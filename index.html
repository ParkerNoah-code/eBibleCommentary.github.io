        <p>
          This site was created to teach the Bible and it's theology from a
          biblical reformed perspective. It is my hope and prayer that this will
          be edifying if the Lord wills!
        </p>

          "The words of the wise are like goads, and masters of these
          collections are like driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd. But
          beyond this, my son, be warned: the writing of many books is endless,
          and excessive study is wearying to the body.
        </p>

          The conclusion, when everything has been heard, is: fear God and keep
          His commandments, because this applies to every person. For God will
          bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is
          good or evil." - Ecclesiastes 12:11-14 (NASB).

          I have used public domain materials extensively which are cited in the
          introduction or commentary sections. Other sources are cited like
          normal. The Bible texts I'm using are in the public domain, and I note
          in the commentary sections if I deviate from them.
