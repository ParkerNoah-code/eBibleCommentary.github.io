        <a href="Biblical/Biblical.html">Biblical</a> - John Calvin was a
        16th-century French theologian and reformer who played a crucial role in
        the Protestant Reformation. His
        <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em> was the first systematic
        theology, and he wrote a commentary on nearly every book of the Bible.

        <a href="Improvement/Improvement.html">Self-Work</a> - The 18th century
        founder of Methodism, John Wesley was known for his disciplined
        lifestyle, deep faith, and commitment to social reform. His emphasis on
        personal holiness, community service, and education helped shape a
        movement focused on continuous spiritual growth and self-improvement.
        That is why I am making him the face of the self-work section.

        <a href="Education/Education.html">Education</a> - A 17th century French
        mathematician, physicist, and religious philosopher, Pascal made
        significant contributions to probability theory, fluid mechanics, and
        the study of pressure. His <em>Pens√©es</em> is a seminal work in
        Christian apologetics, reflecting his deep intellectual and spiritual
        exploration.
