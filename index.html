        <p>
          This site was created to provide resources and commentary for each
          book of the Bible from a believing perspective, and then to synthesize
          what the Bible teaches with theology. It is my hope and prayer that
          this will be edifying, if the Lord wills!
        </p>

          "The words of the wise are like goads, and masters of these
          collections are like driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd. But
          beyond this, my son, be warned: the writing of many books is endless,
          and excessive study is wearying to the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conclusion, when everything has been heard, is: fear God and keep
          His commandments, because this applies to every person. For God will
          bring every act to judgment, everything which is hidden, whether it is
          good or evil." - Ecclesiastes 12:11-14 (NASB)
