        <a href="Biblical/Biblical.html">Biblical</a> - John Calvin was a
        16th-century French theologian and reformer who played a crucial role in
        the Protestant Reformation. Calvin's theological work, especially his
        seminal book <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>, laid the
        foundations of Reformed theology, emphasizing the sovereignty of God,
        predestination, and the authority of Scripture. He also wrote
        significant commentaries on nearly every book of the Bible.
