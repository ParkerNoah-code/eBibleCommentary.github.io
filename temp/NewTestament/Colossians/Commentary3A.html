            THE Gospel is a "mystery," "the riches" of which are unsearchable,
            and "the glory" incomprehensible. But the sum and substance of it is
            contained in few words: it is briefly this, "Christ in us, the hope
            of glory." In the margin of our Bibles it is translated, "Christ
            among us, the hope of glory;" and each of these translations has its
            zealous advocates: but we may easily and properly comprehend both,
            by saying, that Christ is the hope of glory to us,

            The way to the tree of life is guarded by a flaming sword and there
            is no access to it for fallen man, but by Christ, as the appointed

            It is he who has made atonement for our sins, and "reconciled us to
            God by the blood of his cross." Through his vicarious sacrifice
            every sinner in the universe may come to God; seeing that "he is an
            atoning sacrifice, not for our sins only, but also for the sins of
            the world." However great the debt which we owe to Divine justice,
            we may regard it all as paid by our Divine Surety; and may assure
            ourselves, that, if we believe in Christ, "there neither is, nor
            ever shall be, any condemnation to us".

            It is worthy of particular observation, that in the Holy Scriptures
            a greater stress is laid upon the life of Christ in glory, than upon
            his death upon the cross. Peter speaks of him as our hope, in this
            particular view: "God raised him up, and gave him glory, that our
            faith and hope might be in God,
            <a

              rel="noopener"
              >1 Peter 1:21</a
            >." Paul, too, represents the life of Christ as more efficacious for
            our salvation than his death: "Who is he that condemns? it is Christ
            that died, yes, rather, that is risen again; who is even at the
            right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us,
            <a

              rel="noopener"
              >Romans 8:34</a
            >." And still more forcibly, he says in another place, "If when we
            were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much
            more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life,
            <a

              rel="noopener"
              >Romans 5:10</a
            >." In Heaven we view the Lord Jesus as our advocate with the
            Father, maintaining continually our peace with him; when we, by our
            innumerable departures from him, would entirely destroy all our hope
            of final acceptance with him.

          <p align="justify">
            We view Him, also, as:<br />

            the protector of his people from all their enemies, and<br />
            "the finisher" of the work of which he has been "the author."

          <p align="justify">
            It is from this view of him that the weakest of his people is

            exception, holy. And whence comes this? Is it from any power of
            their own? No; it is from the mighty working of his power in us: as
            the Apostle says, "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live:
            yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in
            the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
            himself for me!

            good purpose. It is not Christ on the cross, nor Christ in Heaven,
            no, nor Christ in the heart, that will save us—unless his image is
            there formed in righteousness and true holiness. This is strongly
            declared by the Apostle Paul, in the third chapter of this epistle;
            where he says, "Put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge
            after the image of him who created him; where there is neither Greek
            nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond,
            nor free; but Christ (that is, the image of Christ) is all, and in
            all!

            THE mystery of the Gospel was first made known to <i>Adam </i>in
            Paradise: but in process of time the real scope of it was forgotten;
            and nothing of it remained but the rites whereby it was shadowed
            forth. To <i>Abraham </i>a plainer revelation of it was given; and
            to <i>Moses</i>, a complete system of types, which were to
            illustrate the Gospel in all its parts. Still, however, the views
            which men had of it were obscure: the design of the ceremonial law
            itself was very imperfectly understood; and the idea of men being
            saved through the crucifixion of the incarnate Deity, was almost as
            new to the Jews, in the apostolic age, as to the heathen themselves.
            Hence Paul speaks of it as "hidden from all preceding ages and
            generations," and as then for the first time "manifested to the
            saints."

            That the memory of it might continue to the end of time, and its
            benefits be universally diffused, our blessed Lord appointed an
            order of men, whose sole business would be to spread the knowledge
            of it throughout the world. Among these Paul was a very
            distinguished instrument. He both labored more abundantly, and
            suffered more severely, than any other of the Apostles.

            infantile weakness. And so anxious was the Apostle to bring his

            The preaching of Christ is generally called wild enthusiasm: the
            warning of men respecting their guilt is deemed harshness: the
            laboring to instruct men is ascribed to an officious impertinence,
            or ostentatious vanity, or perhaps designing hypocrisy. A solicitude
            to bring men to a state of spiritual maturity is reckoned, I had
            almost said, among the most unpardonable of crimes; insomuch, that
            the drunkard, the whoremonger, and adulterer, shall meet with more
            favor from the world at large, than a faithful, diligent,
            conscientious minister.

            honor those who resemble him; and to concur with them to the
            uttermost, by a submission to their rebukes, a following of their
            instructions, and an entire devoting of ourselves to the service and
            enjoyment of God.

            through the tender mercy of my God, I have long experienced at your
            hands; and this is what I pray God I may ever see in you, as long as

            Christ. It must be viewed as from all eternity concerted between the
            Father and the Son in the covenant of redemption; wherein the Father
            agreed to accept the mediation of his Son, in behalf of man; and the
            Son agreed to assume our nature, and to bear our sins, and to work
            out a righteousness for us by his own obedience unto death; and so
            to watch over those whom the Father gave him, that they might all,
            without exception, attain to everlasting life,

            "Knowledge," were it as great as that of angels, would be of no

            endure the flames of martyrdom for Christ's sake, be accepted of our

            they are to be distinguished. By love they are to be "knit

            anything else, is the power of religion displayed. "I pray for

            love as Christ himself bears to his saints, such love as is the very

            You have seen "what great conflict" your minister, if faithful, will
            have for you, in relation to these things: and will you feel less
            for yourselves? Go, look at those who are engaged in the race, the
            wrestling, the combat; do you not see how they put forth their
            energies? Have they any disposition to look about them, or any time
            to relax their efforts? Yet is the object of their contest light in
            comparison with yours, and the consequence of a failure unworthy of
            a thought. Come, brethren, and be in earnest. Study the sacred
            volume: study it with much and fervent prayer: entreat of God to
            reveal his dear Son to your hearts: implore the Holy Spirit to
            "guide you into all truth:" and see to it, that you "grow in grace,
            and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." Thus will
            you have in yourselves an evidence of the Gospel, which no human
            learning can give you; and conviction of its excellency, which
            nothing but experience can impart.

          <p align="justify">
            "WISDOM," we are told, "is the principal thing; and therefore we
            should get wisdom." In all civilized countries, wisdom has been held
            in the highest repute: and institutions have been set on foot for
            the cultivation of it. How highly it was esteemed among our
            ancestors, we may judge from the provision which they made for the
            education of youth in all succeeding ages. We can have seen but
            little of the world, if we have not noticed the superiority which a
            cultivated mind possesses over one that is crude and uninstructed.
            And though it must be granted, that human learning will not change
            and sanctify the heart—yet we assert, that it will give a very great
            advantage for the understanding and explaining of the Holy
            Scriptures.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We do not say that God could not, or did not, make use of weak and
            unlettered men for the diffusion of his Gospel: but, as he selected
            Moses, a man "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians," for the
            instruction and government of the Jewish Church, so he selected
            Paul, who had "been brought up at the feet of Gamaliel," to be his
            messenger of grace to the Gentile world: and, if he was pleased so
            to adapt the instrument to the work in that age of miracles, much
            more is such a qualification desirable for his chosen servants, now
            that miracles have ceased. We must not however forget, that the
            Scriptures are the fountain of true wisdom. We should ever bear in
            mind, that the heathen sages, though wiser than their
            contemporaries, were deplorably ignorant in comparison with those
            who live under the Christian dispensation: and even the light which
            some of the most learned among them possessed, was most probably
            obtained, either immediately or remotely, from the inspired volume.
            There, and there alone, is true wisdom to be found; and therein are
            contained "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

            Paul in my text is expressing his ardent desire in behalf of the

            fully instructed in the great mystery of the Gospel of Christ, "in

            expose the Gospel itself to contempt? Indeed, if I were capable of
            doing justice to my subject, such is the impatience of modern
            auditories, that I could not have time to do more than merely open
            to you the casket, and give you a superficial view of its contents:
            but feeling how incompetent I am to unfold all the hidden mysteries
            of the Gospel, I must entreat you to make up for my deficiencies by
            your candor; and to be contented with treasuring up for your benefit

            There are three points to which I will call your attention; and
            which may give you some little idea, that the subject, however
            unworthily handled by me, is at least deserving of the deepest
            investigation. The points I refer to are at all events such as the
            most enlightened heathen had no idea of; namely,
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The real state of man.<br />
            The eternal counsels of God concerning him.<br />
            The stupendous effects produced by those counsels. <br />
            Let these things be for a while considered by us.
          </p>
          <b> </b>
          <p align="justify">
            <b>The <i>real state of man </i></b>was altogether unknown to the
            heathen world. That he was a weak, guilty, and polluted
            creature—they knew; but how weak, how guilty, how polluted—they had
            no conception; much less did they know how he was brought into such
            a state. It is from the inspired volume alone that we learn the
            perfection of his original nature, and the loss of that perfection
            through the fall of his first parents. From thence alone do we learn
            that obvious truth, that we "cannot bring a clean thing out of an
            unclean thing."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Behold then, at the very onset, what a stupendous mystery is here!
            that we died in Adam! That "those who have never sinned after the
            similitude of his transgression," are yet partakers both of his
            guilt and corruption! That we are "born in iniquity, and conceived
            in sin," and are "by nature children of wrath!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            To this I beg your particular attention, because it is the very
            foundation of all spiritual knowledge; it is the very threshold, by
            stumbling at which, multitudes are kept from ever entering into the
            deep recesses of the Gospel.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            You cannot but know, that men in general, and even learned divines,
            endeavor to soften down the Scripture declarations of man's guilt
            and misery: some deny that we are fallen at all; and assert that we
            come into the world as pure as Adam did from his Creator's hands.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Others allow that we are fallen, but deny that we are involved in
            the guilt of our first parents, or that the corruption which we
            inherit from them is anything more than what we have an innate power
            to subdue. They think that the descriptions given of us in the
            inspired volume are not to be taken in a literal sense; and that to
            say that we are "dead in trespasses and sins," is only a metaphor,
            importing that we are not quite so much alive to God and holiness as
            we ought to be.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And now mark how entirely such opinions obstruct the way to true
            wisdom and knowledge: man being in so good a state, there was no
            occasion for the counsels of the Most High to suggest a method of
            deliverance from it: a way of deliverance was obvious enough: there
            was no necessity for God himself to become incarnate, and to expiate
            the sins of men by his own blood; (man might be saved without any
            such sacrifice,) there was no need that the third person in the
            ever-blessed Trinity would undertake to dwell in the hearts of men,
            to enlighten their minds, to draw them unto Christ, to renew their
            nature, and to make them fit for Heaven; (man of himself, by the aid
            of his own reason and resolution, was sufficient for these things,)
            the obligations conferred upon us by this work of redemption are not
            such as to call for all the powers of our souls to be consecrated to
            God in the way of holy obedience; (such a life is needless,
            enthusiastic, and absurd,) in a word, there is no great cause for
            alarm to any of us; for we are all in the way to Heaven; and when we
            get there, shall have no great wonders to celebrate, but only to
            thank God for that which he could not justly or consistently have
            withheld.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Yes, brethren, this it is which obstructs the entrance of light into
            the souls of men: this it is which makes every one suppose that he
            understands the Gospel well enough: this it is that leads men to
            deride all idea of mystery, and to
            <i>reduce the Gospel to a system of heathen ethics</i>.

            to assume our nature, <br />
            to bear our sins, <br />

            Behold then here what treasures of wisdom and knowledge are unfolded
            to us! We see the veil torn away from before our eyes, and the
            Sacred Three sitting, as it were, in council, to provide for man's
            recovery, myriads of ages before his fall! We behold: <br />
            the <u>Father</u> proposing to lay our iniquities on his
            only-begotten Son;<br />
            his <u>Son</u> accepting the office of our Substitute; <br />

            and see whether they also do not unfold the most stupendous

          <i> </i>
          <p align="justify">
            <i>From these counsels results all the work of Christ</i>. He in due
            time left the bosom of his Father, took our nature, was born of a
            virgin, fulfilled the law, offered himself a sacrifice for sin, rose
            from the dead, and ascended up to Heaven to carry on and perfect the
            work which he began on earth. Think of all this as necessary for our
            salvation. Think of it as concerted from eternity, and executed in
            time, and at this very moment accomplishing by means of his
            continual intercession at the right hand of God. Is there nothing
            wonderful in all this?
          </p>
          <i> </i>
          <p align="justify">
            <i>From these counsels also results the salvation of man</i>. Not a
            human being to whom the Gospel comes is ever saved, but by virtue of
            this work which Christ wrought out for him: and by means of this,
            the vilest of the human race are saved. Those who seek a saving
            interest in this Savior are accepted of him, even though they may
            have committed sins of a scarlet or crimson die: but they "who,
            going about to establish their own righteousness, will not submit to
            the righteousness of God," are rejected; and the very Savior who
            would have been a sanctuary to them, becomes a rock of offense, over
            which they fall to their eternal ruin.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Here is a plain way of salvation for all. In vain do men dispute
            about the efficacy of their own good works to save them. Here is a
            door; and those who will enter in by it are saved; and those who
            obstinately stand without, perish. The very builders of the ark
            themselves perished, because they did not enter into it: and so will
            all who do not flee for refuge to this hope that is set before them.
            Is this wisdom, or this knowledge of small value?

            >It is in this way alone that God is, or can be glorified, by any
            man. If man were saved in any other way, every one of the Divine
            perfections would be dishonored. What evidence would there be that
            God is holy, if he allowed his laws to be violated with impunity?
            What would become of all the rights of justice, if no sacrifice were
            offered for sin? How could the truth of God be preserved, if his
            threatenings were not executed, either against the sinner himself,
            or against one who would be substituted in his place?

            Men speak of God's <i>mercy </i>as if that was the only attribute to
            be displayed, and as if it was of no consequence whether his other
            attributes were honored or not. But God will not allow one of his
            attributes to be exalted at the expense of all the rest. Therefore
            has he opened for us a way of salvation whereby all might be
            displayed and all be glorified. Not only is <i>mercy </i>now
            exalted, but <i>justice </i>too; and that, not only in the
            condemnation, but in the salvation also of sinful man: nor is it a
            whit less glorified in the salvation of a penitent believer, than it
            is in the condemnation of the impenitent, and unbelieving.

            Is here then no mystery? are here no treasures of wisdom and

            "desiring daily to look into them," in order that their admiration
            of God may be augmented, and their felicity increased.

            As much as we revere human knowledge, we must declare, that, in
            comparison with that which we have been considering, the wisdom of
            philosophers is of no account: for this divine knowledge is at once
            the most sublime, the most certain, the most attainable, the most
            useful!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            What is there so <u>sublime</u> as this divine knowledge? We grant
            that many human sciences, and astronomy in particular, are very
            sublime; and appear to be out of the reach of mortal man: but it is
            well known that philosophy, in many of its branches, was carried to
            as high, if not a much higher pitch among the unenlightened heathen,
            than among ourselves. But who among the heathen could ever find out
            God? Who could ever dive into his counsels? Who could account for
            the actual state of things as they existed in the world? Who could
            tell how a sinful man might be accepted by his God? Truly, "the
            world by wisdom knew not God:" this knowledge was "too wonderful and
            excellent" for unassisted reason to explore: nor can we, even with
            the Bible in our hands, attain it, unless God by his Spirit open the
            eyes of our understanding, and shine into our hearts to give it to
            us.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We are expressly told, that "eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor
            has it entered into the heart of man to conceive—the things which
            God has prepared for us;" and the things there spoken of are those
            which are revealed to us in the Gospel. It is not of Heaven that the
            Apostle speaks, but of the Gospel, and the mysteries contained in
            it. These are the things which are called in Scripture "the
            wonderful works of God,
            <a
              class="rtBibleRef"

              rel="noopener"
              >Acts 2:11</a
            >." And they are "the things of the Spirit, which the natural man
            cannot receive, nor even know, because they are spiritually
            discerned." Well therefore may we covet that knowledge which was
            "hid in God from the foundation of the world," which the wisest
            philosophers could never attain, which even the learned among
            ourselves cannot possess, unless God himself becomes their teacher,
            and "opens their understandings to understand it."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In point of <u>certainty</u>, there is nothing that can be compared
            with divine knowledge. There are indeed in it many things which we
            cannot comprehend: but there is much known, and known on the
            authority of God himself. Most other knowledge is involved in doubt
            and obscurity; insomuch that hypotheses which have been established
            for ages, have yet been overthrown by the penetration of a
            Copernicus or a Newton. But the truth of God is unchangeable; and
            whether viewed in the promise to Adam, or in subsequent prophecies,
            or in the types and shadows of the law, or in the fuller revelation
            of the Gospel, is ever the same. Nor can all the subtlety of men or
            devils invalidate so much as one single point. Indeed, though
            received on the credit of the inspired writers, it so commends
            itself to the believer, as to approve to him its divine origin, as
            soon as ever it is received into his heart: he there finds a
            counterpart of every truth he has received, and "has the witness in
            himself" that it is indeed from God.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now one great discouragement in the pursuit of human knowledge is,
            that after having labored for many years, we know not but that we
            may, after all, be found wrong, in things which we deemed of
            considerable consequence. But here, we never need to fear a
            disappointment: God's Word, like himself, abides for ever; nor shall
            one jot or tittle of it ever fail!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor is there any other so <u>attainable</u> as divine knowledge.
            Thousands have not ability to investigate the depths of human
            science: if they would bestow ever so much labor, for ever so long a
            time, it would be in vain.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But not so the knowledge of the Gospel: for though it is so deep,
            that no man by the efforts of unassisted reason can enter into
            it—yet it is so easy of acquisition, that "he who runs may read and
            understand it." If God "opens our eyes, we shall see wondrous things
            out of his law!" If he shines into our hearts, the light of the
            knowledge of the glory of God shall be seen by us. The qualification
            for this knowledge consists, not so much in the head, as in the
            heart: "God opened the heart of Lydia to attend to the things that
            were spoken by Paul." Here then every one is encouraged to pursue
            it: for "none teaches like God," he can "ordain strength in the
            mouth of babes and sucklings."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            I grant indeed that it is a "hidden knowledge;" it is "a treasure
            hidden in a field." But it is revealed to us in the Word, and shall
            be revealed in us by the Spirit, if we desire to be taught of him.
            The promise is, "All your children shall be taught of God," and, if
            only we obtain his teaching, we shall "be guided into all truth,"
            nor shall "a way-faring man, though a fool, be left to err therein."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Lastly, What can be compared with divine knowledge in point of
            <u>usefulness</u>? We deny not but that knowledge of various kinds
            is replete with benefit to man: but that benefit is bounded by this
            world, and the present state of things. Not so the knowledge of
            which we are speaking—that extends to the eternal world. In the
            knowledge of God and of Christ, are all our hopes centered. By this
            we are <i>justified</i>: as it is said, "By his knowledge shall my
            righteous servant justify many." By it also we are
            <i>sanctified</i>: as it is said, "Sanctify them through your
            truth—your word is truth." By it also we shall be exalted to
            <i>glory</i>; for it is said, "This is life eternal, that they might
            know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            What knowledge is there that can be compared with this? Will earthly
            knowledge save you? If you could travel the whole round of science,
            and grasp in your mind all that ever was comprehended by human
            intellect:<br />
            would it pacify a guilty conscience? <br />
            would it take away the sting of death? <br />
            would it enable you to look forward with comfort to the eternal
            world? <br />
            would it prepare you to stand at the judgment-seat of Christ, and to
            give your account with joy?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            No! nothing can do this but the knowledge of God as reconciled to us
            in the Son of his love. This is the sole property of the Gospel,
            even of that Gospel which is so neglected and despised. If then you
            would view these things aright, you must study the Gospel, and
            "count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
            Christ Jesus your Lord."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Must we then lay aside our earthly knowledge? you will ask. No; but
            you must get it sanctified by the Spirit of God. The spoils of the
            Midianites were consecrated to the Lord; but before they were
            allowed to be brought into his tabernacle, "everything that would
            abide the fire, must pass through the fire; and whatever would not
            abide the fire, must be made to go through the water," for then only
            could they be an acceptable offering to him, when they were cleansed
            and purified from their corruption,

          <p align="justify">
            Thus also must your learning be sanctified; it must not be set in
            competition with the Word of God, but be made subservient to it.
            Beware then lest it blind your eyes, and fill you with a conceit
            that you do not need to be taught of God. What the Apostle says is
            alike applicable to the philosopher and the peasant, "If any man
            will be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be
            wise." We must have the teachableness of "little children, if we
            would enter into the kingdom of Heaven;" and if we will not humble
            ourselves in that manner, God has told us that "he will take the
            wise in their own craftiness." In subserviency to the Gospel, your
            learning will be an invaluable blessing. But in opposition to it, it
            will prove a curse; for God will "confound the wisdom of the wise,
            and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Are we then desirous of attaining these heavenly treasures? Let us
            seek after them in the Holy Scriptures: and while we seek for
            knowledge as silver, and "search for it as for hidden treasures, let
            us cry to God for it, and lift up our voice to him; since it is the
            Lord alone that gives wisdom, and out of his mouth comes knowledge

              >Ephesians 1:16-20</a

            attain the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
            understanding." Then we may hope also to "shine as lights in a dark
            world," and "be as cities set upon a hill." Or, if our sphere is
            circumscribed within narrower limits, we shall at least have this
            benefit, that we are "made wise unto salvation through faith that is
            in Christ Jesus!"
