            We who have died with Christ must not be always regulating ourselves
            by the dont’s of the Law. Let us enter Christ’s more intimate
            fellowship and live on the positive side. Ours should be the freedom
            of a full life, and the ampler vision of the mountains. Nothing else
            really avails against the indulgence of the flesh.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 20.
            <em
              >If you died with Christ from the elemental spirits of the world,
              why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to
              ordinances,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>If you died with Christ</em>. To be clear, there's no doubt
            about your union with Christ leading to death alongside him. Your
            connection with him means you've shared in his crucifixion, burial,
            and resurrection. You've gained the benefits of redemption, pardon,
            justification, and reconciliation through his death. You've been
            planted together with him, experiencing a likeness to his death.
            This doesn't mean mere shared suffering; just as he died to sin and
            lived for God, you've done the same. The power of his death has made
            you dead to sin, preventing it from condemning and destroying you.
            In fact, it's like sin itself was crucified and destroyed by him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, as for the law – I'm talking about the moral law here – you do
            live in accordance with it, guided by Christ. But you don't seek
            life, righteousness, or salvation through it. You're dead to its
            justificatory role, and even to strict, compulsory obedience. You've
            moved beyond fearing its threats, curses, and condemnation to
            understanding it through the lens of your love for Christ. You're
            also dead to the ceremonial law, as it was always meant to lead you
            to Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From the elemental spirits of the world</em>. The ordinances of
            a worldly sanctuary, the rites and ceremonies of the world, or state
            of the Jews, in opposition to, and distinction from, the Gospel
            dispensation, or times of the Messiah, called, and that by them,
            "the world to come": these were like letters to a language, or like
            the grammar, which contains the rudiments of it; these were the
            first principles of the oracles of God, which led to Christ, and had
            their accomplishment and end in him; and so believers were dead unto
            them, and delivered from them, as they were also to the world, the
            Jewish state, and were entered into the world to come; and even to
            this present evil world, and to the men and things of it, being by
            Christ crucified to it, and that to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Why, as though living in the world</em>. Since ye are dead unto
            it, and from the rudiments of it, why should ye be as though ye
            lived in it? his meaning is not, that they should not live in the
            world, nor among the men of it, for then they must needs go out of
            the world; saints may live in the world, though they are not of it,
            and among the inhabitants of it, though they do not belong to them,
            but to another and better country: nor does he suggest, that they
            lived according to the course of the world, as they did in their
            unregenerate state; but what he seems to blame them for, and reason
            with them about, was, that they acted as if they sought for life and
            righteousness in the rudiments of the world, or by their obedience
            to ceremonial rites, or human inventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Do you subject yourselves to ordinances</em>? Not civil and
            political ones, which are for the better and more orderly government
            of kingdoms, states, and cities, for these the saints ought to be
            subject to, both for the Lord's sake, and conscience sake; nor
            Gospel ordinances, as baptism, and the Lord's supper, for such all
            believers ought to submit unto; but either legal ones, the weak and
            beggarly elements, the yoke of bondage, the law of commandments
            contained in ordinances, the handwriting of ordinances, which some
            were desirous of conforming to; or rather the ordinances and
            appointments of the Jewish fathers, the traditions of the elders,
            their constitutions and decrees, which are collected together, and
            make up their Misna, or oral law; and so the argument is from the
            one to the other, from the greater to the less, that if they were
            delivered by Christ from the burdensome rites of the ceremonial law,
            which were originally appointed by God, it must be great weakness in
            them to be subject to the ordinances of men; or both the
            institutions of the ceremonial law, and the decrees of the Jewish
            doctors about them, which were devised by them, and added to them,
            and imposed as necessary to be observed, may be intended; of which
            the apostle gives some particulars in Colossians 2:21.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 21-22.
            <em
              >“Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch” (all of which perish with
              use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch</em>. This the apostle says,
            not of himself, but in the person of the Jewish doctors; who urging
            the use of the ceremonial law, to which they added decrees and
            constitutions of their own, said, "touch not" the dead body of any
            man, the bone of a man, or a grave, any man or woman in their
            uncleanness; not only their flesh, but the bed they lay on, or the
            seat they sat on; or any creature that was by the law unclean; of a
            Gentile, or any notorious sinner, or common man: hence the Pharisees
            used to wash themselves when they returned from market, lest they
            should have been by any means accidentally defiled by touching any
            thing unclean.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a treatise in their Misna, called Oholot, which gives many
            rules, and is full of decrees about things "that defile by
            touching." And so they likewise said, "taste not," neither the fat,
            nor the blood of any creature which might be eaten itself, nor
            swine's flesh, nor the flesh of any creature that chewed the cud, or
            divided the hoof; nor might the Nazarites taste wine, or strong
            drink, or vinegar made of either, or moist grapes, or even the
            kernels and husks; and if a man ate but the quantity of an olive of
            any of the above things, he was, according to the Jewish canons, to
            be cut off, or beaten: and they also said, "handle not"; or, as the
            Syriac and Arabic read, "do not come near", or "draw not nigh", to a
            Gentile, to one of another nation, or any unclean person, to whom
            they forbid any near approach or conversation; or "handle not" any
            of the above things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some think that these several rules have respect only to meats; as
            "touch not," that is, do not eat of things forbidden ever so little;
            nay, "taste not," do not let anything of them come within your lips;
            yea, "handle not," do not so much as touch them with your fingers.
            Others think that touch not regards abstinence from women (1 Cor
            7:1); and respects the prohibition of marriage by some in those
            times; and "taste not," the forbearance of certain meats, at certain
            times, which God had not restrained any from; and "handle not," that
            is, make no use of, or enjoy your own goods, and so designs that
            voluntary poverty which some entered into under the direction of
            false teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>All of which perish with use</em>. Meaning either the ordinances
            concerning touching, tasting, and handling, which bring destruction
            and death on them that use them, and comply with them, in order to
            obtain righteousness and life; for instead of enjoying salvation
            through them, they were the cause of damnation to them. Or rather
            the meats not to be touched, tasted, or handled; these are in their
            own nature perishing things, and perish by being used; they are only
            of service to the body, and can be of none to the soul; the using of
            them cannot defile the man, nor an abstinence from them sanctify
            him, or commend him to God; they only relate to this present life,
            and will cease with it, and can have no manner of influence on the
            spiritual and eternal concerns of men: and besides, the ordinances
            concerning them are not of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>According to the precepts and doctrines of men</em>. For so even
            the ceremonial law, being now abolished, though originally of God,
            yet the imposition of it, as necessary to salvation, was a
            commandment and doctrine of man's; and particularly the traditions
            of the elders, and the various rules and decrees, which the doctors
            among the Jews obliged men to regard, were human inventions and
            devices: and this is another reason the apostle makes use of to
            dissuade from any regard unto them; for whatever is of man, and not
            of God, in religious worship, ought to be rejected.
          </p>

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>These things indeed appear like wisdom</em>. The authors of them
            set up for men of wisdom, and were esteemed such, and are often
            styled "wise men"; and their scholars that received their
            traditions, and explained and enforced them on others, "the
            disciples of the wise men": and they pretended, that these
            constitutions of theirs were "a hedge for the law", and for the
            honour of it, and to preserve it, and keep men from transgressing
            it; and this carried in it some appearance of wisdom: and their
            pretensions to it lay in self-imposed worship, humility, and
            severity to the body.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In self-imposed worship</em>. Being what was over and above that
            which was commanded by God, and so, like the freewill offerings
            under the law, must be acceptable to him; this was one of their
            colours, which had some show of wisdom, religion, and zeal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Humility</em>. In worshipping of angels, and not coming
            directly, and with boldness, to God or Christ; or rather in
            subjecting themselves to the yoke of the law, and submitting to the
            decrees of the fathers and doctors of the church, who were more
            wise, and learned, and knowing than they, and so had the appearance
            of prudence, gentleness, and goodness
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And severity to the body</em>. By fastings and watchings,
            whereby they seemed to be very religious and devout, holy and
            mortified persons, who kept under their bodies, subdued their unruly
            appetites, and fulfilled not the lusts of the flesh: but then this
            was only a show of wisdom and godliness; there was no truth nor
            reality in these things; they were only a mere form, an outside
            show, a mere pretence; there was no true devotion nor religion in
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But aren’t of any value</em>. Or to be had in any esteem; for if
            the rites of the ceremonial law itself were weak and beggarly
            elements, much more must these additions to it, and corruptions of
            it, be such; and at most only regarded things external.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Against the indulgence of the flesh</em>. Either the body, or
            the carnal mind, in which they were vainly pulled up: though some
            consider this last clause as explanative of the former, "neglecting
            of the body", or not sparing it, but afflicting it with austerities
            of life; depriving it of its proper right, what is necessary for it,
            not taking due care of it, so as to satisfy nature; whereby instead
            of honouring, they dishonoured it: for though the body is not to be
            pampered, and the lusts of it indulged, or luxury and intemperance
            to be encouraged; yet since the body is the work of God's hands, is
            the habitation of the soul, and by which it performs its offices,
            and is the purchase of Christ, the temple of the Holy Spirit, and
            will be raised a glorious body at the last day, it ought not to be
            neglected and dishonoured; but should have a sufficiency of food and
            clothing, whereby it may be comfortably and honourably nourished and
            supported.

        <div id="Exegetical" class="commentary" style="display: none">
          <p>
            The polemical part of the Epistle is now coming to an end. The
            antagonist errors appear for the last time in the words which we
            have now to consider. In these the Apostle seems to gather up all
            his strength to strike two straight, crashing, final blows, which
            pulverise and annihilate the theoretical positions and practical
            precepts of the heretical teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, he puts in the form of an unanswerable demand for the reason
            for their teachings, their radical inconsistency with the
            Christian’s death with Christ, which is the very secret of his life.
            Then, by a contemptuous concession of their apparent value to people
            who will not look an inch below the surface, he makes more emphatic
            their final condemnation as worthless-less than nothing and
            vanity-for the suppression of "the flesh"- the only aim of all moral
            and religious discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we have here two great tests by their conformity to which we may
            try all teachings which assume to regulate life, and all Christian
            teaching about the place and necessity for ritual and outward
            prescriptions of conduct. "Ye are dead with Christ." All must fit in
            with that great fact. The restraint and conquest of "the flesh." The
            purpose of all religion and of all moral teaching-our systems must
            do that or they are naught, however fascinating they may be.

          <p>
            <em>If you died with Christ</em>. This death has many aspects in St.
            Paul’s teaching. It is not only a dying with Christ (2 Tim 2:11),
            but it is also a dying to or from something. This is sometimes
            represented as sin (Rom 6:2); sometimes as self (Gal 2:20);
            sometimes as the Law (Rom 7:6; Gal 2:19); sometimes still more
            widely as the world," as here and in Col 3:3. Our Lord, by his
            teaching and example, set his disciples free from the traditions of
            men (Mat 12:1-13; 15:1-9) and from some of the ceremonial laws of
            Moses (Mk 7:14-19, "This he said making all meats clean;" cf. Acts
            10:15). By his death as the Sacrifice he fulfilled all that was
            typical in the ceremonial Law, so that by union with him "we have
            been discharged from the Law" (Rom 7:6). By his power as the risen
            Saviour, the supreme Head and Lawgiver of his Church, he replaces
            the precepts of Moses by his "I say unto you." He thus introduces
            all believers into a new sphere of life and liberty (Heb 12:18-25).

            Μὴ ἅψῃ μηδὲ γεύσῃ μηδὲ θίγῃς—“Touch not, taste not, handle not.”
            These curt dogmas are not the apostle&#x27;s own teaching, but the
            mottoes, or prominent lessons, or watchwords of the false teachers.
            In all probability, the three terms refer to the same general
            object-abstinence from certain meats and drinks. It is therefore
            excessive refinement to distribute them according to certain
            distinctions, either with Flatt, Böhmer, Hammond, and Homberg,
            referring the first verb-or, with Grotius, the last verb-to
            marriage; or, with Estius, Zanchius, and Erasmus, giving the first
            verb an allusion to Levitical uncleanness, special or general.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two critics last named refer the last term to Levitical sacred
            things, but Michaelis and Storr refer it to impurities. Böhmer, with
            a strange caprice, finds a reference in θίγῃς to the holy oil which
            the Essenes specially regarded as labes. But though the words refer
            generally to diet, and are so used by the classics, there may be a
            distinction among them, as they seem to be repeated, along with the
            negative, for the sake of emphasis. The first and last verbs are
            somewhat similar, and both represent in the Septuagint the
            Hebrew-ðÈâÇò, H5595. But the first term may here denote that
            handling which is necessary to eating-the touch which precedes
            taste; while the last, a sister-term, with tango and touch, may
            signify the slightest contact. In Heb 12:20, the contrast seems to
            be this-a beast was not only not to graze on Sinai, but not even for
            a moment to set a hoof upon it. Thus in Eurip. Bacchae, 617, where a
            similar contrast obtains—“he did not come in contact, far less
            handle me-there was neither touch nor grasp.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The last verb is the most dogmatic-you are not to take certain meats
            into your hand, nor are you to taste them; nay, you are not even to
            touch them, though in the slightest degree-you are to keep from them
            hand, tongue, and even finger-tip. The apostle does not specify the
            objects to be abstained from, for they were so well known to his
            readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The connection and meaning of the next clause are matter of various
            opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            ῞Α ἐστιν πάντα εἰς φθορὰν τῇ ἀποχρήσει. The idea of Macknight is
            altogether unsupported. He supposes the reference of the apostle to
            be to Pythagorean abstinence from animal food, and he connects this
            and the previous verse in the following way. Touch not, taste not,
            handle not whatever things tend to the destruction of life in the
            using. He takes the maxim of the false teachers condemned by the
            apostle to be this-abstain from everything the eating of which
            involves the taking away of life. The idea itself is foreign to the
            argument, nor can it be supported by the apostle&#x27;s diction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question turns upon the meaning assigned to φθορά, and the
            supposed antecedent to the relative.
          </p>
          <p>
            I. A large party take φθορά in a spiritual sense, and suppose the
            relative to refer to the precepts contained in the preceding verse,
            as if the warning were-all which maxims tend by their observance to
            spiritual ruin-lead to the eternal destruction of such as are
            influenced by them. Some of those who hold this view, give ἀπόχρησις
            the sense of abuse, as if the apostle wished to say-the law did make
            distinctions of meats and drinks, but the unwarranted abuse of such
            a distinction is a fatal course. Others, again, connect the last
            clause of the verse with the first-all which precepts tend to your
            own ruin, by your observance of them, for they are an observance
            based upon the doctrines and commandments of men. Such, generally,
            are the views of Ambrosiaster and Augustine, a-Lapide, Heumann,
            Suicer, and Junker.
          </p>
          <p>
            II. Others suppose the antecedent to be not the maxims, but the
            things forbidden in them, and among such critics there are two
            classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Some suppose the apostle to be still further showing the opinion
            of the false teachers. According to them, the meaning is, either,
            all which meats and drinks lead to ruin in the use of them,
            according to the commandments and teachings of those men; or, all
            these meats and drinks to be abstained from, tend to destruction by
            the use of them, if you are to be judged by their opinions and
            doctrines. The verse, then, would contain this idea-the false
            teachers forbade the touching and tasting of certain things,
            because, in their opinion, the use of them brought certain
            pernicious results. This opinion is concurred in by Kypke, Storr, De
            Wette, Böhmer, and Baumgarten-Crusius. There is nothing in the words
            themselves to contradict it; it may be grammatically defended, and
            the noun φθορά may bear the meaning of spiritual hurt, as in Gal
            6:8. But it does not appear to us to be in so complete harmony with
            the context as is the following exegesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The opinion which we prefer is that which gives the same
            antecedent to the relative, but understands the clause to be an
            exposure of the absurdity of such asceticism—“all which things are
            meant for destruction through the use of them.” The meats and drinks
            about which the errorist exclaimed—“touch not, taste not, handle
            not,” are meant to be consumed by use. They perish or cease to
            exist, because they are eaten and drunk for the support of life.
            They are intended for this destiny-ἐστίν εἰς-exist for it; God
            created them to be consumed, and they meet this destiny by being
            used to the full-ἀπο-used to the complete satisfaction of appetite.
            The verb ἐστίν is more than a copula. It means-exists-which things
            exist. The noun φθορά is often used in a physical sense-in the
            Seventy, Exo_18:18; Isa_24:3; Jon_2:7; and in the New Testament, 1
            Cor 15:42; 1 Cor 15:50; 2Pe_2:12; Josephus, Antiq. 7.13, 3. The term
            ἀπόχρησις is not abuse in the English sense of the word-but, “full
            use.” The Latin abutor has this meaning also-to use up; as often in
            Cicero, and also in Terence and Suetonius. It is this using up or
            consuming of a thing by use contained in the ἀπο and ab, that gave
            the term in Latin, Greek, and English, the secondary signification
            of misuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            The apostle thus states two objections to the Colossian asceticism.
            First. It contradicts the design of Providence, which created such
            meats and drinks for man&#x27;s use and satisfaction. The apostle,
            as we have said, uses ἀπόχρησις, which does not signify abuse, but
            full use. The maxims of the false teachers are—“touch not, taste
            not, handle not;” but the things from which he sternly enjoins this
            abstinence are, in their own nature, utterly harmless, and not only
            is the use of them unaccompanied with spiritual damage, but that use
            is enjoined by Him whose providence has so liberally furnished them
            for the stay and support of life. The meats and drinks so frowned
            upon have been created for the very purpose of being consumed, and
            having served their purpose in this consumption they perish. A
            religion of asceticism is therefore a libel upon Providence-a surly
            and superstitious refusal of the Divine benignity. It believes that
            the eating and drinking of some gifts of Divine goodness is fraught
            with unspeakable danger, and therefore it makes its selections among
            them in its “show of wisdom.” Strange conviction, that what is
            physically nutritious may be spiritually poisonous; and that what
            gives strength to the body may send “leanness to the soul”! No
            wonder that such a self-righteous and ungrateful practice led by a
            swift path to a dark and Manichaean theology.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, secondly, things which are meant to perish in being used up,
            can have little connection with genuine piety; it does not, and
            cannot depend on abstinence from them. Our Lord Himself said—“not
            that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;” and the apostle
            declares—“every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused;”
            and he speaks of meats “which God hath created to be received with
            thanksgiving.” 1 Cor 6:13. It degrades Christianity to make it a
            system of physical or ascetic distinctions. Spirituality is not
            based on such external and ceremonial forms. The error, as Olshausen
            says, “was in looking for holiness in the outward rather than the
            inward.” Such an error has been, alas! too common in the church, and
            is the result of superstitious indolence and vanity. Men seek to be
            acted on from without, and to be sanctified as if by the secret and
            unconscious charm of an amulet; misunderstanding, forgetting, or
            shunning the mighty work or change which should be going on within.
            That change is from the centre to the outer life, not from the outer
            life to the seat of motive and thought. What the lips receive or
            refuse from “cup and platter,” has neither propitiatory merit nor
            demerit, nor can it exercise a hidden power over heart and mind. The
            palate may be ungratified and yet the conscience be defiled; the
            anchorite, while he starves himself, may roll many a vice, as a
            sweet morsel, under his tongue; for self-denial in corporeal
            appetite usually takes ample revenge or compensation in spiritual
            indulgence and pride. And thus it has been often found, that men
            attach a higher sanctity to abstinence from certain kinds of food
            and physical refreshment, than to abstinence from sin; and would
            rather violate a Divine statute, than break a self-inflicted fast.
          </p>
          <p>What mean they? Canst thou dream there is a power</p>
          <p>In lighter diet at a later hour</p>
          <p>To charm to sleep the threatenings of the skies,</p>
          <p>And hide past folly from all-seeing eyes?</p>
          <p>
            Several things concur in justifying the view we have taken, which is
            that of the Greek Fathers, of Luther, Calvin, and Beza, of Grotius,
            Meyer, Steiger, and Bähr. The apostle is speaking of physical
            things, as eating and drinking, and it is natural to understand
            φθορά and ἀπόχρησις in their physical sense, and in connection with
            those elements of forbidden sustenance. Again, the writer places no
            substantive after the three verbs, and the ellipse imparts a certain
            emphasis. The objects to be abstained from were yet present to his
            mind, and it was natural for him to allude to them, and to show that
            they were designed for use, nay, were of so little permanence and
            value that they perished in this use. The mimetic clause—“touch
            not,” etc., is inserted, or rather rapidly interjected, as the
            apostle passes on. It will therefore be best read in a parenthesis.
            The swiftness of the apostle&#x27;s thoughts interferes so far with
            the order of them. He first shows the inconsistency of yielding to
            ordinances after they had become dead to them; and he meant to point
            out the source of such ordinances, but the mention of them suggests
            the pointed quotation of some of them, and then he cannot refrain,
            in a brief underthought, from exposing their absurdity, ere he
            formally carries out his purpose of showing their origin and
            inutility. Lastly, the Greek Fathers understand the phrase in this
            way. They do not mince the matter, but give φθορά its coarsest
            meaning. Chrysostom, followed by Theodoret, says-εἰς κόπρον γὰρ
            ἅπαντα μεταβάλλεται. OEcumenius uses this language-ὑπόκειται ἐν τῷ
            ἀφεδρῶνι; while Theophylact is yet more explicit-φθειρόμενα γὰρ ἐν
            τῇ γαστρὶ διὰ τοῦ ἀφεδρῶνος ὑποῤῥεῖ.

            ῞Ατινά ἐστιν λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας—“Which things indeed having a
            show of wisdom.” The antecedent to ἅτινα is the preceding
            clause—“doctrines and commandments of men.” Kühner, § 431, 2. The
            peculiar form ἅτινα represents this idea-all which things, that is,
            the entire class of them. Kühner, § 781, 4, 5. We do not connect
            ἐστίν with the participle ἔχοντα, as some do; but specially with the
            concluding clause of the verse. Λόγος signifies sometimes report or
            rumour-then mere rumour-then mere talk or pretext-words and only
            words-λόγον οὐ πράγματα. It is thus opposed to ἀλήθεια. Diodorus
            Siculus, 13, 4; Polybius, 17 (18), 14, 5. The word thus means a
            certain kind of semblance, which in Scotch is called a sough-sound
            without reality. These precepts and commandments had the air,
            aspect, nomenclature, and pretensions of wisdom. The particle μέν
            might imply the contrast, the apodosis not being formally expressed.
            Kühner, § 734, 2; Winer, § 63, I.2, e. This last critic says-the
            parallel member of the sentence is included in the one with μέν.
            Thus, Heb 6:16,-men, indeed-μέν-swear by the greater, and the
            implied contrast is, but God can only swear by Himself. These
            teachings have a show of wisdom, μέν-but none in reality. Or, Rom
            3:2, “What advantage, then, hath the Jew?-much every way”-πρῶτον
            μέν—“chiefly indeed,” but not wholly, “because that unto them were
            committed the oracles of God.” Thus Acts 19:4. ᾿Ιωάννης μὲν
            ἐβάπτισεν—“John indeed baptized” the baptism of repentance; the
            implied contrast being-but not so Jesus. So, in the clause before
            us, the same construction has been found by some,&amp;- -;there is
            the semblance, indeed, of wisdom, but not the reality. We are
            inclined, however, to regard the apodosis as existing in οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ
            τινι; but δέ is not expressed, because the construction is changed
            into the dative, following up the case of the preceding nouns, and
            because the word οὐκ, to which δέ would be attached, has in it a
            palpable adversative power. It was worse than hypercriticism on the
            part of Jerome to say, that the particle was omitted-propter
            imperitiam artis grammaticae. The apostle particularizes and adds,
            this verbiage of wisdom consists “in will-worship”-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ. This is worship not enjoyed by God, but springing
            out of man&#x27;s own ingenuity-unauthorized devotion, θρησκεία
            being religious service-the outer manifestation of inner feeling.
            Thus, ἐθελόδουλος is one who is wilfully a slave; ἐθελοκίνδυνος is
            one who is wilfully in danger. The worship referred to is
            unsolicited and unaccepted. It is superstition, and probably is the
            homage paid to angels. Such worship had the feint of wisdom, as it
            professed to base itself on invisible arcana; and to ask and receive
            blessings and protection from creatures, whose agency comes not
            within the range of observation, but who were supposed to be the
            patrons and defenders of those who could name them in erring and
            extravagant devotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ—“And humility.” This has been already explained
            under the 18th verse. The humility referred to is plainly of that
            spurious kind, that, in its excess and affectation, could not look
            up to God, but deemed it wondrous wisdom to invoke angels on its
            behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος. The term ἀφειδία is unsparingness, and here
            unsparingness in the form of severity, or that austere asceticism
            which the apostle has already reprimanded. In this sense it often
            occurs among the classical writers. The body is not only kept under,
            that is, kept in its proper and subordinate position, but it is
            hated, lacerated, and tormented into debility. The appetites are
            looked upon as sinful, and are checked-not supplied in healthful
            moderation. Every species of support is grudged—“to back and belly
            too.” The physical constitution is thus enervated and sickened. Yet
            its sinful tendencies are only beaten down, not eradicated. Job made
            a covenant with his eyes, but those fanatics would dim theirs by
            fasting. The whole process was a cardinal mistake, for it was a
            system of externals, both in ceremonial and ethics. The body might
            be reduced, but the evil bias might remain unchecked. A man might
            whip and fast himself into a walking skeleton, and yet the spirit
            within him might have all its lusts unconquered, for all it had lost
            was only the ability to gratify them. To place a fetter on a
            robber&#x27;s hand will not cure him of covetousness, though it may
            disqualify him from actual theft. To seal up a swearer&#x27;s mouth
            will not pluck profanity out of his heart, though it may for the
            time prevent him from taking God&#x27;s name in vain. To lacerate
            the flesh almost to suicide, merely incapacitates it for indulgence,
            but does not extirpate sinful desire. Its air of superior sanctity
            is only pride in disguise-it has but “a show of wisdom,” and is not-
          </p>
          <p>
            Οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινὶ, πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός. There is difficulty in
            arriving at a correct interpretation of these clauses, and one
            reason is, that we have first to solve whether they should be joined
            or disconnected. It is quite plain that the apostle intends a
            contrast, and the preposition ἐν is repeated.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Very many interpreters supply σώματος to τιμῇ. The Greek
            interpreters held this view, followed by Pelagius, Calvin, Luther,
            and other reformers; by Estius, and a-Lapide in the Popish Church;
            by Daillé, Davenant, and Macknight; and in later times by the lately
            deceased critics, De Wette and Baumgarten-Crusius. The meaning,
            then, is—“which things have a show of wisdom in will-worship,
            humility, and neglecting of the body, not in any honour shown to the
            body in reference to such things as satisfy corporeal appetite.”
            This is a favourite interpretation, but we cannot receive it. For,
            as Meyer remarks, it gives σάρξ the meaning of σῶμα, which had just
            been previously used-a meaning which it cannot bear. Then, too, this
            exegesis supplies σώματος without any reason, and it restricts the
            contrast introduced by οὐκ to only one member of the sentence. That
            contrast seems to refer to all the manifestations of this specious
            wisdom, and not simply to one of them. Besides, this interpretation
            gives a very feeble ending to the verse; austerity towards the body,
            is weakly characterized as not giving honour to the body in things
            which satisfy its physical appetites, as if the Colossians needed
            such a definition. And lastly, this πλησμονή is something more than
            the gratification of corporeal desire, for in the Pauline
            vocabulary, σῶμα is only a portion of σάρξ.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Another view, which holds the same connection, is that which
            gives τιμή the sense of value, and brings out this exegesis-which
            are not of any value, inasmuch as they are concerned with things
            which serve only to the gratification of the flesh. These are
            useless prohibitions, and have but a show of wisdom, for they are
            concerned with matters which minister only to appetite-quum ad ea
            spectent quibus farcitur caro. The participle ὄντα is thus supposed
            to stand before πρός. This is the idea of Beza and Crocius, and that
            of Heinrichs is only a worse modification of it. It restricts the
            meaning of σάρξ, and needs considerable eking out in its
            construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Others take the word σάρξ in its full sense, and suppose the
            apostle to mean that all prohibitions which bear especially against
            the body are of little worth, for they minister all the while to the
            pride of corrupted humanity. The last clause is thus nearly
            equivalent to an earlier one—“vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.”
            With some varieties, this is the exegesis of Hilary, Bengel, Storr,
            Flatt, Böhmer, Steiger, Bähr, and Huther. Meyer, in taking the same
            view, places σαρκός in contrast with σώματος, and πλησμονή with
            ἀφειδία. He also lays the principal stress of the contrast on the
            words οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινὶ, as if they stood in antagonism to the λόγον
            σοφίας. That wisdom is all a pretence-it has no honour in reality or
            basis. Still, with this otherwise good interpretation, the
            connection of the last clause appears to be hard, for πρός must
            signify um dadurch, or “all of them tend to.” A modification of this
            view is adopted by Conybeare, who gives the clause a pregnant
            sense—“not of any value to check the indulgence of the flesh.” His
            reviewer in the North British Review applauds the exegesis. We do
            not accept the sense of fleshly passion for σάρξ, and we cannot
            believe πρός to be so utterly indifferent in its meaning. In the
            proposed exegesis, πρός must signify “against.” It sometimes is so
            translated, still the idea of hostility is found, not in the
            particle, but in its adjuncts, as μάχεσθαι, βάλλειν, or as in the
            New Testament, Acts 6:1, where the idea of antagonism is found in
            γογγυσμός, Acts 24:19, where the clause is preceded by κατηγορεῖν,
            and in Eph 6:11, where there is the idea of combat. In all such
            cases the idea of hostility is implied in the clause, and the
            preposition only expresses the reference-but there is no such idea
            implied in the verse before us. The same principle explains the
            array of classical instances adduced by Peile
          </p>
          <p>
            4. While we take this general view, we are inclined to regard the
            verse, from λόγον to τινί, as participial; and with Bähr, closely to
            connect ἐστίν with πρός. “Which things having, indeed, a show of
            wisdom in superstition, humility, and corporeal austerity, not in
            any thing of value, are for, or minister to the gratification of the
            flesh.” Πρός after εἰμί denotes result. Jn 11:4. There needs, with
            this view, the insertion of no explanatory terms, or connecting
            ideas taken for granted. The verb stands at a distance from the
            preposition, but is not on that account the less emphatic. The
            apostle means to condemn those precepts and teachings, and he is
            about to pronounce the sentence; but to make it the more emphatic he
            briefly enumerates what they chiefly consist of, and then his
            censure is, that they produce an effect directly the opposite to
            their professed design. Their avowed purpose is to lower and abase
            humanity, and he gives them epithets all showing this object; while
            he adds with sternness and force, that their only result is to rouse
            up and inflate unregenerate humanity. That πλησμονή can bear this
            tropical meaning there is no doubt, as in Hab_2:16, where the word
            occurs with ἀτιμίας; Sir_1:16, where it is used with σοφίας; and
            Isa_65:15, where it stands absolutely, but with a spiritual sense.
            The phrase οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινί, then brings out this contrast-those
            doctrines have in sooth a show of wisdom, in their will-worship,
            humility, and corporeal austerity, but they have really nothing of
            value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The paragraph therefore reprobates superstitious asceticism. The
            religious history of the world shows what fascination there is to
            many minds in voluntary suffering. Such asceticism threw its eclipse
            over the bright and lovely spirit of Pascal. The oriental
            temperament feels powerfully the fatal charm. As if the Divine Being
            might fail to subject them to a sufficient amount of discipline, men
            assume the labour of disciplining themselves, but choose a mode very
            unlike that which God usually employs.

          <p>
            Such delusions are not confined to religious follies, for their
            origin lies deep in human nature. Men glory in being what their
            fellows dare not aspire to, and there is no little
            self-aggrandizement in this self-annihilation. When Diogenes lifted
            his foot on Plato&#x27;s velvet cushion and shouted, “Thus I trample
            on Plato&#x27;s pride,” the Athenian sage justly replied, “But with
            still greater pride.” The apostle utters a similar sentiment; the
            carnal nature is all the while gratified, even though the body, wan
            and wasted, is reduced to the point of bare existence. There is more
            pride in cells and cloisters than in courts and palaces, and
            oftentimes as gross sensuality. The devotee deifies himself, is more
            to himself than the object of his homage. The whole of these
            fanatical processes, so far from accomplishing their ostensible
            object, really produce the reverse; such will-worship is an impious
            invention; such humility is pride in its most sullen and offensive
            form; and these corporeal macerations, so far from subduing and
            sanctifying, only gratify to satiety the coarse and selfish
            passions; nay, as history has shown, tend to nurse licentiousness in
            one age, and a ferocious fanaticism in another. The entire
            phenomenon, whatever its special aspect, is a huge self-deception,
            and a reversal of that moral order which God has established.

            In the course of expounding this chapter, we have found several
            illustrations in post-apostolic times. We now present another, which
            shows how the practices described in this section were viewed in
            themselves, and condemned at a very early period. The unknown author
            of that very precious document, the letter to Diognetus, and now
            rightly included by Hefele among the remains of the apostolical
            Fathers, speaks in a style worthy of an apostle. He says of the
            Jews, “But indeed I think that you have no need to learn from me
            their ridiculous and senseless alarms about their food, their
            superstition about the Sabbath, their boasting of circumcision, and
            their pretexts of fasting, and the observance of new moons. How is
            it right to receive some of the things which God has created for the
            use of man as fitly created, and to reject others of them as useless
            and superfluous? How can it be else than impious to libel God, as if
            He had forbidden any good action to be done on the Sabbath day? How
            worthy of ridicule their exultation about the curtailment of the
            flesh as a witness of their election, as though on this account they
            were the peculiar objects of God&#x27;s complacency! Who will regard
            as a sign of piety, and will not much more regard as a mark of
            folly, their scrupulous study of the stars, and their watching of
            the moon, in order to procure the observance of months and days, and
            to arrange the Divine dispensations and changes of the seasons-some
            into feasts and others into fasts, according to their inclination? I
            imagine that you are sufficiently informed, that the Christians
            rightly abstain from the prevailing emptiness of worship and
            delusion, and from the fussiness and vainglory of the Jews.”

            Our readers will pardon us for inserting in a note a modern instance
            of this pride of sanctity covered with a robe of revolting humility.
            Last year (1854), a new saint was added to the Popish calendar, by
            name Benedetto Giuseppe Labre, who had made his residence in the
            Coliseo for many years, and was noted by travellers for his
            craziness and filth. At the usual mock trial which takes place at a
            canonization, the pleading of the so-called Devil&#x27;s advocate
            against him was rebutted by the so-called God&#x27;s advocate in the
            following terms, literally translated from the paper:—“He was a
            model of humility, abstinence, and mortification, taking only for
            food remains of cabbage, lemon peel, or lettuce leaves, which he
            picked up in the streets. He even ate, once, some spoiled soup which
            he found on a dunghill, where it had been thrown. All these facts
            are fully proved by the juridical documents laid before the
            tribunal.” . . . . Having spoken at length of the wooden cup, all
            broken and rotten, in which he received his soup at the door of the
            houses, “eternal monument of his voluntary privations,” the advocate
            proceeds: “What more shall I say? A glance cast upon him was
            sufficient to discover in him a perfect model of poverty. His hair
            and beard were neglected, his face pale, his garments ragged, his
            body livid; a rosary hung from his neck; he wore no stockings; his
            shirt was dirty and disgusting; and to give of him a full idea, let
            us add, that he was so completely covered with vermin (pidocchi),
            that in the churches many persons kept away from him for fear of
            catching them!”
