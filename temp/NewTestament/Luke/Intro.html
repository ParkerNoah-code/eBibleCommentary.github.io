        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          Like the contents of the previous Gospels we may also divide those of
          Luke’s into five parts:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The Advent of the Divine Man, Luk_1:1-80, Luk_2:1-52, Luk_3:1-38,
          Luk_4:1-13. After stating his aim the evangelist describes the
          announcement from heaven of the forerunner, John the Baptist, and of
          Christ himself, and their birth with the attendant circumstances,
          Luk_1:1-80, Luk_2:1-20. Then he shows that Christ was made subject to
          the law in circumcision, in the presentation in the temple, and in his
          journey to Jerusalem, Luk_2:21-52. He traces the descent of the Son of
          Man to Adam, and points out that He was prepared for his work by
          baptism and temptation, Luk_3:1-38, Luk_4:1-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Work of the Divine Man for the Jewish World, Luk_4:14-44,
          Luk_5:1-39, Luk_6:1-49, Luk_7:1-50, Luk_8:1-56, Luk_9:1-50. In this
          part we first see Christ preaching in the synagogues of Nazareth,
          Capernaum and all Galilee; performing many miracles in Capernaum and
          by the sea of Galilee, such as the curing of Peter’s mother-in-law,
          the wonderful draught of fishes, the cleansing of the leper, and the
          healing of the palsied man; calling Levi to follow him; and
          instructing his enemies regarding his authority, his purpose, and the
          moral character of his demands, as a result of which many were amazed
          and Pharisees and Scribes were filled with hatred, Luk_4:14-44,
          Luk_5:1-39, Luk_6:1-11. After a night of prayer the Lord now chooses
          his twelve disciples and proclaims the constitution of his Kingdom,
          Luk_6:12-49. He cures the centurion s servant, raises the widow’s son,
          and gives instruction by word and example regarding the nature of his
          work and the character of the subjects of his Kingdom, Luk_7:1-49. The
          origin of the Kingdom is now illustrated in the parable of the sower,
          and the divine power of Christ over both the natural and the spiritual
          world is shown in the stilling of the storm, in the deliverance of the
          Gadarene demoniac, in his curing the woman with the issue of blood and
          raising the daughter of Jairus, Luk_8:1-56. The twelve are sent out
          and on their return Christ retires with them to a desert place, where
          He miraculously feeds the five thousand, after which He once and again
          announced his future suffering and was transfigured on the Mount,
          Luk_9:1-50.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The Work of the Divine Man for the Gentiles, Luk_9:51-62,
          Luk_10:1-42, Luk_11:1-54, Luk_12:1-59, Luk_13:1-35, Luk_14:1-35,
          Luk_15:1-32, Luk_16:1-31, Luk_17:1-37, Luk_18:1-30. Jesus in traveling
          towards Jerusalem sends messengers before him, but these are rejected
          by the Samaritans; then He sends out the seventy, who return with a
          good report, teaches that neighborly love is not to be restricted to
          the Jews (good Samaritan), and gives his disciples instruction
          regarding prayer, Luk_9:51-62, Luk_10:1-42, Luk_11:1-13. The Pharisees
          now claim that Christ casts out the devils through Beelzebub, in
          answer to which He pictures their condition, and when they tempt him
          in various ways, pronounces his woe upon them and warns his disciples
          against them, Luk_11:14-54, Luk_12:1-12. In connection with the
          parable of the rich fool the Lord warns against covetousness and
          anxious care, and bids his disciples to be prepared for the day of his
          coming, Luk_12:13-53. Sitting at meat in the house of a Pharisee, He
          teaches those present true mercy, true humility, true hospitality, and
          the fact that they, having refused the supper of the Lord, will be
          rejected, Luk_14:1-24. Next the necessity of self-denial is impressed
          on those that would follow Jesus, and in three parables the Pharisees
          are made acquainted with the real purpose of his coming, Luk_14:25-35,
          Luk_15:1-32. The disciples are instructed in the careful use of their
          earthly possessions, and to the Pharisees the law of retribution is
          explained, Luk_16:1-31. In various ways the Lord impresses on his
          followers the necessity of a forgiving spirit, of humility, of faith
          and gratitude, of constant prayer with a view to the unexpected
          character of his coming, of trusting in God and of self denial, all
          ending in everlasting salvation, Luk_17:1-37, Luk_18:1-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Sacrifice of the Divine Man for all Mankind, Luk_18:31-43,
          Luk_19:1-48, Luk_20:1-47, Luk_21:1-38, Luk_22:1-71, Luk_23:1-49. Jesus
          announces once more his future suffering and death, at Jericho
          restores the sight of a blind man and calls Zaccheus, and points out
          to his followers that his Kingdom would not immediately come,
          Luk_18:32-43, Luk_19:1-27. Triumphantly He enters Jerusalem, where He
          cleanses the temple, answers the questions of the Chief Priests, the
          Scribes, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and instructs his followers
          regarding his future coming, Luk_19:28-48, Luk_20:1-47, Luk_21:1-38.
          After eating the Passover with his disciples He was betrayed,
          condemned and crucified, Luk_22:1 Luk_23:56.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The Divine Man Saviour of all Nations, Luk_24:1-53. On the morning
          of the first day Christ arose; women seek him in the grave; He appears
          to two of his disciples on the way to Emmaus, to the eleven, and
          finally departs from them with the promise of the Spirit.
        </p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The following are the most important characteristics of the third
          Gospel:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In point of completeness it surpasses the other Synoptics,
          beginning, as it does, with a detailed narrative of the birth of John
          the Baptist and of Christ himself, and ending with a record of the
          ascension from the Mount of Olives. In distinction from Matthew and
          Mark this Gospel even contains an allusion to the promise of the
          Father, Luk_24:29, and thus points beyond the old dispensation to the
          new that would be ushered in by the coming of the Holy Spirit. The
          detailed narrative of Christ’s going to Jerusalem in Luk_9:51-62,
          Luk_10:1-42, Luk_11:1-54, Luk_12:1-59, Luk_13:1-35, Luk_14:1-35,
          Luk_15:1-32, Luk_16:1-31, Luk_17:1-37, Luk_18:1-14 is also peculiar to
          this gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Christ is set before us in this Gospel as the perfect Man with wide
          sympathies. The genealogy of Jesus is trace back through David and
          Abraham to Adam, our common progenitor, thus presenting him as one of
          our race. We are told of the truly human development both in body and
          spirit of Jesus in Luk_2:40-52, and of his dependence on prayer in the
          most important crises of His life, Luk_3:21; Luk_9:29. Those features
          of the Lord’s miracles of healing are clearly brought out that show
          his great sympathy. “Peter’s mother-in-law suffers from a great fever;
          and the leper is full of leprosy. The hand restored on the sabbath is
          the right hand, the centurion s servant is one dear to him, the son of
          the widow of Nain, is an only son, the daughter of Jairus an only
          daughter, the epileptic boy at the hill of transfiguration is an only
          child.” Bruce, The Expositor’s Greek Testament I p. 47.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Another feature of this gospel is its universality. It comes nearer
          than other Gospels to the Pauline doctrine of salvation for all the
          world, and of salvation by faith, without the works of the law. In the
          synagogue at Nazareth Christ points out that God might again deal with
          the Jews as He had done in the days of Elijah and Elisha, Luk_4:25-27;
          He declares that the faith of the centurion was greater than any He
          had found in Israel, Luk_7:2-10; sends messengers before his face into
          Samaria, Luk_9:52-56; demands love of Israel even for the Samaritans,
          Luk_10:30-37; heals the Samaritan leper as well as the others,
          Luk_17:11-19; and speaks the significant word: “Blessed are they that
          hear the word of God and keep it, Luk_11:28.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. More than the other evangelists Luke relates his narrative to
          contemporaneous history and indicates the time of the occurrences. It
          was in the days of king Herod that the birth of John the Baptist and
          Christ was announced, Luk_1:1; Luk_1:26; during the reign of Caesar
          Augustus, that Christ was born, Luk_2:1; while Cyrenius was governor
          of Syria, that the taxation took place, Luk_2:2; in the fifteenth year
          of Tiberias, etc., that Christ was baptized and began his public
          ministry, Luk_3:1-2. Notice also the following chronological
          indications: Luk_1:36; Luk_1:56; Luk_1:59; Luk_2:42; Luk_3:23;
          Luk_9:28; Luk_9:37; Luk_9:51; Luk_22:1; Luk_22:7. We should not infer
          from the foregoing, however, that Luke furnishes us with a
          chronological record of the Lord’s public ministry. Very indefinite
          expressions of time are found throughout the Gospel, as: “and it came
          to pass, when he was in a certain city,” Luk_5:12; “and it came to
          pass on a certain day,” Luk_5:17; “and it came to pass also on another
          sabbath,” Luk_6:6, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Luke writes a purer Greek than any of the other evangelists, but
          this is evident only, where he does not closely follow his sources.
          The Greek of the preface is of remarkable purity, but aside from this
          the first and second chapters are full of Hebraisms. Of the rest of
          the Gospel some parts approach very closely to classical Greek, while
          others are tinged with Hebrew expressions. Plummer says: “The author
          of the Third Gospel and of the Acts is the most versatile of all the
          New Testament writers. He can be as Hebraistic as the LXX, and as free
          from Hebraisms as Plutarch.” Comm. on Luke in International Crit.
          Comm. p. XLIX. His style is also very picturesque; he tries to make us
          see things, just as the eyewitnesses saw them. Moreover his Gospel
          contains 312 words that are peculiar to him. Several of these are ἅπαξ
          λεγόμενα. There are also five Latin words, viz. δηνάριον,λεγεών,
          σουδάριον,ἀσσάριον and μόδιος. Cf. lists in Plummer’s Comm. and
          Davidson’s Introd.
        </p>
        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          Though the author speaks of himself explicitly in the preface of his
          Gospel, we are dependent on tradition for his name. And here again the
          testimony of the fathers is unanimous. Irenaeus asserts that “Luke,
          the companion of Paul, put down in a book the Gospel preached by him.”
          With this agrees the testimony of Origen; Eusebius, Athanasius,
          Gregory, Nazianze, Jerome, e. a.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gospel itself offers us no direct collateral testimony. Yet there
          are certain features that strengthen our belief in the authorship of
          Luke. In the first place the writer evidently looks at things with the
          eye of a physician. In 1882 Dr. Hobart published a work on, The
          Medical Language of St. Luke, showing that in many instances the
          evangelist uses the technical language that was also used by Greek
          medical writers, as παραλελυμἐνος, Luk_5:18; Luk_5:24 (the other
          Gospels have παραλύτικος);συνεχομένη πυρετῷ μεγαλλῳ Luk_4:38; ἔστη ἡ
          ῥύσις τοῦ ἅιματος Luk_8:44 (cf. Mat_5:29); ἀνεκάθισεν, Luk_7:14, Luke
          carefully distinguishes demoniacal possession from disease, Luk_4:18;
          Luk_13:32; states exactly the age of the dying person, Luk_8:42; and
          the duration of the affliction in Luk_13:11. He only relates the
          miracle of the healing of Malchus ear. All these things point to Luke,
          “the beloved physician.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second place there is what has been called the Paulinism of
          Luke. This has sometimes been emphasized unduly, no doubt, but it
          certainly is a characteristic feature of the third Gospel, and is just
          what we would expect in a writing of Paul’s companion. In the third
          place we find great similarity between this Gospel and the Acts of the
          Apostles. If Luke wrote the latter, he also composed the former. The
          general opinion is expressed by Knowling in his introduction to the
          book of Acts, in the Expositor’s Greek TestamentII p. 3: “Whoever
          wrote the Acts wrote also the Gospel which bears the name of Luke.” It
          is true that there are more Hebraisms in the Gospel than in Acts, but
          this is due to the fact that the writer in composing the former was
          more dependent on written sources than he was in writing the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only certain knowledge we have of Luke is derived from the Acts of
          the Apostles and from a few passages in the Epistles of Paul. From
          Col_4:11; Col_4:14 it appears that he was not a Jew and that his
          worldly calling was that of a physician. Eusebius and Jerome state
          that he was originally from Antioch in Syria, which may be true; but
          it is also possible that their statement is due to a mistaken
          derivation of the name Luke from Lucius (cf. Act_13:1) instead of from
          Lucanus. The testimony of Origen makes us suspect thIsa. Theophylact
          and Euthymius had the mistaken opinion that he was one of the Seventy
          sent out by our Lord. This is refuted by the preface of the Gospel,
          where Luke clearly distinguishes himself from those that saw and heard
          the Lord. Apparently the evangelist joined the company of Paul and his
          co-laborers on the second missionary journey at Troas. This may be
          inferred from the beginning of the we-sections in Act_16:10. The first
          one of these sections ends at Act_16:17, so that Luke probably
          remained at Philippi. He stayed there, so it seems, until Paul
          returned from Greece on his third missionary journey, for in Act_20:5
          we suddenly come upon the plural pronoun of the first person again.
          Then he evidently accompanied the apostle to Jerusalem, Act_20:6;
          Act_20:13-15; Act_21:1-17. In all probability he was with Paul at
          Ceasarea, Act_27:1, from where he accompanied the apostle to Rome,
          Act_27:1 Act_28:16. He remained at Rome during the first imprisonment,
          Col_4:14; Phm_1:24, and was according to these passages a beloved
          friend and fellow-laborer of the apostle. And when the great
          missionary of the gentiles was imprisoned for the second time, Luke
          was the only one with him, 2Ti_4:11, and thus gave evidence of his
          great attachment to Paul. The last part of Luke’s life is involved in
          obscurity. Nothing certain can be gathered from the conflicting
          testimony of the fathers. Some claim that he gained a martyr’s crown;
          others, that he died a natural death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question must be asked, whether Paul was in any way connected with
          the composition of the third Gospel. The testimony of the early Church
          is very uncertain on this point. Tertullian says: “Luke’s digest is
          often ascribed to Paul. And indeed it is easy to take that for the
          master’s which is published by the disciples.” According to Eusebius,
          “Luke hath delivered in his Gospel a certain amount of such things as
          he had been assured of by his intimate acquaintance and familiarity
          with Paul, and his connection with the other apostles.” With this the
          testimony of Jerome agrees. Athanasius states that the Gospel of Luke
          was dictated by the apostle Paul. In view of the preface of the gospel
          we may be sure that the Church fathers exaggerate the influence of
          Paul in the composition of this Gospel, possibly to give it apostolic
          authority. Paul’s relation to the third Gospel differs from that of
          Peter to the second; it is not so close. Luke did not simply write
          what he remembered of the preaching of Paul, much less did he write
          according to the dictation of the apostle, for he himself says that he
          traced everything from the beginning and speaks of both oral and
          written sources that were at his command. Among these oral sources we
          must, of course, also reckon the preaching of Paul. That the great
          apostle did influence Luke’s representation of “the beginning of the
          Gospel,” is very evident. There are 175 words and expressions in the
          gospel that are peculiar to Luke and Paul. Cf. Plummer p. LIV.
          Besides, as we have already seen, some of the leading ideas of Paul
          are found in the third gospel, such as the universality of the Gospel,
          the necessity of faith, and the use of the word διακαιόω in a forensic
          sense, Luk_7:29; Luk_10:29; Luk_16:15; Luk_18:14. A striking
          resemblance exists also between Luke’s account of the institution of
          the Lord’s supper, Luk_22:19-20. and Paul’s memoir of this in
          1Co_11:23-25, but this may be due to the use of a common source.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lukan authorship of the Gospel was generally accepted up to the
          time, when Rationalism began its attacks on the books of the Bible.
          The Tubingen school, notably F. C. Baur, maintained that the Gospel of
          Marcion, who began to teach at Rome in 140 A. D., was the original of
          our Gospel. Others followed where Baur led. In later years, however,
          critical opinion wheeled about completely and the opinion is generally
          held that Marcion’s Gospel is a mutilation of Luke’s, though in some
          parts it may represent another and even an older text. This, of
          course, made it possible again to maintain the authorship of Luke. But
          even now there are several German scholars who doubt that Luke wrote
          the Gospel, and Harnack’s protest against their contention seems
          ineffective. Their objections to the Lukan authorship are based on the
          Acts of the Apostles rather than on the Gospel, but, as has been
          intimated, the two stand or fall together. We shall consider these
          objections, when we treat of Acts.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
          1. Readers and Purpose. The Gospel of Luke was first of all intended
          for Theophilus, who is addressed as “most excellent Theophilus” in
          Luk_1:3, and is also mentioned in Act_1:1. We have no means of
          determining who this Theophilus was. It has been supposed by some that
          the name was a general one, applied to every Christian, as a beloved
          one or a friend of God. But the general opinion now is, and rightly
          so, that it is the name of an individual, probably a Greek. The fact
          that he is addressed by Luke in the same manner as Felix, Act_23:26;
          Act_24:3, and Festus, Act_26:25 are addressed, led to the conclusion
          that he was a person of high station. Baljon thinks he was undoubtedly
          a Gentile Christian, while Zahn regards him as a Gentile who had not
          yet accepted Christ, since Luke would have addressed a brother
          differently. It is generally agreed, however, that the Gospel was not
          intended for Theophilus only, but was simply addressed to him as the
          representative of a large circle of readers. Who were these first
          readers of the gospel? Origen says that the third gospel was composed
          “for the sake of the Gentile converts ;” Gregory Nazianze, more
          definitely: “Luke wrote for the Greeks.” Now it is quite evident from
          the gospel itself that the evangelist is not writing for the Jews. He
          never gives the words of Jesus in the Aramaic language; instead of
          ἀμὴν λέγω he has ἀληθώς λέγω, Luk_9:27; Luk_12:44; Luk_21:3; for
          γραμματεῖς he uses νομικόι, διδάσκαλος, Luk_2:46; Luk_7:30; Luk_10:25;
          Luk_11:45; and of many places in Palestine he gives a nearer
          definition. It is very probable that that Gospel of Luke was intended
          for the Greeks, because Paul labored primarily among them, Theophilus
          was in all probability a Greek, the preface of the gospel is in many
          respects like those found in Greek historians, and the whole Gospel is
          remarkably adjusted to the needs of the Greeks. Cf. for this last
          point especially Gregory, Why Four Gospels p. 207 if.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of Luke is clearly stated in the preface, viz. 98 that
          Theophilus and the Gentile readers in general might know the certainty
          of those things, wherein they had been instructed, Luk_1:4. It is his
          desire to present clearly the truth of all Gospel facts. In order to
          do this, he aims at fulness of treatment; traces all things from the
          beginning; writes an orderly account of all that has happened,
          recording the sayings of the Lord in their original setting more than
          the other evangelists do, thus promoting definiteness and
          strengthening his representation of the reality of things; mentions
          the names not only of the principal actors in the Gospel history, but
          also those of others that were in any way connected with it,
          Luk_2:1-2; Luk_3:1-2; Luk_7:40; Luk_8:3; brings the Gospel facts in
          relation with secular history, Luk_2:1-2; Luk_3:1-2; and describes
          carefully the impression which the teachings of Christ made, Luk_4:15;
          Luk_4:22; Luk_4:36; Luk_5:8; Luk_5:25; Luk_6:11; Luk_7:29; Luk_8:37;
          Luk_18:43; Luk_19:37. From the contents of the Gospel we may further
          gather that it was the author s nearer purpose to present Christ in a
          very acceptable way to the Greeks, viz, as the perfect man (cf. p. 91
          above), as the sympathetic friend of the afflicted and the poor,
          Luk_1:52; Luk_2:7; Luk_4:18; Luk_6:20; Luk_12:15 ff. Luk_16:19, etc.,
          and as the Saviour of the world, seeking those that are lost,
          Luk_7:36-50; Luk_15:1-32; Luk_18:9-14; Luk_19:1-10; Luk_23:43.

          2. Time and Place. Tradition tells us very little regarding the time,
          when Luke wrote his Gospel. According to Eusebius Clement of
          Alexandria received a tradition from presbyters of more ancient times
          “that the Gospels containing the genealogies were written first.”
          Theophylact says: “Luke wrote fifteen years after Christ’s ascension.
          The testimony of Euthymius is to the same effect, while Eutichius
          states that Luke wrote his Gospel in the time of Nero. According to
          these testimonies the evangelist composed his Gospel possibly as early
          as 54, and certainly not later than 68 A. D.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal evidence is even more uncertain. Some infer from Luk_21:24
          that Luke realized that a certain time was to elapse between the
          destruction of Jerusalem and the final judgment, and therefore wrote
          after the destruction of the Holy City, a very inconclusive argument
          indeed, since this is a prophetic word of Christ. We might argue in
          favor of a date after the destruction of Jerusalem from the absence of
          the warning note that is found in both Matthew and Mark, but being an
          argument from silence even that does not prove the point. Several
          scholars, especially of the Tubingen school, date the Gospel near the
          end of the first or in the beginning of the second century. The main
          argument for this date is the supposed fact that Luke is in some parts
          of his Gospel dependent on the Antiquities of Josephus, a rather
          chimerical idea. Both Zahn and Weiss are of the opinion that Luke
          wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, but not later than the year
          80 A. D. Zahn settled on this terminus ad quem, because he considers
          it likely that Luke was a member of the Antiochian congregation as
          early as the year 40 A. D., and would therefore be very old in the
          year 80 A. D.; Weiss, since the evangelist evidently expected the
          second coming of Christ in his time, which was characteristic of the
          first generation after Christ. The great majority of conservative
          scholars place the composition of this Gospel somewhere between 58 and
          63 A. D. The main arguments for this date are: (1) it is in harmony
          with ancient tradition; (2) it best explains the total silence of Luke
          regarding the destruction of Jerusalem; and (3) it is most in harmony
          with the dating of Acts in 63 A. D., which offers a good explanation
          of Luke’s silence with respect to the death of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the place, where the Gospel of Luke was written tradition points
          to Achaia and Boeotia. We have no means of controlling this testimony,
          however, so that it really leaves us in ignorance. Some of the modern
          guesses are, Rome, Caesarea, Asia Minor, Ephesus, and Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Method. In view of the preface of Luke’s Gospel we have reason to
          believe that in the composition of it the evangelist depended on both
          oral tradition and written sources. In present day theories the
          emphasis is mainly placed on written sources, and the most prevalent
          hypothesis is that he employed the Gospel of Mark, either in the
          present form or in an earlier recension; the apostolic source Q or
          some διήγησις containing this (from which two sources he derived
          mainly the matter that he has in common with Matthew and Mark); and a
          third main source of unknown character and authorship, from which he
          drew the narrative of the nativity, Luk_1:1-80, Luk_2:1-52, and the
          account of the last journey to Jerusalem, contained in Luk_9:51
          Luk_18:14. Zahn also believes that Luke employed Mark as one of his
          sources, but does not attempt to give a nearer definition of the other
          sources used. The opinion that he drew part of his material from
          Josephus deserves but a passing notice. It seems to us that it is
          impossible to determine exactly what sources Luke used; all we can say
          is: (1) Having been an associate of Paul for several years, part of
          which he spent in Palestine, where he had abundant opportunity to meet
          other apostles and eyewitnesses of the Lord’s works, he must have
          gathered a large store of knowledge from oral tradition, which he
          utilized in the composition of his gospel. This accounts for a great
          deal of the matter which he has in common with Matthew and Mark. (2)
          During the time of his research in Palestine he also became acquainted
          with a goodly number of διηγήσεις narratives of the Gospel facts, of
          which we can no more determine the exact nature, and drew on them for
          a part of his material. One of these probably contained the matter
          found in Luk_1:1-80 and Luk_2:1-52, and in Luk_9:51 Luk_18:14. (3) It
          does not seem likely that Luke read either the Gospel of Matthew or
          that of Mark, and classed them or either one of them with the previous
          attempts, on which he desired to improve. Oral tradition in connection
          with the guidance of the Holy Spirit is quite sufficient to explain
          the resemblance between these Gospels and that of Luke.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The canonicity of this Gospel is well attested. Says Alexander in his
          work on the Canon p. 177: “The same arguments by which the canonical
          authority of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark was established, apply
          with their full force to the Gospel of Luke. It was universally
          received as canonical by the whole primitive Church has a place in
          every catalogue of the books of the New Testament, which was ever
          published is constantly referred to and cited by the Fathers as a part
          of sacred Scripture and was one of the books constantly read in the
          churches, as a part of the rule of faith and practice for all
          believers.” There are in all 16 witnesses before the end of the second
          century that testify to its use and general acceptance in the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gospel of Luke presents to us Christ especially as one of the
          human race, the Seed of the woman, in his saving work not only for
          Israel, but also for the Gentiles. Hence it pictures him as the friend
          of the poor and as seeking sinners, emphasizes the universality of the
          Gospel blessings, and distinctly bespeaks a friendly relation to the
          Samaritans. Its permanent spiritual value is that it reminds the
          Church of all ages that in every nation he that feareth God, and
          worketh righteousness, is accepted with him; and that we have a great
          High Priest that was touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and
          was in all parts tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
