            3.
            <em
              >We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, even
              as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and
              the love of each and every one of you toward one another
              abounds,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>We are bound</em>. In these words Paul shows that we are bound
            to give thanks to God, not only when he does us good, but also when
            we take into view the favors bestowed by him upon our brethren. For
            wherever the goodness of God shines forth, it becomes us to extol
            it. Farther, the welfare of our brethren ought to be so dear to us,
            that we ought to reckon among our own benefits everything that has
            been conferred upon them. Nay more, if we consider the nature and
            sacredness of the unity of Christ's body, such a mutual fellowship
            will have place among us, that we shall reckon the benefits
            conferred upon an individual member as gain to the whole Church.
            Hence, in extolling God's benefits, we must always have an eye to
            the whole body of the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To always give thanks to God</em>. He begins with commendation,
            that he may have occasion to pass on to exhortation, for in this way
            we have more success among those who have already entered upon the
            course, when without passing over in silence their former progress,
            we remind them how far distant they are as yet from the goal, and
            stir them up to make progress. As, however, he had in the former
            Epistle commended their faith and love, he now declares the increase
            of both. And, unquestionably, this course ought to be pursued by all
            the pious--to examine themselves daily, and see how far they have
            advanced. This, therefore, is the true commendation of
            believers--their growing daily in faith and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            When, however, he gives thanks to God on this account, he declares
            that the enlargements, no less than the beginnings, of faith and
            love are from him, for if they proceeded from the power of men,
            thanksgiving would be pretended, or at least worthless. Farther, he
            shows that their proficiency was not trivial, or even ordinary, but
            most abundant. So much the more disgraceful is our slowness,
            inasmuch as we scarcely advance one foot during a long space of
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For you, brothers</em>. Who were so, not in a natural or civil
            relation, but in a spiritual one, being the children of God, and
            brethren of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Even as it is appropriate</em>. It was just, proper, and
            fitting; it not only becomes the persons who have received mercies
            from God to be thankful for them; but it is very right for others to
            join with them in it, and especially the ministers of the Gospel,
            who are bound, and whom it becomes: it is agreeable to their office
            and profession to give God the praise and glory of all the grace,
            and the increase of it, which those, who attend their labours, are
            favoured with, since this is not of them, but of God; and it was for
            an increase of grace the apostle here gives thanks, as he judged he
            was obliged to do, and it was fit he should.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Because your faith grows exceedingly</em>. Their faith was not a
            faith of miracles, nor a mere historical faith, or a counterfeit and
            temporary one, but the faith of God's elect; which is the evidence
            of things not seen, of an unseen Christ, and the glories of another
            world; that grace by which a man goes out of himself to Christ for
            righteousness, life, and salvation; by which he is justified, and by
            which he lives on Christ, and walks on in him as he has received
            him. This was theirs; it was not of themselves, the produce of
            nature, or the fruit of their natural power and free will; but it
            was the gift of God, and of his operation; a fruit of the Spirit of
            God, and of which Christ was the author and finisher; and was only
            theirs, as being given unto them, implanted in them, and exercised
            by them under the influence of the Spirit of God, and for their use,
            comfort, and advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >And the love of each and every one of you toward one another
              abounds</em
            >. As their faith in Christ, so their love to one another was
            increasing, and showed itself in serving one another both in
            temporals and spirituals; and this was not the case of a few only,
            or of the greater part, but of everyone of them; which made their
            communion with one another very comfortable and delightful. For what
            is more pleasant than for brethren to dwell together in unity?
          </p>

          <h2>
            4.
            <em
              >so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for
              your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the
              afflictions which you endure.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>So that we ourselves boast about you</em>. For though they were
            the subject concerning which they gloried, yet not the object in
            which they gloried; the apostle elsewhere advises not to glory in
            men, but only in the Lord; nor was this his practice contrary to his
            advice, for he did not boast of these persons with respect to their
            carnal things; he did not glory in their flesh, nor in their riches,
            nor wisdom, nor strength, nor any external gift; he gloried indeed
            of their graces, and of the exercise and increase of them; but of
            these not as of themselves, or as owing to him, and his fellow
            ministers, but as instances of the grace of God, and for which he
            gives thanks to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the assemblies of God</em>. He could not have bestowed higher
            commendation upon them, than by saying that he sets them forward
            before other Churches as a pattern. These other churches in
            Macedonia and Achaia, as Philippi, Berea, Corinth, and elsewhere he
            gave thanks to God for them in order to stir up other churches to an
            emulation and imitation of them. For Paul did not boast of the faith
            of the Thessalonians from a spirit of ambition, but inasmuch as his
            commendation of them might be an incitement to make it their
            endeavor to imitate them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >For your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in
              the afflictions which you endure</em
            >. Many and sore were the reproaches, the afflictions, and
            persecutions that befell them for the sake of Christ, and their
            profession of him, and his Gospel and which is more or less the case
            of everyone that will live godly in Christ Jesus: and these they
            endured, they bore and stood up under, they were not shocked, and
            staggered, and moved from the hope of the Gospel by them; which
            shows that the truth of grace was in them.
          </p>
          <p>
            For where there is not the root of the matter, when tribulation and
            affliction arise because of the profession of the word, such are
            offended, stumbled, and quickly gone; but these saints endured their
            afflictions, and with great patience, without murmuring and
            repining, and with great constancy, firmness, and resolution of
            mind. They stood fast in the grace and doctrine of faith, and in the
            profession of both, which they held without wavering, and none of
            the things they met with could move them from it.

              "Greet the assembly that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my
              beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ. Greet Mary,
              who labored much for us. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives
              and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who
              were also in Christ before me. Greet Amplias, my beloved in the

            </p>

          <p>There are many local assemblies:</p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
              in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thes 1:1).
            </p>
            <p>
              "I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the

            <p>
              "I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might

          </section>

          <p>
            Though there are many different local assemblies, there is one
            universal body of Christ that consists of all believers:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members
              don’t have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in
              Christ, and individually members of one another, having gifts
              differing according to the grace that was given to us" (Rom
              12:4-6).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle
              wall of separation, having abolished in his flesh the hostility,
              the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might
              create in himself one new man of the two, making peace, and might
              reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having
              killed the hostility through it." (Eph 2:14-16).

          <p>
            Local assemblies should reflect the universal assembly, the body of

              "'Behold, the days come,' says Yahweh, 'that I will make a new
              covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,
              not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in
              the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land
              of Egypt, which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a
              husband to them,' says Yahweh. 'But this is the covenant that I
              will make with the house of Israel after those days,' says
              Yahweh:<br />
              'I will put my law in their inward parts,<br />
              and I will write it in their heart.<br />
              I will be their God,<br />
              and they shall be my people.<br />
              They will no longer each teach his neighbor,<br />
              and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’<br />
              for they will all know me,<br />
              from their least to their greatest,' says Yahweh,<br />
              'for I will forgive their iniquity,<br />
              and I will remember their sin no more.'"
            </p>
            <p>
              "Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship do
              righteousness and iniquity have? Or what fellowship does light
              have with darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial?
              Or what portion does a believer have with an unbeliever? What
              agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a
              temple of the living God. Even as God said, 'I will dwell in them
              and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.'
              Therefore<br />
              “‘Come out from among them,<br />
              and be separate,’ says the Lord.<br />
              ‘Touch no unclean thing.<br />
              I will receive you.<br />
              I will be to you a Father.<br />
              You will be to me sons and daughters,’<br />
              says the Lord Almighty.”" (2 Cor 6:14-18).

            <p>
              "These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly, but
              if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave
              themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living
              God, the pillar and ground of the truth." (1 Tim 3:14-15).
            </p>
            <p>
              "So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are
              fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, being

              himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom the whole building,
              fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you
              also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."

              the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every
              joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each
              individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of
              itself in love." (Eph 4:11-16).

            Local assemblies should reflect the universal assembly, the body of
            Christ, by only accepting believers for baptism:

              "Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in
              the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will
              receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and
              to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the
              Lord our God will call to himself'... Then those who gladly
              received his word were baptized." (Acts 2:38-39, 41).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
              unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in
              the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, in whom he also went and
              preached to the spirits in prison, who before were disobedient
              when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was
              being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through
              water. This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the
              putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
              conscience toward God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
              who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels
              and authorities and powers being made subject to him." (1 Pet
              3:18-22).

              "In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made
              with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the
              flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him
              in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith
              in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. You were dead
              through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. He
              made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our
              trespasses, wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was
              against us. He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the
              cross." (Col 2:11-14).

            Local assemblies should reflect the universal assembly, the body of
            Christ, by only accepting believers for the Lord's Supper:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the
              blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of
              the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who
              are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of
              bread." (1 Cor 10:16-17).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you,
              that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took
              bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'Take, eat.
              This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of
              me.' In the same way he also took the cup after supper, saying,
              'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as
              you drink, in memory of me.' For as often as you eat this bread
              and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a
              way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood
              of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of
              the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks in an
              unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself if he doesn’t
              discern the Lord’s body. For this cause many among you are weak
              and sickly, and not a few sleep. For if we discerned ourselves, we
              wouldn’t be judged. But when we are judged, we are disciplined by
              the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world." (1 Cor
              11:23-32).

            Nevertheless, a certain amount unbelievers will remain in the local
            assemblies during the Church Age:

              "Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in
              which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the
              assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own
              blood. For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will
              enter in among you, not sparing the flock." (Acts 20:28-29).

              "For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading
              as Christ’s apostles. And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as
              an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his servants
              also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be
              according to their works." (2 Cor 11:13-15).
