            John Chrysostom comments, "How unto salvation? By sanctifying you
            through the Spirit. For these are the things that are the efficient
            causes of our salvation. It is nowhere of works, nowhere of
            righteous deeds, but through belief of the truth. Here again, 'in'
            is used for 'through.' 'And through sanctification of the Spirit,'
            he says,
          </p>
          <p>
            'Whereunto He called you through our Gospel to the obtaining of the
            glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.'
          </p>
          <p>
            This too is no little thing, if Christ considers our salvation His
            glory. For it is the glory of the Friend of man that they that are
            saved should be many. Great then is our Lord, if the Holy Spirit so
            desires our salvation. Why did he not say faith first? Because even
            after sanctification we have yet need of much faith, that we may not
            be shaken. Do you see how He shows that nothing is of themselves,
            but all of God?" (<a
