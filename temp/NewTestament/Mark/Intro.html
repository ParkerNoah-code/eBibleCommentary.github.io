        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          We may divide the contents of Mark’s Gospel, that treats of Christ as
          the mighty Worker, into five parts:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The Advent of the mighty Worker, Mar_1:1-45, Mar_2:1-12. Jesus is
          heralded as the mighty One by John the Baptist, and proclaimed as the
          Son of God by the Father, Mar_1:1-13. After calling some of his
          disciples, He taught the Galilean multitudes as one having authority,
          worked mighty miracles among them, as the casting out of demons, the
          healing of Peters mother-in-law, the cleansing of a leper, etc., and
          showed His authority to forgive sins, Mar_1:14-45, Mar_2:1-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Conflict of the mighty Worker, Mar_2:12-28, Mar_3:1-35,
          Mar_4:1-41, Mar_5:1-43, Mar_6:1-56, Mar_7:1-37, Mar_8:1-26. In
          connection with the feast of Levi, the fact that the apostles did not
          fast, and that they plucked ears of corn on the sabbath, Jesus gives
          the Pharisees instruction regarding the purpose of his coming, and the
          moral character of the requirements of his Kingdom, Mar_2:13-29,
          Mar_3:1-8. The healing of the man with the withered hand leads to the
          enmity of Pharisees and Herodians, which caused the withdrawal of
          Jesus. The Lord now chose twelve apostles and continued his mighty
          works, so that even his friends and relatives sought to restrain him,
          and his enemies claimed that He did them through the power of the
          devil, Mar_3:9-35. Next we find him teaching the people regarding the
          origin, the quiet growth, independent of mans efforts, and the future
          strength of the Kingdom of God, Mar_4:1-34. His divine power shines
          forth in his calming the sea, his curing the demoniacs in the land of
          the Gadarenes and the woman that had the issue of blood, and his
          raising the daughter of Jairus, Mar_4:36-41, Mar_5:1-43. He finds no
          faith at Nazareth, and now sends out the twelve into the cities of
          Galilee, Mar_6:1-13. Herod, hearing of Christ, stands in awe of him,
          believing him to be John the Baptist, whom he beheaded, Mar_6:14-29.
          Withdrawing with the twelve to a desert place, He feeds the five
          thousand, and after that shows his power over nature by walking on the
          sea, Mar_6:30-56. The Pharisees accost him, because his disciples eat
          bread with unclean hands, Mar_7:1-23. He now cures the daughter of the
          Syro-Phoenician woman and the deaf and dumb man at Decapolis, where He
          also feeds the four thousand, Mar_7:24-37, Mar_8:1-9. Once more the
          Pharisees ask him for a sign. Leaving them, He restores the sight of
          the blind man at Bethsaida, Mar_8:10-26.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The Claim of the mighty Worker, Mar_8:27-38, Mar_9:1-50,
          Mar_10:1-52, Mar_11:1-33, Mar_12:1-44, Mar_13:1-37. The Lord shows the
          necessity of his suffering, leads his disciples to confess him as
          Messiah, and points out what is required of them, Mar_8:27-38. His
          power and glory are seen in the transfiguration and in the miracle
          following this, Mar_9:1-29. Then follows a second revelation of his
          future suffering, followed by teachings regarding humility and
          offenses, Mar_9:30-50. In Perea Christ, tempted by the Pharisees,
          gives his opinion on the question of divorce; then He blesses little
          children and points out the way of life to the young ruler,
          Mar_10:1-31. For the third time He reveals his future suffering, and
          prepares his disciples for a life of service, Mar_10:32-45. At Jericho
          He restores the sight of Bartemaeus. Next he enters Jerusalem amid
          loud hosannas, curses the fig-tree and cleanses the temple,
          Mar_10:46-52, Mar_11:1-26. In the temple He reveals his superiority by
          answering the questions of Pharisees, Sadducees and Herodians, and
          points to himself as David’s Lord, Mar_11:27-33, Mar_12:1-44. Then he
          speaks of his coming in glory, Mar_13:1-37.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Sacrifice of the mighty Worker, Mar_14:1-72, Mar_15:1-47.
          Preparation is made for Jesus death by the Sanhedrin and Judas on the
          one hand, and by Mary of Bethany on the other, Mar_14:1-11. The
          Passover is eaten and the Lords supper instituted, Mar_14:12-25 : In
          Gethsemane follows bitter agony and captivity, Mar_14:26-52. Then the
          Lord is tried and condemned by the Sanhedrin and by Pilate, and
          finally He is crucified, Mar_14:53-72, Mar_15:1-47.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The mighty Worker as Conqueror of Death, Mar_16:1-20. Women go to
          the grave on the first day of the week and are directed by the angels
          to go to Galilee, Mar_16:1-8. The Lord appears several times, gives
          blessed promises, and at last ascends to heaven, Mar_14:9-20.
        </p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          There are certain characteristics by which the Gospel of Mark is
          distinguished from the other Gospels:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The most striking peculiarity of the second Gospel is its
          descriptive character. It is Marks constant aim to picture the scenes
          of which he speaks in lively colours. There are many minute
          observations in his work that are not found in the other Synoptics,
          some of which point to its autoptic character. He mentions the look of
          anger that Christ cast on the hypocrites about him, Mar_3:5; relates
          the miracles, performed immediately after the transfiguration, with
          greater circumstantiality than the other Gospels, Mar_9:9-29; tells of
          Jesus taking little children in his arms and blessing them, Mar_9:36;
          Mar_10:16; remarks that Jesus, looking at the young ruler, loved him,
          Mar_10:21, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This Gospel contains comparatively little of the teaching of Jesus;
          it rather brings out the greatness of our Lord by pointing to his
          mighty works, and in doing this does not follow the exact
          chronological order. Teaching is subordinate to action, though we
          cannot maintain that it is ignored altogether. Mark, though
          considerably smaller than Matthew, contains all the miracles narrated
          by the latter except five, and besides has three that are not found in
          Matthew. Of the eighteen miracles in Luke, Mark has twelve and four
          others above this number.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In the Gospel of Mark several words of Christ that were directed
          against the Jews are left out, such as we find in Mat_3:7-10;
          Mat_8:5-13; Mat_15:24, etc. On the other hand more Jewish customs and
          Aramaic words are explained than in the first Gospel, Mar_2:18;
          Mar_7:3; Mar_14:12; Mar_15:6; Mar_15:42; Mar_3:17; Mar_5:41; Mar_7:11;
          Mar_7:34; Mar_14:36. The argument from prophecy has not the large
          place here that it has in Matthew.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The style of Mark is more lively than that of Matthew, though not
          as smooth. He delights in using words like εὐθύς or εὐθέως and πολύς
          prefers the use of the present and the imperfect to that of the
          aorist, and often uses the periphrastic εἶναι with a participle
          instead of the finite verb. There are several Latinisms found in his
          Gospel, as κεντυρίων,κορδάντης, κράββατος,πραιτώριον, σπεκουλάτωρ and
          φραγελλοῦν.
        </p>
        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          Just as in the case of Matthew we are entirely dependent on external
          testimony for the name of the author of the second Gospel. And the
          voice of antiquity is unanimous in ascribing it to Mark. The most
          ancient testimony to this effect is that of Papias, who says: “Mark,
          the interpreter of Peter, wrote down carefully all that he
          recollected, though he did not [record] in order that which was either
          said or done by Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor followed
          him; but subsequently, as I have said, [attached himself to] Peter,
          who used to frame his teaching to meet the [immediate] wants [of his
          hearers]; and not as making a connected narrative of the Lords
          discourses. So Mark committed no error, as he wrote down some
          particulars just as he called them to mind. For he took heed to one
          thing—to omit none of the facts that he heard, and to state nothing
          falsely in [his narrative] of them.” Several other church fathers,
          such as Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Jerome,
          Eusebius, e. a., follow in his wake; there is not a dissentient voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot glean a single hint from the Gospel itself as to the
          identity of the author. It may be that the obscure young man who
          followed Jesus in the night of his betrayal. Mar_14:51-52, and who,
          stripped of his garment fled naked in the darkness of night, was the
          author himself. The house of Marks mother was at least in later time a
          rendezvous for the disciples of the Lord, Act_12:12; so that it is not
          improbable that Jesus and his disciples ate the Paschal supper there,
          and that Mark, hearing them depart, left his bed and stole after them.
          This would immediately explain the acquaintance of the author with
          this interesting fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some scholars have expressed doubt as to the identity of Mark, the
          evangelist, and John Mark, the companion of Barnabas and Paul. The
          general consensus of opinion, however, favors thIsa. Proceeding on the
          assumption that this view is correct, we find Mark mentioned first in
          connection with Peter’s deliverance from prison in 44 A. D. After
          leaving the prison walls the apostle went to “the house of Mary, the
          mother of John, whose surname was Mark,” Act_12:12. From the way in
          which Luke introduces his mother we gather that Mark was a well known
          person, when the Acts were written. The fact that Peter calls him his
          son, 1Pe_5:13 naturally leads to the supposition that in his early
          years he had frequent intercourse with the apostle and was through the
          instrumentality of Peter led to a saving knowledge of the truth. He
          was a cousin of Barnabas and hence a Jew, probably even of a priestly
          family, Act_4:36. When Barnabas and Paul set out on their first
          missionary journey, Mark accompanied them until they came to
          Pamphylia, when for some unknown, but as it seems reprehensible
          reason, he turned back. At the beginning of the second missionary
          journey he was minded to accompany the apostles again, but Paul
          positively refused to accept his services. He now accompanied his
          uncle to Cyprus. When we next hear of Mark, about ten years later, he
          is spoken of by Paul as one of those few “fellow-laborers that have
          been a consolation to him,” Col_4:10; Phm_1:24. In his last letter the
          apostle speaks of Mark once more, and in such a laudatory manner as to
          prove that Mark has fully regained his confidence, 2Ti_4:11. The last
          we hear of Mark in Scripture is, when Peter sends the greetings of
          Mark, his son, to the Christians in Asia Minor, 1Pe_5:13. These four
          passages lead us to the following construction of his later history:
          He was with Paul during the apostles first imprisonment at Rome and
          then intended to visit the congregation of Colossae. We have no reason
          to doubt that he carried out this purpose. After Pauls release Mark
          was at Rome with Peter, who in writing to the Christians of Asia Minor
          assumes that they know Mark. Apparently he made another visit to Asia
          Minor, since Paul requests Timothy, 2Ti_4:11 to take Mark with him,
          when he comes to Rome. After the death of Peter he is said to have
          visited Alexandria, where he was the first to found Christian
          churches, and finally died a martyr’s death. This tradition, though
          old, is not without suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems that Mark was “like Peter more a man of action than of deep
          and abiding principle, a man of fervor and enthusiasm rather than of
          persevering effort; but he was transfused by the power of the same
          Christ who transfused Peter into the man of rapid, continued and
          effective effort in the missionary work of the Church.” Gregory, Why
          Four Gospels, p. 163.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relation of Mark to Peter deserves special attention. Scripture
          speaks of this in the two places already mentioned, and tradition
          abundantly testifies to it. Papias says that “Mark was Peters
          interpreter and wrote down carefully all that he recollected.” Clement
          of Alexandria also says that he wrote down the discourses of Peter, as
          he remembered them. Irenaeus, Tertullian and Jerome all style Mark
          “the interpreter of Peter.” Tertullian even says that “the Gospel
          published by Mark may be reckoned Peter’s, whose interpreter he was.”
          And Origen still stronger: “Mark wrote his Gospel according to the
          dictates of Peter.” Similarly Athanasius. All these testimonies agree
          in asserting that Mark was dependent on Peter in writing his Gospel;
          they disagree, however, as to the degree of dependence, some claiming
          merely that Mark recorded what he remembered of Peters preaching, and
          others, that he wrote what Peter dictated. Which representation is the
          true one?
        </p>
        <p>
          The title of the Gospel is against the dictation theory, for if Peter
          had dictated the Gospel, it would in all probability have been called
          by his name, just as the Epistles dictated by Paul are universally
          ascribed to him. On the other hand the autoptic touches in the Gospel
          make it probable that in some parts of his work Mark employed the very
          words of Peter; they also suggest a possible basis for the later
          tradition that Peter dictated to Mark. However, it is not impossible
          that some of the Church fathers accentuated the dependence of Mark on
          Peter unduly, merely to enhance the authority of his work. The true
          relation of the evangelist to the apostle is expressed in the words:
          “Mark was the interpreter (ἑρμηνευτης) of Peter.” This does not mean
          that he accompanied Peter on his missionary journeys as dragoman,
          translating Aramaic discourses into Greek (Davidson), or Greek into
          Latin (Bleek); but that he was Peters scholar and in his Gospel
          interprets i. e. sets forth the doctrine of Peter for those who have
          not heard the apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gospel itself incidentally testifies to the relation in which it
          stands to Peter. There are many touches that indicate first-hand
          knowledge, as in Mar_1:16-20; Mar_1:29; Mar_9:5; 15:54, 72; Mar_16:7.
          Some things found in the other Synoptics are unexpectedly omitted by
          Mark, as Peters walking on the water, Mat_14:29; his appearance in the
          incident of the tribute money, Mat_17:24-27; the statement of Christ
          that He prayed for Peter individually, Luk_22:32; the significant word
          spoken to him as the Rock, Mat_16:18. In other cases his name is
          suppressed, where it is used by Matthew or Luke, as Mat_7:17 cf.
          Mat_15:15; Mat_14:13 cf. Luk_22:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authorship of Mark is quite generally admitted; yet there are
          some, such as Beischlag and Davidson e. a. who deny it. They maintain
          that our present Gospel does not tally with the description of Papias,
          where he says that Mark wrote down the things he heard of Peter “not
          in order.” Wendt supposes that Papias had in mind a series of
          narratives that are embodied in our present Gospel, a sort of
          Urmarkus. But when Papias said that the evangelist wrote “not in
          order,” he did not say anything that is not true of our Mark, for in
          it we do not find things in the order of their occurrence. And in
          ancient literature there is not a single trace of an Urmarkus.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
          1. Readers and Purpose. External testimony enlightens us respecting
          the circle for which the Gospel of Mark was intended; it points to
          Rome and the Romans. Clement of Alexandria says that many of the
          converts of Rome desired of Mark that he should write down the
          discourses of Peter. Jerome also speaks of this “request of the
          brethren at Rome”; and Gregory Nazianzen says: “Mark wrote his Gospel
          for the Italians.” If we now turn to the Gospel itself, we find that
          it was peculiarly adapted to the Romans. They were a strenuous, a very
          active people; Marks Gospel is pre-eminently the Gospel of action, and
          is written in a brisk lively style. The fact that the argument from
          prophecy holds an inferior place in it, and that so many Jewish
          customs and Aramaic words are explained, points away from the Jews;
          while the Latin words contained in the gospel, the reference to the
          Roman manner of divorce, Mar_10:12, the reduction of a coin to the
          Roman quadrans, Mar_12:42, the knowledge of Pilate presupposed in
          Mar_15:1 (cf. Mat_27:1 and Luk_3:1), and the introduction of Simon of
          Cyrene as the father of Alexander and Rufus, Mar_15:21 (cf.
          Rom_16:13),—all point to Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          It stands to reason that the purpose of Mark in writing stood in the
          closest relation to the circle of readers for whom he intended his
          Gospel. It is certainly true, as Zahn asserts, that his intention was
          to record the beginning (ἀρχή) of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, i. e.
          the beginning of its preaching and of its course; but he has this in
          common with the other Synoptics; it is nothing distinctive (cf. p. 58
          above). The theory of Hilgenfeld and Davidson, following Baur, that
          the Gospel of Mark was written to conciliate the two opposing parties
          of the apostolic age, the Petrine and the Pauline, and therefore
          carefully avoids the exclusivism of Matthew as well as the
          universalism of Luke can only be sustained by the most forced and
          artificial interpretations. Neither does the gospel support the view
          of Weiss, that it was written at a time, when the hope of Christ’s
          second coming was on the decline, and intended to show that the
          Messianic character of Jesus mission was sufficiently attested by His
          earthly life. Mark’s aim was simply to record the gospel narrative
          without any special dogmatic aim, but to do this in such a manner as
          would be most suitable for the Romans, the busy Romans, the people of
          action. Hence he places special emphasis on the acts of Christ. For
          those who loved conquest and admired heroism he desired to picture
          Christ as the mighty Conqueror that overcame sin and all its
          consequences, yea even death itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. As to the time when Mark wrote his Gospel the
          witness of the early Church is not unanimous. Irenaeus says that after
          the death of Peter and Paul Mark wrote down what he had heard Peter
          preach. Clement of Alexandria places the composition of the Gospel
          before the death of Peter, stating that, when Peter heard of it, “he
          neither obstructed nor encouraged the work.” Jerome informs us that
          Peter “approved and published it in our churches, commanding the
          reading of it by his own authority~” Others say that Peter dictated to
          Mark. The question to be decided is therefore, whether Mark wrote
          before or after the death of Peter. It is generally assumed that the
          testimony of Irenaeus is the most trustworthy. It is possible that
          some of the later Church fathers insisted on Marks having written the
          Gospel during the life of Peter, in order to clothe it with apostolic
          authority. Zahn would harmonize the testimony of the fathers by
          assuming that Mark began his work before and finished it after the
          death of the apostle; and that Peter on hearing of Mark’s venture at
          first said nothing regarding it; then, seeing a part of the work,
          rejoiced in it; and still later, when it had almost reached its
          perfect form, sanctioned it, Einl. II p. 203.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning to the Gospel itself, we find that it contains no positive
          evidence as to the time of its composition. Some inferred from
          Mar_13:24 as compared with Mat_24:29 that it was written after the
          destruction of Jerusalem, the evangelist being conscious of the lapse
          of a certain period between that catastrophe and the day of Christ’s
          return. But the foundation is too slender for the conclusion. With
          greater probability others infer from Mar_13:14, “let him that readeth
          understand,” that the destruction of the city was still a matter of
          expectation. This seems to follow also from Marks utter silence
          regarding that calamity. The probable conclusion is therefore that the
          year 70 A. D. is the terminus ad quem for the composition of this
          Gospel. From Col_4:10 we may infer that it was written after 62 A. D.,
          for if Paul had known Mark as an evangelist, he would most likely have
          introduced him as such. A place of still greater importance is
          2Pe_1:15. “Yea I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able
          after my decease to call these things to remembrance.” Here Peter
          seems to promise that there will be a record of his preaching after
          his demise. We would therefore date the Gospel between 67 and 70 A. D.
          Davidson without good reasons places it in the beginning of the second
          century, about 125 A. D. Regarding the grounds for his position, (1)
          that in this Gospel belief in the divinity of Christ is more
          pronounced than in the first century; and (2) that the word εὐαγγέλιον
          is used in a sense foreign to the apostolic age, we merely remark that
          they are both unproved assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The testimony of the fathers points, almost without a dissenting
          voice, to Rome as the place, where Mark composed his gospel.
          Chrysostom, however, testifies that “Mark wrote in Egypt at the
          request of the believers there. But in another statement he admits
          that he really knows nothing about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Method. Augustine called Mark “the abridger of Matthew,” assuming
          that the second Gospel was an abbreviated compilation from the first.
          This theory has since been defended by several scholars of the
          Tubingen school, but is now abandoned. The general features of the
          Gospel do not bear out that view. Zahn finds that Mark based his
          Gospel both on the oral communications of Peter and on the Hebrew
          Matthew, Einl. II p. 322. Davidson denies the originality and priority
          of the Gospel by making it depend to a great extent on Matthew and
          Luke, Introd. I p. 478. Salmon finds throughout the Gospel many
          evidences of the priority and independence of Mark, but believes that
          in other places he is, with Matthew and Luke, dependent on a common
          source, Introd. p. 155. The prevalent opinion at present is that Marks
          Gospel was prior to the other two, though, at least according to some,
          he may have employed the εὐαγγέλιον of Matthew. But in order to
          maintain this priority its defenders have resorted to such artificial
          and unlikely theories that they in part defeated their own purpose.
          The theory of an Urmarkus has been broached, but found little
          acceptance. The opinion of Dr. Arthur Wright that we must distinguish
          between a proto-, a deutero- and a trito Mark, a distinction applied
          to oral tradition by him, is now by others applied to written
          documents. Cf. Holdsworth, Gospel Origins p. 108.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here again the great difference of opinion proves that it is quite
          impossible to trace in all details the origin of the material found in
          this Gospel. The great objection to several of the theories propounded
          is that they seek to account for the origin of Mark in a too
          mechanical way. We may be certain of two things: (1) that Mark derived
          the greatest part of his material from the preaching of Peter that had
          gradually assumed a definite shape in his mind; and (2) that he has
          recorded partly the ipsissima verba of Peter (except for the
          occasional change of we into they), and partly merely the substance of
          the apostles κήρυγμα in a form and with interpretations of his own.
          For the rest of his material he probably depended on the Hebrew
          original of Matthew.
        </p>
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          The integrity of the Gospel of Mark is generally maintained, with the
          exception, however, of the last twelve verses, regarding which there
          is a great difference of opinion. The critical camp of the past
          century is just about equally divided, although at present the tide is
          somewhat against these verses. The reasons for rejecting them are both
          external and internal. These verses are wanting in the two oldest and
          most valuable manuscripts, viz, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. Eusebius
          and Jerome and a few others state that they were wanting in almost all
          the Greek copies of the gospels of their time. It is possible,
          however, that the testimony of Jerome and the rest resolves itself
          into that of Eusebius. This is all but certain with respect to that of
          Jerome, as even Davidson admits. They are wanting also in the
          important MS. k, representing the African text of the old Latin
          Version, which has another and shorter conclusion, like that in MS. L.
          They are also absent from some of the best MSS. of the Armenian
          Version. Then the style of this section is abrupt and sententious, not
          graphic like that of the rest of the Gospel. It makes the impression
          of a collection of brief notices, extracted from larger accounts and
          loosely combined. Its phraseology is also peculiar. Thus πρώτῃ
          σαββάτου, verse 9 is used instead of ἡ μία τῶν σαββάτου as in
          Mar_16:2. The verb πορεύεσθαι, which occurs three times in this
          section, is not found in the body of the Gospel. Neither is the word
          θεᾶσθαι, Mar_16:11; Mar_16:14. Another unique feature is the use of ὁ
          κύριος as a designation of Christ, Mar_6:19-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          These verses have also found ardent defenders, however, among whom
          especially Dean Burgon must be named, though he is perhaps a little
          too positive. In his work on, “The last Twelve Verses of the Gospel
          according to Mark,” he put up an able defense. The authenticity of
          this section is favored by the following considerations: It is found
          in most of the uncial MSS. and in all the cursives, though some of
          these mark it with an asterisk, or indicate that it was absent in
          older copies. Moreover its absence from Aleph and B looks somewhat
          suspicious. It is also incorporated in most of the ancient Versions,
          of which the Itala, the Curatorian and Peshito Syriac, and the Coptic
          are older than any of our Greek codices. All the existing Greek and
          Syriac lectionaries, as far as they have now been examined, contain
          these verses. Irenaeus quotes the 19th verse as a part of the Gospel
          of Mark. Justin Martyr too in all probability testifies to the
          authenticity of these verses. And several of the later fathers, such
          as Epiphanius, Ambrose and Augustine certainly quote from them. And as
          far as internal evidence is concerned, it seems very unlikely that
          Mark would end his Gospel with the words ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ without
          recording a single appearance of the Lord. Moreover these verses
          contain too many peculiarities to be a forgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot delay to discuss the causes for the variation of the MSS,
          nor to review the different conclusions to which scholars have come as
          to the extent of Marks Gospel. They who wish to study the subject can
          do so in the work of Burgon, in the Introductions of Guericke and
          Salmon and in Urquharts New Biblical Guide VII, where this section is
          defended; and in the work of Westcott and Hort, “The New Testament in
          Greek,” and in the Introductions of Reuss, Weiss, Davidson and Zahn,
          who reject it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to us that the ground offered for the rejection of these
          verses by external testimony is rather slender and uncertain, while
          the internal evidence is weighty indeed. In view of it we are inclined
          to accept one of two possible conclusions: either that Mark himself
          added these verses some time after he had written his Gospel, possibly
          culling his material from Matthew and Luke; or that someone else wrote
          them to complete the work. The latter is favored by the Armenian
          Gospel that was written in 986 and was discovered by F. C. Conybeare
          in 1891, and which has the superscription above this section: “Of the
          Presbyter Ariston.” In either case we see no reason, however, to doubt
          the canonicity of this part of Marks Gospel, though some have
          attempted to make this suspicious especially by pointing to the
          unlikely (?) miracles of Mar_16:17-18. Cf. Luk_10:19.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Though the external testimony to the canonicity of Mark’s Gospel is
          not so abundant as that for the Gospel of Matthew, yet it is
          sufficient to establish this beyond a shadow of doubt. It is quoted by
          at least two of the apostolic fathers, by Justin Martyr and by the
          three great witnesses of the end of the second century, Irenaeus,
          Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian, and is referred to as a part of
          the Word of God by several others. We find no expressions of doubt in
          the early Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The special purpose of this Gospel in the canon is to show us Christ
          in his divine power, destroying the works of Satan, and conquering sin
          and death. More than other Gospels it places prominently before us the
          work of Christ in behalf of those that are bound by the shackles of
          Satan and are suffering the consequences of sin. We here see the Lion
          out of the tribe of Judah, conquering and ever to conquer. Mark is the
          only one of the evangelists that speaks of the future Kingdom of God
          as coming with power, 9:1. In that way this Gospel has special
          significance for the Church of all ages. It gives her the blessed
          assurance that her future is entrusted to One who has shown himself a
          mighty Conqueror, and who is abundantly able to save to the uttermost
          all who believe in Him.
