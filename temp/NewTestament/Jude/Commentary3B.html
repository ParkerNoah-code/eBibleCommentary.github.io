            Ver 8.
            <em
              >Yet in the same way, these also in their dreaming defile the
              flesh, despise authority, and slander celestial beings.</em

            <em
              >Yet in the same way, these also in their dreaming defile the
              flesh</em
            >. Which may be literally understood, either of the Jewish doctors,
            who pretended to be interpreters of dreams, as R. Akiba, R. Lazar,
            and others n; or of the false teachers in the apostle's time, and of
            their filthy dreams, and nocturnal pollutions in them; which sense
            the Arabic and Ethiopic versions confirm; the former rendering the
            words thus, "so these retiring in the time of sleep, defile their
            own flesh"; and the latter thus, "and likewise these, who in their
            own sleep, pollute their own flesh"; as also of their pretensions to
            divine assistance and intelligence by dreams; and likewise may be
            figuratively understood of them; for false doctrines are dreams, and
            the teachers of them dreamers, Jeremiah 23:25, as are all those
            doctrines of men that oppose the trinity of persons in the Godhead;
            that contradict the deity and sonship of Christ; that depreciate any
            of his offices; that lessen the glory of the person and grace of the
            Spirit; that cry up the purity, power, and righteousness of human
            nature, and are contrary to the free grace of God. These arise from
            the darkness of the understanding, and a spirit of slumber upon
            them; are the fictions of their own brain, and of their roving
            imagination; are illusory and deceitful, and are in themselves
            vanities, and like dreams pass away. And the dreamers of these
            dreams may be said to "defile the flesh"; since they appear to
            follow and walk after the dictates of corrupt nature; and because by
            their unclean practices, mentioned in the preceding verse, they
            defile the flesh, that is, the body: all sin is of a defiling
            nature, and all men are defiled with it; but these were notoriously
            so; and often so it is, that unclean practices follow upon erroneous
            principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Despise authority</em>. Either the government of the world by
            God, denying or speaking evil of his providence; the Ethiopic
            version renders it, "they deny their own God", either his being, or
            rather his providence; or the dominion and kingly power of Christ,
            to which they cared not to be subject; or rather civil magistracy,
            which they despised, as supposing it to be inconsistent with their
            Christian liberty, and rejected it as being a restraint on their
            lusts; choosing rather anarchy and confusion, that they might do as
            they pleased, though magistracy is God's ordinance, and magistrates
            are God's representatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And slander celestial beings</em>. This is to be understood
            either of angels, those glorious creatures, called thrones,
            dominions, c. or ecclesiastical governors, who are set in the first
            and highest place in the church, and are the glory of the churches
            or else civil magistrates, as before, who are the higher powers, and
            sit in high places of honour and grandeur. False teachers are
            injurious to themselves, disturbers of churches, and pernicious to
            civil government.

              arguing about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him an
              abusive condemnation, but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>But Michael, the archangel</em>. By whom is meant, not a created
            angel, but an eternal one, the Lord Jesus Christ; as appears from
            his name Michael, which signifies, "who is as God": and who is as
            God, or like unto him, but the Son of God, who is equal with God?
            and from his character as the archangel, or Prince of angels, for
            Christ is the head of all principality and power; and from what is
            elsewhere said of Michael, as that he is the great Prince, and on
            the side of the people of God, and to have angels under him, and at
            his command, Daniel 10:21. So Philo the Jew o calls the most ancient
            Word, firstborn of God, the archangel; Uriel is called the archangel
            in this passage from the Apocrypha:
          </p>
          <p>
            "And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer, and
            said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for he hath
            weighed the world in the balance.'' (2 Esdras 4:36).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >When contending with the devil and arguing about the body of
              Moses</em
            >. Which some understand literally of the fleshly and natural body
            of Moses, buried by the Lord himself, partly out of respect to him;
            and partly, as some think, lest the Israelites should be tempted to
            an idolatrous worship of him; but rather it was to show that the law
            of Moses was to be abolished and buried by Christ, never to rise
            more: and they think that this dispute was either about the burying
            of his body, or the taking of it up again; Satan on the one hand
            insisting upon the taking of it up, in order to induce the
            Israelites to worship him, and Michael, on the other hand, opposing
            it, to prevent this idolatry; but then the difficulty is, where Jude
            should have this account, since the Scriptures are silent about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some have thought that he took it out of an apocryphal book, called
            "the Ascension of Moses", as Origen p, which is not likely; others,
            that he had it by tradition, by which means the Apostle Paul came by
            the names of the Egyptian magicians Jannes and Jambres; and some
            passages are referred to in some of their writings q, as having some
            traces of this dispute; but in them the discourse is not concerning
            the body, but the soul of Moses; not concerning burying or taking up
            of his body, when buried, but concerning the taking away of his
            soul, when he was alive; which none of the angels caring to
            undertake, at length Samael, the chief of devils, did, but without
            success, wherefore God took it away with a kiss himself: besides,
            the apostle produces this history as a thing well known; nor is it
            reasonable to suppose that such an altercation should be between
            Michael, and the devil, on such an account; or that it was in order
            to draw Israel into idolatry on the one hand, and on the other hand
            to prevent it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since never was the custom of the Israelites to worship their
            progenitors or heroes; nor did they seem so well disposed to Moses
            in his lifetime; nor was there any necessity of taking up his body,
            were they inclined to give him honour and worship; yea, the sight of
            his dead body would rather have prevented than have encouraged it:
            but this is to be understood figuratively; and reference is had to
            the history in Zechariah 3:1; as appears from the latter part of
            this verse: some think the priesthood of Christ is intended, which
            was the end, the sum and substance, of the law of Moses; and seeing
            that Joshua, the high priest, was a type of Christ, and the angel of
            the Lord contended with Satan about him, he might be said to dispute
            with him about the body of Moses; but this sense makes a type of a
            type, and Christ to contend about himself; besides, this should
            rather be called the body of Christ than of Moses, others think that
            the temple of the Jews is meant about the rebuilding of which the
            contention is thought to be; and which may be called the body of
            Moses, as the church is called the body of Christ; though it should
            be observed, that the temple is never so called, and that not the
            place where the church meets, but the church itself, is called the
            body of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is best of all to understand it of the law of Moses, which is
            sometimes called Moses himself, John 5:45; and so the body of Moses,
            or the body of his laws, the system of them; just as we call a
            system of laws, and of divinity, such an one's body of laws, and
            such an one's body of divinity: and this agrees with the language of
            the Jews, who say r, of statutes, service, purification, c. that
            they are גופי התורה, "the bodies of the law" and so of Misnic
            treatises, as those which concern the offerings of turtle doves, and
            the purification of menstruous women, that they are גופי, "the
            bodies" of the traditions s, that is, the sum and substance of them:
            so the decalogue is said t to be "the body of the Shema", or "Hear,
            O Israel", Deuteronomy 6:4, so Clemens of Alexandria u says, that
            there are some who consider the body of the Scriptures, the words
            and names, as if they were, το σωμα του μωσεως, "the body of Moses"
            w. Now the law of Moses was restored in the time of Joshua the high
            priest, by Ezra and Nehemiah. Joshua breaks some of these laws, and
            is charged by Satan as guilty, who contended and insisted upon it
            that he should suffer for it; so that this dispute or contention
            might be said to be about the body of Moses, that is, the body of
            Moses's law, which Joshua had broken; in which dispute Michael, or
            the angel of the Lord, even the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation</em>. That
            is, not that he was afraid of the devil, but though he could have
            given harder words, or severer language, and which the other
            deserved, yet he chose not to do it, he would not do it; in which
            sense the word "durst", or "dare", is used in Romans 5:7.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”</em> For thy malice and
            insolence; see Zechariah 3:2; and this mild and gentle way of using
            even the devil himself agrees with Christ's conduct towards him,
            when tempted by him in the wilderness, and when in his agony with
            him in the garden, and amidst all his reproaches and sufferings on
            the cross. And now the argument is from the greater to the lesser,
            that if Christ, the Prince of angels, did not choose to give a
            railing word to the devil, who is so much inferior to him, and when
            there was so much reason and occasion for it; then how great is the
            insolence of these men, that speak evil of civil and ecclesiastical
            rulers, without any just cause at all?

            Which may more particularly refer to dignities, Judges 1:8; either
            angels, who are little known, and not at all, but by revelation, and
            yet were blasphemed, or evil spoken of by these men; either by
            ascribing too much to them, as the creation of the world; or by
            saying such things of them, as were below, and unworthy of them, as
            their congress with women, c. or civil magistrates these men were
            ignorant of the nature, use, and end, of magistracy and civil
            government, and so treated it with contempt; or the ministers of the
            Gospel, whose usefulness was not known, at least not acknowledged by
            them, and so became the object of their scorn and reproach: or it
            may refer more generally to the Scriptures, which false teachers are
            ignorant of, and yet speak evil of; either by denying them to be the
            Word of God, or by putting false glosses on them; and so to the
            several parts of the Scriptures, as to the law, the nature, use, and
            end of which they are not acquainted with; and therefore blaspheme
            it, by not walking according to it, or by denying it to be of God,
            and to be good, or by making the observance of it necessary to
            justification and salvation; and also to the Gospel, the doctrines
            and ordinances of it, which they speak evil of, despise and reject,
            not knowing the nature, value, and design of them.

            impaired, a natural knowledge of God, and of things natural, civil,

            both their souls and bodies, and so shall be destroyed, and perish
            in their corruption.
