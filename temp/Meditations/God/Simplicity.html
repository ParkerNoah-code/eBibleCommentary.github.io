        <h2>God is Simple</h2>
        <p>
          Divine simplicity posits that God is without parts, indivisible, and
          unified. It contrasts with the idea of God being composite rather than
          complex. God's simplicity means He has no composition or parts,
          including physical parts, form and matter, essence, and attributes.
          This doctrine affirms that God cannot be divided, and His attributes
          are not separable entities or properties like physical
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          While simplicity implies no parts or divisions, it does not exclude
          the possibility of distinguishable aspects in God's nature, such as
          the attributes or persons of the Trinity. Biblical passages reveal
          God’s essence through various attributes (e.g., God is spirit, light,
          and love). Despite the plurality of attributes, there is a profound
          unity in God’s nature, suggesting a complex but unified essence.
          Everything in God is God, and there is nothing in God that does not
          include all His attributes. For example, God’s love is inherently
          holy, His knowledge unchanging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scriptural references, such as Deuteronomy 4:15-16, John 4:24, Luke
          24:39, and Exodus 3:14, along with traditional theological
          interpretations, support the notion of God’s simplicity. This doctrine
          is linked to divine independence, infinity, and creation. The biblical
          approach to God's simplicity emphasizes His personal relationship with
          us, contrasting with the abstract nature of scholastic philosophy. God
          relates to us as a whole person, not just as a collection of
          attributes.
        </p>
        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <p>
          If God were composed of parts, He would depend on those parts,
          contradicting His nature as the most fundamental being. Divine
          simplicity implies that all divine attributes are essentially one and
          identical with His essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          It implies God’s immutability (unchangeability), omnipotence
          (all-powerful), and omniscience (all-knowing). This doctrine also
          suggests that God, being simple, does not change over time or space,
          is self-existent (aseity), and is always in a state of pure action
          (pure act). This steers us away from envisioning God as a being
          possessing qualities in the way creatures do, and instead invites us
          to contemplate a God who, in His very nature, is the embodiment of all
          His attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is especially relevant in understanding the nature of the Trinity,
          suggesting that each Person of the Trinity encompasses the whole
          divine essence. It emphasizes that each person of the Trinity (Father,
          Son, and Holy Spirit) is fully and completely God, not a fractional
          part of God. The incarnation of Christ does not contradict divine
          simplicity. While Jesus Christ, in His human nature, experienced
          change, His divine nature did not change.
