        <h2>Its Instrument</h2>
        "Being justified freely by His grace" (Romans 3:24); "being now
        justified by His blood" (Romans 5:9); "being now justified by faith"
        (Romans 5:1). A full exposition of the doctrine of justification
        requires that each of these propositions should be interpreted in their
        Scriptural sense, and that they be combined together in their true
        relations as to form one harmonious whole. Unless these three
        propositions be carefully distinguished there is sure to be confusion;
        unless all the three are steadily borne in mind we are sure to land in
        error. Each must be given its due weight, yet none must be understood in
        such a way as to make its force annul that of the others. Nor is this by
        any means a simple task, in fact none but a real teacher (that is, a
        spiritual theologian) who has devoted a lifetime to the undivided study
        of Scriptures is qualified for it. "The righteousness of God which is by
        faith of Jesus Christ" (Romans 3:22); "A man is justified by faith
        without the deeds of the law" (Romans 3:28); "even we have believed in
        Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not
        by the works of the law" (Galatians 2:16). What is the precise place and
        influence which faith has in the important affairs of justification?
        What is the exact nature or character of justifying faith? In what
        particular sense are we to understand this proposition that we are
        "justified by faith"? and what is the connection between that
        proposition and the postulates that we are "justified by grace" and
        "justified by Christ's blood"? These are matters which call for the
        utmost care. The nature of justifying faith requires to be closely
        defined so that its particular agency is correctly viewed, for it is
        easy to make a mistake here to the prejudice of Christ's honor and
        glory, which must not be given to another—no, not to faith itself. Many
        would-be teachers have erred at this point, for the common tendency of
        human nature is to arrogate to itself the glory which belongs alone to
        God. While there have been those who rejected the unscriptural notion
        that we can be justified before God by our own works, yet not a few of
        these very men virtually make a Savior of their own faith. Not only have
        some spoken of faith as though it were a contribution which God requires
        the sinner to make toward his own salvation—the last mite which was
        necessary to make up the price of his redemption; but others (who
        sneered at theologians and boasted of their superior understanding of
        the things of God) have insisted that faith itself is what constitutes
        us righteous before God, He regarding faith as righteousness. A
        deplorable example of what we have just mentioned is to be found in the
        comments made upon Romans 4 by Mr. J.N. Darby, the father of the
        Plymouth Brethren: "This was Abraham's faith. He believed the promise
        that he should be the father of many nations, because God had spoken,
        counting on the power of God, thus glorifying Him, without calling in
        question anything that He had said by looking at circumstances;
        therefore this also was counted to him for righteousness. He glorified
        God according to what God was. Now this was not written for his sake
        alone: the same faith shall be imputed to us also for righteousness"
        ("Synopsis" vol. 4, p. 133—italics ours). The Christ-dishonoring error
        contained in those statements will be exposed later on in this chapter.
        "How does faith justify a sinner in the sight of God? Answer: Faith
        justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other
        graces which do always accompany it, nor of good works that are the
        fruits of it, nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were
        imputed to him for justification; but only as it is an instrument by
        which he receives and applies Christ and His righteousness" (Westminster
        Confession of Faith). Though this definition was framed upwards of two
        hundred and fifty years ago, it is far superior to almost anything found
        in current literature on the subject. It is more accurate to speak of
        faith as the "instrument" rather than as the condition, for a
        "condition" is generally used to signify that for the sake whereof a
        benefit is conferred. Faith is neither the ground nor the substance of
        our justification, but simply the hand which receives the divine gift
        offered to us in the gospel. What is the precise place and influence
        which faith has in the important affair of justification? Romanist
        answer, It justifies us formally, not relatively: that is, upon the
        account of its own intrinsic value. They point out that faith is never
        alone, but "works by love" (Gal 5:6), and therefore its own excellency
        merits acceptance at God's hand. But the faith of the best is weak and
        deficient (Luke 17:5), and so could never satisfy the law, which
        requires a flawless perfection. If righteousness was given as a reward
        for faith, its possessor would have cause for boasting, expressly
        contrary to the apostle in Romans 3:26, 27. Moreover, such a method of
        justification would entirely frustrate the life and death of Christ,
        making His great sacrifice unnecessary. It is not faith as a spiritual
        grace which justifies us, but as an instrument—the hand which lays hold
        of Christ. In connection with justification, faith is not to be
        considered as a virtuous exercise of the heart, nor as a principle of
        holy obedience: "Because faith, as concerned in our justification, does
        not regard Christ as King, enacting laws, requiring obedience, and
        subduing depravity; but as a Substitute, answering the requirements of
        the divine law, and as a Priest expiating sin by His own death on the
        cross. Hence, in justification we read of 'precious faith... through the
        righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ' (2 Peter 1:1) and of
        'faith in His blood' (Romans 3:25), and believers are described as
        'receiving the atonement' and 'receiving the gift of righteousness'
        (Romans 5:11, 17). Therefore it is evident that faith is represented as
        having an immediate regard to the vicarious work of Christ, and that it
        is considered not under the notion of exercising virtue or of performing
        a duty, but of receiving a free gift" (A. Booth). What is the relation
        of faith to justification? The Arminian answer to the question, refined
        somewhat by the Plymouth Brethren, is, that the act of believing is
        imputed to us for righteousness. One error leads to another. Mr. Darby
        denied that Gentiles were ever under the law, hence he denied also that
        Christ obeyed the law in His people's stead, and therefore as Christ's
        vicarious obedience is not reckoned to their account, he had to seek
        elsewhere for their righteousness. This he claimed to find in the
        Christian's own faith, insisting that their act of believing is imputed
        to them "for righteousness." To give his theory respectability, he
        clothed it in the language of several expressions found in Romans 4,
        though he knew quite well that the Greek afforded no foundation whatever
        for that which he built upon it. In Romans 4 we read "his faith is
        counted for righteousness" (verse 5), "faith was reckoned to Abraham for
        righteousness" (verse 9), "it was imputed to him for righteousness"
        (verse 22). Now in each of these verses the Greek preposition is "His"
        which never means "in the stead of," but always signifies "towards, in
        order to, with a view to": it has the uniform force of "unto." Its exact
        meaning and force is unequivocally plain in Romans 10:10, "with the
        heart man believes unto ("His") righteousness": that is, the believing
        heart reaches out toward and lays hold of Christ Himself. "This passage
        (Romans 10:10) may help us to understand what justification by faith is,
        for it shows that righteousness there comes to us when we embrace God's
        goodness offered to us in the gospel. We are then, for this reason, made
        just: because we believe that God is propitious to us through Christ"
        (J. Calvin). The Holy Spirit has used the Greek prepositions with
        unerring precision. Never do we find Him employing "His" in connection
        with Christ's satisfaction and sacrifice in our room and stead, but only
        "anti" or "huper," which means in lieu of. On the other hand, "anti" and
        "huper" are never used in connection with our believing, for faith is
        not accepted by God in lieu of perfect obedience. Faith must either be
        the ground of our acceptance with God, or the means or instrument of our
        becoming interested in the true meritorious ground, namely, the
        righteousness of Christ; it cannot stand in both relations to our
        justification. "God justifies, not by imputing faith itself, the act of
        believing, but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ"
        (Westminster Catechism). That faith itself cannot be the substance or
        ground of our justification is clear from many considerations. The
        "righteousness of God (that is, the satisfaction which Christ rendered
        to the law) is revealed to faith" (Romans 1:17) and so cannot be faith
        itself. Romans 10:10 declares "with the heart man believes unto
        righteousness" so that righteousness must be a distinct thing from
        believing. In Jeremiah 23:6 we read "The LORD our righteousness," so
        faith cannot be our righteousness. Let not Christ be dethroned in order
        to exalt faith: set not the servant above the master. "We acknowledge no
        righteousness but what the obedience and satisfaction of Christ yields
        us: His blood, not our faith; His satisfaction, not our believing it, is
        the matter of justification before God" (J. Flavel). What alterations
        are there in our faith! what minglings of unbelief at all times! Is this
        a foundation to build our justification and hope upon? Perhaps some will
        say, Are not the words of Scripture expressly on Mr. Darby's side? Does
        not Romans 4:5 affirm "faith is counted for righteousness"? We answer,
        Is the sense of Scripture on his side? Suppose I should undertake to
        prove that David was cleansed from guilt by the "hyssop" which grows on
        the wall: that would sound ridiculous. Yes; nevertheless, I should have
        the express words of Scripture to support me: "Purge me with hyssop, and
        I shall be clean" (Psalm 51:7). Yet clear as those words read, they
        would not afford me the least countenance imaginable from the sense and
        spirit of God's Word. Has the hyssop—a worthless shrub—any kind of
        fitness to stand in the stead of the sacrificial blood, and make an
        atonement for sin? No more fitness has faith to stand in the stead of
        Christ's perfect obedience, to act as our justifying righteousness, or
        procure our acceptance with God! An apology is really due many of our
        readers, for wasting their time with such puerilities, but we ask them
        to kindly bear with us. We hope it may please God to use this chapter to
        expose one of Mr. Darby's many grievous errors. For "grievous" this
        error most certainly is. His teaching that the Christian's faith,
        instead of the vicarious obedience of Christ, is reckoned for
        righteousness (Mr. W. Kelly, his chief lieutenant, wrote "his
        [Abraham's] faith in God's word as that which he exercised and which was
        accounted as righteousness"—see chapter 5) makes God guilty of a
        downright lie, for it represents Him as giving to faith a fictitious
        value—the believer has no righteousness, so God regards his poor faith
        as "righteousness." "And he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to
        him for righteousness" (Genesis 15:6). The one point to be decided here
        is: was it Abraham's faith itself which was in God's account taken for
        righteousness (horrible idea!), or, was it the righteousness of God in
        Christ which Abraham's faith prospectively laid hold of? The comments of
        the apostle in Romans 4:18-22 settle the point decisively. In these
        verses Paul emphasizes the natural impossibilities which stood in the
        way of God's promise of a numerous offspring to Abraham being fulfilled
        (the genital deadness both of his own body and Sarah's), and on the
        implicit confidence he had (notwithstanding the difficulties) in the
        power and faithfulness of God that He would perform what He promised.
        Hence, when the apostle adds, "Therefore it was imputed to him for
        righteousness" (verse 22), that "therefore" can only mean: Because
        through faith he completely lost sight of nature and self, and realized
        with undoubting assurance the sufficiency of the divine arm, and the
        certainty of its working. Abraham's faith, dear reader, was nothing more
        and nothing else than the renunciation of all virtue and strength in
        himself, and a hanging in childlike trust upon God for what He was able
        and willing to do. Far, very far, indeed, was his faith from being a
        mere substitute for a "righteousness" which he lacked. Far, very far was
        God from accepting his faith in lieu of a perfect obedience to His law.
        Rather was Abraham's faith the acting of a soul which found its life,
        its hope, its all in the Lord Himself. And that is what justifying faith
        is: it is "simply the instrument by which Christ and His righteousness
        are received in order to justification. It is emptiness filled with
        Christ's fullness; impotency lying down upon Christ's strength" (J.L.
        Girardeau). "The best obedience of my hands Dares not appear before Your
        throne; But faith can answer Your demands, By pleading what my Lord has
        done." What is the relation of faith to justification? Antinomians and
        hyper-Calvinists answer, Merely that of comfort or assurance. Their
        theory is that the elect were actually justified by God before the
        foundation of the world, and all that faith does now is to make this
        manifest in their conscience. This error was advocated by such men as W.
        Gadsby, J. Irons, James Wells, J.C. Philpot. That it originated not with
        these men is clear from the fact that the Puritans refuted it in their
        day. "By faith alone we obtain and receive the forgiveness of sins; for
        notwithstanding any antecedent act of God concerning us in and for
        Christ, we do not actually receive a complete soul-freeing discharge
        until we believe" (J. Owen). "It is vain to say I am justified only in
        respect to the court of mine own conscience. The faith that Paul and the
        other apostles were justified by, was their believing on Christ that
        they might be justified (Galatians 2:15, 16), and not a believing they
        were justified already; and therefore it was not an act of assurance"
        (T. Goodwin, vol. 8). How are we justified by faith? Having given a
        threefold negative answer: not by faith as a joint cause with works
        (Romanists), not by faith as an act of grace in us (Arminians), not by
        faith as it receives the Spirit's witness (Antinomians); we now turn to
        the positive answer. Faith justifies only as an instrument which God has
        appointed to the apprehension and application of Christ's righteousness.
        When we say that faith is the "instrument" of our justification, let it
        be clearly understood that we do not mean faith is the instrument with
        which God justifies, but the instrument whereby we receive Christ.
        Christ has merited righteousness for us, and faith in Christ is that
        which renders it meet in God's sight the purchased blessing be assigned.
        Faith unites to Christ, and being united to Him we are possessed of all
        that is in Christ, so far as is consistent with our capacity of
        receiving and God's appointment in giving. Having been made one with
        Christ in spirit, God now considers us as one with Him in law. We are
        justified by faith, and not for faith; not because of what faith is, but
        because of what it receives. "It has no efficacy of itself, but as it is
        the band of our union with Christ. The whole virtue of cleansing
        proceeds from Christ the object. We receive the water with our hands,
        but the cleansing virtue is not in our hands, but in the water, yet the
        water cannot cleanse us without our receiving it; our receiving it
        unites the water to us, and is a means whereby we are cleansed. And
        therefore is it observed that our justification by faith is always
        expressed in the passive, not in the active: we are justified by faith,
        not that faith justifies us. The efficacy is in Christ's blood; the
        reception of it is in our faith" (S. Charnock). Scripture knows no such
        thing as a justified unbeliever. There is nothing meritorious about
        believing, yet it is necessary in order to justification. It is not only
        the righteousness of Christ as imputed which justifies, but also as
        received (Romans 5:11, 17). The righteousness of Christ is not mine
        until I accept it as the Father's gift. "The believing sinner is
        'justified by faith' only instrumentally, as he 'lives by eating' only
        instrumentally. Eating is the particular act by which he receives and
        appropriates food. Strictly speaking, he lives by bread alone, not by
        eating, or the act of masticating. And, strictly speaking, the sinner is
        justified by Christ's sacrifice alone, not by his act of believing in
        it" (W. Shedd). In the application of justification faith is not a
        builder, but a beholder; not an agent, but an instrument; it has nothing
        to do, but all to believe; nothing to give, but all to receive. God has
        not selected faith to be the instrument of justification because there
        is some peculiar virtue in faith, but rather because there is no merit
        in it: faith is self-emptying—"Therefore it is of faith that it might be
        by grace" (Romans 4:16). A gift is seen to be a gift when nothing is
        required or accepted of the recipient, but simply that he receive it.
        Whatever other properties faith may possess, it is simply as receiving
        Christ that it justifies. Were we said to be justified by repentance, by
        love, or by any other spiritual grace, it would convey the idea of
        something good in us being the consideration on which the blessing was
        bestowed; but justification by faith (correctly understood) conveys no
        such idea. "Faith justifies in no other way than as it introduces us
        into a participation of the righteousness of Christ" (J. Calvin).
        Justifying faith is a looking away from self, a renouncing of my own
        righteousness, a laying hold of Christ. Justifying faith consists,
        first, of a knowledge and belief of the truth revealed in Scripture
        thereon; second, in an abandonment of all pretense, claim or confidence
        in our own righteousness; third, in a trust in and reliance upon the
        righteousness of Christ, laying hold of the blessing which He purchased
        for us. It is the heart's approval and approbation of the method of
        justification proposed in the gospel: by Christ alone, proceeding from
        the pure grace of God, and excluding all human merits. "In the LORD have
        I righteousness and strength" (Isaiah 45:24). None will experimentally
        appreciate the righteousness of Christ until they have been
        experimentally stripped by the Spirit. Not until the Lord puts us in the
        fire and burns off our filthy rags, and makes us stand naked before Him,
        trembling from head to foot as we view the sword of His justice
        suspended over our heads, will any truly value "the best robe." Not
        until the condemning sentence of the law has been applied by the Spirit
        to the conscience does the guilty soul cry, "Lost, lost!" (Romans 7:9,
        10). Not until there is a personal apprehension of the requirements of
        God's law, a feeling sense of our total inability to perform its
        righteous demands, and an honest realization that God would be just in
        banishing us from His presence forever, is the necessity for a precious
        Christ perceived by the soul.
