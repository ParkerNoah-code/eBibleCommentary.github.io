        <h2>Its Results</h2>
        <p>
          The justification of the believer is absolute, complete, final.
          &quot;It is God that justifies&quot; (Romans 8:33), and &quot;I know
          that, whatever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to
          it, nor anything taken from it&quot; (Ecclesiastes 3:14). So absolute
          and inexorable is this blessed fact that, in Romans 8:30 we are told,
          &quot;Whom He justified, them He also glorified&quot;: notice it is
          not simply a promise that God &quot;will glorify,&quot; but so sure
          and certain is that blissful event, the past tense is used. &quot;Them
          He also glorified&quot; is speaking from the standpoint of the eternal
          and unalterable purpose of God, concerning which there is no
          conditionality or contingency whatever. To be &quot;glorified&quot; is
          to be perfectly conformed to the lovely image of Christ, when we shall
          see Him as He is and be made like Him (1 John 3:2). Because God has
          determined this, He speaks of it as already accomplished, for He
          &quot;calls those things which be not as though they were&quot;
          (Romans 4:17). So far as the believer is concerned, the penal side of
          the sin question has been settled once and for all. His case has been
          tried in the supreme court, and God has justified him: in consequence
          thereof the divine decision is &quot;There is therefore now no
          condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus&quot; (Romans 8:1).
          Once those very persons were under condemnation—&quot;condemned
          already&quot; (John 3:18); but now that their faith has united them to
          Christ there is no condemnation. The debt of their sin has been paid
          by their great Surety; the record thereof has been &quot;blotted
          out&quot; by His cleansing blood. &quot;It is God that justifies. Who
          is he who condemns&quot; (Romans 8:33, 34).
        </p>
        <p>
          Who will reverse His decision! Where is that superior tribunal to
          which this cause can be carried? Eternal justice has pronounced her
          fiat; immutable judgment has recorded her sentence. It is utterly and
          absolutely impossible that the sentence of the Divine Judge should
          ever be revoked or reversed. His sentence of justification results
          from and rests upon a complete satisfaction having been offered to His
          law, and that in the fulfillment of a covenant engagement. Thus is
          effectually precluded the recall of the verdict. The Father stipulated
          to release His elect from the curse of the law provided the Son would
          meet the claims of justice against them. The Son freely complied with
          His Father&#x27;s will: &quot;Lo, I come.&quot; He was now made under
          the law, fulfilled the law, and suffered the full penalty of the law;
          therefore shall He see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied.
          Sooner shall the lightenings of omnipotence shiver the Rock of Ages
          than those sheltering in Him again be brought under condemnation. How
          very, very far from the glorious truth of the gospel is the mere
          conditional pardon which Arminians represent God as bestowing upon
          those who come to Christ—a pardon which may be rescinded, yes, which
          will be canceled, unless they &quot;do their part&quot; and perform
          certain stipulations! What a horrible and blasphemous travesty of the
          Truth is that!—an error which must be steadfastly resisted no matter
          who holds it: better far to hurt the feelings of a million of our
          fellow-creatures than to displease their august Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          On no such precarious basis as our fulfilling certain conditions has
          God suspended the justification of His people. Not only is there
          &quot;now no condemnation&quot; resting upon the believer, but there
          never again shall me, for &quot;Blessed is the man to whom the Lord
          will not impute sin&quot; (Romans 4:8). The dread sentence of the law,
          &quot;You shall surely die,&quot; cannot in justice be executed upon
          the sinner&#x27;s Surety and also upon himself. Hence by a necessity
          existing in the very nature of moral government, it must follow that
          the believing sinner be freed from all condemnation, that is, so
          cleared of the same that he is raised above all liability to
          punishment. So declared our blessed Savior Himself, in words too plain
          and emphatic to admit of any misunderstanding: &quot;Truly, truly, I
          say unto you, He who hears My word, and believes on Him that sent Me,
          has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is
          passed from death unto life&quot; (John 5:24). He, the habitation of
          whose throne is &quot;justice and judgment,&quot; has sealed up this
          declaration forever, by affirming &quot;I will never leave you nor
          forsake you.&quot; Sooner shall the sword of justice cleave the helmet
          of the Almighty than any divinely pardoned soul perish. But not only
          are the sins of all who truly come to Christ eternally remitted, but
          the very righteousness of the Redeemer passes over to them, is placed
          upon them, so that a perfect obedience to the law is imputed to their
          account. It is theirs, not by promise, but by gift (Romans 5:17), by
          actual bestowment. It is not simply that God treats them as if they
          were righteous, they are righteous and so pronounced by Him. And
          therefore may each believing soul exclaim, &quot;I will greatly
          rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He has
          clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the
          robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments,
          and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels&quot; (Isaiah 61:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          O that each Christian reader may be enabled to clearly and strongly
          grasp hold of this glorious fact: that he is now truly righteous in
          the sight of God, is in actual possession of an obedience which
          answers every demand of the law. This unspeakable blessing is bestowed
          not only by the amazing grace of God, but it is actually required by
          His inexorable justice. This too was stipulated and agreed upon in the
          covenant into which the Father entered with the Son. That is why the
          Redeemer lived here on earth for upwards of thirty years before He
          went to the cross to suffer the penalty of our sins: He assumed and
          discharged our responsibilities; as a child, as a youth, as a man, He
          rendered unto God that perfect obedience which we owed Him. He
          &quot;fulfilled all righteousness&quot; (Matthew 3:15) for His people,
          and just as He who knew no sin was made sin for them, so they are now
          made &quot;the righteousness of God in Him&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:21).
          And therefore does Jehovah declare, &quot;For the mountains shall
          depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart
          from you, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed, says the
          LORD that has mercy on you&quot; (Isaiah 54:10). By actually believing
          with a justifying faith the sinner does receive Christ Himself, is
          joined to Him, and becomes immediately an heir of God and joint-heir
          with Christ. This gives him a right unto and an interest in the
          benefits of His mediation. By faith in Christ he received not only the
          forgiveness of sins, but an inheritance among all them that are
          sanctified (Acts 26:18), the Holy Spirit (given to him) being
          &quot;the earnest of our inheritance&quot; (Ephesians 1:13, 14). The
          believing sinner may now say &quot;in the LORD have I
          righteousness&quot; (Isaiah 45:24). He is &quot;complete in Him&quot;
          (Colossians 2:10), for by &quot;one offering&quot; the Savior has
          &quot;perfected forever them that are sanctified&quot; (Hebrews
          10:14). The believer has been &quot;accepted in the Beloved&quot;
          (Ephesians 1:6), and stands before the throne of God arrayed in a
          garment more excellent than that which is worn by the holy angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          How infinitely does the glorious gospel of God transcend the
          impoverished thoughts and schemes of men! How immeasurably superior is
          that &quot;everlasting righteousness&quot; which Christ has brought in
          (Daniel 9:24) from that miserable thing which multitudes are seeking
          to produce by their own efforts. Greater far is the difference between
          the shining light of the midday sun and the blackness of the darkest
          night, than between that &quot;best robe&quot; (Luke 15:22) which
          Christ has wrought out for each of His people and that wretched
          covering which zealous religionists are attempting to weave out of the
          filthy rags of their own righteousness. Equally great is the
          difference between the truth of God concerning the present and
          immutable standing of His saints in all the acceptability of Christ,
          and the horrible perversion of Arminians who make acceptance with God
          contingent upon the believer&#x27;s faithfulness and perseverance, who
          suppose that Heaven can be purchased by the creature&#x27;s deeds and
          doings. It is not that the justified soul is now left to himself, so
          that he is certain of getting to Heaven no matter how he conducts
          himself—the fatal error of Antinomians. No Indeed. God also imparts to
          him the blessed Holy Spirit, who works within him the desire to serve,
          please, and glorify the One who has been so gracious to Him. &quot;The
          love of Christ constrains us... that they which live should not
          henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them, and
          rose again&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:14, 15). They now &quot;delight in
          the law of God after the inward man&quot; (Romans 7:22), and though
          the flesh, the world, and the Devil oppose every step of the way,
          occasioning many a sad fall—which is repented of, confessed, and
          forsaken—nevertheless the Spirit renews them day by day (2 Corinthians
          4:16) and leads them in the paths of righteousness for Christ&#x27;s
          name&#x27;s sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last paragraph will be found the answer to those who object
          that the preaching of justification by the imputed righteousness of
          Christ, apprehended by faith alone, will encourage carelessness and
          foster licentiousness. Those whom God justifies are not left in their
          natural condition, under the dominion of sin, but are quickened,
          indwelt, and guided by the Holy Spirit. As Christ cannot be divided,
          and so is received as Lord to rule us as well as Savior to redeem us,
          so those whom God justifies He also sanctifies. We do not affirm that
          all who receive this blessed truth into their heads have their lives
          transformed thereby—no indeed; but we do insist that where it is
          applied in power to the heart there always follows a walk to the glory
          of God, the fruits of righteousness being brought forth to the praise
          of His name. Each truly justified soul will say:
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Let worldly minds the world pursue,</p>
        <p>It has no charms for me;</p>
        <p>I once admired its trifles too,</p>
        <p>But grace has set me free!&quot;</p>
        <p>
          It is therefore the bounden duty of those who profess to have been
          justified by God to diligently and impartially examine themselves, to
          ascertain whether or not they have in them those spiritual graces
          which always accompany justification. It is by our sanctification, and
          that alone, that we may discover our justification. Would you know
          whether Christ fulfilled the law for you, that His obedience has been
          imputed to your account? Then search your heart and life and see
          whether a spirit of obedience to Him is daily working in you. The
          righteousness of the law is fulfilled only in those who &quot;walk not
          after the flesh, but after the Spirit&quot; (Romans 8:4). God never
          designed that the obedience of His Son should be imputed to those who
          live a life of worldliness, self-pleasing, and gratifying the lusts of
          the flesh. Far from it: &quot;If any man be in Christ, he is a new
          creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become
          new&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:17). Summarizing now the blessed results of
          justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The sins of the believer are forgiven. &quot;Through this Man is
          preached unto you the forgiveness of sins. And by Him all that believe
          are justified from all things&quot; (Acts 13:38, 39). All the sins of
          the believer, past, present, and to come, were laid upon Christ and
          atoned for by Him. Although sins cannot be actually pardoned before
          they are actually committed yet their obligation unto the curse of the
          law were virtually remitted at the Cross, antecedently to their actual
          commission. The sins of Christians involve only the governmental
          dealings of God in this life, and these are remitted upon a sincere
          repentance and confession.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. An inalienable title unto everlasting glory is bestowed. Christ
          purchased for His people the reward of blessing of the law, which is
          eternal life. Therefore does the Holy Spirit assure the Christian that
          he has been begotten &quot;to an inheritance incorruptible, and
          undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in Heaven for you&quot;
          (1 Peter 1:4). Not only is that inheritance reserved for all the
          justified, but they are all preserved unto it, as the very next verse
          declares, &quot;who are kept by the power of God through faith unto
          salvation ready to be revealed in the last time&quot; (verse
          5)—&quot;kept&quot; from committing the unpardonable sin, from
          apostatizing from the truth, from being fatally deceived by the Devil;
          so &quot;kept&quot; that the power of God prevents anything separating
          them from His love in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:35-38).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Reconciliation unto God Himself. &quot;Therefore being justified by
          faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ... we were
          reconciled to God by the death of His Son&quot; (Romans 5:1, 10).
          Until men are justified they are at war with God, and He is against
          them, being &quot;angry with the wicked every day&quot; (Psalm 7:11).
          Dreadful beyond words is the condition of those who are under
          condemnation: their minds are enmity against God (Romans 8:7), all
          their ways are opposed to Him (Colossians 1:21). But at conversion the
          sinner throws down the weapons of his rebellion and surrenders to the
          righteous claims of Christ, and by Him he is reconciled to God.
          Reconciliation is to make an end of strife, to bring together those at
          variance, to change enemies into friends. Between God and the
          justified there is peace—effected by the blood of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. An unalterable standing in the favor of God. &quot;Therefore being
          justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
          Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
          we stand&quot; (Romans 5:1, 2). Mark the word &quot;also&quot;: not
          only has Christ turned away the wrath of God from us, but in addition
          He has secured the benevolence of God toward us. Previous to
          justification our standing was one of unutterable disgrace, but now,
          through Christ, it is in one of unclouded grace. God now has naught
          but good-will toward us. God has not only ceased to be offended at us,
          but is well-pleased with us; not only will He never afflict punishment
          upon us, but He will never cease to shower His blessings upon us. The
          throne to which we have free access is not one of judgment, but of
          pure and unchanging grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Owned by God Himself before an assembled universe. &quot;But I say
          unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
          account thereof in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be
          justified&quot; (Matthew 12:36, 37): yes, justified publicly by the
          Judge Himself! &quot;These shall go away into everlasting punishment:
          but the righteous into life eternal&quot; (Matthew 25:46). Here will
          be the final justification of the Christian, this sentence being
          declaratory unto the glory of God and the everlasting blessedness of
          those who have believed. Let it be said in conclusion that the
          justification of the Christian is complete the moment he truly
          believes in Christ, and hence there are no degrees in justification.
          The Apostle Paul was as truly a justified man at the hour of his
          conversion as he was at the close of his life. The feeblest babe in
          Christ is just as completely justified as is the most mature saint.
          Let theologians note the following distinctions. Christians were
          decretively justified from all eternity: efficaciously so when Christ
          rose again from the dead; actually so when they believed; sensibly so
          when the Spirit bestows joyous assurance; manifestly so when they
          tread the path of obedience; finally so at the Day of Judgment, when
          God shall sententiously, and in the presence of all created things,
          pronounce them so.
