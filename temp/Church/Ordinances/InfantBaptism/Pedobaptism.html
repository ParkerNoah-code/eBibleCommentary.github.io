        <p>To my Pedobaptist brethren:</p>
        <p>
          Will you not here pause, and with the Bible in your hand, prayerfully
          re-examine this whole subject? You may have never, at any time, given
          it a careful investigation. Many have found it in their Church, and
          feeling, very naturally, a prejudice in favor of whatever she
          approves, and observes, received and adopted it. And since then have
          practiced the rite under a sort of indefinite impression that,
          although with no clearness how, it is defensible by the word of God.
          This, I know, is the position occupied by thousands. Those who do not
          design to depart from the gospel. Least of all is it imagined by those
          who practice infant baptism that it would be committing an injury in
          any way. The enormous evil it brings upon the parents, children, the
          church, and the world is a great fact to which your attention needs to
          be called.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may still regard it with favor because it is observed by your
          church; because great men practice, and defend it; because it is a
          time-honored practice which has come down to you through a period of
          fifteen centuries; and because you have thought that "If it does no
          good, it will do no harm!" But great men, as great, and as good, as
          any that have defended, and practiced infant baptism, have also
          defended, and practiced, all the corruptions of Popery. If on this
          account you receive infant baptism, you are obliged, for the same
          reasons, to receive all the corruptions of Popery.
        </p>
        <p>
          That, too, is a time-honored institution, clothed with the sanction of
          more than twelve centuries. High position, great learning, and
          venerableness can never give authority to any thing which is in itself
          false, and injurious. Ours is neither the age, nor the country, nor is
          religion the subject, in which such arguments can be respected.
          Because our fathers were governed by kings, and emperors, who, as they
          were taught by great, and good, men, "ruled by divine right," shall we
          be monarchists? We choose in politics, to exercise our own judgment,
          and we reject as baseless, all these antiquated pretensions. Shall we
          be less wise in religion? Here, too, we will look not to men, but to
          God; not to antiquity, but to divine revelation. Our appeal is, "to
          the law, and to the testimony. If we speak not according to these, it
          is because there is no light in us."
        </p>
        <p>List of reasons to reject infant baptism:</p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason1.html">1.</a> Its practice is unsupported by the word
          of God.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason2.html">2.</a> Its defense leads to injurious
          perversions of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason3.html">3.</a> It engrafts Judaism upon the gospel of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason4.html">4.</a> It falsifies the doctrine of universal
          depravity.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason5.html">5.</a> The doctrines upon which it is
          predicated contradict the great fundamental principle of justification
          by faith.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason6.html">6.</a> It is in direct conflict with the
          doctrine of the work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason7.html">7.</a> It despoils the church of those peculiar
          qualities which are essential to the church of Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason8.html">8.</a> Its practice perpetuates the
          superstitions that originally produced it.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason9.html">9.</a> It subverts the scripture doctrine of
          infant salvation.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason10.html">10.</a> It leads its advocates into rebellion
          against the authority of Christ.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason11.html">11.</a> The connection it assumes with the
          moral and religious training of children.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason12.html">12.</a> It is the grand foundation upon which
          rests the union of church and state.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason13.html">13.</a> It leads to religious persecutions.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason14.html">14.</a> It is contrary to the principles of
          civil and religious freedom.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason15.html">15.</a> It enfeebles the power of the church
          to combat error.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason16.html">16.</a> It injures the credit of religion with
          reflecting men of the world.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason17.html">17.</a> It is the great barrier to Christian
          union.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason18.html">18.</a> It prevents the salutary impression
          which baptism was designed to make upon the minds both of those who
          receive it, and of those who witness its administration.
        </p>
        <p class="hangingindent">
          <a href="Reason19.html">19.</a> It retards the designs of Christ in
          the conversion of the world.
