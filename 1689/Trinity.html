        <p style="color: red">Who Is God? (Part 1)</p>

        <p>
          The statement begins with the assertion that God is "one only living
          and true God," citing 1 Corinthians 8:4, 6, and Deuteronomy 6:4. This
          claim emphasizes monotheism, directly opposing polytheistic systems
          like those of ancient pagan cultures, as well as modern religious
          pluralism. Monotheism is a core foundation of Judeo-Christian
          theology, portraying God as the singular source of all reality and
          truth. It reflects the unity and exclusivity of God's nature as both
          "living" (active, not an abstract principle) and "true" (authentic, in
          contrast to false gods or idols).
        </p>

        <p>
          When it states that God’s "subsistence is in and of Himself" (Jeremiah
          10:10; Isaiah 48:12), the confession addresses God's self-existence or
          aseity. This means God depends on no one and nothing for His being,
          unlike all created things. This doctrine is a key distinction between
          Creator and creature, countering systems like pantheism or process
          theology, which might imply God is contingent or changes over time.
          The idea of God as "infinite in being and perfection" reinforces this:
          His attributes are boundless, incomparable, and perfectly realized,
          challenging any human tendency to limit God to finite categories.
        </p>

        <p>
          The assertion that God's "essence cannot be comprehended by any but
          Himself" (Exodus 3:14) highlights His incomprehensibility. This
          doesn’t mean God cannot be known at all, but rather that human
          understanding of God is always partial and mediated by revelation.
          Systems like rationalism, which claim full apprehension of divine
          realities through human reason alone, are implicitly critiqued here.
          Instead, God’s self-revelation, such as in the burning bush ("I AM WHO
          I AM"), underscores His transcendence and mysterious nature.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">God as Spirit and Immortality</p>

        <p>
          The description of God as a "most pure spirit, invisible, without
          body, parts, or passions" (John 4:24; 1 Timothy 1:17; Deuteronomy
          4:15-16) contrasts sharply with anthropomorphic or idolatrous views of
          deity. This aligns with Jesus’ teaching in John 4:24, which affirms
          God's nature as spirit and emphasizes the need for worship in "spirit
          and truth." The absence of "body, parts, or passions" speaks to the
          doctrine of divine simplicity, meaning God is not composed of parts
          nor subject to emotional fluctuations. This doctrine refutes notions
          of God being changeable or influenced by external forces, as seen in
          certain pagan or open theist conceptions of deity. The affirmation of
          His immortality and dwelling in "light unapproachable" underscores His
          utter transcendence and holiness, distinguishing Him from all created
          things, which are mortal and finite.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Immutability and Eternity</p>

        <p>
          God’s immutability (Malachi 3:6) means He does not change in His
          being, purposes, or promises. This doctrine is vital in reassuring
          believers of the reliability of God's character and covenant. It
          stands against views that suggest God evolves or adapts over time,
          such as process theology. God’s immensity (1 Kings 8:27; Jeremiah
          23:23) and eternity (Psalm 90:2) further highlight His omnipresence
          and timelessness. He is not confined by space or time but exists in
          absolute sovereignty over both. This counters any worldview that would
          limit God to the created order, such as materialism or temporal deism.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">God's Attributes and Moral Perfections</p>

        <p>
          Attributes such as holiness (Isaiah 6:3), wisdom, freedom, and
          omnipotence (Genesis 17:1) emphasize the fullness of God's moral and
          metaphysical perfection. His actions are described as arising from
          "the counsel of His own immutable and most righteous will" (Psalm
          115:3; Isaiah 46:10), affirming God's sovereignty. The idea that all
          things are done "for His own glory" (Proverbs 16:4; Romans 11:36)
          reflects the Reformed tradition’s emphasis on theocentrism, countering
          anthropocentric views that place human desires at the center of God's
          purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, God's love, grace, mercy, patience, and forgiveness
          (Exodus 34:6-7; Hebrews 11:6) reveal His compassionate relationship
          with creation. These attributes counterbalance His justice and wrath
          (Nehemiah 9:32-33; Psalms 5:5-6), ensuring that God's moral perfection
          includes both mercy and judgment. The refusal to "clear the guilty"
          (Exodus 34:7; Nahum 1:2-3) underscores the seriousness of sin and the
          necessity of atonement, a theme central to Christian soteriology.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Engagement with Other Views</p>

        <p>
          Overall, the confession systematically refutes competing theological
          and philosophical systems. It opposes atheism and agnosticism by
          affirming God's existence and self-revelation. It critiques polytheism
          and pantheism by emphasizing monotheism and God's transcendence. The
          assertion of God's immutability and aseity challenges process theology
          and open theism, while divine simplicity rejects any notion of God as
          a composite being or one subject to external influences. Furthermore,
          the confession's emphasis on God's moral perfections and ultimate
          purpose in His own glory challenges human-centered theologies or
          secular worldviews that diminish the gravity of sin or the centrality
          of God's sovereignty.

        <p style="color: red">God's Self-Sufficiency and Independence</p>

        <p>
          The statement begins by affirming that God possesses “all life” (John
          5:26), “glory” (Psalm 148:13), “goodness” (Psalm 119:68), and
          “blessedness” in and of Himself. John 5:26 teaches that the Father has
          “life in himself,” and likewise has granted the Son the same. This
          indicates that God’s life is self-existent, not derived from any
          external source. Unlike created beings, God is independent and
          eternal, which highlights His aseity. Psalm 148:13 glorifies God’s
          name as “excellent” and “above the earth and heaven,” pointing to His
          unmatched splendor and glory. Similarly, Psalm 119:68 declares that
          God is good and does good, showing that His goodness is intrinsic and
          perfect, not contingent upon any external factor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Job 22:2-3 supports this self-sufficiency by asking rhetorically if
          man can profit God or if God’s gain depends on human righteousness.
          The implied answer is no—God needs nothing from His creatures. This
          refutes any theology or worldview that suggests God depends on
          creation for fulfillment, as found in some pagan systems or modern
          relational theologies that emphasize mutual dependence between God and
          creation.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">God as the Source and Sovereign Ruler of All</p>

        <p>
          The confession declares God to be “the alone fountain of all being,”
          citing Romans 11:34-36. These verses emphasize that all things come
          from Him, exist through Him, and are for Him. God is both the origin
          and the goal of creation, underscoring His supremacy and
          purposefulness. Daniel 4:25, 34-35 reinforces God’s absolute
          sovereignty, particularly Nebuchadnezzar’s acknowledgment that God’s
          dominion is everlasting and that no one can question His actions or
          resist His will. This demonstrates that God exercises complete
          authority over His creation, not as a distant or passive observer but
          as the active Ruler and Sustainer of all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, the confession emphasizes that God “hath most sovereign
          dominion” to act upon creation “whatsoever Himself pleases.” This
          reflects Psalm 115:3, where it says, “Our God is in the heavens; He
          does all that He pleases.” Such verses affirm God’s freedom and power,
          challenging views that portray God as limited by human free will or
          constrained by the natural order. This has implications for doctrines
          of providence and predestination, underscoring that God’s purposes
          prevail over all contingencies.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">God's Omniscience</p>

        <p>
          The statement that “in His sight all things are open and manifest” is
          grounded in Hebrews 4:13: “And no creature is hidden from His sight,
          but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give
          account.” This emphasizes God’s exhaustive knowledge of all things,
          which is both comforting and sobering. Ezekiel 11:5 similarly declares
          that God knows the thoughts of man, showing His intimate and perfect
          understanding of every aspect of creation. Acts 15:18 speaks of God’s
          works being “known from of old,” pointing to His foreknowledge and
          eternal decrees.
        </p>

        <p>
          The confession refutes the notion that anything is “contingent or
          uncertain” to God. This opposes open theism, which holds that God’s
          knowledge of the future is limited or dependent on human actions.
          Instead, God’s infinite and infallible knowledge assures believers
          that His plans are unchanging and perfectly wise, as Proverbs 19:21
          states: “Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the
          purpose of the Lord that will stand.”
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">God's Holiness and Moral Perfection</p>

        <p>
          God’s holiness is emphasized with the declaration that He is “most
          holy in all His counsels, in all His works, and in all His commands,”
          supported by Psalm 145:17: “The Lord is righteous in all His ways and
          kind in all His works.” This holiness permeates all of God’s actions
          and directives, setting the standard for moral perfection and
          righteousness. His commands, therefore, are not arbitrary but reflect
          His character, inviting creatures to mirror His holiness (Leviticus
          11:44).
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">The Worship Due to God</p>

        <p>
          The confession concludes by asserting that angels and men owe God
          worship, service, and obedience. Revelation 5:12-14 provides a vivid
          scene of universal worship, where every creature declares the
          worthiness of the Lamb to receive “power and wealth and wisdom and
          might and honor and glory and blessing.” This universal acknowledgment
          of God’s sovereignty and worthiness reflects His unique status as
          Creator and Redeemer. The statement challenges idolatry and human
          pride, reminding believers that God alone is worthy of absolute
          allegiance and devotion.
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, this section of the confession draws deeply from Scripture
          to affirm God’s self-sufficiency, sovereignty, omniscience, holiness,
          and the worship due to Him. These attributes place God in stark
          contrast to finite, contingent beings and reject views that diminish
          His glory or independence. The confession calls believers to awe,
          reverence, and obedience, grounded in the recognition of God’s
          unparalleled majesty and authority.

        <h2>3. What Is the Trinity?</h2>
        <p>
          In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, the
          Father, the Word or Son, and Holy Spirit,<sup>27</sup> of one
          substance, power, and eternity, each having the whole divine essence,
          yet the essence undivided:<sup>28</sup> the Father is of none, neither
          begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the
          Father;<sup>29</sup> the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and
          the Son;<sup>30</sup> all infinite, without beginning, therefore but
          one God, who is not to be divided in nature and being, but
          distinguished by several peculiar relative properties and personal
          relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our
          communion with God, and comfortable dependence on Him.

        <p style="color: red">What Is the Trinity?</p>

        <p>
          This section articulates the doctrine of the Trinity, emphasizing the
          unity and distinction within the Godhead as revealed in Scripture. It
          asserts that the one divine Being subsists in three persons—the
          Father, the Son (referred to as the Word), and the Holy Spirit—who
          share the same essence while maintaining distinct relational
          properties.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Three Persons in One Divine Being</p>

        <p>
          The statement begins by describing the "three subsistences" (persons)
          in the one "divine and infinite Being," drawing from passages like 1
          John 5:7, which mentions the Father, the Word, and the Spirit as
          bearing witness in heaven, and Matthew 28:19, which commands baptism
          in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These
          passages affirm both the plurality of persons and the unity of the
          divine name, pointing to the indivisibility of God’s essence despite
          the distinct persons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each person possesses "the whole divine essence, yet the essence
          undivided." This statement aligns with the Athanasian Creed, which
          declares that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit
          is God, yet there are not three Gods, but one God. This reflects the
          scriptural truth that God is one in essence (Deuteronomy 6:4, “The
          Lord our God, the Lord is one”) while also affirming the tri-personal
          nature of God as revealed in texts like 2 Corinthians 13:14, where
          Paul mentions the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and
          the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.

        <p style="color: red">Eternal Distinctions within the Godhead</p>

        <p>
          The confession distinguishes the persons of the Trinity by their
          "peculiar relative properties and personal relations." The Father is
          "of none," meaning He is unbegotten and the source within the Trinity.
          The Son is "eternally begotten of the Father," as John 1:14 declares,
          "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His
          glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father." Similarly, John 1:18
          speaks of the Son as "the only God, who is at the Father’s side,"
          underscoring His eternal relationship with the Father.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Holy Spirit is described as "proceeding from the Father and the
          Son." This procession is rooted in passages like John 15:26, where
          Jesus says, "But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from
          the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, He will
          bear witness about Me." Galatians 4:6 complements this by identifying
          the Spirit as "the Spirit of His Son," revealing the Spirit’s
          relational connection to both the Father and the Son.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Unity and Distinction in God</p>

        <p>
          While the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct in their
          relations, they are united in substance, power, and eternity. Each
          person is fully God, possessing all divine attributes, yet there is no
          division or separation in the divine essence. John 14:11 captures this
          unity when Jesus says, “I am in the Father and the Father is in me,”
          illustrating the oneness of their essence and operation. Similarly,
          Exodus 3:14 ("I AM WHO I AM") emphasizes God’s indivisible
          self-existence, which applies equally to all three persons of the
          Trinity.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unity distinguishes the Christian doctrine of God from tritheism,
          which posits three separate gods, and modalism, which denies the
          distinct persons of the Trinity by claiming God merely appears in
          different modes at different times. By holding that the persons are
          distinct yet one in being, the confession aligns with the biblical
          testimony and the historic orthodox faith as defined by the early
          church councils, such as Nicea (AD 325) and Constantinople (AD 381).
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">The Practical Importance of the Trinity</p>

        <p>
          The confession concludes by emphasizing that the doctrine of the
          Trinity is the foundation of "all our communion with God, and
          comfortable dependence on Him." This is profoundly practical:
          believers experience fellowship with the Father through the Son in the
          power of the Holy Spirit. For example, Ephesians 2:18 states, "For
          through Him [the Son] we both have access in one Spirit to the
          Father," demonstrating how the triune God works in unison to bring
          believers into communion with Himself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, this doctrine assures believers of God's sufficiency and
          eternal love. The eternal relationship between the Father and the Son
          (John 17:24) and the Spirit’s role in applying God’s love to our
          hearts (Romans 5:5) reveal a God who is self-sufficient in His
          relational being and extends that perfect fellowship to His people.
          This gives believers a firm foundation for worship, trust, and
          obedience, knowing that the triune God is both transcendent and
          personally involved in their redemption and sanctification.
