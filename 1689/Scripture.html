  <h1>Chapter 1. Of the Holy Scriptures</h1>
  <h2>1. Purpose of the Bible</h2>
  <p>
    The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of
    all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.<sup>1</sup> Although the light
    of nature, and the works of creation and providence do so far manifest the
    goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men inexcusable; yet are
    they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and his will which is
    necessary unto salvation.<sup>2</sup> Therefore it pleased the Lord at
    sundry times and in divers manners to reveal himself, and to declare that
    his will unto his church;<sup>3</sup> and afterward for the better
    preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment
    and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the
    malice of Satan, and of the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing;
    which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of
    God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.<sup>4</sup>

    inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life.<sup>5</sup>
  </p>
  <p>5. 2 Timothy 3:16</p>
  <h2>3. The Apocrypha</h2>
  <p>
    The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no
    part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are of no
    authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use
    of than other human writings.<sup>6</sup>
  </p>
  <p>6. Luke 24:27, 44; Romans 3:2</p>
  <h2>4. Biblical Authority</h2>
  <p>
    The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed,
    dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God
    (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received
    because it is the Word of God.<sup>7</sup>
  </p>
  <p>7. 2 Peter 1:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9</p>
  <h2>5. Proofs of Divine Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to an high
    and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the
    matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the majesty of the style, the
    consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory
    to God), the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, and
    many other incomparable excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are
    arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God;
    yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
    truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy
    Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup>8</sup>
  </p>
  <p>8. John 16:13-14; 1 Corinthians 2:10-12; 1 John 2:20, 27</p>
  <h2>6. Biblical Sufficiency</h2>
  <p>
    The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory,
    man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down or necessarily
    contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be
    added, whether by new revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup
      >9</sup
    >
    Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to
    be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in
    the Word,<sup>10</sup> and that there are some circumstances concerning the
    worship of God, and government of the church, common to human actions and
    societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian
    prudence, according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be
    observed.<sup>11</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    9. 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Galatians 1:8-9
    <br />10. John 6:45; 1 Corinthians 2:9-12 <br />11. 1 Corinthians 11:13-14;
    1 Corinthians 14:26,40
  </p>
  <h2>7. Clarity of the Bible</h2>
  <p>
    All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear
    unto all;<sup>12</sup> yet those things which are necessary to be known,
    believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in
    some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the
    unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient
    understanding of them.<sup>13</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    12. 2 Peter 3:16
    <br />13. Psalms 19:7; Psalms 119:130
  </p>
  <h2>8. Bible Translation</h2>
  <p>
    The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the people of
    God of old),<sup>14</sup> and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time
    of the writing of it was most generally known to the nations), being
    immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept
    pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so as in all controversies of
    religion, the church is finally to appeal to them.<sup>15</sup> But because
    these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a
    right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of
    God to read,<sup>16</sup> and search them,<sup>17</sup> therefore they are
    to be translated into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they
    come,<sup>18</sup> that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they
    may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of
    the Scriptures may have hope.<sup>19</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    14. Romans 3:2
    <br />15. Isaiah 8:20 <br />16. Acts 15:15 <br />17. John 5:39 <br />18. 1
    Corinthians 14:6, 9, 11-12, 24, 28 <br />19. Colossians 3:16
  </p>
  <h2>9. Scripture interprets Scripture</h2>
  <p>
    The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself;
    and therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any
    Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched by other
    places that speak more clearly.<sup>20</sup>
  </p>
  <p>20. 2 Peter 1:20-21; Acts 15:15-16</p>
  <h2>10. Sola Scriptura</h2>
  <p>
    The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be
    determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers,
    doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose
    sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by
    the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally
    resolved.<sup>21</sup>
  </p>
  <p>21. Matthew 22:29, 31-32; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23</p>
