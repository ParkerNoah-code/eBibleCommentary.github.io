        <h2>1. The Bible Is Infallible, Sufficient, and Necessary</h2>
        <p>
          The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible
          rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.<sup>1</sup>
          Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence
          do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave
          men inexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of
          God and his will which is necessary unto salvation.<sup>2</sup>
          Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners to
          reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church;<sup
            >3</sup
          >
          and afterward for the better preserving and propagating of the truth,
          and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against
          the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the
          world, to commit the same wholly unto writing; which maketh the Holy
          Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God&#x27;s
          revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>

          The Holy Scripture as the Rule of Saving Knowledge, Faith, and
          Obedience
        </p>
        <p>
          The opening declaration establishes the primacy and sufficiency of the
          Holy Scriptures in theological discourse. This assertion is rooted in
          2 Timothy 3:15-17, which highlights the divine inspiration of
          Scripture, equipping the believer for every good work. By positioning
          the Scriptures as the "only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule,"
          the text eliminates competing claims to ultimate authority, such as
          tradition or private revelation, emphasizing the necessity of a
          definitive and objective source for salvific truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine reflects the Reformation's "sola scriptura" principle,
          countering medieval reliance on church tradition or magisterial
          pronouncements as co-equal with Scripture. In this context,
          "sufficient" refers to the ability of Scripture to provide all
          knowledge necessary for salvation, "certain" underscores its
          reliability, and "infallible" affirms that it is free from error in
          its teaching on faith and obedience.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Role of General Revelation</p>
        <p>
          The text acknowledges the reality and value of general revelation
          through "the light of nature, and the works of creation and
          providence." This echoes Romans 1:19-21 and Psalms 19:1-3, which
          assert that God's attributes—His power, wisdom, and goodness—are
          evident in creation. General revelation renders humanity "inexcusable"
          for failing to recognize God's existence and attributes. However, it
          is deemed insufficient for a saving knowledge of God. This
          insufficiency points to the limitations of natural theology: while it
          may lead to a recognition of God's existence, it cannot unveil His
          redemptive purposes or provide the detailed knowledge of His will
          required for salvation.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          Progressive Revelation and the Necessity of Scripture
        </p>
        <p>
          The affirmation that God revealed Himself "at sundry times and in
          divers manners" (Hebrews 1:1) highlights the progressive nature of
          divine revelation. God’s self-disclosure unfolded through various
          historical events, prophetic utterances, and personal encounters,
          culminating in the advent of Christ and the apostolic testimony. This
          progressive revelation ensured that God's people received knowledge
          suited to their time and context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase "for the better preserving and propagating of the truth"
          identifies the practical necessity of committing revelation to
          writing. The Scriptures serve as a safeguard against the distortions
          of human memory, cultural corruption, and satanic deception. By
          inscribing His will, God provided His church with an enduring,
          authoritative record to anchor faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Cessation of Former Modes of Revelation</p>
        <p>
          The concluding assertion, that "those former ways of God's revealing
          his will unto his people being now ceased," reflects a cessationist
          viewpoint. This cessation aligns with the conviction that the canon of
          Scripture is closed, having achieved its purpose in providing the full
          and final revelation of God's will for salvation and life. References
          to Proverbs 22:19-21 and 2 Peter 1:19-20 emphasize the value of the
          written word in offering clarity and certainty, preventing subjective
          or novel claims to divine revelation from undermining the unity and
          authority of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          Scripture’s Role in the Preservation and Comfort of the Church
        </p>
        <p>
          Written Scripture ensures the fidelity and dissemination of divine
          truth amid changing circumstances. Scripture provides a secure
          foundation against threats, including the “corruption of the flesh,
          the malice of Satan, and of the world.” This reflects a high view of
          the church’s dependence on God’s Word for spiritual stability and
          assurance. Proverbs 22:19-21 and Romans 15:4 emphasize Scripture’s
          practical role in offering hope and instruction, highlighting its
          enduring relevance. These texts invite reflection on the
          transformative power of the Word to guide and sustain God’s people
          through every challenge.

        <h2>2. The Books of the Bible</h2>
        <p>
          Under the name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now
          contained all the books of the Old and New Testaments, which are
          these:

        </p>
        <p>5. 2 Timothy 3:16</p>
        <p style="color: red">
          The Canon of Holy Scripture: Definition and Scope
        </p>
        <p>
          The confession delineates the books of the Old and New Testaments as
          the entirety of the "Word of God written," explicitly naming the
          canonical texts. This list establishes the boundaries of Scripture,
          reflecting the Protestant canon that excludes the Apocrypha. This
          exclusivity asserts the sufficiency of these 66 books as the complete
          and authoritative Word of God, rejecting additions or subtractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theologically, the concept of canon (from the Greek kanōn, meaning
          rule or standard) affirms these texts as uniquely inspired and binding
          for faith and practice. The inclusion of both Testaments demonstrates
          the unity of Scripture, asserting that the Old and New are
          complementary, forming a cohesive revelation of God's redemptive
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reliance on 2 Timothy 3:16 (“All Scripture is breathed out by
          God...”) underscores the divine origin of these texts. The term
          "inspiration" (theopneustos) reflects the idea that the Holy Spirit
          superintended the human authors to produce writings that are fully
          divine in authority and fully human in expression, making them
          trustworthy and infallible as the "rule of faith and life."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Old Testament section reflects the Hebrew Scriptures, or the
          Tanakh, recognized by Judaism as authoritative. The list aligns with
          the traditional Protestant enumeration of 39 books, organized by
          subject rather than the tripartite division (Law, Prophets, Writings)
          typical of Jewish tradition. These books provide the foundation for
          Christian theology, including doctrines of creation, covenant, law,
          and prophecy, all of which anticipate the coming of Christ.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Old Testament Canon</p>
        <p>
          The Protestant rejection of the Apocrypha (included in Catholic and
          Orthodox canons) reflects debates during the Reformation about the
          nature of inspiration and the historical use of these texts.
          Protestants viewed the Apocrypha as historically and theologically
          valuable but not divinely inspired or binding. This delineation
          underscores a theology of Scripture that demands rigorous criteria for
          inclusion in the canon, such as apostolic authority, consistency with
          previous revelation, held to by Jesus and Paul, and widespread
          acceptance among the early church.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The New Testament Canon</p>
        <p>
          The New Testament list includes the 27 books universally accepted by
          historic Christianity. The explicit naming of these texts reaffirms
          the early church's recognition of their apostolic origin or direct
          connection to apostolic authority. They provide the doctrinal
          foundation for understanding salvation through Christ and the ethical
          implications of living as His disciples. These writings include:
        </p>
        <p>
          <um>
            <li>
              Gospels: The life, death, and resurrection of Christ as the
              culmination of Old Testament prophecy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Acts: The historical account of the early church’s growth under
              the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Epistles: Doctrinal, ethical, and pastoral instructions for the
              church.
            </li>
            <li>
              Revelation: The apocalyptic vision of Christ’s ultimate victory
              and the consummation of history.
            </li>
          </um>
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Inspiration of Scripture</p>
        <p>
          The section culminates with the affirmation that all these books "are
          given by the inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and life."
          The theological term "rule" signifies that Scripture is the standard
          by which all doctrine, worship, and ethical behavior are judged. This
          statement reflects a rejection of competing authorities, such as
          tradition (while respected, it is not on par with Scripture) or reason
          and experience (valuable but subordinate to the authoritative Word).
        </p>
        <p>The doctrine of inspiration further implies:</p>
        <p>
          <um>
            <li>
              Inerrancy: The Scriptures are free from error in their original
              manuscripts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clarity (perspicuity): The essential truths of Scripture are
              understandable to all believers, though some parts require careful
              study and the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sufficiency: Scripture provides all necessary guidance for
              salvation and Christian living, negating the need for additional
              revelation.
            </li>
          </um>
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Practical and Theological Implications</p>
        <p>The listing of the biblical books serves several key purposes:</p>
        <p>
          <um>
            <li>
              Unity of Doctrine: By specifying the canon, the confession unifies
              the church around a common set of divinely authoritative texts,
              fostering doctrinal and liturgical harmony.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boundary Setting: The exclusion of apocryphal or pseudepigraphal
              works reinforces the necessity of discerning divine inspiration
              and maintaining theological purity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reliance on Scripture: The canon ensures that the church
              continually looks to the Bible as its foundational authority,
              rather than external or subjective sources.
            </li>
          </um>
        </p>
        <h2>3. The Apocrypha Are Not Inspired</h2>
        <p>
          The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration,
          are no part of the canon or rule of the Scripture, and, therefore, are
          of no authority to the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved
          or made use of than other human writings.<sup>6</sup>
        </p>
        <p>6. Luke 24:27, 44; Romans 3:2</p>
        <p style="color: red">The Nature of the Apocrypha</p>
        <p>
          This section firmly denies the Apocrypha’s inclusion in the canon by
          asserting that these books are "not of divine inspiration." The
          Apocrypha, a collection of texts written during the intertestamental
          period, holds a contested place in Christian history. While included
          in the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament) and regarded as
          deuterocanonical in Catholic and Orthodox traditions, they are
          excluded by Protestantism, following Jewish tradition and the early
          church’s understanding of the Hebrew canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Himself, in Luke 24:27 and 44, demonstrates the authority of the
          canonical Old Testament by expounding on "Moses and all the Prophets"
          as pointing to Him. His reference to the Law, Prophets, and Psalms
          (the Writings) reflects the tripartite division of the Hebrew Bible,
          affirming the Jewish canon. This silence on the Apocrypha indicates
          its exclusion from the recognized Scriptures of Jesus’ time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Romans 3:2, Paul highlights that the "oracles of God" were
          entrusted to the Jewish people, reinforcing the Jewish canon as the
          divinely inspired Scriptures. Since the Apocryphal texts were not part
          of this tradition, they are excluded from the category of “oracles.”
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Use of the Apocrypha</p>
        <p>
          The text recognizes the Apocrypha as “human writings,” comparable to
          other historical or philosophical works. This acknowledgment permits
          their use for edification or historical insight but rejects their
          authority for doctrine or as a rule of faith. Examples include their
          insights into Jewish life and thought during the Second Temple period,
          which help contextualize the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, by asserting that the Apocrypha has “no authority to the
          church of God,” the confession establishes a sharp boundary to
          safeguard doctrine. This reflects the Reformation’s concern to anchor
          theological authority solely in the inspired Scriptures,
          distinguishing divine revelation from human traditions.
        </p>
        <h2>4. The Bible is Authoritative Because It Is the Word of God</h2>
        <p>
          The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be
          believed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but
          wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore
          it is to be received because it is the Word of God.<sup>7</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          7. 2 Peter 1:19-21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Source of Scripture’s Authority</p>
        <p>
          This section asserts that the authority of Scripture derives not from
          human testimony or ecclesiastical approval but from its divine
          authorship. The grounding in God, "who is truth itself," underscores
          the objective and inherent nature of Scripture’s authority. Its
          truthfulness and reliability are anchored in the character of God, the
          ultimate source of all truth. This statement reflects the Protestant
          principle of Scripture’s self-authenticating nature (autopistos),
          meaning that it bears the marks of divine inspiration independently of
          external validation.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Scriptural Support</p>
        <p>
          2 Peter 1:19-21: Peter highlights the prophetic word as "more fully
          confirmed," emphasizing that Scripture did not originate in human will
          but was delivered by individuals moved by the Holy Spirit. This divine
          origin ensures its authority and trustworthiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Timothy 3:16: Scripture is "breathed out by God" (theopneustos),
          underscoring its divine origin and practical utility. Its sufficiency
          extends to teaching, reproof, correction, and training in
          righteousness, making it authoritative for all aspects of faith and
          life.

        <h2>5. Reasons We Should Believe the Bible</h2>
        <p>
          We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church of God to
          an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the
          heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, and the
          majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the
          whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full discovery it makes
          of the only way of man&#x27;s salvation, and many other incomparable
          excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it
          doth abundantly evidence itself to be the Word of God; yet
          notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the infallible
          truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the
          Holy Spirit bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.<sup
            >8</sup

        <p style="color: red">The Role of the Church’s Testimony</p>
        <p>
          The section begins by acknowledging that the testimony of the church
          has a significant role in leading believers to esteem the Scriptures
          highly. Historically, the church has preserved, proclaimed, and
          defended the Scriptures, giving witness to their divine origin and
          authority. However, this testimony is not the ultimate basis for
          belief in Scripture’s infallibility; rather, it serves as an external
          and secondary argument that guides believers toward recognizing the
          Bible’s unique status.
        </p>
        <p>
          The theological insight here is critical: while the church’s
          historical witness is important for affirming the canon and providing
          a context for scriptural reception, it does not confer authority upon
          Scripture. Instead, the authority of the Bible is inherent, derived
          from its divine authorship.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Internal Evidence of Scripture’s Divine Origin</p>
        <p>
          The confession identifies several internal qualities of the Bible that
          powerfully demonstrate its divine inspiration. One such quality is the
          <em>heavenliness of the matter</em>, as the Bible’s teachings reflect
          truths that transcend human wisdom, revealing the nature of God, the
          person and work of Christ, and the reality of salvation by grace
          through faith. These doctrines originate from a heavenly source and
          bring about heavenly effects, affirming their divine origin.
          Similarly, the <em>efficacy of the doctrine</em> provides compelling
          evidence of the Bible’s divine nature. Scripture’s transformative
          power is highlighted in passages like Hebrews 4:12, which describes
          the Word’s ability to pierce the heart, convict of sin, and lead to
          repentance and spiritual renewal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another striking characteristic is the
          <em>majesty of the style</em>. The Bible’s literary qualities,
          including its profound simplicity, poetic beauty (as seen in the
          Psalms), and prophetic authority, display an unparalleled majesty that
          suggests divine authorship. The
          <em>consent of all the parts</em> further underscores its supernatural
          origin. Despite being composed over centuries by diverse human
          authors, the Bible exhibits unity and consistency, presenting a
          coherent narrative centered on God’s redemptive plan through Christ.
          This harmony amidst diversity is remarkable and points to the guidance
          of a divine author.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>scope of the whole</em> also testifies to its divine
          inspiration, as the Bible’s ultimate purpose is to glorify God. From
          creation in Genesis to the consummation in Revelation, the Scriptures
          consistently exalt God as sovereign, holy, and merciful, displaying
          His glory in salvation and judgment. Finally, the Bible’s
          <em>discovery of salvation</em> uniquely reveals the "only way of
          man’s salvation"—the gospel of Jesus Christ. Its clarity and
          exclusivity in addressing humanity’s deepest need for reconciliation
          with God affirm its divine origin. These "incomparable excellencies"
          collectively demonstrate that the Bible is not merely a human product
          but the inspired Word of God.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Work of the Holy Spirit</p>
        <p>
          While external arguments and internal evidences of Scripture’s divine
          origin are compelling, the confession emphasizes that "our full
          persuasion and assurance" of its truth and authority ultimately
          depends on the inward work of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit’s role is
          essential in illumination, witness, and the glorification of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Holy Spirit enables believers to understand and accept the truths
          of Scripture. 1 Corinthians 2:10-12 explains that the Spirit reveals
          "the deep things of God" that cannot be comprehended by natural means.
          According to 1 John 2:20, 27, the Spirit teaches and confirms the
          truth of God’s Word in the hearts of believers, giving them an
          anointing to discern divine truth from error. As stated in John
          16:13-14, the Spirit guides believers into all truth and glorifies
          Christ by making Him known through the Word.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Balance of Evidence and Faith</p>
        <p>
          The confession wisely balances external evidence, internal
          characteristics, and the Holy Spirit’s witness. While the testimony of
          the church and the Bible’s intrinsic qualities provide rational and
          historical support, they are insufficient to produce saving faith or
          full assurance on their own. Faith in the Bible as the Word of God
          ultimately depends on the Spirit’s work, which aligns the believer’s
          heart with the truth revealed in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          This balance addresses two potential errors: Rationalism, in
          overemphasizing external or internal evidence at the expense of the
          Spirit’s role. And subjectivism, relying solely on subjective
          spiritual experiences without regard for the objective testimony of
          Scripture’s qualities or the church’s witness.
        </p>
        <h2>6. The Bible Is Sufficient and Complete</h2>
        <p>
          The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own
          glory, man&#x27;s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set
          down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture: unto which
          nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelation of the
          Spirit, or traditions of men.<sup>9</sup> Nevertheless, we acknowledge
          the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the
          saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word,<sup
            >10</sup
          >
          and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God,
          and government of the church, common to human actions and societies,
          which are to be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence,
          according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be
          observed.<sup>11</sup>

        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Sufficiency of the Bible</p>
        <p>
          The confession asserts that the Bible is sufficient and complete,
          containing "the whole counsel of God" concerning all matters necessary
          for His glory, human salvation, faith, and life. This sufficiency
          means that all essential doctrines and moral principles are either
          explicitly stated or necessarily implied within Scripture, leaving no
          need for supplementation through new revelations or human traditions.
          Passages such as 2 Timothy 3:15-17 affirm this claim, declaring
          Scripture to be "profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
          and for training in righteousness," equipping believers for every good
          work. Similarly, Galatians 1:8-9 warns against adding to the gospel,
          underscoring the completeness of God’s revealed Word.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Holy Spirit's Illumination</p>
        <p>
          Despite Scripture's sufficiency, the confession acknowledges the
          necessity of the Holy Spirit’s inward illumination for a saving
          understanding of its truths. This is not a deficiency in the Bible
          itself but rather a recognition of human inability to fully grasp
          divine truths apart from God’s enabling work. Jesus declares in John
          6:45 that "they will all be taught by God," emphasizing the Spirit’s
          role in revealing the Word to believers. Likewise, 1 Corinthians
          2:9-12 highlights that the Spirit searches and reveals the deep things
          of God, making His Word comprehensible and transformative for the
          faithful.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Practical Principles</p>
        <p>
          The confession also addresses practical matters related to church life
          and worship, acknowledging that Scripture does not provide detailed
          instructions for every circumstance. Instead, some aspects of worship
          and church governance, which are common to all human societies, are to
          be ordered by the light of nature and Christian prudence. These must
          always align with the general principles of the Word. 1 Corinthians
          11:13-14 and 1 Corinthians 14:26, 40 provide examples of this
          principle, urging orderly worship and appealing to reason and natural
          understanding in governing communal life. Such directives underscore
          the importance of applying scriptural principles in diverse and
          changing contexts while maintaining fidelity to God’s revealed will.

          7. Everyone Can Obtain Saving Knowledge Through the Bible; at the Same
          Time, Parts of the Bible Are Clearer to Some Than Others
        </h2>
        <p>
          All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike
          clear unto all;<sup>12</sup> yet those things which are necessary to
          be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly
          propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not
          only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means,
          may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.<sup>13</sup>

        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Not All Parts of Scripture Are Equally Clear</p>
        <p>
          The confession acknowledges that not all passages of Scripture are
          equally plain or easy to understand. Some texts, by their nature,
          require more effort and wisdom to interpret, as they may involve
          complex theological concepts, symbolic language, or cultural and
          historical contexts. 2 Peter 3:16 illustrates this point, where Peter
          refers to some of Paul’s writings as “hard to understand,” noting that
          they are sometimes distorted by the ignorant or unstable. This
          acknowledgment encourages humility in approaching Scripture and
          reliance on sound hermeneutical principles to grasp its more
          challenging portions.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Clarity of Essential Truths for Salvation</p>
        <p>
          Despite the varying difficulty of specific passages, the confession
          strongly asserts the perspicuity of Scripture in relation to matters
          necessary for salvation. The truths that must be "known, believed, and
          observed for salvation" are so clearly presented in the Bible that
          both the learned and unlearned, using ordinary means, can comprehend
          them. Psalm 19:7 supports this claim, declaring, “The law of the Lord
          is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure,
          making wise the simple.” Similarly, Psalm 119:130 affirms that “the
          unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the
          simple.” These passages highlight Scripture's accessibility and its
          ability to provide clarity and guidance for all believers, regardless
          of education or intellect.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Role of Ordinary Means</p>
        <p>
          The confession also emphasizes the importance of “ordinary means” in
          attaining understanding. This includes practices such as regular
          reading of the Bible, prayer, participation in the church’s teaching
          ministry, and reliance on the Holy Spirit’s illumination. Through
          these means, both the learned and unlearned can grasp the essential
          truths of salvation without requiring extraordinary insight or
          revelation.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Encouragement and Assurance</p>
        <p>
          This balance of acknowledging the difficulty of certain parts of
          Scripture while affirming the clarity of its central message provides
          encouragement and assurance to believers. It reassures the faithful
          that God has made His Word sufficiently plain for salvation and
          Christian living while also recognizing the value of diligent study
          and teaching to grow deeper in understanding. This doctrine fosters
          confidence in Scripture’s accessibility and challenges believers to
          faithfully engage with its teachings in reliance on the Spirit.

          8. The Bible Should Be Translated So It Is Accessible to Everyone
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native language of the
          people of God of old),<sup>14</sup> and the New Testament in Greek
          (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to
          the nations), being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular
          care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentic; so
          as in all controversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal
          to them.<sup>15</sup> But because these original tongues are not known
          to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the
          Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read,<sup>16</sup>
          and search them,<sup>17</sup> therefore they are to be translated into
          the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come,<sup>18</sup>
          that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him
          in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the

        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Authenticity of the Original Texts</p>
        <p>
          The confession begins by affirming that the Old Testament in Hebrew
          and the New Testament in Greek are the original languages in which God
          inspired the Scriptures. These texts, described as being "immediately
          inspired by God," carry the highest authority in matters of faith and
          doctrine. Romans 3:2 underscores this by stating that "the oracles of
          God" were entrusted to the Jewish people, affirming the divine
          authority of the Hebrew Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The confession further asserts that God’s providential care has
          preserved these texts through the ages, ensuring their purity and
          reliability. As such, the church is to appeal to the original texts in
          all controversies of religion, a principle reinforced by Isaiah 8:20,
          which directs believers to the Word of God as the ultimate standard of
          truth.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Need for Translation</p>
        <p>
          While the original languages of Scripture are foundational and
          authoritative, the confession acknowledges that not all God’s people
          are familiar with Hebrew and Greek. Because believers are commanded to
          read (John 5:39) and search the Scriptures, and because all Christians
          have a right to and interest in the Word of God, it must be made
          accessible through translation. The confession highlights the
          necessity of translating Scripture into the “vulgar” (common) language
          of every nation to ensure that all people can engage with God’s Word
          directly and personally. This principle is supported by Acts 15:15,
          which references Scripture being cited and applied in contexts where
          it could be understood by the audience.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Importance of Accessibility</p>
        <p>
          The call for translation stems from a theological commitment to the
          universal accessibility of God’s Word. 1 Corinthians 14:6, 9-12, 24,
          28 emphasizes the importance of understanding in worship and
          edification, stating that communication without comprehension is
          fruitless. By translating Scripture into the common language,
          believers can be equipped to worship God "in an acceptable manner" and
          grow in faith. This accessibility ensures that the Word of God "dwells
          plentifully" among all people (Colossians 3:16) and provides comfort
          and hope through its promises (Romans 15:4).
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Historical and Practical Implications</p>
        <p>
          This doctrine has significant historical and practical implications.
          During the Reformation, figures like Martin Luther and William Tyndale
          emphasized the need to translate Scripture into the vernacular,
          challenging the church’s restrictions on access to the Bible. Their
          work democratized access to Scripture and empowered believers to
          engage directly with God’s Word. In contemporary times, the same
          principle undergirds the efforts of Bible translation organizations to
          make Scripture available in every language.

        <h2>
          9. The Ultimate Standard for Interpreting the Bible Is the Bible
          Itself
        </h2>
        <p>
          The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture
          itself; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full
          sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be
          searched by other places that speak more clearly.<sup>20</sup>
        </p>
        <p>20. 2 Peter 1:20-21; Acts 15:15-16</p>
        <p style="color: red">Scripture Interprets Scripture</p>
        <p>
          The confession declares that the ultimate and infallible rule for
          interpreting Scripture is Scripture itself. This principle, often
          called the <em>analogy of faith</em> (analogia fidei), asserts that
          the Bible’s unity and divine authorship ensure its internal coherence.
          When interpreting a particular passage, it must be understood in light
          of the broader biblical context, using clearer texts to illuminate
          those that are less clear. This approach safeguards against personal
          bias or misinterpretation, ensuring that the meaning of Scripture
          aligns with the whole counsel of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This principle is supported by 2 Peter 1:20-21, which teaches that no
          prophecy of Scripture is a matter of private interpretation because it
          was delivered by men carried along by the Holy Spirit. This passage
          emphasizes the divine origin and singular intent of Scripture,
          implying that its interpretation must align with its inspired meaning.
          Similarly, Acts 15:15-16 demonstrates this method in practice as the
          apostles interpret the inclusion of Gentiles in the church by
          referencing Old Testament prophecy, harmonizing different parts of
          Scripture to clarify God’s unfolding plan.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Singular Meaning of Scripture</p>
        <p>
          The confession asserts that the sense of Scripture is "not manifold,
          but one." This affirms that while Scripture may have layers of
          application or rich theological depth, its meaning is singular, rooted
          in the intent of its divine Author. This conviction guards against
          subjective interpretations that would fragment the church and distort
          the truth. Instead, by seeking clarity from the Scripture itself,
          believers can arrive at a faithful and unified understanding of God’s
          Word.

        <h2>10. The Bible Is the Ultimate Standard of Authority</h2>
        <p>
          The supreme judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be
          determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers,
          doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in
          whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture
          delivered by the Spirit, into which Scripture so delivered, our faith
          is finally resolved.<sup>21</sup>
        </p>
        <p>21. Matthew 22:29, 31-32; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23</p>
        <p style="color: red">Scripture as the Supreme Judge</p>
        <p>
          The confession asserts that Scripture alone is the ultimate authority
          in determining all matters of faith and practice. It is the "supreme
          judge" by which every decree, doctrine, and opinion must be tested,
          including those of councils, ancient writers, and individual
          interpretations. This statement reflects the Protestant commitment to
          <em>sola scriptura</em>, affirming that no human authority can equal
          or surpass the authority of God’s Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthew 22:29, 31-32 illustrates this principle as Jesus appeals to
          Scripture to correct theological error, affirming its final authority
          in matters of doctrine. Likewise, Ephesians 2:20 describes the church
          as being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with
          Christ as the cornerstone, indicating that the teaching of Scripture
          is the bedrock of the church’s faith and practice. In Acts 28:23, Paul
          uses the Scriptures to persuade his audience about Jesus,
          demonstrating that Scripture is the final arbiter of truth.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">The Finality of Scripture in Faith</p>
        <p>
          The confession emphasizes that the church and individual believers
          must resolve their faith in the truth of Scripture as delivered by the
          Spirit. This excludes any reliance on human tradition or subjective
          experiences as ultimate authorities, ensuring that faith rests solely
          on the Word of God. This principle provides a safeguard against the
          intrusion of human error and promotes a Christ-centered, Spirit-led
          understanding of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Practical Implications</p>
        <p>
          The recognition of Scripture as the supreme judge challenges believers
          to submit their beliefs, practices, and interpretations to the
          authority of God’s Word. It also emphasizes the importance of thorough
          biblical study and the guidance of the Holy Spirit in discerning
          truth. For the church, it establishes Scripture as the foundation for
          resolving disputes and maintaining unity, ensuring that its teachings
          remain faithful to God’s revelation.
