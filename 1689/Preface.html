  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p>
    <b>1.</b> Courteous Reader: It is now many years since divers of us (with
    other sober Christians then living, and walking in the way of the Lord, that
    we profess) did conceive ourselves to be under a necessity of publishing a
    Confession, of our Faith, for the information and satisfaction of those that
    did not thoroughly understand what our principles were, or had entertained
    prejudices against our profession, by reason of the strange representation
    of them by some men of note who had taken very wrong measures, and
    accordingly led others into misapprehension of us and them. And this was
    first put forth about the year 1643, in the name of seven congregations then
    gathered in London; since which time divers impressions thereof have been
    dispersed abroad, and our end proposed in good measure answered, inasmuch as
    many (and some of those men eminent both for piety and learning) were
    thereby satisfied that we were no way guilty of those heterodoxies and
    fundamental errors which had too frequently been charged upon us without
    ground or occasion given on our part.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>2.</b> And forasmuch as that Confession is not now commonly to be had,
    and also that many others have since embraced the same truth which is owned
    therein, it was judged necessary by us to join together in giving a
    testimony to the world of our firm adhering to those wholesome principles by
    the publication of this which is now in your hand. And forasmuch as our
    method and manner of expressing our sentiments in this doth vary from the
    former (although the substance of this matter is the same), we shall freely
    impart to you the reason and occasion thereof.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing that greatly prevailed with us to undertake this work was (not
    only to give a full account of ourselves to those Christians that differ
    from us about the subject of baptism, but also) the profit that might from
    thence arise unto those that have any account of our labors in their
    instruction and establishment in the great truths of the Gospel, in the
    clear understanding and steady belief of which our comfortable walking with
    God, and fruitfulness before him in all our ways, is most nearly concerned;
    and therefore we did conclude it necessary to express ourselves the more
    fully and distinctly; and also to fix on such a method as might be most
    comprehensive of those things we designed to explain our sense and belief
    of; and finding no defect in this regard in that fixed on by the Assembly,
    and, after them by those of the congregational way, we did readily conclude
    it best to retain the same order in our present Confession.
  </p>
  <p>
    And also when we observed that those last mentioned did in their Confessions
    (for reasons which seemed of weight both to themselves and others) choose
    not only to express their mind in words concurrent with the former in sense
    concerning all those articles wherein they were agreed, but also for the
    most part without any variation of the terms, we did in like manner conclude
    it best to follow their example in making use of the very same words with
    them both in these articles (which are very many) wherein our faith and
    doctrine are the same with theirs; and this we did the more abundantly to
    manifest our consent with both in all the fundamental articles of the
    Christian religion, as also with many others whose orthodox Confessions have
    been published to the world on the behalf of the Protestant in diverse
    nations and cities. And also to convince all that we have no itch to clog
    religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in that form of sound
    words which hath been, in consent with the Holy Scriptures, used by others
    before us; hereby declaring, before God, angels, and men, our hearty
    agreement with them in that wholesome Protestant doctrine which, with so
    clear evidence of Scriptures, they have asserted. Some things, indeed, are
    in some places added, some terms omitted, and some few changed; but these
    alterations are of that nature as that we need not doubt any charge or
    suspicion of unsoundness in the faith from any of our brethren upon the
    account of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>3.</b> In those things wherein we differ from others we have expressed
    ourselves with all candor and plainness, that none might entertain jealousy
    of aught secretly lodged in our breasts that we would not the world should
    be acquainted with; yet we hope we have also observed those rules of modesty
    and humility as will render our freedom in this respect inoffensive, even to
    those whose sentiments are different from ours.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>4.</b> We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture at the bottom,
    for the confirmation of each article in our Confession; in which work we
    have studiously endeavored to select such as are most clear and pertinent
    for the proof of what is asserted by us; and our earnest desire is that all
    into whose hands this may come would follow that (never enough commended)
    example of the noble Bereans, who searched the Scriptures daily that they
    might find out whether the things preached to them were so or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>5.</b> There is one thing more which we sincerely profess and earnestly
    desire credence in - viz., that contention is most remote from our design in
    all that we have done in this matter; and we hope that the liberty of an
    ingenuous unfolding our principles and opening our hearts unto our brethren,
    with the Scripture grounds of our faith and practice will by none of them be
    either denied to us, or taken ill from us. Our whole design is accomplished
    if we may have attained that justice as to be measured in our principles and
    practice, and the judgment of both by others, according to what we have now
    published, which the Lord (whose eyes are as a flame of fire) knoweth to be
    the doctrine which with our hearts we most firmly believe and sincerely
    endeavor to conform our lives to. And O that, other contentions being laid
    asleep, the only care and contention of all upon whom the name of our
    blessed Redeemer is called might for the future be to walk humbly with their
    God in the exercise of all love and meekness toward each other, to perfect
    holiness in the fear of the Lord, each one endeavoring to have his
    conversation such as becometh the gospel; and also, suitable to his place
    and capacity, vigorously to promote in others the practice of true religion
    and undefiled in the sight of God our Father! And that in this backsliding
    day we might not spend our breath in fruitless complaints of the evils of
    others, but may every one begin at home, to reform in the first place our
    own hearts and ways, and then to quicken all that we may have influence upon
    to the some work, that if the will of God were so, none might deceive
    themselves by resting in and trusting to a form of godliness without the
    power of it, and inward experience of the efficacy of those truths that are
    professed by them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>6.</b> And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of religion
    in our day which we cannot but touch upon and earnestly urge a redress of,
    and that is the neglect of the worship of God in families by those to whom
    the charge and conduct of them is committed. May not the gross ignorance and
    instability of many, with the profaneness of others, be justly charged upon
    their parents and masters, who have not trained them up in the way wherein
    they ought to walk when they were young, but have neglected those frequent
    and solemn commands which the Lord hath laid upon them, so to catechise and
    instruct them that their tender years might be seasoned with the knowledge
    of the truth of God as revealed in the Scriptures; and also by their own
    omission of prayer and other duties of religion of their families, together
    with the ill example of their loose conversation, having, inured them first
    to a neglect and the contempt of all piety and religion? We know this will
    not excuse the blindness and wickedness of any, but certainly it will fall
    heavy upon those that have been thus the occasion thereof; they indeed die
    in their sins, but will not their blood be required of those under whose
    care they were, who yet permitted them to go on without warning - yea, led
    them into the paths of destruction? And will not the diligence of Christians
    with respect to the discharge of these duties in ages past rise up in
    judgment against and condemn many of those who would be esteemed such now?
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>7.</b> We shall conclude with our earnest prayer that the God of all
    grace will pour out those measures of his Holy Spirit upon us, that the
    profession of truth may be accompanied with the sound belief and diligent
    practice of it by us, that his name may in all things be glorified through
    Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
