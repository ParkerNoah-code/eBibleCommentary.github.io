        <h2>1. Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          It has now been many years since several of us (along with other
          Christians who lived and walked in the way of the Lord that we
          profess) were compelled to publish a confession of our faith. Our
          purpose was to inform and satisfy people who did not understand what
          we believed or had prejudices against our beliefs because of
          particular people who distorted our beliefs and wrongly led others
          into wrong knowledge concerning us and themselves. We first came up
          with this idea around the year 1643. We were seven congregations
          gathered in London. Since then, we proposed our goal to other
          congregations, and we were answered by many (and some of these men
          were godly men full of piety and learning) who were satisfied that we
          were not guilty of the wrong beliefs and fundamental errors that
          others had often accused us of without reason or anything that we had
          done.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>2. We Want to Communicate Unity as Much as Possible</h2>
        <p>
          Then, since a common confession was not generally available, and since
          many others had embraced the same truth contained within our
          confession, we decided it was necessary to work together to give a
          testimony to the world concerning our firm belief in these doctrines.
          So, we wrote this confession that you now possess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our method and way of expressing our beliefs differs from the
          Westminster Confession (although the substance is the same), so we
          wanted to share with you the reason for why we are writing. One thing
          we wanted to accomplish with this work was to not only explain our
          beliefs and how they are different from Christians who have a
          different view of baptism, but also to instruct and establish in the
          great truths of the Gospel those who read our work. We want people to
          have a clear understanding and steady belief concerning living a
          fruitful Christian life before God in all their ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we decided it was necessary to express ourselves more fully
          and distinctly, and to choose a method that would comprehensively
          explain our doctrines and beliefs. Since we found no problem with the
          method taken by the Westminster assembly and by the
          congregationalists, we concluded that it was best to keep the same
          order in our confession.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, we observed that the congregationalists, in their confession (for
          reasons that they considered important for themselves and others),
          chose to express their beliefs using essentially the same words as
          those of the Westminster Confession concerning every doctrine they
          agreed with and, for the most part, did not change any of the terms.
          Likewise, we decided it was best to follow their example by using the
          same words as both of those confessions regarding the doctrines (which
          are very many) in which our faith and doctrine were the same as
          theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important reason we did this was to demonstrate our unity with
          both groups in all the fundamental doctrines of the Christian
          religion. We also wanted to demonstrate our unity with many others,
          whose orthodox confession have been published to the world on behalf
          of Protestants in various nations and cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we wanted to convince all that we do not desire to hinder
          religion with new words. Rather, we readily agree with sound words in
          conformity with the holy Scriptures that have been used by others
          before us. In this way, we declare before God, angels, and men our
          full agreement with these words and their right Protestant doctrine,
          which are supported with the clear evidence of Scripture. We have
          added, left out, and changed some words, but these changes are of such
          a nature that other Christians should not doubt our soundness of
          faith.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Regarding Our Differences</h2>
        <p>
          In the areas where we differ from others, we have expressed ourselves
          with all honestly and plainness, so that no one should accuse us of
          hiding things we do not want the world to know about. Nevertheless, we
          hope we have also been modest and humble so that the freedoms we have
          taken will be inoffensive, even to those whose beliefs are different
          from ours.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Our Use of Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          We have also been careful to attach Scripture texts at the bottom to
          support each article in our Confession. We sought to choose Scriptures
          that were the most clear and relevant to prove our assertions. Our
          earnest desire is that everyone who acquires this confession would
          follow the example of the noble Bereans (who cannot ever be commended
          enough), who searched the Scriptures daily, so that they could find
          out whether the things preached to them were true or not.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Let's Not Focus on Fighting One Another</h2>
        <p>
          There is one more thing we profess that we want people to understand,
          namely, that we do not want our work to cause conflict. We hope that
          people will not deny to us or be offended by this liberty of laying
          out our beliefs and opening our hearts to our brethren with these
          Scriptural grounds of our faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our purpose is accomplished if people judge us by our principles and
          practice and according to what we have published, which the Lord—whose
          eyes are as a flame of fire—knows to be the doctrine which we firmly
          believe with our hearts and sincerely seek to conform our lives to.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that instead of focusing excessively on our differences, the
          focus of all who are called by the name of our blessed Redeemer would
          be to walk humbly with their God in the exercise of all love and
          meekness towards each other, as well as to perfect holiness in the
          fear of the Lord. We should seek to have conversations that are worthy
          of the gospel and appropriately according to our situation. We should
          seek to vigorously promote in others the practice of true religion
          that is undefiled in the sight of God our Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that during this time that is filled with much backsliding, we
          would not spend our energy fruitlessly criticizing others. Rather, we
          hope people would exert their energies starting at home, to first
          reform our own hearts and ways, and then to exhort everyone we have
          influence over to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that, if this is the will of God, nobody would deceive
          themselves into resting and trusting in a form of godliness without
          its power and without an inward experience of the power of the truths
          they profess.
        </p>
        <h2>6. The Importance of Family Worship</h2>
        <p>
          Truly, there is one root cause for the decay of religion today which
          we must mention and urge correction concerning. This is the neglect of
          worshipping God in families by those who have the responsiblity to
          lead in doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the gross ignorance and instability of many, as well as the
          profaneness of others, can be blamed upon their parents and leaders,
          who have not trained them up in the way they should walk when they
          were young.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather, they have neglected the many solemn commands that the Lord has
          given to them to catechize and teach children, so that their early
          years would be seasoned with the knowledge of the truth of God as
          revealed in the Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, perhaps their neglect of prayer and leading in other
          duties of religion in their families, along with their being bad
          examples because of their nominal conversion, led others to neglecting
          and having contempt for piety and religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know this does not excuse anyone's blindness or wickedness.
          However, those who have contributed to this problem will be judged
          harshly. Of course, the blind and wicked will die in their sins, but
          those who had authority over them will also have blood on their hands,
          since they allowed those they had responsibility over to continue in
          sin without warning, and actually led them into paths of destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreoever, the diligence of Christians in earlier times who fulfilled
          their responsibilities in these areas will rise up in judgment
          against, and condemn, many today who have neglected their
          responsibilities.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          We conclude with our earnest prayer that the God of all grace will
          pour out those measures of his Holy Spirit upon us, so that the
          profession of truth may be accompanied with sound belief and our
          diligent practice of it, as well as that his name may in all things be
          glorified through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
