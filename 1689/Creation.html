        <p style="color: red">Scriptural Grounding</p>

        <p>
          John 1:2-3 emphasizes the active involvement of the Word (the Son) in
          creation: "He was in the beginning with God. All things were made
          through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made." This
          underscores the Son's divine nature and role in creation, affirming
          the Trinitarian cooperation in creation. Hebrews 1:2 declares that the
          Son is the one "through whom also He made the worlds," linking
          Christ's creative work to His role as heir of all things. Job 26:13
          poetically describes God's Spirit as having "garnished the heavens,"
          highlighting the Spirit's role in shaping creation. Together, these
          verses present a robust Trinitarian framework, where Father, Son, and
          Spirit collaboratively act in creation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Romans 1:20 reflects on creation's purpose, stating that "His
          invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things
          that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead." This verse ties
          creation to God's revelation, showing how His wisdom, power, and deity
          are manifested in the created order. Colossians 1:16 explicitly states
          that "by Him all things were created," affirming Christ's supremacy
          over all creation and echoing the cosmic scope of Genesis 1:31, which
          declares that "God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was
          very good." These passages collectively confirm God's sovereign, wise,
          and purposeful act of creation.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Terminological Relevance</p>

        <p>
          Key terms in this section include "Trinity," "manifestation," and
          "goodness." The Trinity, central to Christian theology, emphasizes
          that creation is a unified act of the Father, Son, and Spirit, each
          contributing distinctly yet harmoniously. The term "manifestation"
          indicates that creation serves as a display of God's attributes,
          particularly His "eternal power, wisdom, and goodness." The word
          "goodness" conveys the inherent perfection and moral uprightness of
          creation before the fall, reflecting God's character.
        </p>

        <p>
          Theologically, the term "aseity" (God's self-existence) underpins this
          section, as God's act of creation is not out of necessity but His
          sovereign pleasure. Creation is an overflow of God's independent
          nature, not a response to a lack or need. Understanding these terms
          enriches our comprehension of the divine purpose and the intrinsic
          goodness of creation.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Theological Interaction</p>

        <p>
          In contrast to Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, which may
          emphasize human participation in the ongoing perfection of creation
          through sacramental life, the 1689 Confession focuses on the completed
          and "very good" nature of the original creation. Arminianism, with its
          emphasis on human free will, might place greater focus on creation's
          allowance for human choice, whereas the Confession centers on God's
          sovereign glory in creation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Against Open Theism, which posits a more dynamic and uncertain divine
          interaction with creation, this doctrine asserts God's eternal wisdom
          and purposeful act in creating all things. This Trinitarian
          perspective also contrasts with unitarian systems (e.g., Islam) that
          deny the multi-personal nature of God and His relational aspect within
          creation.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Historical and Theological Comparison</p>

        <p>
          The Westminster Confession shares a nearly identical assertion
          regarding God’s role as Creator, reflecting the shared Reformed
          heritage. However, the 1689 Confession places stronger emphasis on the
          Trinitarian nature of creation, aligning closely with the Nicene
          Creed's affirmation of Christ as the "Maker of heaven and earth." The
          idea of creation being “very good” aligns with Augustine’s views on
          the goodness of creation in *City of God*, countering Manichean
          dualism, which saw matter as inherently evil.
        </p>

        <p>
          In comparison to Aquinas, who emphasized creation as a rational act of
          divine wisdom, the 1689 Confession includes a devotional dimension,
          focusing on the manifestation of God's glory in creation. Calvin’s
          *Institutes* similarly highlight creation as a "theater of God’s
          glory," harmonizing well with the theological intentions of this
          section.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Practical and Devotional Implications</p>

        <p>
          This doctrine fosters a deep sense of awe and gratitude in the
          believer, recognizing creation as a testament to God's majesty and
          wisdom. It encourages stewardship of the world, viewing it as a gift
          reflecting God’s goodness. In worship, this truth calls believers to
          praise the triune God for His sovereign power and creativity. It also
          provides a foundation for Christian ethics, affirming the inherent
          goodness of God's created order and human responsibility to preserve
          it. Reflecting on God's purpose in creation can deepen personal piety
          and inspire a life of worshipful obedience.

        <h2>2. God Created Humans In His Own Image</h2>
        <p>
          After God had made all other creatures, He created man, male and
          female,<sup>4</sup> with reasonable and immortal souls,<sup>5</sup>
          rendering them fit unto that life to God for which they were created;
          being made after the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and
          true holiness;<sup>6</sup> having the law of God written in their
          hearts,<sup>7</sup> and power to fulfill it, and yet under a
          possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own
          will, which was subject to change.<sup>8</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Genesis 1:27
          <br />
          5. Genesis 2:7
          <br />
          6. Ecclesiastes 7:29; Genesis 1:26
          <br />
          7. Romans 2:14-15
          <br />
          8. Genesis 3:6
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Scriptural Grounding</p>

        <p>
          Genesis 1:27 states, "So God created man in His own image; in the
          image of God He created him; male and female He created them." This
          foundational verse asserts humanity's unique creation in God's image,
          underscoring human dignity and relationality. Genesis 2:7 explains
          that "the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
          into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."
          This highlights the divine origin of human life, with the "breath of
          life" symbolizing humanity’s rational and immortal soul, setting
          humans apart from other creatures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ecclesiastes 7:29 declares, "Truly, this only I have found: that God
          made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes." This affirms
          humanity’s original state of righteousness and true holiness, a direct
          reflection of God's image. Romans 2:14-15 emphasizes the moral law
          written on human hearts, asserting that even Gentiles, without the
          Mosaic Law, show the work of the law in their conscience. Genesis 3:6
          recounts the fall, where humanity, though created with the ability to
          fulfill God’s law, misused the liberty of will, demonstrating the
          reality and consequences of transgression.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Terminological Relevance</p>

        <p>
          Key terms include "image of God," "reasonable and immortal souls," and
          "liberty of their own will." The "image of God" (imago Dei) refers to
          humanity's reflection of God's communicable attributes, such as
          knowledge, righteousness, and holiness. This includes relational,
          moral, and spiritual capacities that distinguish humans from other
          creatures. The "reasonable and immortal soul" refers to the eternal
          aspect of humanity that enables rational thought, moral agency, and
          communion with God. "Liberty of their own will" signifies humanity's
          capacity to choose freely, within the bounds of their created nature,
          which was originally inclined toward righteousness but subject to
          change.
        </p>

        <p>
          These terms collectively emphasize the high status and responsibility
          of humans as God’s image-bearers and moral agents. The concept of
          "subject to change" highlights the contingent nature of created
          beings, contrasting God’s immutable perfection.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Theological Interaction</p>

        <p>
          Roman Catholic theology shares the affirmation of humans as made in
          God’s image but often includes a stronger distinction between natural
          and supernatural gifts. In Catholic thought, the "image" includes
          natural faculties, while "likeness" involves supernatural grace, lost
          at the Fall. The 1689 Confession, consistent with Reformed theology,
          asserts that humans were originally endowed with both knowledge and
          righteousness, emphasizing the covenantal relationship between God and
          humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eastern Orthodoxy, while emphasizing the image of God, focuses on
          theosis (deification) as humanity’s ultimate purpose, emphasizing a
          dynamic transformation into divine likeness. The 1689 Confession, by
          contrast, centers on righteousness and holiness as immediate
          reflections of God's image, stressing humanity’s moral responsibility
          before God. Arminian theology highlights human free will in its
          treatment of the fall, whereas the Confession frames free will within
          the context of original righteousness and the possibility of
          transgression, aligning more closely with Augustinian determinism.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Confession stands in opposition to Open Theism and Pelagianism,
          which respectively downplay God's foreknowledge and humanity’s
          original righteousness. Open Theism's emphasis on human autonomy is
          incompatible with the confession’s view of God’s sovereign creation
          and moral law, while Pelagianism’s denial of original righteousness
          contradicts the biblical teaching of humanity’s upright creation.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Historical and Theological Comparison</p>

        <p>
          The Westminster Confession closely parallels the 1689 Confession in
          describing the creation of humanity, reflecting shared Reformed
          commitments. The Heidelberg Catechism echoes this doctrine,
          particularly in its teaching on humanity’s creation in righteousness
          and true holiness (Q&A 6). Augustine's writings, particularly in *The
          City of God*, articulate humanity’s original righteousness and the
          freedom to choose good or evil, which significantly influenced
          Reformed thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Nicene and Chalcedonian affirmations of Christ’s full humanity
          implicitly uphold the doctrine of humanity made in God’s image, as
          Christ restores and perfects the image through His incarnation and
          work. This continuity places the confession within a broader
          historical and theological trajectory affirming human dignity and
          divine purpose.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Practical and Devotional Implications</p>

        <p>
          This doctrine profoundly shapes Christian identity and ethics.
          Recognizing oneself and others as made in God’s image fosters
          humility, gratitude, and respect for human dignity. It underscores the
          sanctity of life, guiding believers to honor God through
          relationships, stewardship, and moral living. The concept of original
          righteousness inspires believers to pursue holiness, while the
          acknowledgment of human fallibility cultivates dependence on Christ
          for restoration and growth in grace.
        </p>

        <p>
          In worship, this truth calls Christians to glorify God as their
          Creator and to seek renewal in His image through the Spirit. It
          encourages believers to live in alignment with God's purpose,
          reflecting His character in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness in
          their personal and corporate lives.

        <h2>
          3. God's Command Not to Eat From the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
          Evil
        </h2>
        <p>
          Besides the law written in their hearts, they received a command not
          to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,<sup>9</sup> which
          while they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had
          dominion over the creatures.<sup>10</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Genesis 2:17
          <br />
          10. Genesis 1:26, 28
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">Scriptural Grounding</p>

        <p>
          Genesis 2:17 states, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
          evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall
          surely die." This verse establishes God's explicit command as a test
          of Adam and Eve's obedience and trust in His authority. It signifies a
          covenantal arrangement wherein human flourishing and communion with
          God were contingent on their adherence to His word.
        </p>

        <p>
          Genesis 1:26 and 28 articulate humanity’s dominion over creation: "Let
          us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have
          dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over
          the cattle, over all the earth." Verse 28 reiterates this mandate,
          coupling dominion with the blessing to "be fruitful and multiply."
          These verses show that humanity's obedience to God’s command was
          integrally tied to their role as vice-regents, stewarding creation
          under God's ultimate authority. The prohibition concerning the tree
          thus functioned within the broader framework of God’s covenantal
          relationship with humanity.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Terminological Relevance</p>

        <p>
          Key terms include "law written in their hearts" and "dominion." The
          "law written in their hearts" refers to the innate moral understanding
          granted to Adam and Eve as image-bearers of God, which was further
          reinforced by the specific prohibition concerning the tree. This
          highlights their moral accountability. "Dominion" reflects humanity’s
          God-given authority over creation, a stewardship meant to mirror God’s
          sovereign rule and maintain harmony within the created order.
        </p>

        <p>
          The phrase "knowledge of good and evil" has been interpreted
          variously, but within this context, it signifies the experiential and
          autonomous determination of morality apart from God. The command not
          to eat the fruit was not arbitrary but deeply tied to humanity's
          covenantal obligation to depend wholly on God for wisdom and moral
          understanding.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Theological Interaction</p>

        <p>
          In Roman Catholic theology, this command is often framed within the
          broader doctrine of original justice, emphasizing that Adam and Eve
          possessed supernatural grace that enabled their communion with God.
          The 1689 Confession aligns with this but focuses more heavily on the
          covenantal structure, commonly referred to as the "covenant of works,"
          wherein obedience was required for continued blessing and life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eastern Orthodoxy views the command as part of humanity's spiritual
          maturation process, where Adam and Eve were intended to grow into
          divine likeness (theosis). In contrast, the 1689 Confession emphasizes
          the probationary nature of the command, where obedience or
          disobedience had immediate covenantal consequences. Against Open
          Theism, which downplays divine foreknowledge and sovereignty, this
          command demonstrates God’s perfect governance and the intentionality
          of His relational arrangements with humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Confession contrasts with Pelagianism, which denies the necessity
          of divine grace for moral obedience, by underscoring that Adam and
          Eve’s happiness and communion with God were contingent upon their
          dependence on and obedience to Him. The inclusion of "law written in
          their hearts" also critiques modern relativistic views, affirming that
          God's moral standards are universal and objective.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Historical and Theological Comparison</p>

        <p>
          The Westminster Confession shares the 1689 Confession's emphasis on
          the probationary nature of the command and its covenantal framework.
          Reformed theologians like John Calvin highlight the significance of
          this command as a test of faith and obedience, noting that Adam’s
          failure was not merely a moral lapse but a breach of trust and
          dependence on God.
        </p>

        <p>
          Augustine, in his writings on original sin, interprets this command as
          central to understanding the fall, emphasizing that disobedience to
          such a simple and clear command revealed a profound turning away from
          God’s authority. The Council of Trent’s treatment of original sin,
          though divergent in its theological framework, also acknowledges the
          importance of Adam’s initial state of grace and its loss through
          transgression.
        </p>

        <p style="color: red">Practical and Devotional Implications</p>

        <p>
          This doctrine reminds Christians of the importance of trusting and
          obeying God’s commands, even when they do not fully understand His
          reasons. It underscores the seriousness of sin as rebellion against
          God's authority and the subsequent loss of fellowship with Him. For
          believers, it highlights the necessity of relying on Christ’s
          obedience, which fulfilled the law perfectly and restored communion
          with God.
        </p>

        <p>
          Devotionally, this truth calls for humility and gratitude for God’s
          provision in Christ, as well as a renewed commitment to live in
          obedience to His revealed will. Recognizing humanity’s original
          dominion encourages faithful stewardship of creation, while reflecting
          on the joy of Adam and Eve's unbroken communion with God inspires a
          longing for restored fellowship with Him through worship and prayer.
