      <h2>Mini Essays</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for writing mini essays came from Odysseas' videos 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YjXJVzoZY" target="_blank">Mini Essays: The Ultimate Learning Tool</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCaOSNxwCsw" target="_blank">How to Write a Mini-Essay</a>. Mini 
        essays utilize the principles from the Feynman technique, which is to research, teach, fill in gaps in your understanding, repeat
        until competent, and then simply. Mini essays do this on a very small scale, are great for memorization, organization, and
        can be used later on in larger projects, linking multiple ideas together into a chain of reasoning. They typically consist
        of only 3 to 5 paragraphs.

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        I want to begin by laying out and elaborating on the definitions of several of the fields I'm interested in.

      <p>
        <a href="Econ.html">Economics</a> - Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources which have alternative uses.
