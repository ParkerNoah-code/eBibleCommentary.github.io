        <h2>Lecture 3</h2>
        <h2>Introduction to Developmental Psychology</h2>
        <p>
          Human development is the process of psychological change across the
          lifespan. Developmental psychology examines how individuals transform
          over time, encompassing social, personality, moral, cognitive, and
          physical development. This field spans every phase of life, from
          infancy to old age, focusing on the dynamic and multifaceted nature of
          human growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Areas of Development</h2>
        <p>
          Development can occur in various domains, such as social
          relationships, moral understanding, and cognitive abilities.
          Researchers study these processes in different life stages, including
          infancy, adolescence, adulthood, and advanced old age, exploring how
          people change and adapt in response to life’s challenges and
          opportunities.
        </p>

        <h2>Classic Theories of Development</h2>
        <p>
          Developmental psychology is shaped by classic theories from figures
          such as Freud, Bowlby, Piaget, Kohlberg, and Erikson. Each theorist
          contributed unique perspectives, focusing on stages of development,
          cognitive growth, moral reasoning, and psychosocial challenges. These
          theories offer frameworks for understanding the complexities of human
          development.
        </p>

        <h2>Freud’s Psychosexual Development</h2>
        <p>
          Freud’s theory proposes that development is driven by psychic energy,
          or libido, which focuses on different erogenous zones at each stage of
          life. These stages—oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital—are
          marked by specific conflicts and potential fixations. For example,
          oral fixation may result in behaviors like smoking or nail-biting in
          adulthood.
        </p>

        <h2>Bowlby’s Attachment Theory</h2>
        <p>
          Bowlby emphasized the importance of early attachments between children
          and caregivers. Secure attachment fosters trust and exploration, while
          insecure attachment can lead to clinginess or avoidant behaviors.
          These early patterns shape future relationships and social
          interactions throughout life.
        </p>

        <h2>Piaget’s Cognitive Development</h2>
        <p>
          Piaget outlined stages of cognitive growth, from sensorimotor
          exploration in infancy to formal operational thinking in adolescence.
          His work highlights how children progressively develop the ability to
          understand abstract concepts, solve problems, and engage in logical
          reasoning.
        </p>

        <h2>Kohlberg’s Moral Development</h2>
        <p>
          Kohlberg focused on the evolution of moral reasoning, identifying
          stages from basic reward and punishment thinking (pre-conventional) to
          societal norms (conventional) and eventually principles of justice and
          individual ethics (post-conventional). These stages reflect the
          growing complexity of moral understanding as individuals mature.
        </p>

        <h2>Erikson’s Psychosocial Development</h2>
        <p>
          Erikson proposed a life-course model consisting of eight stages, each
          defined by a psychosocial conflict. From trust versus mistrust in
          infancy to integrity versus despair in old age, these conflicts
          represent key developmental challenges that shape identity and
          well-being.
        </p>

        <h2>Emerging Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
          Modern research suggests a new stage, emerging adulthood, typically
          spanning ages 18 to 28. This phase is characterized by identity
          exploration, delayed milestones such as marriage or stable employment,
          and extended self-discovery. Cultural and economic shifts have
          contributed to the elongation of this period of development.
        </p>

        <h2>Young Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
          In young adulthood (ages 29–40), Erikson identified the conflict of
          intimacy versus isolation. This stage emphasizes building meaningful
          relationships, establishing careers, and contributing to society.
          Maturation also occurs, with individuals becoming more conscientious,
          emotionally stable, and socially responsible.
        </p>

        <h2>Middle Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
          During middle adulthood (ages 40–60), individuals often grapple with
          generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves creating
          something of lasting value, such as mentoring, parenting, or
          contributing to society. This phase also presents opportunities for
          personal and spiritual growth, as described by Jung’s midlife
          transition theories.
        </p>

        <h2>Old Age</h2>
        <p>
          In old age (65+), the focus shifts to ego integrity versus despair.
          Reflecting on life, individuals seek to find meaning and peace with
          their experiences. Successful navigation of this stage involves
          resolving unfinished conflicts and embracing the transition to the end
          of life with grace and acceptance.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Themes in Development</h2>
        <p>
          Human development involves balancing individuality with connection.
          Growth requires both autonomy and meaningful relationships.
          Development is dynamic, with early experiences influencing later
          stages while allowing room for change and adaptation throughout life.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Developmental psychology provides insights into the lifelong process
          of change, highlighting the interplay between biological, social, and
          cultural factors. Understanding these stages and theories helps us
          appreciate the complexity of human growth and the potential for
          transformation at every age.
