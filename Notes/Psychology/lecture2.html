        <h2>Lecture 2</h2>
        <h2>The Psychology of Human Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          Human behavior is driven by how we make sense of the world. Contrary
          to the idea that our minds function like recording devices that
          accurately capture reality, psychology reveals that our perception is
          a constructed model of the external world. This model is shaped by our
          sensory inputs, motivations, and prior experiences, rather than a
          direct recording of reality.
        </p>

        <h2>Sensation and Perception</h2>
        <p>
          Sensation involves the initial intake of sensory stimuli—sight, sound,
          touch, etc.—while perception is the process of interpreting these
          stimuli to create a coherent mental model. This interpretation often
          involves significant reduction and transformation of the raw data to
          make it manageable and meaningful. For example, we focus selectively
          on aspects of our environment due to the brain's attentional
          processes, leaving much unnoticed.
        </p>

        <h2>Pareidolia and Apophenia</h2>
        <p>
          Humans are sense-making beings, often interpreting ambiguous stimuli
          as familiar patterns or objects. Pareidolia refers to perceiving
          recognizable images, like faces or animals, in random patterns (e.g.,
          clouds). Apophenia involves finding meaningful connections in
          unrelated or random data, such as conspiracy theories. These
          tendencies reflect our brain's effort to impose order on chaos.
        </p>

        <h2>Illusions and Attention</h2>
        <p>
          Illusions demonstrate how perception can be shaped by interpretation.
          Examples like the duck-rabbit illusion or ambiguous figures highlight
          how perception depends on context and focus. Attention functions like
          a spotlight, directing our focus to specific stimuli while ignoring
          others, which can create surprising lapses in awareness, such as
          missing a gorilla in a visual task.
        </p>

        <h2>Dual Process Model of the Mind</h2>
        <p>
          The human mind operates using two systems: the automatic (fast,
          intuitive, and associative) and the controlled (slow, deliberate, and
          logical). This dual-process model explains phenomena like quick
          judgments versus reasoned decisions. For example, initial romantic
          attraction might arise from automatic processes, while deeper
          relationship evaluations involve controlled thought.
        </p>

        <h2>Judgment and Decision-Making Biases</h2>
        <p>
          Humans rely on heuristics—mental shortcuts—for quick decision-making,
          often leading to biases. The availability heuristic, for example,
          makes events that are easily recalled seem more probable. Similarly,
          salience biases cause people to focus on standout features, and
          stereotypes influence judgments based on preexisting categories.
        </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Scripts and Schemas</h2>
        <p>
          Schemas and scripts help us navigate the world efficiently. Scripts
          provide sequential expectations for familiar events, like dining at a
          restaurant, while schemas are broader mental models used to interpret
          situations. These structures can lead to errors when applied to novel
          or mismatched contexts, requiring adaptation and learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
        <p>
          Cognitive dissonance arises when there is a conflict between beliefs,
          attitudes, or behaviors, leading to psychological discomfort. Humans
          resolve dissonance by changing their beliefs, downplaying the
          importance of the inconsistency, or adding new rationalizations. For
          example, smokers may justify their habit by minimizing its health
          risks or emphasizing other compensatory behaviors.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Construction of Reality</h2>
        <p>
          Reality is not only individually perceived but also socially
          constructed. Group consensus can shape perceptions of ambiguous
          stimuli, as demonstrated by Sherif's autokinetic effect experiment.
          Once a shared reality is established within a group, it can persist
          and influence subsequent generations of group members.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation and Perception</h2>
        <p>
          Our motivations significantly influence how we perceive the world. For
          example, a home buyer, a burglar, and a housing inspector will view
          the same house differently based on their goals and priorities. These
          motivations prime specific schemas that shape our interpretations and
          interactions with our environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Controlled Processes Becoming Automatic</h2>
        <p>
          Through repetition and practice, controlled processes can become
          automatic. Learning complex skills, like driving or golfing, begins
          with deliberate effort and eventually transitions into automatic
          behavior. This process underscores the importance of habit formation
          and consistent practice in mastering new tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Balancing Social and Individual Realities</h2>
        <p>
          Human perception is influenced by both biological and social factors.
          The need for internal consistency and social agreement often leads
          individuals to conform to shared realities within their cultural or
          social groups. Disagreements with group norms can create significant
          psychological and social challenges.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Human perception and behavior are shaped by a complex interplay of
          sensory inputs, cognitive processes, social dynamics, and individual
          motivations. While our constructed models of reality serve the purpose
          of survival and social harmony, they are also flexible, allowing for
          growth, adaptation, and deeper understanding of the world.
