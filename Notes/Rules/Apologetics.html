  <h1>Apologetics</h1>
  <p>
    <b>The Inescapability of Presuppositions</b>: Every worldview begins with
    foundational beliefs that are assumed rather than proven. For
    presuppositional apologetics, the Christian worldview is the necessary
    starting point.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The Authority of Scripture</b>: The Bible is the ultimate standard of
    truth. All reasoning and argumentation must be grounded in the truth of
    Scripture, which is self-authenticating and provides the basis for all
    knowledge and understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The Impossibility of the Contrary</b>: Without the presupposition of the
    Christian God, one cannot make sense of reality, logic, morality, or
    science. Non-Christian worldviews ultimately lead to epistemological and
    moral chaos.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The Transcendental Argument</b>: The existence of the Christian God is
    the precondition for intelligibility. This argument asserts that the
    preconditions for the intelligibility of human experience are only met if
    the God of the Bible exists.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Antithesis</b>: There is a fundamental opposition between Christian and
    non-Christian worldviews. This means there can be no neutral ground; one
    must either be for Christ or against Him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The Noetic Effects of Sin</b>: Sin affects the mind and understanding,
    leading to a suppression of the truth. Unbelievers are not merely neutral or
    ignorant of God but actively suppress the truth of God's existence and
    authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Point of Contact</b>: Although there is antithesis between believers and
    unbelievers, there is also a point of contact because all people are created
    in the image of God and live in God's world. This common ground can be used
    to show unbelievers the inconsistency of their worldview.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Worldview Analysis</b>: Apologetics involves analyzing and critiquing the
    presuppositions of other worldviews, demonstrating their internal
    inconsistencies and inability to provide a coherent basis for knowledge,
    ethics, or meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Biblical Epistemology</b>: True knowledge begins with the fear of the
    Lord. Human knowledge is dependent and derivative, relying on God's
    revelation rather than autonomous human reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Covenantal Apologetics</b>: The relationship between God and humanity is
    covenantal. This involves understanding apologetics within the framework of
    God's redemptive history and covenantal dealings with humanity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Holistic Approach</b>: Apologetics is not just intellectual but also
    involves addressing the whole person, including their ethical, spiritual,
    and emotional aspects.
