      <h1>Economics</h1>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        "Economics is the study of the use of scarce
        resources which have alternative uses" (Thomas Sowell, 
        <a href="https://riosmauricio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Basic-Economics-5th-Edition-Thomas-Sowell.pdf" target="_blank">Basic Economics</a>, 15). 
        I want to begin
        by elaborating on several of the key terms in the definition: scarcity, resources, and alternative uses.
        Then I want to provide an example of something that is and is not an example of an economy and 
        give a short conclusion of some basic economics questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, <b>scarcity</b> refers to the limited availability of resources. Scarcity is the foundational challenge of 
        economics, as it forces individuals and societies to make choices about how to allocate finite goods and 
        services. Without scarcity, there would be no need for economics, as everyoneâ€™s needs and desires 
        would be fully satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, <b>resources</b> are the inputs available to produce goods and services. These can be natural resources like land, 
        labor resources such as human effort and skills, or capital, which includes machinery and tools used to produce 
        other goods. The finite nature of resources underpins their scarcity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, <b>alternative uses</b> refers to the fact that resources can often be employed in different ways. For instance, 
        land can be used to grow crops, build homes, or serve as a location for businesses. The need to choose among these 
        various uses is central to economic decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        To illustrate, consider a modern market economy, where resources like labor, raw materials, and technology are 
        allocated through prices, wages, and investments. In this system, economic actors must decide between various 
        potential uses for their resources, such as choosing to manufacture cars or computers. On the other hand, a 
        purely subsistence society with an abundant supply of food and no pressing scarcity of other goods would not be 
        an example of an economy in the strict sense. Without scarcity, there is no need for the decision-making framework 
        that economics provides.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, economics revolves around critical questions like: What should be produced? How should it be produced? 
        And who gets to consume what is produced? These questions arise from the problem of scarcity and must be addressed 
        in every society, making economics an essential field for understanding the trade-offs inherent in managing resources.
