        <h1>Lecture Notes on Modern Philosophy</h1>
        <h2>Lecture 5</h2>
        <h2>Introduction to Counter-Enlightenment</h2>
        <p>
          The Counter-Enlightenment emerged as a reaction to the Enlightenment
          during its height, characterized by a critique of reason,
          individualism, and progress. Key figures like Jean-Jacques Rousseau
          and David Hume challenged the foundational ideas of Enlightenment
          thought, proposing alternative views on society, epistemology, and
          human nature. The movement gained traction around the time of the
          French Revolution in 1789, a period marked by intense political and
          ideological shifts.
        </p>

        <h2>The French Revolution and Enlightenment Ideals</h2>
        <p>
          The French Revolution, beginning in 1789, was a defining moment in
          modern history. Initially rooted in Enlightenment ideals of reason,
          liberty, and universal rights, the Revolution unfolded in three
          distinct phases. The early phase, dominated by aristocrats, sought to
          reform the monarchy. However, the Revolution soon transformed into an
          ideological movement, culminating in the Declaration of the Rights of
          Man and Citizen. This document emphasized natural, universal rights
          and the shift from subjects to citizens, reflecting Enlightenment
          principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the Revolution progressed, the liberal movement lost momentum to
          the Jacobins, led by figures like Robespierre and Danton. Influenced
          by Rousseau’s ideas, the Jacobins pursued a radical and authoritarian
          agenda, inaugurating the Reign of Terror. This period of mass arrests,
          executions, and ideological purges marked a dramatic departure from
          the Revolution's liberal beginnings.
        </p>

        <h2>Jean-Jacques Rousseau: A Critique of Enlightenment Ideals</h2>
        <p>
          Rousseau rejected nearly every tenet of Enlightenment thought, from
          reason and individualism to liberal property rights. While not a
          traditional conservative, Rousseau envisioned a different modernity
          grounded in communal values and a return to a “natural” state of
          being. He criticized Enlightenment thinkers for undermining religion,
          which he viewed as a necessary check on the passions of the powerful
          and a source of solace for the suffering.
        </p>

        <p>
          For Rousseau, civilization masked a new form of slavery. The arts,
          sciences, and modern comforts distracted humanity from its loss of
          true liberty. He argued that property rights, celebrated by
          Enlightenment liberals, were the root of societal inequality and
          conflict. In his view, land and resources should belong to everyone
          collectively, rejecting both feudal and capitalist notions of
          ownership.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rousseau also attacked reason, which he claimed fostered egocentrism
          and isolated individuals. Instead, he emphasized feeling and faith as
          the true foundations of human connection and morality. His political
          philosophy, articulated in works like <em>The Social Contract</em>,
          envisioned a collective society where individuals surrender their
          personal interests to the common good, creating a new communal
          identity.
        </p>

        <h2>David Hume: Skepticism and Empiricism</h2>
        <p>
          David Hume, though rooted in the empiricist tradition of Bacon and
          Locke, reached radically skeptical conclusions about knowledge,
          identity, and causation. He argued that human understanding is based
          on impressions and memories, rejecting the existence of genuine
          abstractions or universal principles. For Hume, concepts like
          causality, the self, and external reality were not grounded in
          objective impressions but in subjective associations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hume’s famous “is-ought” distinction highlighted the difficulty of
          deriving moral principles from factual observations. He criticized the
          Enlightenment's reliance on reason as a foundation for ethics, arguing
          that human behavior is ultimately driven by passions rather than
          rationality. In his view, reason is merely a tool subordinate to
          emotional and instinctual forces.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Rousseau and Hume: Divergent Contributions to Counter-Enlightenment
        </h2>
        <p>
          While Rousseau focused on social and political issues, advocating for
          communalism and moral regeneration, Hume’s contributions were
          primarily epistemological and metaphysical. Together, they undermined
          the Enlightenment’s optimistic view of human potential and progress,
          highlighting the limitations of reason and the dangers of unrestrained
          individualism.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy of the Counter-Enlightenment</h2>
        <p>
          The Counter-Enlightenment introduced alternative pathways for modern
          thought, challenging the Enlightenment’s faith in reason and progress.
          Rousseau’s communalism and critique of property influenced socialist
          and collectivist ideologies, while Hume’s skepticism reshaped debates
          on epistemology and metaphysics. These ideas continue to shape
          philosophical and political discourse, offering a critical lens
          through which to evaluate the promises and perils of modernity.
