        <h1>Lecture Notes on Postmodern Philosophy</h1>
        <h2>Lecture 5</h2>
        <h2>The Objectivity of Science and the 20th-Century Debate</h2>
        <p>
          The mid-20th century marked an era of intense philosophical scrutiny
          regarding the nature of science. Philosophers such as Karl Popper and
          Thomas Kuhn profoundly shaped the discourse on whether science is an
          objective and progressive endeavor or a socially constructed and
          subjective practice. This discussion unfolded in the broader context
          of scientific and technological breakthroughs, such as the space race,
          which exemplified human ingenuity and ambition.
        </p>

        <h2>Karl Popper and the Criterion of Falsifiability</h2>
        <p>
          Karl Popper defended the objectivity of science, proposing
          falsifiability as its defining criterion. For Popper, a scientific
          theory must be structured in a way that it can be tested and
          potentially refuted by evidence. He emphasized that the strength of
          science lies in its willingness to expose theories to rigorous testing
          and to abandon them if falsified. This process distinguishes genuine
          science from pseudosciences like astrology or Freudian psychology,
          which, according to Popper, interpret all evidence as confirmation of
          their claims and lack refutability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Popper highlighted Einstein's theory of relativity as an exemplary
          scientific model because of its risk-laden predictions that could be
          tested and potentially disproven, such as Eddington's observations
          during a solar eclipse. This stands in contrast to theories like
          Marxism or Freudianism, which Popper criticized for explaining all
          phenomena without risking disconfirmation, making them more akin to
          myths than science.
        </p>

        <h2>Thomas Kuhn and Paradigm Shifts</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas Kuhn offered a contrasting view in "The Structure of Scientific
          Revolutions." He argued that science does not progress linearly toward
          truth but undergoes periodic paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn,
          scientific paradigms—frameworks of theories, methods, and
          assumptions—dominate scientific communities until they encounter
          anomalies that cannot be reconciled. When anomalies accumulate, a
          scientific revolution occurs, leading to the adoption of a new
          paradigm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kuhn emphasized that paradigms are incommensurable, meaning they are
          not directly comparable because they define their concepts and methods
          differently. He argued that paradigm shifts are less about objective
          evidence and more about sociological factors, likening them to
          political or religious conversions rather than rational deliberation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Philosophical Divide: Objectivity vs. Relativity</h2>
        <p>
          Popper and Kuhn represent two opposing perspectives on science. Popper
          maintained that science is an objective, self-correcting endeavor
          aimed at uncovering truths about the world. Kuhn, in contrast, viewed
          science as a socially driven process shaped by subjective commitments
          to paradigms. Kuhn’s relativistic stance challenged the Enlightenment
          ideals of progress and objectivity, suggesting that scientific
          "progress" is an illusion tied to changing paradigms rather than an
          approach to absolute truth.
        </p>

        <h2>Implications for Philosophy of Science</h2>
        <p>
          The debate between Popper and Kuhn sparked broader discussions about
          the nature of truth, progress, and the role of science in society.
          Popper’s emphasis on falsifiability reinforced the ideal of rational
          inquiry, while Kuhn’s paradigm theory encouraged skepticism about
          science as a purely objective enterprise. This philosophical divide
          influenced subsequent thinkers, including Paul Feyerabend, who further
          questioned the distinction between science and other forms of
          knowledge, such as myth and religion.
        </p>

        <h2>The Legacy of the 20th-Century Science Debate</h2>
        <p>
          The contrasting views of Popper and Kuhn continue to shape
          contemporary discussions in the philosophy of science. While Popper’s
          model emphasizes rigor and accountability in scientific practice,
          Kuhn’s insights reveal the sociocultural dynamics that influence
          scientific communities. Together, their works provide a nuanced
          understanding of science as both an empirical and a human enterprise,
          navigating the tension between objectivity and subjectivity.
