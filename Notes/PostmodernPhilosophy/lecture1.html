        <h2>Lecture 1</h2>
        <h2>Uncertain Prospects in Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          The year 1912 marks a significant moment in both history and
          philosophy. Events such as the sinking of the Titanic symbolize a
          broader uncertainty. In art, Cubism emerges, dismantling and
          reassembling perceptions, while in Russia, the Bolsheviks break from a
          Marx-inspired socialist movement. Philosophy mirrors these
          disruptions, grappling with its role and relevance in a rapidly
          changing world.
        </p>

        <h2>Bertrand Russell and the Problems of Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Bertrand Russell's 1912 work, "The Problems of Philosophy," captures
          the philosophical state of his time. Russell reflects on the legacy of
          philosophical giants like Plato, Descartes, and Kant, critiquing their
          rationalist tendencies. His focus is on issues such as the distinction
          between appearance and reality, the existence of matter, and the
          nature of universals. Yet, he concludes that philosophy offers no
          definitive answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Russell argues that the value of philosophy lies not in its
          practicality or definitive truths but in its ability to expand the
          mind and question assumptions. He views philosophy as a mental
          discipline that fosters open-mindedness and liberates individuals from
          dogmatic constraints, offering a broader perspective on existence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Shift from Certainty to Uncertainty</h2>
        <p>
          Russell emphasizes the uncertainty intrinsic to philosophical inquiry,
          suggesting that this lack of resolution is a virtue. By challenging
          claims of absolute truth, philosophy discourages arrogance and
          encourages humility. This intellectual flexibility is seen as
          philosophy's most significant contribution to human thought, providing
          freedom from societal conventions and narrow perspectives.
        </p>

        <h2>John Dewey and Pragmatism</h2>
        <p>
          In contrast to Russell, John Dewey champions a pragmatic approach to
          philosophy, deeply influenced by Darwinian evolution. Dewey rejects
          fixed, eternal truths and emphasizes change and adaptability. He
          argues that Darwin's work transforms philosophical thought by
          discarding teleological assumptions and embracing a dynamic
          understanding of existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dewey critiques traditional religious and philosophical frameworks,
          positioning them as conservative and resistant to innovation. He
          asserts that humanity must take responsibility for shaping its
          destiny, abandoning reliance on transcendent authorities. This
          pragmatic perspective emphasizes problem-solving and engagement with
          the material world.
        </p>

        <h2>Reconciling Russell and Dewey</h2>
        <p>
          While Russell and Dewey differ in their approaches, they share a
          skepticism about philosophy's ability to provide absolute knowledge.
          Russell's idealism celebrates intellectual abstraction, while Dewey's
          pragmatism values practical results. Both reject traditional
          certainties, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of 20th-century
          philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their divergent yet complementary views underscore a broader
          philosophical transition. Philosophy, now unmoored from its historical
          quest for ultimate truths, embraces uncertainty, practicality, and
          adaptability as central themes in its ongoing inquiry into human
          existence.
