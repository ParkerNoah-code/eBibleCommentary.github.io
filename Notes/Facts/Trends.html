      >Ten Global Trends Every Smart Person Should Know</a
    >" by Ronald Bailey and Marian L. Tupy:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Poverty</b>: Extreme poverty is declining globally. The percentage of
    people living in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1.90 per
    day) has fallen dramatically from around 42% in 1981 to less than 10% in
    recent years.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Life Expectancy</b>: Life expectancy has increased significantly
    worldwide. Improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition have
    contributed to a rise in average global life expectancy from 52 years in
    1960 to over 72 years today.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Child Mortality</b>: Child mortality rates have decreased sharply. The
    number of children dying before their fifth birthday has fallen from 18.2
    million in 1960 to 4.6 million in recent years, thanks to better medical
    care and improved living conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Food Supply</b>: Global food supply has improved. Agricultural
    advancements have led to higher food production, and the percentage of
    undernourished people in the world has decreased from 28% in 1970 to about
    11% today.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Income</b>: Global income levels are rising. The world has seen a
    significant increase in median incomes, with more people moving into the
    middle class, particularly in developing countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Peace</b>: The world is experiencing fewer wars and violent conflicts.
    Despite ongoing conflicts in certain regions, the overall number of wars and
    battle deaths has declined since the mid-20th century.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Education</b>: Educational attainment has improved globally. More people
    are receiving formal education, with literacy rates rising from 56% in 1950
    to over 86% today.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Environment</b>: Environmental conditions are improving in many areas.
    There have been successes in reducing pollution, conserving natural
    habitats, and increasing the use of renewable energy sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Freedom</b>: Human freedom is expanding. More people are living in
    democratic societies, and civil liberties have increased in many parts of
    the world over the past few decades.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Population</b>: Population growth rates are stabilizing. While the global
    population continues to grow, the rate of growth is slowing down, and many
    countries are experiencing declining birth rates.
