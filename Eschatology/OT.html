        <h2>Genesis 2:17</h2>
        <p>
          "but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;
          for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die."
        </p>
        <p>
          God warned Adam that he would surely die if he ate from the tree of
          the knowledge of good and evil. Natural, literal death is clearly
          intended here. Hence, in Genesis 3:19, God says, "you are dust, and
          you shall return to dust." The curses causing difficulty in working
          the land and in childbirth also indicate that death is intended.
          Therefore, God kicked Adam out of the garden when he sinned, "lest he
          reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and
          live forever" (Gen 3:22). Paul explains that "as sin entered into the
          world through one man, and death through sin, so death passed to all
          men because all sinned." (Rom 5:12). Everyone in Adam is destined to
          perish and die.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Revelation, it is revealed that believers will get to partake of
          the tree of life and live forevermore: "On this side of the river and
          on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding
          its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of
          the nations." (Rev 22:2). Paul explains that believers will be made
          unable to die: "The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The
          second man is the Lord from heaven... Now I say this, brothers, that
          flesh and blood can’t inherit God’s Kingdom; neither does the
          perishable inherit imperishable... For this perishable body must
          become imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality." (1 Cor
          15:47, 50, 53).
        </p>
        <p>
          It follows that some will not inherit the imperishable nor receive
          immortality. They will be subject to everlasting death and won't
          obtain to the final age: "But those who are considered worthy to
          attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry
          nor are given in marriage. For they can’t die any more, for they are
          like the angels and are children of God, being children of the
          resurrection" (Lk 20:35-36).

          Victor P. Hamilton, The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17, NICOT (Grand
          Rapids: Eerdmans, 1990), pg. 172: "Here in 2:17 we have translated it
          as
          <em>as surely as</em> on the basis of its occasional use as an idiom
          meaning 'for certain,' as in 1 K. 2:37, 42, where Shimei is threatened
          with death 'on the day you go forth and cross the brook Kidron.' As
          the next few verses indicate, Shimei could not possibly have been
          executed 'on the day' he exited his house. The verse is underscoring
          the certainty of death, not its chronology."

          >, 2017: "In other words, 'you will certainly die' became true
          instantly, as a kind of death sentence or curse. In the Hebrew, this
          phrase is a language construct known as an infinitive absolute. It has
          no exact equivalent in English, and should be read not as a statement
          about when death will occur, but rather to emphasize the certainty of
          death being incurred."

          Anthony Hoekema, Created in God's Image (Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2009)
          ch 8: "We come now to the last part of the judgment on the man: God
          tells him he will return to the ground from which he was taken—'for
          dust you are and to dust you will return' (v. 19). Since man had been
          formed from the dust of the ground (2:7), it is obvious that these
          words describe physical death. Though some theologians taught that man
          would have died anyway, whether he had sinned or not, the fact that
          these words occur as part of God’s judgment on man because of the
          first sin indicates that physical death is one of the results of sin.
          God warned that death would be one of the results of Adam’s
          transgression in the so-called Probationary Command: 'But you must not
          eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when (or in
          the day that) you eat of it you will surely die' (Gen. 2:17)."

          Michael Horton, A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way,
          (Zondervan: Grand Rapids, 2011), 908: "However, in Scripture there is
          no assumption that the soul is immortal. Rather, like the body, it is
          a created substance with a beginning and an end. Immortality was the
          goal held out to Adam and Eve in the Tree of Life, and not merely for
          the soul but for the whole person. It is this immortality that was
          forfeited by Adam but has been promised to those who trust in Jesus
          Christ."

            >Four Discourses Against the Arians</a
          >: "And thus since the truth declares that the Word is not by nature a
          creature, it is fitting now to say, in what sense He is 'beginning of
          ways.' For when the first way, which was through Adam, was lost, and
          in place of paradise we deviated unto death, and heard the words,
          'Dust you are, and unto dust Genesis 3:19 shall you return,' therefore
          the Word of God, who loves man, puts on Him created flesh at the
          Father's will, that whereas the first man had made it dead through the
          transgression, He Himself might quicken it in the blood of His own
          body, and might open 'for us a way new and living,' as the Apostle
          says, 'through the veil, that is to say, His flesh Hebrews 10:20;'
          which he signifies elsewhere thus, 'Wherefore, if any man be in
          Christ, he is a new creation; old things are passed away, behold all
          things have become new 2 Corinthians 5:17'" (2.65).
        </p>
        <p>
          "To provide against this also, He sends His own Son, and He becomes
          Son of Man, by taking created flesh; that, since all were under
          sentence of death, He, being other than them all, might Himself for
          all offer to death His own body; and that henceforth, as if all had
          died through Him, the word of that sentence might be accomplished (for
          'all died 2 Corinthians 5:14 ' in Christ), and all through Him might
          thereupon become free from sin and from the curse which came upon it,
          and might truly abide for ever, risen from the dead and clothed in
          immortality and incorruption" (2.69).

          (2012), 22: "The disparity extends neither to the mode (i.e.,
          imputation) of the work of Adam and Christ impacting those whom each
          represents nor to the “life/death” issues that were set before each
          federal head. The fact that Christ purchased eternal “life” for his
          own, and that he did so for those who were eternally “dead” in Adam
          means that Christ’s work was intended to remedy what Adam had wrought
          (death), and to accomplish what Adam had failed to do (life)."

        <p>
          The phrase gnashing of teeth indicates anger, annoyance, and being
          upset at the inability to stop something. Here it is used in
          conjunction with the wicked melting away and perishing. It does not
          suggest a perpetual process of suffering. Neither is gnashing of teeth

          This verse does not teach the immortality of the soul. The Hebrew word
          "olam" is commonly translated as "darkness," "eternity," or "the
          future." This verse is about the insatiable longing for and awareness
          of something beyond this world that God has instilled in human hearts.
          Humans possess an inherent sense of something beyond the temporal
          world. Yet we are unable to fully understand God's workings or be
          ultimately satisfied in this world. This verse describes that
          existential reality.

        <p>
          Isaiah isn't denying a general future resurrection of all. He's
          denying that the wicked will get to participate in the resurrection
          life to come. They will come out "to the resurrection of judgment"
          while those saved by Jesus will come out "to the resurrection of life"
          (Jn 5:29). The wicked will face eternal destruction from the fires of
          Gehenna.

          is a fire that will devour you. The peoples will be like the burning
          of lime, like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire... The
          sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who

          Isaiah provides the background for many of the New Testament’s
          teachings about hell. Chaff being burned represents complete devouring
          and destruction (Mat 3:12). Trees (Mat 7:19), weeds (Mat 13:40), and
          thorns and thistles (Heb 6:8) likewise are cut down and burned up. The
          obvious answer to Isaiah's rhetorical question, who among us can live,
          is that they will not be able to continue living in the midst of
          everlasting, devouring fire (Mat 18:8). The fire does not turn them
          into a juggernaut that can take on endless fire. While it may be
          possible to withstand fire for 5 or 10 minutes, this imagery conveys
          an utterly destructive power that will obliterate the wicked.

        <h2>Isaiah 34:2-5, 8-10</h2>
        <p>
          "For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, and angry with all
          their armies. He has utterly destroyed them. He has given them over
          for slaughter. Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of
          their dead bodies will come up. The mountains will melt in their
          blood. All of the army of the sky will be dissolved. The sky will be
          rolled up like a scroll, and all its armies will fade away, as a leaf
          fades from off a vine or a fig tree. For my sword has drunk its fill
          in the sky. Behold, it will come down on Edom, and on the people of my
          curse, for judgment... For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of
          recompense for the cause of Zion. Its streams will be turned into
          pitch, its dust into sulfur, and its land will become burning pitch.
          It won’t be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From
          generation to generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass through
          it forever and ever."
        </p>

        <h2>Isaiah 66:15-16</h2>
        <p>
          "For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be
          like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his
          rebuke with flames of fire. For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire
          and by his sword on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be
          many."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus is the one who will execute judgment by a "flaming fire" (2 Thes
          1:7). The sword of judgment will fall on the lawless one, "whom the
          Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the
          manifestation of his coming" (2 Thes 2:8). Thus, many will be slain
          and face the penalty of "eternal destruction from the face of the Lord
          and from the glory of his might" (2 Thes 1:8).
        </p>

        <h2>Isaiah 66:22-24</h2>
        <p>
          "'For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
          remain before me,' says Yahweh, 'so your offspring and your name shall
          remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from
          one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,'
          says Yahweh. 'They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men
          who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor
          will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all
          mankind.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus uses this imagery of the worm not dying and the fire not being
          quenched in conjunction with Gehenna, a valley of dead bodies that
          serves as a picture of the final end for unbelievers. Notice that the
          context in both is about dead bodies in the new heavens and new earth.
          The worms will devour. The fire will completely consume. The
          unrighteous will forever be remembered with contempt. Though
          "unquenchable fire" strikes modern as eternal torment, the Old
          Testament background demonstrates that it refers to a consuming fire
          that cannot be extinguished.
        </p>

        <h2>Jeremiah 7:32-33 // 19:6-13</h2>
        <p>
          "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no more
          be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The
          valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no
          place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for the
          birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will
          frighten them away.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the background for Jesus' teaching about Gehenna (what is
          commonly translated hell, the final end for the unsaved). Gehenna will
          be called "The Valley of Slaughter." God will slay His enemies there.
          The worms, birds, and other scavengers will devour the dead bodies
          while fire burns up and consumes them. This picture intensely portrays
          death, destruction, and annihilation, not eternal torment.
        </p>

        <h2>Jeremiah 31:38-40</h2>
        <p>
          "'Behold, the days come,' says Yahweh, 'that the city will be built to
          Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner. The
          measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb,
          and will turn toward Goah. The whole valley of the dead bodies and of
          the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of
          the horse gate toward the east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be
          plucked up or thrown down any more forever.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Daniel 12:2</h2>
        <p>
          "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to
          everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal
          life, and some to disgrace and eternal contempt." [CSB]
        </p>
        <p>
          "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake,
          these to everlasting life, but the others to reproach and everlasting
          contempt." [LSB]
        </p>
        <p>
          "And the multitude of those sleeping in the dust of the ground do
          awake, some to life age-during, and some to reproaches -- to
          abhorrence age-during." [YTL]
        </p>
        <p>
          Contempt is the same word as

            >loathsome</a
          >
          in Isaiah 66:24, the only other occurance of that word in the Old
          Testament. Both verses speak of the comtempt of believers for the
          wicked.

          contempt outlives them."

        <h2>Nahum 1:8-10</h2>
        <p>
          "But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place,
          and will pursue his enemies into darkness. What do you plot against
          Yahweh? He will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second
          time. For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they
          are consumed utterly like dry stubble."
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to the traditional belief that God will keep His enemies
          alive forever to keep sinning, God will instead make a full end to
          evil. He will pursue His enemies into the depths of Sheol. They will
          all be completely consumed like straw. God will have complete victory
          over sin and death and evil.

        <h2>Malachi 4:1-3</h2>
        <p>
          "'For behold, the day comes, burning like a furnace, when all the
          proud and all who work wickedness will be stubble. The day that comes
          will burn them up,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'so that it will leave them
          neither root nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of
          righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and
          leap like calves of the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for
          they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I
          make,' says Yahweh of Armies."
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those
            who afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us
            when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
            in flaming fire, punishing those who don’t know God, and to those
            who don’t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus, who will pay the
            penalty: eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the
            glory of his might, when he comes in that day to be glorified in his
            saints and to be admired among all those who have believed, because
            our testimony to you was believed." (2 Thes 1:6-10).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          God's destruction of the wicked will be complete. There will be no
          part left untouched by the burning furnace and no part left
          unconsumed. They will be like "natural animals to be taken and
          destroyed" and "will in their destroying surely be destroyed" (2 Pet
          2:12). Only the righteous will arise to healing and life. All those
          who work wickedness will rise to judgment and be burned up with
          unquenchable fire so that only ashes remain.
