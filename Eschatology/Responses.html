        <h2>John M. Frame</h2>
        <p>

            >Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</a
          >
          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2013). In response to the chapter
          called "Eternal Punishment of Unbelievers (Hell)," pgs. 1081-1083:
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Frame admits that he is reluctant to write about the topic of
          hell, unpleasant as it is, he states, "I must teach only what the
          Bible teaches." This is certainly to be commended; however, the
          question still remains, what does the Bible teach about hell?
        </p>
        <p>
          I certainly agree with Frame that all sinners are under the just
          condemnation of a holy God and in need of a savior. We are saved by
          faith in the Son of God who died on the cross for us. His death
          provides atonement for our sins, but the wrath of God remains on those
          who don't believe in the Son. Frame cites Exodus 15:6-7 to explain the
          wrath of God, but it also provides important background information
          about the consuming fire of God:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand,
            Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces. In the greatness of your
            excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send
            out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Frame states that the "OT descriptions of God's wrath mainly concern
          what happens in this life." The Old Testament speaks of God's enemies
          being slain, consumed by fire, and put to an end. He is beginning to
          try to create a contrast between Old and New Testament language of
          destruction because he believes that the New Testament teaches eternal
          conscious torment. However, the New Testament uses Old Testament
          language to describe eschatological judgment. If the Old Testament
          descriptions are of annihilation, it provides strong support for
          conditionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then makes the argument that punishment in this life could never
          satisfy God's law and cites Hebrews 10:26-27:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
            truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain
            fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will
            devour the adversaries."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This sounds awfully familiar to the outcome of God's enemies in the
          Old Testament. The traditional view does not teach that God's enemies
          will be consumed and devoured. Instead, it teaches that they will
          continue burning alive forever. Thus far, no support for the
          traditional view can be found while much of the language cited
          provides support for conditionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists agree with Frame that the final "punishment is
          everlasting," but Romans 6:23 explains what the punishment for sin is:
          "the wages of sin is death." Frame cites Matthew 25:46 to support the
          eternal aspect of the final judgment:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
            eternal life."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Notice that Jesus contrasts eternal punishment with eternal life. The
          final punishment doesn't include eternal life. Traditionalists argue
          that the wicked will be made immortal and granted eternal life to
          suffer in hell forever. Conditionalists, on the other hand, argue that
          the wicked will not receive eternal life but perish eternally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Frame reveals the real impetus behind his belief in eternal
          conscious torment: Revelation 14:11. And like most traditionalist
          treatments on hell, there is no consideration given to the context,
          genre, or background of the verse. It's just cited as if it came out
          of a textbook, rather than an apocalyptic book full of Old Testament
          allusions and symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frame's only response to annihilationism is that "Scripture suggests
          the opposite, that not only does the fire continue forever, but the
          torment of the wicked continues forever as well (Rev. 14:11; 20:10)."
          This is not a substantial explanation. If we remember that John's
          vision is of a representation of the final judgment (it's symbolic),
          then we see that Frame hasn't even started to give a biblical argument
          for eternal conscious torment because he hasn't tried to interpret any
          of the symbols. Both passages are describing the final judgment. John
          interprets the lake of fire in Revelation 20:10 in clear language two
          times. The lake of fire is the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8). It
          means dying a second time, both body and soul (Mat 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He provides several references in parentheses for support which, when
          understood in context, provide vivid pictures of annihilation. Mark
          9:43 and 48 contain a quote to Isaiah 66:24, a passage indicating that
          the fires will be inextinguishable, thus burning up the dead bodies
          completely. Luke 16:22-24 and 28 are not even about hell, but about
          Hades, the intermediate state, demonstrating the sloppiness of
          exegesis needed to provide support for the traditional view.
          Revelation 14:11 and 19:3 both indicate that smoke rises forever.
          Likewise, the smoke rises forever from Edom which was destroyed by
          unquenchable fire (Isa 34:8-10). The everlasting smoke symbolizes the
          remembrance of a judgment which results in complete destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other verses in Scripture are very clear on this issue too. Paul
          teaches that sin leads to death and destruction. The language of
          eschatological perishing and dying is used all over the New Testament.
          The Old Testament is very clear about the fate of the wicked too. All
          of that clear teaching can't be reinterpreted based upon the
          non-exegesis of Revelation. Unfortunately, that's what most defenses
          of the traditional view amount to.

        <h2>Robert L. Reymond</h2>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Systematic-Theology-Christian-Faith/dp/0310108950/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28T6DJ3YT10PO&keywords=robert+l+reymond&qid=1703649614&sprefix=robert+l+reymond%2Caps%2C77&sr=8-1"
            target="_blank"
            >A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith: 2nd Edition</a
          >, 2020. In response to the chapter called "Eternal Punishment
          Construed as Annihilation," pgs. 1068-1081:
        </p>
        <p>
          Reymond says in the beginning of this section that John gives us a
          "graphic representation of hell," but just after that, he quotes
          Revelation 14:9-11 and states that "<em>eternal conscious torment</em>
          is [here] said to be the punishment of those who have the mark of the
          beast." These two statements contradict. John is not giving
          straightforward, didactic teaching about hell. He's recording a
          pictorial representation of the final judgment that he sees in a
          vision, not a vision of hell itself. The Old Testament background,
          parallel judgment passages, and John's own interpretation of the
          symbols are keys to understanding what that imagery represents.
          Reymond completely disregards the context and takes his own
          interpretation for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if we take the passage at face value without interpreting what
          each symbol represents, Reymond's interpretation of eternal conscious
          torment still does not follow. John only states that these people will
          be tormented in fire, won't have any rest for a time, and that the
          smoke rising from this judgment will last forever. Traditionalist
          scholar G. K. Beale agrees that an annihilationist reading is possible
          because "Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great judgment that will be
          remembered forever, not one that leads to eternal suffering" (<a
            href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/762/mode/1up"
            target="_blank"
            >The Book of Revelation</a
          >, 762). Furthermore, there are conditionalists that do believe that
          eternal conscious torment is being depicted here that symbolizes
          annihilation. Either way, Reymond has decided that eternal conscious
          torment is the correct view ahead of time and skips the necessary
          exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demonstrates a common interpretive problem when it comes to this
          issue. Revelation may be the hardest book to interpret in the New
          Testament. It is full of symbolism and Old Testament allusions which
          are not readily understood by people in a context removed from the
          original audience. Thus, taking a surface level reading of Revelation
          14:9-11 or 20:10, concluding that it teaches eternal conscious
          torment, and then reading that view back into every other passage
          about hell is completely backwards and irresponsible hermeneutically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that short argument from Revelation, Reymond finishes his very
          first paragraph by concluding that "it is clear that the divine
          judgment awaiting evil-doers is certain, just, and eternal." Every
          conditionalist would agree wholeheartedly with this conclusion, except
          that Reymond clearly means eternal torment is certain. Not only is
          this misrepresenting conditionalism as if it denies eternal punishment
          before he has even explained the position, but it's also presenting
          that poor exegesis of Revelation as if it's decisive. Reymond has
          already precluded the possibility of conditionalism with absolutely no
          biblical support offered. The eisegesis that follows was inevitable
          from his starting position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reymond addresses very few Old Testament passages because of his
          presupposition of eternal conscious torment. The Old Testament has
          much to say about the final death and destruction of the wicked, and
          God putting a final end to evil. However, the few texts cited still
          provide a vivid picture of annihilation: the fiery destruction of
          Sodom and Gomorrah, the destruction of Sihon killing every man, woman,
          and child, the principle of herem ("devotion") to the Lord for
          complete destruction, the fact that every evil deed will be judged,
          and the prophecy that the redeemed will go out in the new heavens and
          new earth to look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against God
          which are being eaten by worms and burned up.
        </p>
        <p>
          That last image comes from Isaiah 66:22-24. The only comment on this
          passage is a quote from a commentary. It affirms that this passage is
          indeed about the final state but explains away the obvious
          conditionalist implications by calling it a "monstrous and
          inconceivable" picture. Actually, it's very clear. The picture is of
          dead bodies that were slain, burned up, consumed, and looked on with
          contempt. It then cites Mark 9:48 as support that this is a picture of
          eternal torment, but that argument is completely circular. Jesus
          quotes from this passage in Mark 9:48, not to reinterpret it to mean
          the exact opposite of what it means in context, but because this
          passage is an accurate description of Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament section is hurt by the bad exegesis of the Old
          Testament. Jesus uses the phrase "unquenchable fire" because the fire
          can't be put out so that it completely consumes. Reymond acknowledges
          that the garbage dump theory of Gehenna comes "from late Jewish
          tradition (David Qimchi, c. A.D. 1200)" and has no support, but he
          nevertheless wrongly treats that as the primary background over and
          against the Old Testament. Even if we accepted the garbage dump
          theory, the garbage would be burned up anyway. It doesn't actually
          help his case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weeping primarily indicates sadness. Gnashing teeth primarily
          indicates anger. Weeping and gnashing are not said to last eternally
          and are accurate descriptions of people on death row or being burned
          alive. He says that a "more bearable" (Mat 10:15) judgment day on an
          annihilationist view is difficult to comprehend because everyone ends
          up dead. Being instantly incinerated versus being burned alive for
          hours clearly represent two different degrees of capital punishment.
          On the contrary, it is extremely hard to comprehend how the
          traditional view accounts for different degrees of punishment when one
          sin merits the same punishment as a billion sins, eternal suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the intermediate state consists of torment, it does not follow
          that the eternal state consists of eternal torment. Just because the
          demons expect torment in the future (Mat 8:29), doesn't mean that they
          expect eternal torment (and so what if they did?). Tartarus in 2 Peter
          2:4 does not refer to hell. It is the holding place for angels until
          the judgment. That is just another factual error from Reymond.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for some reason, even though Reymond and Vos think the language of
          2 Thessalonians 1:9 is of annihilation, Vos thinks "that
          'annihilation' is an extremely abstract idea, too philosophical, in
          fact." It's not that complicated. It just means their final death. He
          also argues that Paul couldn't have been thinking of annihilation
          because Jesus taught eternal torment in the gospels. This shows the
          potential danger of arguing based on the analogy of scripture when you
          fail to interpret other passages properly. It's better to carefully
          exegete the text before attempting to apply systematic theology to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entire chapter illustrates how a bad starting point,
          misinterpreting a passage in Revelation, led to systematic
          misinterpretation of other passages about the final fate of the
          wicked. It also illustrates that we can't be dogmatic about tradition.
          We must test all things by the Word of God. Reymond concludes the New
          Testament section without an in depth treatment of Revelation, but he
          assures us of his interpretation about the fires of Revelation by
          stating that "we should understand the realities these biblical
          passages seek to represent to be
          <em>more</em>—not less—horrible than their word depictions." However,
          having a more intolerable, dreadful, and harsh view of hell does not
          make it correct or more convincing.

          Annihilationism, pgs. 199-220:
        </p>

        <p>
          Morey's arguments are much better suited to argue against Froom and
          Seventh-Day Adventists. Unfortunately, he doesn't address the kind of
          exegetical and theological points evangelical conditionalists use to
          support conditional immortality.
        </p>

        <p><b>A Brief History</b></p>
        <p>
          Morey begins by attempting to give a brief history of conditional
          immortality. He claims that annihilationism "was first advanced by
          Arnobius" in the fourth century whom he calls a "Christian" in quotes.
          The
          <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01746c.htm" target="_blank"
            >Catholic Encyclopedia</a
          >
          notes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Arnobius is more earnest in his defence of Christianity than
            correct in his tenets," but "Arnobius is a vigorous apologist for
            the Christian Faith, defends and expounds its noble monotheism (<em
              >deus princeps, deus summus</em
            >), the Divinity of Christ and of the Christian religion, proved by
            its rapid diffusion, its incredible influence over uncivilized
            peoples, and its agreement with the views of the best philosophers."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It would be convenient for Morey if Arnobius really were the first
          proponent of conditionalism several hundred years after the New
          Testament but that simply isn't true. Arnobius was following a
          tradition of conditionalists. It appears that all of the Apostolic
          Fathers and many early Christians were conditionalists, but one
          example suffices to refute the claim that Arnobius is the first. That
          Irenaeus (c. A.D. 120-200) is a conditionalist is very clear in
          multiple places and is widely recognized by traditionalist scholars.
          Irenaeus in

          (2.34.3) writes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>

            ever; indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts
            continuance for ever and ever on those who are saved... If you have
            not been faithful in that which is little, who will give you that
            which is great? indicating that those who, in this brief temporal
            life, have shown themselves ungrateful to Him who bestowed it, shall
            justly not receive from Him length of days for ever and ever."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Morey's historical argument thus falls flat. It was not a later,
          biblically illiterate Christian who first taught conditionalism as
          Morey portrays it, but a stream of Christians from the earliest times
          after the New Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey repeats the often made claim that the
          <a
            href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xii.x.html"
            target="_blank"
            >Second Council of Constantinople</a
          >
          (A.D. 553) condemned conditionalism as heresy. He provides no quote
          but is most likely referring to anathematism IX which says, "If anyone
          says or thinks that the punishment of demons and of impious men is
          only temporary, and will one day have an end, and that a restoration
          will take place of demons and of impious men, let him be anathema."
          However, this is a condemnation against Origen's universalism, and
          says nothing contrary to conditionalism. On the annihilation view, the
          punishment is eternal and no restoration will ever take place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree with Morey that the traditional view of hell is widespread
          after Augustine, but as traditionalist scholar Graham Keith notes, "a
          century or so after Constantine [the 5th century] we have a surprising
          amount of evidence indicating widespread denial of eternal [conscious]
          punishment within the church" (<a
            href="https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1999-3_217.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >Patristic Views on Hell―Part 1</a
          >). Even at so late a date, ECT was still widely denied in the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also agree with Morey that a theologian believing in soul sleep does
          not imply that they believe in annihilationism. He claims that many
          annihilationists argue that soul sleep implies annihilationism citing
          Froom as an example, but I've never heard that claim before.
          Annihilationism is about the final state and doesn't commit one to
          soul sleep which is about the intermediate state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although conditionalism is held by several cult groups today,
          Seventh-Day Adventists are an example of a Christian denomination that
          holds to conditionalism. Morey claims that the publishing of
          <em>The Fire That Consumes</em> by Edward Fudge was done with the hope
          to "introduce Adventist theology into evangelical circles" almost
          conspiratorially. But the question of conditional immortality is quite
          apart from other Seventh-Day Adventist doctrines. Even if that was the
          intention, conditionalism is held by many evangelicals across
          different denominations.
        </p>
        <p>
          He ends the first section by claiming that annihilationism is on the
          rise because of liberalism and "is regrettably the result of a weak
          view of Scripture which has been developing in certain evangelical
          circles over the last 25 years." But that is incredibly uncharitable
          to those who are committed to biblical inerrancy and believe the Bible
          teaches conditional immortality. It also poisons the well by painting
          conditionalism as the liberal view before addressing even a single
          biblical text. A doctrine being taught widely in the church makes it
          traditional, not biblical! It has to come from the Bible to properly
          be described as biblical.
        </p>

        <p><b>A Theological Analysis</b></p>
        <p>
          For some strange reason, Morey equates conditional immortality with
          materialism. He claims that "both deny that man has an immaterial soul
          and that man’s soul or spirit survives the death of the body," but
          this is certainly false. As far as the first claim, some
          conditionalists are anthropological physicalists while others are
          dualists. Christian physicalism is not materialism because it affirms
          the existence of God and other spiritual realities. It just denies
          that man's soul is an immaterial substance. For the second claim,
          while evangelical conditionalism teaches that God will "destroy both
          soul and body in Gehenna" (Mat 10:28), it affirms that everyone's soul
          survives death until the general resurrection and final judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey continues to present annihilationism as a cultic view stating
          that "we must point out that it is generally in connection with cultic
          or neo-cultic organizations that this belief is found." If
          conditionalism is such a plainly unbiblical belief, we wouldn't need
          all the inaccurate historical and theological priming against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contra Froom's introduction, conditionalism is attested early, is not
          a form of materialism, was not condemed as heretical by the Second
          Council of Constantinople, is not an inherently cultic or liberal
          belief, has no inherent connection to other Seventh-Day Adventist
          beliefs, and has strong biblical arguments for it that need to be
          addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey raises and responds to twelve conditionalist arguments in the
          next section which primarily come from Froom's
          <em>The Conditionalist Faith of Our Fathers</em> (1965). I have not
          read that work, but I am not impressed by it based on Morey's
          relaying. Edward Fudge's <em>The Fire that Consumes</em> (1982) is
          barely addressed, but I think it is a much stronger presentation of
          conditionalism.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 1</b></p>
        <p>
          Morey responds to the claim that conditionalist arguments have been
          ignored and adds the gripe that the label "traditionalism" implies
          that ECT is only held because of tradition and not the Bible. While
          not an argument for conditionalism, I definitely agree that
          conditionalist arguments have not been given substantial responses and
          that the traditional view is predominantly held because of tradition.
          Morey mentions "Bartlett, Boettner, Grant, A. Hodge, Hovey, Landis,
          Stuart, Martin, etc." as writers who have responded to conditionalism.
          I have not read all of them, but older writers such as Herman Bavinck
          are primarily responding to liberal and emotional arguments. Many
          modern traditionalists such as Morey or Robert L. Reymond continue to
          argue against many of the same bad arguments instead of addressing
          robust evangelical proponents of conditionalism such as Edward Fudge.
          Mischaracterizations and sloppiness abound in traditionalist works.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while responses do exist, there are few serious responses. There
          are even prominent traditionalists who agree with that assessment.
          James White for example agrees that most proponents of ECT are
          following it because of tradition and not because of any firm biblical
          understanding, though he does believe the Bible teaches it (<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Kclj_vN48"

            >Is the Punishment of Hell Temporary or Eternal?</a
          >).
        </p>

        <p><b>Arguments 2, 3, and 12</b></p>
        <p>
          These are against soul sleep. I don't believe in soul sleep, so I
          agree with Morey here, but it's irrelevant to the issue at hand. Morey
          does have a common modern misunderstanding about the final state
          though. Unbelievers do not go straight to hell when they die. They go
          to hades (the grave). This is known as the intermediate state. It is
          only after the general resurrection of all that they face the final
          judgment and are sent to Gehenna. This again has support from
          traditionalists. James White says, "It seems rather obvious to me that
          hell is the final state. You go to Hades, and then death and Hades are
          cast into the Lake of Fire, the Book of Revelation, at the end" (<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVqPf5pXkJM"
            target="_blank"
            >Francis' Empty Hell, Brandan's Empty Bible</a
          >, 6:48).
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey assumes (as does Froom it seems) that the intermediate state
          must be exactly like the eternal state, but that is a faulty
          assumption. The intermediate state is like a holding cell until the
          resurrection, judgment, and final damnation to Gehenna. There is no
          reason to conflate the two when the Bible does not. The intermediate
          state could consist of the worst torment imaginable, but that would
          not change the fact that the wicked will face the second death on
          judgment day.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 4</b></p>
        <p>
          The conditionalist argument given is that Sheol and Hades both mean
          grave, so there is no intermediate state but instead immediate death.
          This is a really bad argument. Morey rightly rejects it, but for the
          wrong reason. Hades really is the grave contrary to what Morey says,
          but at the end of the age, Hades will give up the dead so that they
          can be judged: "Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.
          They were judged, each one according to his works" (Rev 20:13).
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 5</b></p>
        <p>
          The most common terms for the fate of the wicked are "destroyed,"
          "consumed", "perish," etc., which must "mean that they pass into
          nonexistence." Annihilation does not mean nonexistent, but killed,
          destroyed, unalived. The given answer to this argument is that
          <em>apollumi</em>
          doesn't actually mean destroyed, but "ruin, loss... of well-being."
          There is a good reason Bible translations don't translate it that way.
          When people are "apollumi-ed," they are killed, destroyed, and lose
          their life. When objects are "apollumi-ed," they are ruined or lost.

        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 6</b></p>
        <p>
          Eternal life means living forever. Only the righteous get eternal
          life. Therefore, only the righteous will live forever. This is a super
          simple and effective argument. His response is that eternal life
          actually means "a quality of divine life." It's obvious that he isn't
          taking the language in a natural way. Of course, eternal life has a
          positive quality or connotation to it, but the phrase eternal life
          does mean living forever. Just as the Israelites looked to the raised
          serpent to save their lives temporarily (Jn 3:14-15), we look to Jesus
          to save our lives eternally (Jn 3:16). This isn't complicated or
          cryptic language.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 7</b></p>
        <p>
          1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God has immortality, so man is not
          immortal. I agree with Morey's response that this means that only God
          has absolute immortality. However, I disagree that the unrighteous
          will be granted immortality. Post-fall humans are mortal, and eternal
          life and immortality are a gift for the righteous at the resurrection
          (1 Cor 15). The burden of proof is on Morey to show that the
          unrighteous will be granted eternal life and immortality too.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 8</b></p>
        <p>
          He presents the argument that Gehenna is a garbage dump whose fire and
          worms will go out after the trash is consumed. However, the first
          claim that Gehenna was a garbage dump comes from Rabbi David Kimhi
          around A.D. 1200. This mistake doesn't help his case though. The
          context for Gehenna in Jeremiah 7 indicates that the fire and worms
          will burn up and consume
          <em>dead bodies</em>. Gehenna is prophesied to be called the Valley of
          Slaughter because God is going to slay His enemies there. But even if
          a dump were the background, of course the garbage would be burned up
          and the garbage would still represent corpses which couldn't feel
          torment regardless.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 9</b></p>
        <p>
          I don't argue that olam, aion, and aionios mean something other than
          eternal, but eternal undeniably can refer to something either eternal
          in process or eternal in result when referring to certain nouns.
          Examples: Eternal salvation means something is eternally saved. If
          something is eternally saved, it is either being saved forever or is
          forever saved. Eternal destruction means something is eternally
          destroyed. If something is eternally destroyed, it is either being
          destroyed forever or is forever destroyed. Eternal judgment means
          something is eternally judged. If something is eternally judged, it is
          either being judged forever or forever judged. If something is
          eternally punished, it is either being punished forever or forever
          punished. This is not controversial and can be found in standard Greek
          lexicons and confirmed by linguistics.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 10</b></p>
        <p>
          It is very obvious from the biblical account that the soul is not
          preexistent. It is clear but less obvious that the soul is not
          necessarily immortal. The reason it is valid to claim that the
          traditional view is influenced by Plato's philosophy is that the very
          first proponents of ECT, Tertullian and Athenagoras of Athens, both
          cite Plato extensively in the context of their belief in the intrinsic
          immortality of the soul, an idea central to Plato's philosophy and
          absent from the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tertullian,

            >A Treatise on the Soul</a
          >: "[Socrates], in the face of death itself, asserts the immortality
          of the soul by a strong assumption" (1), an account which comes from
          Plato. Side note, "the operation of death is plain and obvious: it is
          the separation of body and soul" (51). Many conditionalists agree with
          this statement; however, there is a difference between the operation
          or technical details of death, separation of body and soul, and the
          definition of death, the loss of bodily life, which is often missed by
          modern traditionalists.

            >A Plea for the Christians</a
          >: He expounds much on the philosophers including "Plato and Aristotle
          — not that I am about to go through all that the philosophers have
          said about God..." (6). He holds that "God has not made us as sheep or
          beasts of burden, a mere by-work, and that we should perish [apollumi]
          and be annihilated [aphanizo]" (31), explicitly contradicting John
          3:16, Acts 13:40-41, 2 Peter 2:12-13 and many other texts. About the
          resurrection he writes, "for nothing hinders, according to Pythagoras
          and Plato, that when the dissolution of bodies takes place, they
          should, from the very same elements of which they were constructed at
          first, be constructed again" (36). Influence from Plato is very clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey admits that "the orthodox have always viewed life in this world
          or in the next as a gift of God," which logically entails that the
          traditional view holds that God grants the gift of immortality to
          sinners at the final judgment. A radical claim that is not supported
          in this section.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 11</b></p>
        <p>
          The conditionalist argument given is that all Jewish and early
          patristic writings support conditionalism. I agree that this claim is
          overstated. While the vast majority of early Jewish writings support
          conditionalism, ECT is occasionally found in some later Jewish
          writings. And while all the Apostolic Fathers appear to support
          conditionalism, ECT would enter the church a little over a century
          later from theologians in the late second century like Athenagoras of
          Athens (A.D. 133-190) and Tertullian (A.D. 160-240).
        </p>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
        <p>
          He believes to "have covered all the arguments for conditionalism and
          annihilationism... to be found in the literature on this subject." One
          of the most obvious arguments is that Christ died for sins. He was our
          substitute on the cross bearing the punishment we deserve. The
          punishment Christ suffered was a brutal, painful death. Therefore, the
          punishment for those not saved by Christ is a brutal, painful death:
          "For the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23). It is clear from this
          simple argument that Morey has not comprehensively responded to
          conditionalist arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though there were problems with Morey's responses, a big issue was
          that the arguments for conditionalism were just bad. They barely
          addressed Scripture at all. Responding to Edward Fudge would have been
          much more fruitful and exegetically focused. Also understanding that
          annihilationism is <em>only</em> about the final fate of the wicked
          would help further the discussion. Conditionalists hold different
          views on the anthropology of man, the intermediate state and other
          issues, but these are distinct from the doctrine of hell.

        </p>
        <p>
          Carson focuses on conservative annihilationists, which I appreciate.
          However, he still spends a lot of space addressing philosophical and
          emotional arguments rather than exegetical ones which is unfortunate.
          I won't be addressing those in depth. The biblical case is decisive
          and authoritative in a way that philosophy, history and emotion are
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson provides three reasons for why he is addressing
          annihilationism. The first is that evangelicalism is expanding to
          allow conditionalism to be seen as a valid viewpoint as the number of
          its evangelical adherents is rapidly increasing. This could be seen as
          proof that liberalism is on the rise, but it could also indicate that
          there's a strong biblical case that hasn't been sufficiently answered.
          The second is the fact that some conditionalists really are
          theological liberals who primarily appeal to emotion and God's love
          instead of addressing the Bible. I strongly reject that along with
          Carson. The third is that there is a movement of conservatives for
          whom this issue is entirely hermeneutical, but who "are proving
          unwilling to be corrected by more careful exegesis." We will evaluate
          that claim in the following analysis.
        </p>
        <h2>A. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Carson does a good job of summarizing the conditionalist position. He
          notes that there are different views of anthropology, the intermediate
          state, and other doctrines among conditionalists, but the common
          beliefs that "the punishment is unending," the wicked "are finally
          destroyed," and the rejection of the traditional view of eternal
          conscious torment (ECT). He distinguishes between conditional
          immortality and annihilationism stating that their anthropology is
          different; however, most people use these terms interchangeably.
          Conditional immortality states that there is a condition that's
          required for eternal life, faith in Christ, while annihilationism
          describes the fate of those who don't meet that condition, death. It's
          a difference in emphasis rather than being two separate positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He writes that annihilationists "hold that there is finally a
          cessation of existence," but existence is not the right category. The
          term annihilation is meant to indicate death, destruction of soul and
          body, and the loss of life. This is an important and common
          misconception which will be addressed later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson gives a bibliography for treatments on hell, both historical
          and modern. He doesn't discuss them here, though he fears "these are
          largely unread by those who espouse annihilationism." However, I’ve
          read a lot of materials from traditionalists at this point and grew up
          only knowing about the traditional view of hell. It is much more often
          the case that traditionalists don’t understand conditional immortality
          and have studied the doctrine of hell very little.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson states that in this chapter he’s avoiding "idiosyncratic
          interpretations" in his treatment of conditionalism, not addressing
          the fate of people who don't hear the gospel, and not discussing side
          questions that may arise. While Carson doesn’t provide idiosyncratic
          interpretations, he does use idiosyncratic methods to come to those
          interpretations. In the following analysis, I seek to demonstrate that
          conditional immortality is simply the result of consistent
          hermeneutical principles applied to scriptural passages about the
          final fate of the wicked.

        <h2>B. The Case for Conditional Immortality</h2>

          He briefly lays out seven arguments used to defend conditional
          immortality in this section:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Passages that say the wicked will be destroyed "suggests total
          destruction, i.e., cessation of existence." Again, many
          traditionalists insist on characterizing annihilationists as saying
          that the wicked will "cease to exist," but this is simply not
          accurate. When a person dies, their body does not cease to exist. It's
          just dead. Likewise, the soul of a person may still exist after it is
          destroyed. The point is that the body and soul of the wicked will be
          killed and destroyed, i.e., their life will be totally ended. Mark

            >Apollumi: The Word that Tells Us What Happens to People in Hell
            (Annihilation or Eternal Torment?)</a
          >
          thoroughly demonstrates that <em>apollumi</em>, the Greek word
          translated destruction, does indeed mean killing or slaying when
          referring to the fate of the unrighteous.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. An unquenchable fire destroys that which it burns. Unquenchable
          means inextinguishable, which emphasizes the certainty of its
          devouring and consuming (see Mat 3:12 // Isa 66:24). The reason it
          destroys is precisely because it will not be put out or stopped. All
          of the metaphors and direct language that explain the unquenchable
          fire such as chaff, trees, thorns, thistles, destruction, burn up, and
          consume demonstrate that Jesus is talking about a consuming fire
          rather than torment. Carson does a good explaining this argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I agree with Carson that the words translated eternal and forever
          in Matthew 25:46 and Revelation 14:11 refer to an endless amount of
          time, so this point stands. Most conditionalists would agree with this
          as well. It is typically universalists that argue against that.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In Matthew 25:46, eternal is used to describe life and punishment.
          This is referring to the everlasting life believers, and the final,
          everlasting death of the wicked. Everlasting death is properly called
          an eternal punishment. There is no justification for saying eternal
          punishment must refer to perpetually inflicted torment. I agree with
          the way he stated this argument, and it's solid. The argument still
          must be made that death is the punishment for sin, but everything
          checks out grammatically and logically with calling everlasting death
          an eternal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This argument is based on the love of God. I'm not going to focus
          on this one. I'm just going to stick to the ones that focus on
          exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This argument is about the fairness of hell. The argument that ECT
          is unfair can be made from the Bible. If a country has a law that says
          murders will face capital punishment but instead locks them up in a
          dungeon for torture, everyone would say that was unjust. Likewise, if
          God said that "the wages of sin is death" but instead keeps sinners
          alive to eternally torment them, that would be unjust. Of course, that
          argument assumes "death" really means death as in the Old Testament
          sacrificial system which Jesus fulfilled in dying on the cross, which
          brings us back to asking, what did God declare the just punishment of
          sin to be and how are we to understand that? However, he doesn't state
          this as a biblical argument but as an emotional one, so I won't focus
          on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The last argument is that ECT would mar the new heavens and new
          earth. This argument can be bolstered. It is actually impossible for
          traditional hell to exist in the new heavens and new earth (Rev 21:4).
          Traditionalist scholar G. K. Beale writes that "the reality underlying
          the figurative lake of the second death must exist somewhere else,
          perhaps in a different dimension from that of the new creation" (<a
            href="https://archive.org/stream/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/Revelation_G.Beale_djvu.txt"
            target="_blank"
            >The Book of Revelation</a
          >, 1061), but the Bible doesn’t say that. It specifically says they
          will be resurrected on this earth to face judgmentand cast into a
          valley outside of Jerusalem to be destroyed soul and body. Moreover,
          God has "no pleasure in the death of the wicked" (Eze 33:11). If death
          means ECT, then God would eternally be sustaining something that
          brings Him no pleasure. We will be made like God, so we will take no
          pleasure in the ECT of the wicked either. Again though, Carson only
          raises this as a philosophical argument.
        </p>
        <h2>C. Biblical and Theological Responses</h2>
        <p>
          Carson begins his response by addressing the terms Sheol and Hades. He
          is right that they "have roughly the same semantic range and
          overtones." Both refer to "the abode of the dead." He is also correct
          that there is a mention of torment in Hades (Lk 16:23), although many
          believe this is an example story much like the story of the good
          Samaritan (10:25:37), the rich fool (12:13-21), or the Pharisee and
          the tax collector (18:9-14). If that’s the case, then this story is a
          graphic portrayal of the dichotomy between the fate of the righteous
          and the damned after death, but the details are not necessarily
          intended to be actual descriptions of Hades.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Carson goes off course when he tries to conflate Hades with
          Gehenna (the
          <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1035.htm" target="_blank"
            >Catechism of the Catholic Church</a
          >
          #1035 makes this same error). Hades is the abode of the dead
          <em>before</em> they are raised and cast into Gehenna. It is not the
          final state. The reason he gives for this is that Revelation 20:10, 14
          link Hades with the lake of fire. So now Carson conflates Gehenna, the
          lake of fire, and Hades. Gehenna is a real valley outside of
          Jerusalem, also known as the Valley of Slaughter, which depicts the
          destruction of soul and body. The lake of fire is a symbolic picture
          in John's vision which corresponds to the second death (Rev 20:15;
          21:8). Even the verses Carson cites maintain a clear distinction
          between Hades and the lake of fire. Hades releases its dead, so that
          they can be judged and thrown into the lake of fire. Subsequently,
          Hades itself is thrown into the lake of fire, demonstrating that they
          are two different places:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were
            judged, each one according to his works. Death and Hades were thrown
            into the lake of fire" (Rev 20:13-14).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Carson moves on to define Gehenna, the name of the place that actually
          refers to the final fate of the wicked. Carson repeats the myth that
          Gehenna was "the burning dump outside of Jerusalem." Traditionalist
          scholar Robert Reymond at least informs the reader that the garbage
          dump theory first comes "from late Jewish tradition (David Qimchi, c.
          A.D. 1200)" in his treatment, but Carson doesn't do that. He also
          doesn't inform the reader of Jeremiah 7 or 19 which prophesy about
          future eschatological judgment of Gehenna (that might be important
          context!):
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no
            more be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but
            ‘The valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there
            is no place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for
            the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will
            frighten them away'" (Jer 7:32-33).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is a large part of the background for Jesus' teaching about
          Gehenna (Gehenna is derived from the Hebrew <em>Ge Hinnom</em> meaning
          “Valley of Hinnom”). Gehenna will be called "The Valley of Slaughter."
          God will slay His enemies there. The worms, birds, and other
          scavengers will devour the dead bodies cast there, and the fire will
          burn up and consume them. Gehenna is a vivid picture of death,
          destruction, and annihilation, not eternal torment. This refutes
          Carson's claim that Gehenna conveys "notions of suffering" by which he
          means torment without death. Gehenna is about the wicked undergoing
          the punishment for sin, death (Rom 6:23), death forever (Jn 11:26),
          perishing (Jn 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          He then cites parallel passages in which Jesus warns of the
          destruction of body and soul which will take place in Gehenna. How can
          we expect anyone to live in Gehenna forever? Surely God casting his
          enemies into Gehenna, destroying them soul and body, and burning up
          their dead bodies which are consumed by scavengers does not permit an
          eternal torment reading:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to
            kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and
            body in Gehenna." "But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear
            him who after he has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna." (Mat
            10:28 // Lk 12:5).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Carson proceeds to cite Romans 2:5-9, 11, 16 in favor of ECT, but no
          support can be found there. Rather than an eternity of wrath, Paul
          speaks of a "day of wrath" (2:5) when God "will pay back to everyone
          according to their works" (2:6). Paul writes that "now, being made
          free from sin" we have "the result of eternal life" (6:22), but "the
          wages of sin is death" (6:23). God is the "potter,” and we are "clay"
          (9:21). The wicked are clay "vessels of wrath prepared for
          destruction" (9:23). While Paul doesn't mention Gehenna by name, he
          certainly doesn't shy away from addressing the final fate which awaits
          unbelievers in Gehenna—death and destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson cites another passage from Paul, 2 Thessalonians 1:9, but he
          cites the NIV which renders the verse very inaccurately. The NIV:
          "everlasting destruction and shut out from." The ESV: "eternal
          destruction, away from." The NLT: "eternal destruction, forever
          separated from." However, the Greek literally reads, "eternal
          destruction from [<em>apo</em>] the presence of the Lord." The phrases
          "and shut out," "away," and "forever separated" are not in the Greek
          but are interpretive and misleading. Going with the alternative
          rendering in the footnote of the ESV, the verse reads:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction that comes
            from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          They will be destroyed forever from an encounter with God's presence.
          No ECT here. Moreover, verses 7-8 provide important context because
          they reference Isaiah 66:15: "For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire,
          and his chariots will be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with
          fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire." It goes on to say,
          "For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all
          flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many" (Isa 66:16). And in the
          next chapter, Paul says that "the Lord will kill [the lawless one]
          with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the manifestation of his
          coming" (2 Thes 2:8) reinforcing that the destruction comes from the
          presence of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very next verse that Carson cites is another reference to Isaiah
          66. Jesus connects Gehenna and Isaiah 66 with a direct quote,
          describing it as the place "where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire
          is not quenched" (Mk 9:48 // Isa 66:24). We just saw a few verses
          earlier in Isaiah that God's enemies were slain. In the part Jesus
          quotes from, it describes "the new heavens and the new earth" where
          believers "will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who
          have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will
          their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind"
          (Isa 66:22-24). In the final judgment, unbelievers will be slain and
          burned up by God. Believers will walk out and see their corpses.
          Isaiah says that explicitly, and both Jesus and Paul attest to that
          reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          He points out that the judgment is characterized by "weeping and
          gnashing of teeth" (Mat 8:12), but the crying and anger is never said
          to last eternally. Of course that is the reaction of people facing the
          judgment of God, but it is no support for ECT. That phrase is even
          used in conjunction with people perishing: "The wicked will see it,
          and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away" (Ps
          112:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson says that there "is no escape from hell: there is a great fixed
          chasm (Luke 16:26)." Again, he is conflating Hades (which is the
          actual word used in this verse) with Gehenna. This verse is irrelevant
          to the final judgment. There is a time when everyone will be brought
          out of Hades, "the abode of the dead" (his own definition). Then the
          wicked will face judgment and be cast into Gehenna from which there is
          no return.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we check the verses Carson cites about the "'everlasting chains' (2
          Peter 2:4; Jude 6)," we read that angels (not humans) are "kept in
          everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day"
          and that God "committed them to pits of darkness to be reserved for
          judgment." The chains hold angels <em>for</em> the judgment of the
          great day. It does not say that angels will have chains eternally, it
          is not about the final judgment and it isn't even about humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we check the verse that Carson cites to support the claim that the
          "lost 'suffer the punishment of eternal fire' (Jude 7)," we read that
          Sodom and Gomorrah "are exhibited as an example in undergoing the
          punishment of eternal fire" (NASB). The historical example of the
          complete destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire functions
          typologically to show what will happen to the wicked on judgment day.
          The eternal fire inflicted complete destruction:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from
            Yahweh out of the sky. He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all
            the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
            But Lot’s wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar
            of salt. Abraham went up early in the morning to the place where he
            had stood before Yahweh. He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and
            toward all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the land
            went up as the smoke of a furnace." (Gen 19:24-28).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Carson writes that they "suffer 'everlasting contempt' (Dan. 12:2),"
          but Daniel denies that they will live forever. Daniel 12:2 is
          connected to Isaiah 66:24 by the words "contempt" and "loathsome"
          which are the only occurrences of the Hebrew word
          <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_1860.htm" target="_blank"
            >deraon</a
          >. Isaiah writes that the “dead bodies” of the wicked "will be
          loathsome to all mankind." Just as contempt for Nero outlives his
          life, Daniel is saying that contempt for unbelievers will last
          forever, and he contrasts that fate with "everlasting life." The two
          are mutually exclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that Carson has limited space and cannot explain every
          point in this section, but the rapid-fire proof texting used in this
          section does not reflect the "more careful exegesis" that supposedly
          supports the traditionalist view. It was more of the same basic
          mistakes that characterize many traditionalist writings like mixing up
          Hades with Gehenna, getting the background for Gehenna wrong, using
          verses that are clearly translated inaccurately, citing passages about
          the intermediate state as if they were about Gehenna, and not
          addressing the passages that the NT authors keep quoting from like
          Isaiah 66 to understand the context. It is always better to explain a
          few passages carefully than many passages in this way.
        </p>
        <h2>Carson offers six reflections at this point:</h2>
        <p>
          <b>1.</b> He begins by addressing <em>apollumi</em>. I already cited
          an in-depth word study of <em>apollumi</em> in the first argument. A
          quote from Edward White's
          <a
            href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_in_Christ.html?id=bvsCAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false"
            target="_blank"
            >Life in Christ</a
          >
          makes the point forcefully: "My mind fails to conceive a grosser
          misinterpretation of language than when the five or six strongest
          words which the Greek tongue possesses, signifying ‘destroy,’ or
          ‘destruction,’ are explained to mean maintaining an everlasting but
          wretched existence. To translate black as white is nothing to this"
          (365). Carson writes, "<em>of course</em> those who suffer
          <em>destruction</em> are <em>destroyed</em>. But it does not follow
          that those who suffer eternal destruction cease to exist." Torment is
          not destruction and arguing that they don't "cease to exist" is not
          addressing the argument. They are as "natural animals to be taken and
          destroyed... [and] will in their destroying surely be destroyed" (2
          Pet 2:12). They will be reduced to ashes (2 Pet 2:6; cf. Mal 4:1-3;
          Isa 66:24). They "won’t see life" (Jn 3:36).
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson fails to engage meaningfully with Stott on this point. He
          writes, "Stott, for instance, argues that [the words for destroy]...
          [best] refer to cessation of existence" and their use "suggests
          cessation of existence." He then counters that the word group for
          destroy can refer to something lost or ruined: "in neither case is
          cessation of existence in view" and that it would only be plausible
          "if 'life' means no more than mere existence." He concludes, "Stott
          has assumed his definition of 'destruction'" as cessation of
          existence, and "the issue must itself be decided on other grounds."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Stott does not assume his view, Carson just ignores his
          arguments, and Stott's view isn't that destruction means "cease to
          exist." In context, Stott writes, "When the verb [<em>apollymi</em>]
          is active and transitive, 'destroy' means 'kill,' as when Herod wanted
          to murder the baby Jesus and the Jewish leaders later plotted to have
          him executed (Matt 2:13; 12:14; 27:4)... (Matt 10:28; cf. Jas 4:12)"
          (Edwards and Stott,
          <em>Essentials</em>, 314-16). In other words, destruction is about
          killing, the taking of life, not the cessation of existence. The
          traditional view denies that God will finally kill the wicked and
          holds that they will live forever in torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stott goes on to write, "If to kill is to deprive the body of life,
          hell would seem to be the deprivation of both physical and spiritual
          life, that is, extinction of being" (by which he means the total loss
          of life), and the Sermon on the Mount contrasts the "'road that leads
          to life' with the 'broad... road that leads to destruction' (Matt
          7:13...)." It should be very clear now that saying death doesn't mean
          non-existence is a complete non-answer. The argument needs to be made
          that destruction doesn't refer to the ending of life or else it is
          only attacking a straw man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, in the passage Carson uses to argue that life means "more
          than mere existence," John 3:16, he agrees with the conditionalist
          framing that "'life' and 'destruction' are contrasted." The category
          John is using is life. Given the contrast with life, destruction
          (<em>apollymi</em>) indicates death. This is supported by the
          immediate context in John 3:14-15 where Jesus compares Himself to the
          bronze serpant which the Israelites could look at to save their
          literal, physical lives (Num 21:9). Carson quotes Timothy Philips in
          "Hell: A Christological Reflection" that "Christ is contrasting two
          qualitatively different types of existence," but there are absolutely
          no reasons given for why we should accept this. It also demonstrates
          that traditionalists are the ones using the category of existence
          instead of life and forcing that lens on the Bible and on
          conditionalists.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while traditionalists repeat many times the objection that death
          does not mean non-existence, I hope it is clear now that existence
          isn't the right category. Death is about life and death. The second
          death is about being killed and dying, the destruction of body and
          soul, the loss of bodily and spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, Carson argues that eternal punishment cannot refer to the result
          of the punishment being eternal in Matthew 25:46 but must refer to an
          ongoing process of punishing. He cites several scholars that agree
          with him, but this is obviously wrong. In English and Greek,
          punishment is a generic word that can refer to various kinds of
          punishments, and eternal can refer to either an everlasting state or
          process. Simply put, the punishment for sin is death, the death is
          eternal, so the punishment is eternal, everlasting, never-ending
          death. I'll quote a few articles that explain it well and provide more
          depth:
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris Date writes that "Punishment, whether in English or in Greek, is
          polysemous. And it is context and the nature of the punishment that
          determine whether it carries a process or result reading. The modifier
          'eternal' does not give it a process reading, anymore than it does
          'salvation' and 'redemption' in the epistle to the Hebrews" (<a
            href="https://rethinkinghell.com/2013/06/02/no-retreat-on-nouns-of-action-turretinfans-premature-celebration/"

            Celebration</a
          >, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
          In another article, Christ Date notes that "many deverbal nouns are
          polysemous, ambiguous between a process or result meaning. For
          example, the phrase, 'The translation of the book took ten years,'
          means that the process of translating lasted ten years. The phrase,
          'The translation has been published recently,' on the other hand,
          means that the translation that resulted from, or was the outcome of,
          the translating process was recently published" (<a
            href="https://rethinkinghell.com/2012/06/19/eternal-punishment-and-the-polysemy-of-deverbal-nouns/"

            >"Punishment" and the Polysemy of Deverbal Nouns</a
          >, 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
          And building off the previous example, Joseph Dear summarizes, "The
          question is, what meaning of 'punishment' was intended? Was Jesus
          referring to the act of punishing (like 'the translation of the book
          took ten years'), or was he referring to the result of the act of
          punishing (like 'the translation has been published recently')? Either
          one would be 'punishment'" (<a

        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2.</b> Carson moves on to arguments about the descriptions of hell.
          The first one he addresses is that the fire is a consuming fire. Fire
          describes destruction, not torment:
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson's initial response to this argument is that most "interpreters
          recognize that there is a substantial metaphorical element in the
          Bible's descriptions of hell." He tries to show that the Bible uses
          contradictory language to describe hell to substantiate this claim.
          However, he does this by mixing up symbolic depictions of the final
          judgment in Revelation, descriptions of Hades (the intermediate
          state), and scenes from parables with actual descriptions of Gehenna,
          and he interprets the actual descriptions of Gehenna in a wooden and
          silly way.
        </p>
        <p>
          This attitude that the biblical language about hell is obviously
          metaphorical will not do. I do not accept that. A little work in the
          Old Testament background and context of these passages reveals a
          consistent, noncontradictory teaching that the wicked will finally
          perish in Gehenna. Only conditionalism can take the biblical
          descriptions of hell and the language of life, death, perishing,
          destruction, slaying, burning up, Gehenna, etc. in their natural
          sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional view relies fundamentally on the metaphorical
          interpretation of passages about the final fate of the wicked with an
          improper literal interpretation of Revelation, while the
          conditionalist view relies fundamentally on a literal, straightforward
          interpretation of passages about the final fate of the wicked with a
          proper symbolic interpretation of Revelation. Refuting the
          over-allegorizing tendencies of the traditional view destroys a core
          pillar undergirding it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson uses three examples to support the allegorizing of Gehenna and
          its descriptions, which I will state and then challenge:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) We don't normally "think of unquenchable fire and worms
          coexisting." We might not normally think of that, but there is nothing
          contradictory about Gehenna consisting of fire and maggots. Those are
          specific descriptions of the dead bodies being destroyed. The fire
          can't be put out and the worms can't be killed, so that they will
          carry out the destruction of the dead bodies of the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) "It is hard to imagine how a lake of fire coexists with utter
          darkness." The lake of fire is a symbolic picture in Revelation which
          is interpreted as the second death, literally dying a second time in
          the age to come (Rev 21:8). Outer darkness is a parabolic way of
          describing refusal to the Kingdom of God such as when the servant is
          tied hand and foot and thrown out of the wedding feast into outer
          darkness by the King (Mat 22:1-14). It is also obvious that the
          servant, being bound hand and foot and thrown into the Judean
          wilderness, will surely die, not merely experience torment in the
          parable. Angels are also described as being held "under darkness"
          (Jude 6 // 2 Pet 2:4), but this is referring to the intermediate state
          before the final judgment. Conditionalists affirm that the wicked will
          be refused entrance to the Kingdom of God, will face the second death,
          and that the angels are held under darkness for the judgment in the
          intermediate state. None of those suggest that we need to allegorize
          Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) If "one is cast into a lake of fire, what need of chains?" Again,
          the lake of fire is a graphic portrayal of the death of the wicked in
          John's vision. And as previously mentioned, the chains hold angels for
          judgment day (Jude 6 // 2 Pet 2:4). The chains are not about Gehenna.
          These are still not good reasons to metaphorically interpret passages
          about Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson continues by asking, what sustains the worms (because they are
          said to not die) if they have already consumed the people? But nowhere
          are the worms said to be eternal worms. It doesn't say they will never
          die
          <em>ever</em>. That's like arguing that the statement, "Bob won't get
          off the video game" means that, "Bob won't get off the video game
          <em>ever</em>." Obviously, there is a context in both situations: Bob
          won't get off the video game until he finishes his match, and the
          worms won't die until they finish consuming their meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the language is interpreted woodenly to mean that the worms
          will never die ever, this would only mean that there are worms which
          will live forever. This can't be used as support that the wicked will
          live forever because they are already dead forever at this point.
          Carson says that his question was "ugly and silly, precisely because
          it is demanding a concrete and this-worldly answer to the use of
          language describing the realities of punishment in a future world
          still largely inconceivable." Instead, it appears that his question
          was "ugly and silly" because it relies on understanding the phrase
          "their worm does not die" out of context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson points to several more reasons he believes the annihilationist
          reading is wrong:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) It is called "their worm" rather than "the worm" which "suggests
          that it is perpetually bound up with those who are suffering." This is
          a strange argument. It was not written "the worm" because it isn't a
          specific worm that won't die, nor worms in general that won't die.
          It's "their worm" because it's referring to the worms consuming their
          bodies. And as a reminder, the context is not about worms eating
          "those who are suffering," but is about the "dead bodies of the men
          who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die…" (Isa
          66:24 // Mk 9:48).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The logic of this argument is that the "unquenchable fire" is a
          fire that cannot be extinguished so that it either burns up but does
          not last forever or burns forever but does not burn up. He claims that
          the former interpretation has difficulties because "unquenchable fire"
          is paralleled with "eternal fire" (Mat 18:8). Carson's initial framing
          of this argument is a false dilemma. The fire could last forever but
          still burn up. Earlier in Matthew, it is explicitly stated that they
          "will burn up [katakaió] with unquenchable fire" like chaff (Mat
          3:12). Katakaió means to burn down utterly, incinerate, or consume
          wholly.
        </p>
        <p>
          That still leaves the question of what eternal fire means in Matthew
          18:8 and 25:41. Before these verses, Matthew indicates that the
          hellfire will burn up (3:12; 7:19; 13:40, 42, 50), the wicked will be
          destroyed (7:13-14; 10:28), and they will perish in Gehenna (5:22;
          5:29; 10:28). The word <em>aiōnios</em> means eternal. The eternal
          fire/punishment refers to that ultimate punishment of the age to come
          which is the everlasting destruction of soul and body by fire from
          Yahweh resulting in the final and total loss of life, the never-ending
          death, of the wicked forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is confirmed by Jude's use of the phrase “eternal fire.” Jude 7
          tells us that the final punishment of "eternal fire" looks like the
          historical destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. 2 Peter 2:6, the
          parallel passage, says, "and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
          into ashes, condemned them to destruction, having made them an example
          to those who would live in an ungodly way." Because the cities of
          Sodom and Gomorrah underwent "the punishment of eternal fire" and
          those cities are not still burning, I believe the source of the fire,
          Yahweh, is being described as an eternal fire, "for our God is a
          consuming fire" (Heb 12:29). However, even if this is undestood in a
          different way, it is clear that this eternal fire utterly consumes the
          wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final objection Carson raises is that this view would deny degrees
          of punishment. He says, "must we not also infer that fire consumes
          everyone at more or less the same rate"? No, of course not. That
          inference is not from the text and is clearly wrong. There are
          different degrees of fire, which consume people at different rates. It
          is conceivable that some could be instantly incinerated while others
          are slowly burned to death, so this objection fails.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing that more in-depth section, Carson writes that the
          conditionalist interpretation appears to go astray "because
          illegitimate and arbitrary inferences are being drawn from the
          language, against the more natural readings, in order to support a
          theory that is being imposed on the text." However, this seems to
          reveals an error of mistaking what feels like for modern readers are
          "more natural readings" with what the text actually means.
        </p>
        <p>
          For modern readers (myself included), the phrase "weeping and gnashing
          of teeth" sounds like eternal torment. I grew up thinking that's what
          that meant; however, that anger and sadness is never said to last
          forever. An "unquenchable fire" sounds like a fire that is burning
          people perpetually, but "unquenchable" means "inextinguishable." If
          your house caught on fire with an unquenchable fire, it would burn
          down completely because firefighters couldn't put it out. The word
          hell itself has the definition of a place of eternal torment in most
          people’s minds, but it is a place name in the Greek, Gehenna, a valley
          outside of Jerusalem with an Old Testament background. Jude 7
          describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by "sulfur and fire
          from Yahweh out of the sky" (Gen 19:24) as "the punishment of eternal
          fire." Understanding that the eternal fire consumes and destroys God's
          enemies may not be a “natural reading” for people in a different
          context, but the Bible clearly defines it that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could multiply examples, but the point is that the idea of hell as a
          place of eternal torment is thoroughly ingrained in our culture and
          traditions. However, when we examine the Old Testament backgrounds,
          perform careful word studies, and are willing to conform our beliefs
          to the Word of God, all the evidence seems to point squarely towards
          annihilationism.
        </p>
        <h2>The Big Three</h2>
        <p>
          Next, Carson moves on to address the big three traditionalist proof
          texts. I call them the big three because they are the most commonly
          cited proof texts for ECT. They are typically not analyzed in detail
          and are assumed to unequivocally teach ECT. Without these three
          verses, ECT could never get off the ground, but with them, the entire
          Bible is reinterpreted to line up with ECT. These texts are Revelation
          14:10-11, Revelation 20:10-15 and Matthew 25:46. Upon closer
          inspection, they are actually strong proofs for conditional
          immortality.
        </p>
        <p><b>Revelation 14:9-11:</b></p>
        <p>
          "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, 'If
          anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
          forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath
          of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be
          tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and
          in the presence of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up
          forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship
          the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          The language of fire and sulfur is found in references to Sodom and
          Gomorrah (Gen 19:24; Deut 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isa 30:27-33; 34:9-11;
          Ezek 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive annihilation and complete
          destruction, leaving nothing but ashes and rising smoke in its wake.
          Notice that the smoke from the torment is said to last forever, not
          the torment itself. The image of rising smoke also comes from the
          account of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19:28) and symbolizes the permanent
          destruction of the wicked. This is the same fate of Edom in Isaiah
          34:8-10:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the
            cause of Zion. Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into
            sulfur, and its land will become burning pitch. It won’t be quenched
            night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From generation to
            generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass through it forever
            and ever."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Carson recognizes these allusions but says he suspects that there must
          have been some amount of torment in Sodom, Gomorrah, and Edom, so
          surely the suffering part was typological of the final judgment.
          However, the "sufferings of Edom in Isaiah 34" were unto everlasting
          destruction. The account of Sodom and Gomorrah is also unequivocally
          about death and destruction. He cites Jude 7 and arbitrarily says that
          the "suffering" is typological of the judgment despite the parallel
          passage explicitly stating that the destruction and reduction to ashes
          is: "and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes,
          condemned them to destruction, having made them an example to those
          who would live in an ungodly way" (2 Pet 2:6).
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaiah says that Edom’s fire "won’t be quenched night or day." Like
          Isaiah, John is saying that the fire burns continuously without
          ceasing "day or night" during the period of torment. It is a ceaseless
          activity, and a restless time. Carson objects to this interpretation
          of "night and day" calling it "special pleading" because the order in
          Revelation is torment, fire, smoke, and then no rest, while in Isaiah
          the order is fire, no rest, and then smoke. But all of these are just
          descriptions of different aspects of the judgment with recognizable OT
          allusions. Carson says that "writers like Fudge constantly resort to
          serialization of these elements," but that is exactly what he is doing
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionalist scholar G. K. Beale agrees that this passage is not
          decisive for ECT: "In particular, 'day and night' (ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός)
          in 14:11 can be taken as a qualitative genitive construction
          indicating not duration of time (like the accusative construction of
          the same phrase) but kind of time, that is, time of ceaseless
          activity... The lack of rest will continue uninterrupted as long as
          the period of suffering lasts, though there will be an end to the
          period. Therefore, the imagery of Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great
          judgment that will be remembered forever, not one that leads to
          eternal suffering" (<a

        </p>
        <p>
          Lack of rest for the unrighteous could also just be contrasting the
          rest which the righteous experience. Verse 13 says that the blessed
          receive "rest from their labors." In Matthew 11:28, Jesus says, "I
          will give you rest." The unrighteous will never get to experience the
          blessed rest which the righteous will enjoy forever in the new heavens
          and new earth. Their souls will never find rest, not because they are
          tormented forever, but because they will be destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, if we consider that John describes the destruction of
          Babylon in Revelation 17-19 with the same language of torment, fire,
          and smoke from the burning ascending forever, we have ample reason to
          believe that John intends the same meaning here:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she
            did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to
            her double... Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death,
            mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire, for
            the Lord God who has judged her is strong… The kings of the earth
            who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her will
            weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning,
            standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe,
            the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come
            in one hour’... and [they] cried out as they looked at the smoke of
            her burning, saying, ‘What is like the great city?’..."
          </p>
          <p>
            "After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great
            multitude in heaven, saying, 'Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and
            glory belong to our God; for his judgments are true and righteous.
            For he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with
            her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants
            at her hand.' A second said, 'Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever
            and ever.'" (Rev 18:6, 8-10, 18; 19:1-3).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Beale also agrees that the rising smoke in these passages refer to a
          permanent memorial of judgment: "what is precisely underscored is the
          finality of Babylon’s judgment: ‘her smoke ascends forever.’ The
          wording comes from Isa. 34:9-10, where the portrayal of smoke
          continually ascending serves as a permanent memorial to God’s
          punishment of Edom for its sin. Rev. 14:11 also alludes to Isa.
          34:9-10 to describe the never-ending effect of God’s judgment of the
          beast’s followers. Here Edom’s fall is taken as an anticipatory
          typological pattern for the fall of the world system, which will never
          rise again after God’s judgment" (<a
            href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/279/mode/1up"

        </p>
        <p>
          It should also be taken into account that the very next picture of
          judgment immediately following these verses mentions the “wine of the
          wrath of God” again and is clearly about death: “The angel thrust his
          sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth and threw
          it into the great wine press of the wrath of God. The wine press was
          trodden outside of the city, and blood came out of the wine press, up
          to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred
          stadia” (Rev 14:19-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson provides a quote from Harmon's
          <em>The Case Against Conditionalism</em>
          which objects to conditionalism because "destruction dominates while
          punishment and exclusion fall into the background. Indeed, the latter
          image is hardly discussed." Conditionalists believe the punishment is
          death and destruction, so that part of the objection doesn't work. It
          is true that unbelievers will be excluded from the Kingdom of God,
          eternal life and a part in the age to come, but that is precisely
          because they will perish, suffer destruction, and die a second death.
          Exclusion and separation from God are almost exclusively how
          traditionalists describe hell, but that is not how the Bible
          predominantly describes it. This very passage contradicts that. The
          judgment will take place "in the presence of the holy angels and in
          the presence of the Lamb."
        </p>
        <p><b>Revelation 20:10-15:</b></p>
        <p>
          "The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and
          sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be
          tormented day and night forever and ever... The sea gave up the dead
          who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.
          They were judged, each one according to his works. Death and Hades
          were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake
          of fire. If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was
          cast into the lake of fire."
        </p>
        <p>
          G. K. Beale has helpful commentary on this passage as well: "Strictly
          speaking, even the expression 'they will be tormented forever and
          ever' is figurative... at the least, the phrase figuratively connotes
          a very long time. The context here and in the whole Apocalypse must
          determine whether this is a limited time or an unending period... All
          unbelievers suffering the first death are held in the sphere of 'death
          and Hades,' which is a temporary, preconsummate holding tank to be
          finally replaced by the permanent, consummate 'lake of fire,' which is
          'the second death' (see on 20:14)" (<a

        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming that Carson is correct about the three figures in 20:10
          rather than John Stott, John sees a vision in which the three figures,
          the devil, the beast and the false prophet, are tormented for an
          extraordinarily long period of time. Carson interprets these figures
          for us: the devil, depicted as a dragon and a serpent, is Satan, and
          the beast and false prophet "are best thought of as recurring
          individuals, culminating in supreme manifestations of their type."
          Those whose names are not written in the book of life are the enemies
          of Christ. Death and Hades are personified individuals in Revelation.
          Hades and Death give up the dead who were in them, meaning everyone is
          resurrected, and those who are not saved are judged and cast into the
          lake of fire. Afterwards, Death and Hades are also thrown in. John and
          God Himself interpret the vision of the "lake of fire" for us: it is
          the "second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8). The vision he sees represents
          the execution, the killing, the death and final judgment of the wicked
          in the age to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson says that Satan "constitutes at least one sentient being who is
          clearly pictured as suffering conscious torment forever." Even if the
          language demanded that the picture is of Satan suffering ECT, the
          authoritative interpretation given twice is that this is a picture of
          death. However, the language doesn't demand that we understand it in a
          strickly literal way. John is recording a vision. He couldn't see an
          eternal process in a vision; however, he could clearly tell they were
          suffering for a very long time, and the language he uses reflects that
          reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last argument for this text that Carson gives is that it is
          reasonable to assume that if Satan is going to suffer ECT in the lake
          of fire, the unrighteous will too. Again, it is not necessary to
          understand the vision of the lake of fire as ECT, and the
          interpretation of the vision is still death which Carson does not
          address. But more fundementally, it is improper to derive doctrine
          from unclear inferences, or from a vision without the interpretation
          of the vision, or from less clear passages. We have plently of clear
          didactic passages which tell us that the final fate of the wicked is
          death.
        </p>
        <p><b>Matthew 25:46:</b></p>
        <p>
          "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
          eternal life."
        </p>
        <p>
          If the fire leads to destruction, the "eternal" aspect is in the
          everlasting nature of the destruction, not in a continuous experience
          of punishment. This verse specifically sets up a contrast between the
          eternal punishment of the unrighteous and the eternal life of the
          righteous. This precludes the possibility of the unrighteous
          experiencing eternal life. While the righteous experience life that is
          eternal in duration (unending and ongoing life), the unrighteous face
          death that is eternal in duration (unending and ongoing death).
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson responds that "annihilationists again introduce temporal
          serialization: first the fire that annihilates, then the eternal
          punishment which in fact constitutes the nonreversing of the
          annihilation." However, that misunderstands the argument. We also say
          that Jesus bore the punishment for our sins by His death, but we
          aren’t denying that Christ’s sufferings on the cross were part of that
          punishment. Likewise, we say that death is the punishment for sins,
          but we aren’t denying that suffering will be part of that death. The
          destruction by fire is the punishment in the same way that the cross
          was the punishment for Jesus, both of which were carried out in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the duration of the punishment goes, the length of the death
          of the wicked is eternal in the same way that Jesus' death lasted
          three days. Just as chopping off a criminal’s finger for stealing is
          completed quickly but constitutes a lifelong punishment, the
          destruction by fire is carried out in a finite amount of time but
          constitutes an eternal punishment. The nature of the punishment is
          privation which means that the length of the effect of the punishment,
          the duration of the privation, is the proper characterization of the
          duration of the punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul explicitly states that the punishment is "eternal destruction" (2
          Thes 1:9). The eternal punishment is eternal destruction which is
          eternal death, to "die forever" (Jn 11:26 LEB). This is not new or
          controversial language. It flows straight from biblical language about
          sin and judgment. The phrase "eternal death" has been used for
          centuries to describe the eternal punishment (e.g. by John Calvin,
          Francis Turretin, and Douglas Moo; see Miscellaneous for more
          examples). It is even used in the
          <a href="https://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_03" target="_blank"
            >Westminster Confession of Faith</a
          >
          (1647) which is still held to by millions of evangelicals today: "By
          the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and
          angels are predestinated unto everlasting life; and others
          foreordained to everlasting death" (3.3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Carson appeals to the lake of fire in Revelation 20 for support that
          the torment is eternal; however, as noted above, the language in
          Revelation need only refer to a long period of torment, which makes
          sense in context because the lake of fire is the second death. Carson
          says the "word 'punishment' is graphic, and at least suggests
          suffering." The word punishment (κόλασιν) can refer to all kinds of
          different punishments including capital punishment. And just because
          conditionalists believe that the final punishment is capital
          punishment (execution), does not mean that torment will not be
          involved. Burning at the stake, crucifixion, and the electric chair
          are all forms of capital punishment with varying degrees of torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next argument has been a driving assumption for the continued
          belief in ECT. Carson writes that "Jesus could not have used such
          words as these without being understood to be in line with Pharisaic
          beliefs on the matter." The assumption for a long time was that ECT
          became the majority view during the intertestamental period. This
          meant that we should read the NT with the assumption of ECT. However,
          we now know that conditionalism was by far the majority view during
          the intertestamental period in keeping with the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pharisaic/rabbinic schools believed there would be three final
          destinies of people: heaven, an in-between group that might go to hell
          temporarily, or hell. Jesus very clearly rejects this teaching of the
          Pharisees. He taught that there are only two fates, heaven and hell,
          that hell’s punishment is eternal, and that even Jews could go to hell
          if they didn't repent and believe. David Instone-Brewer, Baptist
          Minister and Senior Research Fellow in Rabbinics at Cambridge,
          reviewing the primary literature in
          <em>Eternal Punishment in First-Century Jewish Thought</em> concludes,
          “This means the verse stating that ‘punishment’ is eternal should be
          understood to mean that torment plus destruction is eternal—without
          any means of escape—because this is what his contemporaries meant when
          they used the same language” (A Consuming Passion, Eugene: Pickwick,
          2015). The literature from the Apostolic Fathers reflects the same
          understanding. It would not be until the middle and latter half of the
          second century that the doctrine of ECT developed in the church, and
          the language of eternal punishment became increasingly misunderstood
          after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3.</b> Carson argues that annihilation cannot account for the
          "eternal sin" (Mk 3:29) which "will not be forgiven, either in this
          age or in the age to come" (Mat 12:32), but this is another objection
          that doesn't stick. If sinners had their sins forgiven, they would be
          able to enter life. But since people who commit this sin will not be
          forgiven, they will face the punishment of eternal destruction. God
          doesn't forgive them, but instead counts their sin against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the claim is made many times, annihilationism is not a
          softening of hell. ECT is just a softening of the value of life. Even
          if the final death of unbelievers is more emotionally tolerable to
          some people, it is simply an attempt to understand the Bible more
          accurately. However, I would strongly argue that annihilationism is a
          harsher view of hell. Only one view teaches that God will finally rid
          the cosmos of sin forever, accomplish justice once and for all rather
          than having an eternally unfinished punishment, and will take every
          good thing away from sinners including their very lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the contrary, much of traditionalism is guilty of softening the
          language about hell without biblical warrent. Hell has been almost
          completely psychologized by traditionalists. He says he is "reluctant
          to say that none of this suffering is physical in some sense," but he
          takes a very metaphorical view of hell. This is quite different than
          the Bible’s very physical descriptions of punishment. The unjust are
          raised physically to receive their punishment (Jn 5:28-29) which
          consists of torment and fire. There is also a recent view among
          traditionalists that the wicked will eventually have some kind of
          sub-human existence while suffering ECT, but this is based on
          philosophical speculation. If those who believe that alter their view
          slightly, they can affirm with the Bible that the wicked will indeed
          be turned into ashes and perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4.</b> Carson makes the argument that "judges made their decisions
          while keeping in mind the social status of the person being judged" to
          justify the severity of eternal torment. This is still true to an
          extent today. You will be in much greater trouble if you punch the
          president than if you punch a random man. However, it is also true in
          reverse. A child will be punished less severely for punching the
          president than an adult would. I don't think this philosophical
          argument gets us anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, "What is hard to prove, but seems to me probable, is that one
          reason why the conscious punishment of hell is ongoing is because sin
          is ongoing." This flies in the face of many passages which talk about
          the defeat of sin and death and the cosmic reconciliation of all
          things to God. Also, we don't have passages that say God continues
          judging for all eternity or that God is judging sins committed after
          this life. We're just told that there is a "day of judgment" in which
          justice will be accomplished. If sin and the need for ongoing
          punishment continues forever, justice is never accomplished. He tries
          to use Revelation 22:10-11 to support the idea of ongoing sin after
          judgment day, but he anticipates my rebuttal and agrees that this was
          written about the "time from 'now' <em>until</em> judgment" which
          counters his own point.
        </p>
        <p>
          In footnote 52, Carson writes that "many annihilationists" conclude
          "that punishment must be finite because we are finite and our actions
          are finite." However, annihilationists believe in a punishment that is
          just as eternal as traditionalists do. The punishment of death is
          eternal. In the very beginning of the article, Carson acknowledges
          that conditionalists believe in "everlasting punishment," so it is
          important not to forget that and caricature the position.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5.</b> Carson wonders why the just and the unjust are raised from a
          conditionalist perspective. They are raised for justice to be carried
          out. For the unjust to stand in court before a holy Judge, who will
          vindicate the righteous and punish the wicked. The dead are awaiting
          trial in Hades until then. Many unrighteous people have died in luxury
          with a good name. They will suffer a shameful, painful death on
          judgment day and be remembered with contempt by the righteous.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says there is "much to commend the idea" of universal human
          immortality, but he provides no verses to examine. Indeed, there are
          none which state that the unrighteous are immortal. Instead,
          immortality (which is the same thing as eternal life) is a gift
          exclusively reserved for those in Christ (1 Cor 15). The unrighteous
          will not receive eternal life but perish (Jn 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>6.</b> The final vision of the cosmos for conditionalists is one
          where God has destroyed all of His enemies. Death was the final enemy
          to be annihilated. The old things have passed away, and all things are
          made new. Christ will reconcile all things to himself, and everything
          will be subjected to the Father so that God may be all in all. From
          the traditional view, Carson says, "hell's inmates are full of sin."
          Wickedness is rampant in hell for all eternity. God will never finally
          stamp out evil but will instead grant the impenitent everlasting life.
          Justice will never be accomplished because the wicked will never
          receive all the punishment they deserve. In this view, it is hard to
          see how God has truly triumphed over evil when the rebels continue in
          their rebellion for all eternity. This view appears more like an
          eternal dualism between good and evil than the Bible's description of
          God's final, decisive victory over sin, death, and evil.
        </p>
        <h2>D. Concluding Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          Carson writes that it "is getting harder and harder to be faithful to
          the 'hard' lines of Scripture." Like many other traditionalists,
          Carson feels like he is fighting against liberals and compromisers in
          this debate over hell. I understand that feeling because ECT is a hard
          view emotionally for people, is in many protestant confessions, has
          been the traditional view for a long time, and is often attacked by
          liberals and cults. Notwithstanding all of those positive indicators,
          ECT simply does not stand up to biblical scrutiny. It misses the clear
          teaching that the gospel is a life and death matter, eternal life is
          only granted to believers, and unbelievers will finally perish in
          hell: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son,
          that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life"
          (Jn 3:16).
