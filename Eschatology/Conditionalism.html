        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
          resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a
          second, irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. In
          other words, the unrighteous will be finally destroyed by God. Only
          those who are saved through faith in Christ will receive the gift of
          immortality and eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional belief in the eternal conscious torment of the
          unsaved, whether right or wrong, acts as a doctrinal grid that affects
          our interpretation of biblical texts. This grid forces texts about
          "death," "destruction," and "perishing" to be interpreted
          metaphorically to refer to separation from God, pain, or torment.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are sufficient translational, exegetical, theological, and
          practical considerations to inspire humility and genuine reflection as
          one studies this weighty and important doctrine. Therefore, both sides
          must be careful to avoid reading presuppositions into the Bible or
          flippantly dismissing those who disagree. Proof-texting without regard
          for context or carefulness is irresponsible and unhelpful. A thorough
          examination of passages about the ultimate end of unbelievers is the
          only way we can reach clarity and certainty on the matter.

          will not suffer eternally. Instead, they will perish (John 3:16) as
          God destroys both their bodies and souls in hell (Matthew 10:28) and
          they are reduced to ashes (2 Peter 2:6). They will no longer exist as
          conscious people and will be gone forever."

          loss of being)." "More fully expressed, this would mean humans are
          mortal yet capable of immortality (after meeting qualifying
          conditions), or alternatively, immortal yet capable of mortality
          (after meeting disqualifying conditions)." "Our own view is that all
          people will be resurrected, but only some will receive a 'resurrection
          like his,' having 'died to sin' and been 'crucified with him,' in
          order that 'we will also live' and 'never die again,' for 'death has
          no dominion' over him, nor over those who are 'alive to God in Christ
          Jesus' (Rom 6:2-11)."

            >Statement on Evangelical Conditionalism</a
          >: "Conditionalism is the view that life is the Creator’s provisional
          gift to all, which will ultimately be granted forever to the saved and
          revoked forever from the unsaved. Evangelical conditionalists believe
          that the saved in Christ will receive glory, honor and immortality,
          being raised with an incorruptible body to inherit eternal life
          (Romans 2:7). The unsaved will be raised in shame and dishonor, to
          face God and receive the just condemnation for their sins. When the
          penalty is carried out, they will be permanently excluded from eternal
          life by means of a final death, implicating the whole person in a
          destruction of human life and being (Matthew 10:28)."
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. Scripture, being the very
          word of God, is both authoritative and accurate in all that it
          teaches. It is the standard of truth over and against all human
          traditions, philosophies, creeds, councils, and authorities. I cite
          resources at the bottom of each section when relevant for further
          study and support. Not all the authors cited are Conditionalists,
          though the majority are.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          What would cause someone to question a belief that seems so certain?
          One only needs to consider the time before the Reformation when many
          in the visible church believed that justification was by faith and
          works. It was going back to the Word of God with an open mind to be
          conformed to its message that revealed that doctrinal error. So, it is
          certainly possible for many to be mistaken about what the Bible
          teaches, but what in Scripture would cause someone to question eternal
          torment?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well to start with, the very meaning of the gospel suggests that
          death, not eternal torment, is the price for sin. Everyone is under
          "the law of sin and death" (Rom 8:2), for "the wages of sin is death"
          (Rom 6:23). "But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we
          were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom 5:8), so that we have "an
          atoning sacrifice through faith in his blood" (Rom 3:25). He, "who was
          delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification" (Rom
          4:25), took the penalty for our sins, that is death, on the cross for
          our justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those whose sins are not covered by the cross will be held accountable
          on judgment day. They will have to suffer the consequences of sin with
          the most serious punishment, capital punishment. They will be cast
          into the lake of fire where they will undergo the second death (Rev
          20:14). This permanent, final punishment, the second death, is the
          ultimate consequence of sin. It entails eternal and complete
          destruction from God who will annihilate both soul and body in Gehenna
          (Mat 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          This punishment is put in contrast to eternal life which is
          consistently presented in the New Testament as the desirable
          alternative to death, destruction, and perishing. The Bible clearly
          states that the righteous will be resurrected and given immortality,
          but there is no suggestion in the Scriptures that the wicked will be
          granted immortality. They will not receive eternal life but perish (Jn
          3:16). In contrast to this, the historic doctrine of eternal torment
          holds that unbelievers will also be granted eternal, embodied life
          just like believers, and the price for their sins is not death but
          torment.

          clear my desk to engage in prayerful, thorough, painstaking exegesis
          to have landed on this position. But from what I have seen, there’s a
          good deal of sound, biblical arguments for it."

          and John Wenham, embrace conditional immortality and annihilationism
          'for the right reason—not because it fitted into their comfort zone,
          though it did, but because they thought they found it in the Bible.'"

          from a firm commitment to the truthfulness and perennial relevance of
          the Bible, and not from a desire to have its message be more palatable
          to our own culture. We are not seeking to construct a more tolerable
          version of hell, as though primarily motivated by an emotional
          aversion to the idea of eternal torment. Neither do we assume,
          however, that the correct view of Hell must be whichever is perceived
          to be the harshest and most intolerable."

        <h2>Proof Texts</h2>
        <p>
          Consider how each one of these texts states or implies that we must
          believe in Jesus Christ to live eternally:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that
            whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life"
            (Jn 3:16).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word and believes him
            who sent me has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but
            has passed out of death into life" (Jn 5:24).
          </p>
          <p>
            "This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the
            Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise
            him up at the last day" (Jn 6:40).
          </p>
          <p>
            "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the
            Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that
            you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God" (1 Jn
            5:13)
          </p>
          <p>
            "However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus
            Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who
            were going to believe in him for eternal life" (1 Tim 1:16).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Other times the Bible speaks of the evidence of faith, the
          demonstration that we are true believers, as the condition for eternal
          life:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father,
            or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will
            receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life" (Mat
            19:29).
          </p>
          <p>
            "to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor,
            and incorruptibility, eternal life" (Rom 2:7).
          </p>
          <p>
            "But now, being made free from sin and having become servants of
            God, you have your fruit of sanctification and the result of eternal
            life" (Rom 6:22).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          And one of my favorite verses. Notice again the condition for
          receiving eternal life and immortality:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst
            again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well
            of water springing up to eternal life" (Jn 4:14).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Those who do not have faith in Christ will not receive eternal life
          but perish:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys
            the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him" (Jn
            3:36).
          </p>
          <p>
            "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal
            life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom 6:23).

          concerning the end of the wicked. It appears silent to the
          traditionalist only because it says nothing he expected to find. It is
          silent, however, about unending conscious torture. But it speaks
          volumes concerning that penalty first threatened in the Garden of
          Eden: Those who sin will "surely die" (Gen 3:3; Ezek 18:4)."

        <h2>Translation of Hell</h2>
        <p>
          The King James Version translates the words Sheol, Hades, Tartarus,
          and Gehenna as hell. This is inaccurate and confusing in modern
          English. There are still many modern translations which translate
          these words inconsistently, but Gehenna is the only one that refers to
          the final fate of the wicked. It is a real valley outside of Jerusalem
          with an Old Testament background that needs to be taken into account.

          When the Bible says people go to 'hell,' we agree. We just think it
          is, as Jesus put it in Matthew 10:28, where God destroys 'both body
          and soul.' We don’t believe in hell as a place of eternal torment
          because that’s not what the Bible means when it uses the underlying

          and is the equivalent of the Greek Haides, by which word it is
          translated in Septuagint... The believer's hope for the future, so far
          as this had place, was not prolonged existence in Sheol, but
          deliverance from it and restoration to new life in God's presence (Job
          14:13-15; Job 19:25-27 Psalm 16:10, 11; Psalm 17:15; Psalm 49:15;

          The gates of Sheol will not prevail against Christ’s church because
          Jesus has already broken down its doors. All those united to Christ by
          faith and through the power of his Holy Spirit are no longer prisoners

          3 times. Can you imagine the same word being translated as both grave
          and hell?... By its usage we see that Sheol was considered the place
          or state of all the dead -- whether they were good or bad. When used
          figuratively it could mean the consequences of wickedness in the
          present world, likened to death."

          poet, spoke of 'dark Tartarus...the deepest pit' (Iliad, 8.13). Here
          [2 Peter 2:4], it is used of the abode of evil angels prior to their
          banishment to Gehenna, their ultimate destiny (cf. Mt. 25:41)."
        </p>

        <h2>Gehenna</h2>
        <p>
          Gehenna, the shortened name for the valley of Hinnom, became notorious
          during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh as the location where
          children were sacrificed by fire to the god Molech (2 Chron 28:3;
          33:6). The valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would
          be called a place of slaughter where it was prophesied to be filled
          with the corpses of those who had turned away from God. This valley
          thus became synonymous with divine punishment, where the dead bodies
          of the slain were left unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers,
          painting a vivid picture of desolation and wrath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just bodily destruction,
          but the culmination of divine judgment where the opportunity for
          salvation is irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete
          destruction of soul and body by God. Jesus uses Gehenna
          eschatologically to illustrate the final death of the wicked (Mat
          5:22, 29-30, 18:9). This imagery resonates with Isaiah 66:24, a verse
          Jesus quotes when speaking of Gehenna, reinforcing the notion of
          Gehenna as a place of total annihilation. This is consistent with Paul
          who speaks of the ultimate fate of the wicked in terms of destruction
          (Phil 1:28; 3:18-19; Rom 9:22-24; 2 Thes 1:8-9).
        </p>
        <p>
          A common myth is that the Valley of Hinnom was a garbage dump that was
          always burning with fire, and therefore provided good imagery for
          eternal torment. However, this is a baseless claim first made by Rabbi
          David Kimhi around A.D. 1200. Although the garbage dump theory is
          commonly stated in study Bibles and commentaries to support the
          doctrine of eternal torment, there is no archeological or literary
          evidence to back it up. The reality is that the Old Testament provides
          the background for Gehenna as a place of slaughter, death, and
          destruction, a stark contrast to the idea of people being tormented
          forever and never dying.

          the idea, but because it seems a reasonable explanation for the origin
          of the Hinnom Valley as 'hell,' writers and preachers accept and

        <h2>Penalty</h2>
        <p>
          Penalty is that pain or loss which is directly or indirectly inflicted
          by the Lawgiver, in vindication of his justice outraged by the
          violation of law.
        </p>
        <p>In this definition it is implied that:</p>
        <p>
          1. The natural consequences of transgression, although they constitute
          a part of the penalty of sin, do not exhaust that penalty. In all
          penalty there is a personal element, the holy wrath of the Lawgiver,
          which natural consequences but partially express.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The object of penalty is not the reformation of the offender or the
          ensuring of social or governmental safety. These ends may be
          incidentally secured through its infliction, but the great end of
          penalty is the vindication of the character of the Lawgiver. Penalty
          is essentially a necessary reaction of the divine holiness against
          sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin is the negation of the law. Penalty is the negation of that
          negation, that is, the reestablishment of the law. Sin is a thrust of
          the sinner against the law, and penalty is the adverse thrust of that
          law against sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ submitted to physical death as the penalty for sin, and by his
          resurrection from the grave gave proof that the penalty of sin was
          exhausted and that humanity in him was justified. Sin and its effects
          still remain for now. However, every believer's hope is in
          resurrection unto eternal life with Christ, while the end for unbelief
          is eternal death. These two outcomes are seen in the twofold nature of
          death in Scripture:
        </p>
        <p>
          The first death is the loss of bodily life including all those
          temporal evils and sufferings accompanying it. Physical death is a
          direct consequence of sin and a curse on humanity. The first death is
          an expression of the nature of God and his holy wrath against sin, but
          it is not the full expression of God's justice against sin. The souls
          of all men survive the first death to be raised and judged on the last
          day. The bodily resurrection of those in Christ is the defeat and
          reversal of the first death, while the resurrection of those in Adam
          is for the execution of justice which consists of the second death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second death is the destruction of soul and body from God
          including all the shame and torment accompanying it. Unbelievers will
          be raised on the last day to give account for deeds done in this life
          to the Son who will execute judgment. The second death is the penalty
          they will face for their sins. It is nothing less than eternal death
          which encompasses the loss of the whole person forever. It is an
          eternal punishment from which there is neither return nor end. After
          the final judgment, justice will have been accomplished and all those
          who suffered in this life for God's sake will be vindicated.

        <h2>Fallacies</h2>
        <p>
          Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman. Both
          sides affirm eternal punishment. The disagreement is over the nature
          of that punishment. Conditionalists do not argue that the punishment
          for sin is ceasing to exist. The punishment is death (deprivation of
          life). For the damned, this punishment is eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Annihilationists redefine the word eternal: This misunderstands the
          position. Annihilationism is the view that the punishment for sin is
          death, though it does affirm that there is suffering leading up to and
          accompanying that death. Both positions affirm eternal punishment. It
          is not the view that sinners receive the punishment of torment for a
          long time to pay the price of their sins before God ends their lives,
          and it does not teach that God instantly annihilates sinners so that
          they face no pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          This view must be wrong because Jehovah's Witnesses believe it: This
          isn't even the genetic fallacy. Annihilationism has strong support in
          the early church until the time of Augustine and is becoming more
          common among conservative, Bible-believing Christians now. This is the
          guilt by association fallacy. Just because this position is held by a
          heretical group, doesn't mean that it is wrong or that others hold the
          position for the same reasons. The arguments given here are exegetical
          and based on accepted hermeneutical principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists deny degrees of punishment: It is argued that
          Conditionalism must deny degrees of punishment since the wicked will
          all face the same fate of death in the end. This does not follow
          though. If you want to understand degrees of capital punishment,
          consider the differences between death by lethal injection, firing
          squad, burning at the stake, and crucifixion. In contrast, the
          traditional view is that one sin and a lifetime of sin both merit
          everlasting torment. Both views give an account for degrees of
          punishment, though the latter appears to give a much worse account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
          character of love and justice: This is a red herring. The focus should
          remain exegetical first and foremost. There is certainly room to
          discuss the justness of each view, but one's intuition about justice
          should not be treated as the primary argument or motivation for their
          view. Moreover, death, not eternal torment, is consistently said to be
          the price of sin, so it is not hard to understand the belief that
          capital punishment aligns with God's justice. Traditionalists also
          have explanations for why God would be just to inflict eternal
          torment. Ultimately, we must rely on the Bible more than intuition or
          emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea
          of people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just
          theological liberals: This is just poisoning the well when people
          begin with these kinds of accusations. The goal is not to
          psychoanalyze the other side but to examine arguments about the
          biblical view of hell. It may in fact be traditionalists that are not
          taking the biblical language serious enough through constant
          allegorizing of language about life and death, perishing, destruction,
          fire, Gehenna, extinction, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as
          metaphors for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets
          these descriptions non-literally or metaphorically is not only false,
          it is used rhetorically to discount consideration of the view.
          Destruction and annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on
          fire are consumed and destroyed. Rather, construing these descriptions
          to mean eternal conscious torment is clearly the metaphorical
          interpretation of these passages.

          destruction... John Stott has commented that 'it would seem strange,
          therefore, if people who are said to suffer destruction are in fact
          not destroyed.' He concurs with his partner in dialogue David Edwards
          (while they disagree on many other things) that it is 'difficult to
          imagine a perpetually inconclusive process of perishing.'"
        </p>

        <h2>Correcting Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
          The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
          created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
          existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live
          on forever. God "is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna."
          (Mat. 10:28).

          Everyone might not spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone
          will experience eternal life, either in heaven or hell, is an
          assumption that must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is
          almost the only text used to argue that all people will be raised with
          immortality and incorruptibility; however, in context, this chapter is
          only about those in Christ being raised and says nothing of
          unbelievers. Verses like John 3:16 indicate the opposite, that
          unbelievers are destined to perish.

          Michael Horton, A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way,
          (Zondervan: Grand Rapids, 2011), 908: "However, in Scripture there is
          no assumption that the soul is immortal. Rather, like the body, it is
          a created substance with a beginning and an end. Immortality was the
          goal held out to Adam and Eve in the Tree of Life, and not merely for
          the soul but for the whole person. It is this immortality that was
          forfeited by Adam but has been promised to those who trust in Jesus
          Christ."

            >The Neglected Doctrines of Resurrection and Bodily
            Transformation</a
          >, 2017: "This, in a nutshell, is conditional immortality, in which
          salvation is understood to be rescue from the mortal condition that
          results from sin... It explains why Christ’s resurrection is so unique
          and profound, and how if we are to receive eternal life and
          immortality, it is necessary for us to participate in 'a resurrection
          like his' (Rom 6:5). To a dying world, the fact that Jesus died and
          conquered death for us is very good news indeed."
