        <h2>Hermeneutic</h2>
        <p>
          If we recognize the following principles, we shouldn't go far astray:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. John is describing a symbolic vision, not a direct picture of the
          future. The vision is made up of symbols that represent reality but
          which need interpretation. He is not giving a direct, literal
          description of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. John uses Old Testament language to describe the vision he sees. We
          need to understand the Old Testament allusions in context to properly
          understand John's intended meaning. Intertestamental literature like
          the Jewish targums and the Greco-Roman background of Revelation also
          help inform our understanding of the language John uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. John develops certain themes throughout the book of Revelation, so
          comparing related passages with each other helps to elucidate the
          meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Some of the symbolic pictures in Revelation are given direct
          interpretations in which case the referent is immediately known. The
          interpretation of a symbol is not symbolic itself, but is the literal,
          direct, or straightforward meaning of the symbol.

          48, New Studies in Biblical Theology (Downers Grove: IVP, 2019), 8:
          "Like Jesus and the Old Testament prophets, Revelation presents its
          message in symbolic, pictorial language to unveil true spiritual
          realities compellingly to those with ears to hear... Jesus Christ
          ‘made known’ or ‘signified’ (<em>sēmainō</em>) the revelation to John
          by sending an angel (Rev. 1:1). Similarly, Daniel 2:30, 45 LXX says
          that the mystery of the king’s dream ‘was shown’ (<em>sēmainō</em>) to
          Daniel and ‘the great God has shown [<em>sēmainō</em>] the king what
          will be at the end of the days’ (NETS)."

          word pictures, as though a number of slides were being shown upon a
          great screen. As we watch we allow ourselves to be carried along by
          impressions created by these pictures. Many of the details of the
          pictures are intended to contribute to the total impression, and are
          not to be isolated and interpreted with wooden literalism."

          response... In reporting his visionary experiences, John frequently
          uses symbolic language. Sometimes he explains the meaning of the
          symbols... [I]n attempting to understand John’s symbolism, we must
          consider not only the book itself but also his use of the Old
          Testament... In any case, it is important to recognize that the
          descriptions
          <em
            >are descriptions of symbols, not of the reality conveyed by the
            symbols</em

          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2001), 4, 11, 13, 22: "Although, as
          we will see, applying the literal-where-possible maxim to prophetic
          literature is problematic, its inadequacy does not mean that
          Revelation is a wax nose, to be manipulated into any shape we
          choose... The literal meaning of symbolic language is the symbolic
          correspondence between the imagery of the language and the referent
          that it describes... We dare not tackle the symbolism of Revelation
          without immersing our minds in the rich imagery of the Old
          Testament... Revelation makes sense only in light of the Old
          Testament. Not only the visions of such prophets as Ezekiel, Daniel,
          and Zechariah but also historical events such as creation, the fall,
          and the exodus provide the symbolic vocabulary for John’s visions."

          book... with the word 'apocalypse'... a clear allusion to Dan. 2...
          The revelation is not abstract but pictorial... Dan. 2:28-30, 45
          indicates that a symbolic vision and its interpretation is going to be
          part of the warp and woof of the means of communication throughout
          Revelation. This conclusion is based on the supposition that John uses
          OT references with significant degrees of awareness of OT context, for
          which I will argue later... [A] number of authors of both popular and
          scholarly commentaries contend that one should interpret literally
          except where one is forced to interpret symbolically by clear
          indications of context... But the results of the analysis above of 1:1
          indicate that... the essence of the book is figurative ['1:12-20 and
          4:1-22:5 at the least']... The OT and Judaism are the primary

          the Old Testament in a careful and not haphazard way throughout, so
          that an understanding of these Old Testament texts is crucial to the
          interpretation of the Apocalypse at every point along the way and is
          necessary for understanding his literary strategy. Consequently, the
          Old Testament 'forms a body of literature which John expects his
          readers to know and explicitly to recall in detail while reading his
          own work'. Furthermore, a study of Jewish exegetical tradition of
          various Old Testament texts can also shed light on John's own
          understanding of the same texts."

          ['the verb cognate of the noun “sign” in john’s Gospel']... in 1:1
          because of its parallels with Dan. 2:28-30, 45, where God 'signifies'
          truths through pictorial or symbolic visions. Thus it means to
          'communicate by symbols' and connotes the need to interpret the
          reality behind the symbol... Symbols are metaphorical utterances that
          are meant to be understood first pictorially and then referentially...
          The sources for interpreting them come from the OT, intertestamental
          literature, and the Greco-Roman world—in other words, in the common
          world of the original readers in the province of Asia."

          Richard Bauckham, Climax of Prophecy, (Edinburgh: T&T, 1993), xi: "It
          is a book designed to be read in constant intertextual relationship
          with the Old Testament. John was writing what he understood to be a
          work of prophetic scripture, the climax of prophetic revelation, which
          gathered up the prophetic meaning of the Old Testament scriptures and
          disclosed the way in which it was being and was to be fulfilled in the
          last days. His work therefore, presupposes and conveys an extensive
          interpretation of large parts of Old Testament prophecy. Allusions are
          meant to recall the Old Testament context, which thereby becomes part
          of the meaning the Apocalypse conveys, and to build up, sometimes by a
          network of allusion to the same Old Testament passage in various parts
          of the Apocalypse, an interpretation of whole passages of Old
          Testament prophecy."

          Vern S. Poythress, The Returning King (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R
          Publishing, 2000), 47: "Some people today come to Revelation with the
          recipe, 'Interpret everything literally, if possible.' That recipe
          misunderstands what kind of book Revelation is. Of course, John
          literally saw what he says he saw. But what he saw was a vision. It
          was filled with symbols, like the Beast of 13:1–8 and the seven
          blazing lamps in 4:5. It never intended to be a direct, nonsymbolical
          description of the future. People living in John’s own time understood
          this matter instinctively, because they recognized that John was
          writing in an 'apocalyptic' manner, a manner already as familiar to
          them as a political cartoon is to us today."

            >Judgment in the Book Of Revelation</a
          >, 2: "The correspondence of crime and punishment here depends on a
          wordplay, exploiting the double meaning of <em>diaphtheirō</em>, which
          can mean both “destroy,” in the sense of causing to perish, and
          “ruin,” in the sense of corrupting with evil. The destroyers of the
          earth are the powers of evil who are ruining God’s creation with their
          violence, oppression, and idolatrous religion (cf. 19:2). There is an
          allusion to the equivalent wordplay in the Genesis story of the flood
          (Gen 6:11–13, 17, where s-h-t has the same double meaning). In both
          cases God’s wholesale destruction of those who are ruining his
          creation is justified as necessary for the preservation of his
          creation and its salvation from the evil they are doing to it."
        </p>

        <h2>Revelation 14:9-11</h2>
        <p>
          "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, 'If
          anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
          forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath
          of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be
          tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and
          in the presence of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up
          forever and ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship
          the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Old Testament, the cup of God's wrath is a potent symbol of
          divine judgment, sometimes temporary and recoverable, while at other
          times irreversible and destructive (Isa 51:22-52:2; Obad 16; Jer
          25:27). Jesus, representing humanity, took upon himself the wrathful
          cup, enduring death (Matt 26:39, 42, 44). His death and resurrection
          mean that his followers no longer face this wrath, instead receiving a
          cup of blessing (Matt 26:27-29). Revelation portrays the cup as a
          judgment against "Babylon," the epitome of evil, leading to its
          inevitable destruction (Rev 16:19; 18:6, 7-9). It affects all those
          allied with the beast (Rev 17–19), and symbolizes a final, fatal
          judgment, leading to utter destruction characterized by torment,
          grief, famine, and fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of fire and brimstone is found in references to Sodom and
          Gomorrah (Gen 19:23, 28; Deut 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isa 30:27-33;
          34:9-11; Ezek 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive annihilation and
          complete destruction, leaving nothing but ashes in its wake. This
          picture appears to be in stark contrast to excruciating, unending
          suffering.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
            plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a
            furnace" (Gen 19:28).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Smoke rising forever symbolizes the permanent destruction of the
          wicked. This is the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10. The city was
          destroyed by fire, and the smoke rising forever represents the
          everlasting nature of its destruction. The smoke, therefore, stands as
          a permanent reminder of God's final victory over evil.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "It won’t be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever.
            From generation to generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass
            through it forever and ever" (Isa 34:10).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          John vividly depicts the plight of those who worship the beast,
          emphasizing that they find no respite "day or night." John
          consistently uses "day and night" in Revelation to describe continuous
          actions, unrelated to time of day, such as the living creatures'
          praise, the martyrs' service, Satan's accusations, and the torment of
          the unholy trinity. Similarly, Isaiah 34:10 uses "night and day" to
          describe Edom's unquenched fire, symbolizing complete destruction.
          While the fire burns continuously without ceasing, it will consume
          completely.

          genitive construction indicating not duration of time (like the
          accusative construction of the same phrase) but kind of time, that is,
          time of ceaseless activity... The lack of rest will continue
          uninterrupted as long as the period of suffering lasts, though there
          will be an end to the period. Therefore, the imagery of Rev 14:10-11
          could indicate a great judgment that will be remembered forever, not
          one that leads to eternal suffering."

          completed, the destructive process encompassed such conscious
          suffering as God saw fit to require. That was true of the temporal
          judgment against Sodom and Gomorrah. It was later true of God’s

          is the finality of Babylon’s judgment: 'her smoke ascends forever.'
          The wording comes from Isa. 34:9-10, where the portrayal of smoke
          continually ascending serves as a permanent memorial to God’s
          punishment of Edom for its sin. Rev. 14:11 also alludes to Isa.
          34:9-10 to describe the never-ending effect of God’s judgment of the
          beast’s followers. Here Edom’s fall is taken as an anticipatory
          typological pattern for the fall of the world system, which will never
          rise again after God’s judgment."

        <h2>Revelation 20:10</h2>
        <p>
          "The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and
          sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be
          tormented day and night forever and ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          John couldn't see an eternal process in a vision and the language he
          uses reflects that. "Forever and ever" is figurative and indicates a
          long period of time. John sees the beast, the false prophet, and the
          devil suffering torment for a very long time. John tells us that the
          "lake of fire" is a picture the "the second death" (Rev 20:14; 21:8).
          John is not using symbolism to interpret his symbolism. The vision he
          sees represents the final death of the wicked, not everlasting
          torment. This vision is a climatic recapitulation of the judgment
          portrayed throughout Revelation (16:14, 16; 17:14; 19:11-21).
          Confirming this is the fact that the personified figures of Death and
          Hades are indeed destroyed after they were thrown into the lake of
          fire. Christ's enemies are destroyed, and righteousness will reign
          forevermore.

          are destruction. (b) This same verbiage and imagery are borrowed from
          two major OT sources (Ezekiel and Isaiah), showing that this imagery
          is used to denote utter destruction, not an ongoing process. (c) The
          inanimate entities thrown into the lake of fire are later taken to be
          destroyed, and so (d) it is reasonable to assume the same end for the
          animate entities (Satan, the angels, the false prophet, and

          The wicked city Babylon is pictured as a woman whose judgment in
          chapter 18 is 'torment and grief,' which turns out to be 'death,
          mourning, and famine,' and she is 'consumed by fire.' It is not
          unthinkable, therefore, to understand torment of the devil, beast, and

          figuratively connotes a very long time. The context here and in the
          whole Apocalypse must determine whether this is a limited time or an
          unending period... All unbelievers suffering the first death are held
          in the sphere of 'death and Hades,' which is a temporary,
          preconsummate holding tank to be finally replaced by the permanent,
          consummate 'lake of fire,' which is 'the second death' (see on

          sees a vision where three beings are thrown into a lake of fire to be

          destruction of the things the images represent in real life."

          cycle of judgments, each of which leads up to the Second Coming... The
          final battle in 20:7–10 seems to be the same as the final battle in

          enemies are destroyed in 19:11–21. If 20:1–6 describes events later

          pre-NT Jewish texts reflect a conditionalist belief in keeping with

            >Traditionalism and the (Not So) Second Death</a
          >: "Putting aside the rather awkward definition of death as torment,
          this line of reasoning suffers from still another problem. Those over
          whom John says the second death will have no power are those who come
          to life and reign with Christ (20:4-6). Those who are not thrown into
          the lake of fire—the second death—are first raised out of death and
          Hades (20:13-15). The first death, then, is something experienced by
          both believers and unbelievers alike; both are raised from it, and
          only the unsaved experience the second. Therefore, if what qualifies
          the second death as the <em>second</em> death is the torment in which
          it consists, and in which the first death likewise consists, then it
          follows that believers, too, experience torment in Hades prior to the
          resurrection."

            >What is the Second Death? Part 1, Symbols and Meanings</a
          >, 2017: "The traditional view reads this verse backwards as if John
          saw a vision of people dying a second time and was then told that 'the
          second death is the lake of fire'. Traditionalists then take this
          strange definition of death and apply it to other verses like Romans
          6:23... They say that 'death' does not mean what we normally think of
          as 'death'. Indeed, the traditional view is that the unsaved NEVER
          actually die. Instead they live forever in the lake of fire. Hopefully
          by now you can see that this is backwards."

            >Second Death</a
          >: "The second death, also known as eternal death, is an
          eschatological concept in Judaism... Harry Sysling, in his study
          (1996) of Teḥiyyat ha-metim (Hebrew; "the resurrection of the dead")
          in the Palestinian Targums, identifies a consistent usage of the term
          "second death" in texts of the Second Temple period and early
          rabbinical writings. In most cases, the "second death" is identical
          with the judgment, following the resurrection, in Gehinnom at the Last
          Day [indicating that the wicked will perish]."

          fire... for they [Revelation 22:11, 15] contain the words spoken to
          John on behalf of Jesus <em>after</em> the vision had concluded. The
          apocalyptic vision of the future had ended in verse 5 with the
          description of the New Jerusalem’s river and tree of life and the
          presence of God amongst his saints there."
