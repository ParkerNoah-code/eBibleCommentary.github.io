        <h2>Atonement</h2>
        <p>
          Christ is our lamb whose life was given in order to atone for our
          sins:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For the life of the flesh is in the blood. I have given it to you
            on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood
            that makes atonement by reason of the life." (Lev 17:11).
          </p>
          <p>
            "The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the
            Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (Jn 1:29).
          </p>
          <p>
            "For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place."
            (1 Cor 5:7).
          </p>
          <p>
            "but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish or spot, the
            blood of Christ" (1 Pet 1:19).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          If Christ's substitutionary work, His taking our punishment on
          Himself, was death, then the punishment for sin is death. Christ's
          punishment is what He suffered on our behalf or else an indication of
          what we will suffer without Him:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to
            give his life as a ransom for many." (Mat 20:28).
          </p>
          <p>
            "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for
            the sheep." (Jn 10:11).
          </p>
          <p>
            "But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet
            sinners, Christ died for us." (Rom 5:8).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
            unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in
            the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit" (1 Pet 3:18).

          charge conditionalism with being Christologically problematic, it
          seems the real danger to orthodox Christology lies in their own
          tendency to locate the substitutionary work of Christ in his
          suffering... if the finite duration of his suffering is the
          substitutionary equivalent to the eternity of suffering awaiting the
          risen, undying wicked, why did he go on to die? If 'he had paid the
          full penalty for our sin,' as Grudem says, what penalty was left to
          pay with his death?"

          resurrection and that they condemned the belief that the dead go

          brought to them from God the Ruler; concerning what had to be done so
          that they might escape death and receive an immortality unknown to
          them? And when the strangeness of these things and the unheard

          hesitate to believe, the Lord of every power and the Destroyer of
          death itself, allowed His human form to be killed, so that from the

          on the one hand perish if they have not known God, and on the other be
          delivered from death if they have given heed to His threats and

          real death, this which leaves nothing behind. For that which is seen

          >: "For if, out of a former normal state of non-existence, they were
          called into being by the Presence and loving-kindness of the Word, it
          followed naturally that when men were bereft of the knowledge of God
          and were turned back to what was not (for what is evil is not, but
          what is good is), they should, since they derive their being from God
          who IS, be everlastingly bereft even of being; in other words, that
          they should be disintegrated and abide in death and corruption. For
          man is by nature mortal, inasmuch as he is made out of what is not;
          but by reason of his likeness to Him that is (and if he still
          preserved this likeness by keeping Him in his knowledge) he would stay
          his natural corruption, and remain incorrupt" (4.5).
        </p>
        <p>
          "For it were monstrous, firstly, that God, having spoken, should prove
          false — that, when once He had ordained that man, if he transgressed
          the commandment, should die the death, after the transgression man
          should not die, but God's word should be broken. For God would not be
          true, if, when He had said we should die, man died not. Again, it were
          unseemly that creatures once made rational, and having partaken of the
          Word, should go to ruin, and turn again toward non-existence by the
          way of corruption... It was, then, out of the question to leave men to
          the current of corruption; because this would be unseemly, and
          unworthy of God's goodness." (6.3-4, 10).

          >, 69: "Again, if the Son were a creature, man had remained mortal as
          before, not being joined to God; for a creature had not joined
          creatures to God, as seeking itself one to join it ; nor would a
          portion of the creation have been the creation's salvation, as needing
          salvation itself. To provide against this also, He sends His own Son,
          and He becomes Son of Man, by taking created flesh; that, since all
          were under sentence of death, He, being other than them all, might
          Himself for all offer to death His own body; and that henceforth, as
          if all had died through Him, the word of that sentence might be
          accomplished (for 'all died 2 Corinthians 5:14 ' in Christ), and all
          through Him might thereupon become free from sin and from the curse
          which came upon it, and might truly abide for ever, risen from the
          dead and clothed in immortality and incorruption."

          testify to the reality that people deeply fear death, and the Bible’s
          offer of immortal life is naturally appealing to them... Consequently,

          There are many other examples. Far from being a step towards
          universalism or theological compromise of some kind, the Biblical

          as eternal conscious torment 'intolerable'... But Stott was thoroughly
          evangelical, and he knew that his question must be 'not what does my
          heart tell me, but what does God’s Word say?'... In face of that
          stumbling block to the evangelistic work of traditionalists in the
          western world, might it not be, therefore, that an annihilationist
          understanding would be considerably less scandalous, and therefore
          that Christian annihilationists would find themselves more eager to
          share the good news of Jesus’ saving work, and less reluctant to
          describe the consequences of rejecting Christ?"

        <h2>Eternal Death</h2>
        <p>
          The language of conditional immortality flows straight from the Bible
          and has been widely used by those who hold to the traditional view of
          hell who would frankly admit that they are just parroting the clear
          teaching of Scripture. The phrase "eternal death" exemplifies
          annihilation language and is frequently contrasted with "eternal life"
          conditioned on faith in Christ, the conditional aspect of conditional
          immortality, providing the two sides of conditional immortality. But
          this language clearly undermines and betrays their position on hell;
          for they hold that an embodied life of suffering is the punishment for
          sin, not death forever. That is why the word "death" is equivocated on
          and reinterpreted to mean separation instead of the loss of life.

          Posterity of Adam who have been guilty of no other Transgression but
          that of the Light and Law of Nature... Now this Punishment must be the
          Fruit of that Curse which is the Sanction of that Law which they were
          under, and which was transgressed by them, which was the Law of
          Creation, even the same Law that Adam was made under; and if the Law
          be the same, the same Penalty was incurred by the Transgression
          thereof; and if they are liable to eternal Death for the Transgression
          of this Law, there is no rational doubt but Adam was so."

          future punishment. There is no other death which the soul is in danger
          of dying... This passage proves, then, that there is a death which the

          death as a consequence of sin; and that the soul will suffer that
