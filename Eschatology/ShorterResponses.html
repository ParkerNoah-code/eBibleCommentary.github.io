        <h2>John M. Frame</h2>
        <p>
          <a

            >Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</a
          >
          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2013). In response to the chapter
          called "Eternal Punishment of Unbelievers (Hell)," pgs. 1081-1083:
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Frame admits that he is reluctant to write about the topic of
          hell, unpleasant as it is, he states, "I must teach only what the
          Bible teaches." This is certainly to be commended; however, the
          question still remains, what does the Bible teach about hell?
        </p>
        <p>
          I certainly agree with Frame that all sinners are under the just
          condemnation of a holy God and in need of a savior. We are saved by
          faith in the Son of God who died on the cross for us. His death
          provides atonement for our sins, but the wrath of God remains on those
          who don't believe in the Son. Frame cites Exodus 15:6-7 to explain the
          wrath of God, but it also provides important background information
          about the consuming fire of God:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand,
            Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces. In the greatness of your
            excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send
            out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Frame states that the "OT descriptions of God's wrath mainly concern
          what happens in this life." The Old Testament speaks of God's enemies
          being slain, consumed by fire, and put to an end. He is beginning to
          try to create a contrast between Old and New Testament language of
          destruction because he believes that the New Testament teaches eternal
          conscious torment. However, the New Testament uses Old Testament
          language to describe eschatological judgment. If the Old Testament
          descriptions are of annihilation, it provides strong support for
          conditionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then makes the argument that punishment in this life could never
          satisfy God's law and cites Hebrews 10:26-27:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
            truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain
            fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will
            devour the adversaries."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This sounds awfully familiar to the outcome of God's enemies in the
          Old Testament. The traditional view does not teach that God's enemies
          will be consumed and devoured. Instead, it teaches that they will
          continue burning alive forever. Thus far, no support for the
          traditional view can be found while much of the language cited
          provides support for conditionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditionalists agree with Frame that the final "punishment is
          everlasting," but Romans 6:23 explains what the punishment for sin is:
          "the wages of sin is death." Frame cites Matthew 25:46 to support the
          eternal aspect of the final judgment:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
            eternal life."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Notice that Jesus contrasts eternal punishment with eternal life. The
          final punishment doesn't include eternal life. Traditionalists argue
          that the wicked will be made immortal and granted eternal life to
          suffer in hell forever. Conditionalists, on the other hand, argue that
          the wicked will not receive eternal life but perish eternally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Frame reveals the real impetus behind his belief in eternal
          conscious torment: Revelation 14:11. And like most traditionalist
          treatments on hell, there is no consideration given to the context,
          genre, or background of the verse. It's just cited as if it came out
          of a textbook, rather than an apocalyptic book full of Old Testament
          allusions and symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frame's only response to annihilationism is that "Scripture suggests
          the opposite, that not only does the fire continue forever, but the
          torment of the wicked continues forever as well (Rev. 14:11; 20:10)."
          This is not a substantial explanation. If we remember that John's
          vision is of a representation of the final judgment (it's symbolic),
          then we see that Frame hasn't even started to give a biblical argument
          for eternal conscious torment because he hasn't tried to interpret any
          of the symbols. Both passages are describing the final judgment. John
          interprets the lake of fire in Revelation 20:10 in clear language two
          times. The lake of fire is the second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8). It
          means dying a second time, both body and soul (Mat 10:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He provides several references in parentheses for support which, when
          understood in context, provide vivid pictures of annihilation. Mark
          9:43 and 48 contain a quote to Isaiah 66:24, a passage indicating that
          the fires will be inextinguishable, thus burning up the dead bodies
          completely. Luke 16:22-24 and 28 are not even about hell, but about
          Hades, the intermediate state, demonstrating the sloppiness of
          exegesis needed to provide support for the traditional view.
          Revelation 14:11 and 19:3 both indicate that smoke rises forever.
          Likewise, the smoke rises forever from Edom which was destroyed by
          unquenchable fire (Isa 34:8-10). The everlasting smoke symbolizes the
          remembrance of a judgment which results in complete destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other verses in Scripture are very clear on this issue too. Paul
          teaches that sin leads to death and destruction. The language of
          eschatological perishing and dying is used all over the New Testament.
          The Old Testament is very clear about the fate of the wicked too. All
          of that clear teaching can't be reinterpreted based upon the
          non-exegesis of Revelation. Unfortunately, that's what most defenses
          of the traditional view amount to.

        <h2>Robert L. Reymond</h2>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Systematic-Theology-Christian-Faith/dp/0310108950/ref=sr_1_1?crid=28T6DJ3YT10PO&keywords=robert+l+reymond&qid=1703649614&sprefix=robert+l+reymond%2Caps%2C77&sr=8-1"
            target="_blank"
            >A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith: 2nd Edition</a
          >, 2020. In response to the chapter called "Eternal Punishment
          Construed as Annihilation," pgs. 1068-1081:
        </p>
        <p>
          Reymond says in the beginning of this section that John gives us a
          "graphic representation of hell," but just after that, he quotes
          Revelation 14:9-11 and states that "<em>eternal conscious torment</em>
          is [here] said to be the punishment of those who have the mark of the
          beast." These two statements contradict. John is not giving
          straightforward, didactic teaching about hell. He's recording a
          pictorial representation of the final judgment that he sees in a
          vision, not a vision of hell itself. The Old Testament background,
          parallel judgment passages, and John's own interpretation of the
          symbols are keys to understanding what that imagery represents.
          Reymond completely disregards the context and takes his own
          interpretation for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if we take the passage at face value without interpreting what
          each symbol represents, Reymond's interpretation of eternal conscious
          torment still does not follow. John only states that these people will
          be tormented in fire, won't have any rest for a time, and that the
          smoke rising from this judgment will last forever. Traditionalist
          scholar G. K. Beale agrees that an annihilationist reading is possible
          because "Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great judgment that will be
          remembered forever, not one that leads to eternal suffering" (<a
            href="https://archive.org/details/g.k.beale-the-book-of-revelation/page/762/mode/1up"
            target="_blank"
            >The Book of Revelation</a
          >, 762). Furthermore, there are conditionalists that do believe that
          eternal conscious torment is being depicted here that symbolizes
          annihilation. Either way, Reymond has decided that eternal conscious
          torment is the correct view ahead of time and skips the necessary
          exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demonstrates a common interpretive problem when it comes to this
          issue. Revelation may be the hardest book to interpret in the New
          Testament. It is full of symbolism and Old Testament allusions which
          are not readily understood by people in a context removed from the
          original audience. Thus, taking a surface level reading of Revelation
          14:9-11 or 20:10, concluding that it teaches eternal conscious
          torment, and then reading that view back into every other passage
          about hell is completely backwards and irresponsible hermeneutically.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that short argument from Revelation, Reymond finishes his very
          first paragraph by concluding that "it is clear that the divine
          judgment awaiting evil-doers is certain, just, and eternal." Every
          conditionalist would agree wholeheartedly with this conclusion, except
          that Reymond clearly means eternal torment is certain. Not only is
          this misrepresenting conditionalism as if it denies eternal punishment
          before he has even explained the position, but it's also presenting
          that poor exegesis of Revelation as if it's decisive. Reymond has
          already precluded the possibility of conditionalism with absolutely no
          biblical support offered. The eisegesis that follows was inevitable
          from his starting position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reymond addresses very few Old Testament passages because of his
          presupposition of eternal conscious torment. The Old Testament has
          much to say about the final death and destruction of the wicked, and
          God putting a final end to evil. However, the few texts cited still
          provide a vivid picture of annihilation: the fiery destruction of
          Sodom and Gomorrah, the destruction of Sihon killing every man, woman,
          and child, the principle of herem ("devotion") to the Lord for
          complete destruction, the fact that every evil deed will be judged,
          and the prophecy that the redeemed will go out in the new heavens and
          new earth to look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against God
          which are being eaten by worms and burned up.
        </p>
        <p>
          That last image comes from Isaiah 66:22-24. The only comment on this
          passage is a quote from a commentary. It affirms that this passage is
          indeed about the final state but explains away the obvious
          conditionalist implications by calling it a "monstrous and
          inconceivable" picture. Actually, it's very clear. The picture is of
          dead bodies that were slain, burned up, consumed, and looked on with
          contempt. It then cites Mark 9:48 as support that this is a picture of
          eternal torment, but that argument is completely circular. Jesus
          quotes from this passage in Mark 9:48, not to reinterpret it to mean
          the exact opposite of what it means in context, but because this
          passage is an accurate description of Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Testament section is hurt by the bad exegesis of the Old
          Testament. Jesus uses the phrase "unquenchable fire" because the fire
          can't be put out so that it completely consumes. Reymond acknowledges
          that the garbage dump theory of Gehenna comes "from late Jewish
          tradition (David Qimchi, c. A.D. 1200)" and has no support, but he
          nevertheless wrongly treats that as the primary background over and
          against the Old Testament. Even if we accepted the garbage dump
          theory, the garbage would be burned up anyway. It doesn't actually
          help his case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weeping primarily indicates sadness. Gnashing teeth primarily
          indicates anger. Weeping and gnashing are not said to last eternally
          and are accurate descriptions of people on death row or being burned
          alive. He says that a "more bearable" (Mat 10:15) judgment day on an
          annihilationist view is difficult to comprehend because everyone ends
          up dead. Being instantly incinerated versus being burned alive for
          hours clearly represent two different degrees of capital punishment.
          On the contrary, it is extremely hard to comprehend how the
          traditional view accounts for different degrees of punishment when one
          sin merits the same punishment as a billion sins, eternal suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the intermediate state consists of torment, it does not follow
          that the eternal state consists of eternal torment. Just because the
          demons expect torment in the future (Mat 8:29), doesn't mean that they
          expect eternal torment (and so what if they did?). Tartarus in 2 Peter
          2:4 does not refer to hell. It is the holding place for angels until
          the judgment. That is just another factual error from Reymond.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for some reason, even though Reymond and Vos think the language of
          2 Thessalonians 1:9 is of annihilation, Vos thinks "that
          'annihilation' is an extremely abstract idea, too philosophical, in
          fact." It's not that complicated. It just means their final death. He
          also argues that Paul couldn't have been thinking of annihilation
          because Jesus taught eternal torment in the gospels. This shows the
          potential danger of arguing based on the analogy of scripture when you
          fail to interpret other passages properly. It's better to carefully
          exegete the text before attempting to apply systematic theology to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This entire chapter illustrates how a bad starting point,
          misinterpreting a passage in Revelation, led to systematic
          misinterpretation of other passages about the final fate of the
          wicked. It also illustrates that we can't be dogmatic about tradition.
          We must test all things by the Word of God. Reymond concludes the New
          Testament section without an in depth treatment of Revelation, but he
          assures us of his interpretation about the fires of Revelation by
          stating that "we should understand the realities these biblical
          passages seek to represent to be
          <em>more</em>—not less—horrible than their word depictions." However,
          having a more intolerable, dreadful, and harsh view of hell does not
          make it correct or more convincing.

          Annihilationism, pgs. 199-220:
        </p>

        <p>
          Morey's arguments are much better suited to argue against Froom and
          Seventh-Day Adventists. Unfortunately, he doesn't address the kind of
          exegetical and theological points evangelical conditionalists use to
          support conditional immortality.
        </p>

        <p><b>A Brief History</b></p>
        <p>
          Morey begins by attempting to give a brief history of conditional
          immortality. He claims that annihilationism "was first advanced by
          Arnobius" in the fourth century whom he calls a "Christian" in quotes.
          The
          <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01746c.htm" target="_blank"
            >Catholic Encyclopedia</a
          >
          notes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Arnobius is more earnest in his defense of Christianity than
            correct in his tenets," but "Arnobius is a vigorous apologist for
            the Christian Faith, defends and expounds its noble monotheism (<em
              >deus princeps, deus summus</em
            >), the Divinity of Christ and of the Christian religion, proved by
            its rapid diffusion, its incredible influence over uncivilized
            peoples, and its agreement with the views of the best philosophers."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It would be convenient for Morey if Arnobius really were the first
          proponent of conditionalism several hundred years after the New
          Testament but that simply isn't true. Arnobius was following a
          tradition of conditionalists. It appears that all of the Apostolic
          Fathers and many early Christians were conditionalists, but one
          example suffices to refute the claim that Arnobius is the first. That
          Irenaeus (c. A.D. 120-200) is a conditionalist is very clear in
          multiple places and is widely recognized by traditionalist scholars.
          Irenaeus in

            continuance for ever and ever on those who are saved... If you have
            not been faithful in that which is little, who will give you that
            which is great? indicating that those who, in this brief temporal
            life, have shown themselves ungrateful to Him who bestowed it, shall
            justly not receive from Him length of days for ever and ever."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Morey's historical argument thus falls flat. It was not a later,
          biblically illiterate Christian who first taught conditionalism as
          Morey portrays it, but a stream of Christians from the earliest times
          after the New Testament.

          (A.D. 553) condemned conditionalism as heresy. He provides no quote
          but is most likely referring to anathematism IX which says, "If anyone
          says or thinks that the punishment of demons and of impious men is
          only temporary, and will one day have an end, and that a restoration
          will take place of demons and of impious men, let him be anathema."
          However, this is a condemnation against Origen's universalism, and
          says nothing contrary to conditionalism. On the annihilation view, the
          punishment is eternal and no restoration will ever take place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree with Morey that the traditional view of hell is widespread
          after Augustine, but as traditionalist scholar Graham Keith notes, "a
          century or so after Constantine [the 5th century] we have a surprising
          amount of evidence indicating widespread denial of eternal [conscious]
          punishment within the church" (<a
            href="https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1999-3_217.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >Patristic Views on Hell―Part 1</a
          >). Even at so late a date, ECT was still widely denied in the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also agree with Morey that a theologian believing in soul sleep does
          not imply that they believe in annihilationism. He claims that many
          annihilationists argue that soul sleep implies annihilationism citing
          Froom as an example, but I've never heard that claim before.
          Annihilationism is about the final state and doesn't commit one to
          soul sleep which is about the intermediate state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although conditionalism is held by several cult groups today,
          Seventh-Day Adventists are an example of a Christian denomination that
          holds to conditionalism. Morey claims that the publishing of
          <em>The Fire That Consumes</em> by Edward Fudge was done with the hope
          to "introduce Adventist theology into evangelical circles" almost
          conspiratorially. But the question of conditional immortality is quite
          apart from other Seventh-Day Adventist doctrines. Even if that was the
          intention, conditionalism is held by many evangelicals across
          different denominations.
        </p>
        <p>
          He ends the first section by claiming that annihilationism is on the
          rise because of liberalism and "is regrettably the result of a weak
          view of Scripture which has been developing in certain evangelical
          circles over the last 25 years." But that is incredibly uncharitable
          to those who are committed to biblical inerrancy and believe the Bible
          teaches conditional immortality. It also poisons the well by painting
          conditionalism as the liberal view before addressing even a single
          biblical text. A doctrine being taught widely in the church makes it
          traditional, not biblical! It has to come from the Bible to properly
          be described as biblical.
        </p>

        <p><b>A Theological Analysis</b></p>
        <p>
          For some strange reason, Morey equates conditional immortality with
          materialism. He claims that "both deny that man has an immaterial soul
          and that man’s soul or spirit survives the death of the body," but
          this is certainly false. As far as the first claim, some
          conditionalists are anthropological physicalists while others are
          dualists. Christian physicalism is not materialism because it affirms
          the existence of God and other spiritual realities. It just denies
          that man's soul is an immaterial substance. For the second claim,
          while evangelical conditionalism teaches that God will "destroy both
          soul and body in Gehenna" (Mat 10:28), it affirms that everyone's soul
          survives death until the general resurrection and final judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey continues to present annihilationism as a cultic view stating
          that "we must point out that it is generally in connection with cultic
          or neo-cultic organizations that this belief is found." If
          conditionalism is such a plainly unbiblical belief, we wouldn't need
          all the inaccurate historical and theological priming against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contra Froom's introduction, conditionalism is attested early, is not
          a form of materialism, was not condemed as heretical by the Second
          Council of Constantinople, is not an inherently cultic or liberal
          belief, has no inherent connection to other Seventh-Day Adventist
          beliefs, and has strong biblical arguments for it that need to be
          addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey raises and responds to twelve conditionalist arguments in the
          next section which primarily come from Froom's
          <em>The Conditionalist Faith of Our Fathers</em> (1965). I have not
          read that work, but I am not impressed by it based on Morey's
          relaying. Edward Fudge's <em>The Fire that Consumes</em> (1982) is
          barely addressed, but I think it is a much stronger presentation of
          conditionalism.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 1</b></p>
        <p>
          Morey responds to the claim that conditionalist arguments have been
          ignored and adds the gripe that the label "traditionalism" implies
          that ECT is only held because of tradition and not the Bible. While
          not an argument for conditionalism, I definitely agree that
          conditionalist arguments have not been given substantial responses and
          that the traditional view is predominantly held because of tradition.
          Morey mentions "Bartlett, Boettner, Grant, A. Hodge, Hovey, Landis,
          Stuart, Martin, etc." as writers who have responded to conditionalism.
          I have not read all of them, but older writers such as Herman Bavinck
          are primarily responding to liberal and emotional arguments. Many
          modern traditionalists such as Morey or Robert L. Reymond continue to
          argue against many of the same bad arguments instead of addressing
          robust evangelical proponents of conditionalism such as Edward Fudge.
          Mischaracterizations and sloppiness abound in traditionalist works.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while responses do exist, there are few serious responses. There
          are even prominent traditionalists who agree with that assessment.
          James White for example agrees that most proponents of ECT are
          following it because of tradition and not because of any firm biblical
          understanding, though he does believe the Bible teaches it (<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Kclj_vN48"

            >Is the Punishment of Hell Temporary or Eternal?</a
          >).
        </p>

        <p><b>Arguments 2, 3, and 12</b></p>
        <p>
          These are against soul sleep. I don't believe in soul sleep, so I
          agree with Morey here, but it's irrelevant to the issue at hand. Morey
          does have a common modern misunderstanding about the final state
          though. Unbelievers do not go straight to hell when they die. They go
          to hades (the grave). This is known as the intermediate state. It is
          only after the general resurrection of all that they face the final
          judgment and are sent to Gehenna. This again has support from
          traditionalists. James White says, "It seems rather obvious to me that
          hell is the final state. You go to Hades, and then death and Hades are
          cast into the Lake of Fire, the Book of Revelation, at the end" (<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVqPf5pXkJM"
            target="_blank"
            >Francis' Empty Hell, Brandan's Empty Bible</a
          >, 6:48).
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey assumes (as does Froom it seems) that the intermediate state
          must be exactly like the eternal state, but that is a faulty
          assumption. The intermediate state is like a holding cell until the
          resurrection, judgment, and final damnation to Gehenna. There is no
          reason to conflate the two when the Bible does not. The intermediate
          state could consist of the worst torment imaginable, but that would
          not change the fact that the wicked will face the second death on
          judgment day.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 4</b></p>
        <p>
          The conditionalist argument given is that Sheol and Hades both mean
          grave, so there is no intermediate state but instead immediate death.
          This is a really bad argument. Morey rightly rejects it, but for the
          wrong reason. Hades really is the grave contrary to what Morey says,
          but at the end of the age, Hades will give up the dead so that they
          can be judged: "Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.
          They were judged, each one according to his works" (Rev 20:13).
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 5</b></p>
        <p>
          The most common terms for the fate of the wicked are "destroyed,"
          "consumed", "perish," etc., which must "mean that they pass into
          nonexistence." Annihilation does not mean nonexistent, but killed,
          destroyed, unalived. The given answer to this argument is that
          <em>apollumi</em>
          doesn't actually mean destroyed, but "ruin, loss... of well-being."
          There is a good reason Bible translations don't translate it that way.
          When people are "apollumi-ed," they are killed, destroyed, and lose
          their life. When objects are "apollumi-ed," they are ruined or lost.

          outside the New Testament.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 6</b></p>
        <p>
          Eternal life means living forever. Only the righteous get eternal
          life. Therefore, only the righteous will live forever. This is a super
          simple and effective argument. His response is that eternal life
          actually means "a quality of divine life." It's obvious that he isn't
          taking the language in a natural way. Of course, eternal life has a
          positive quality or connotation to it, but the phrase eternal life
          does mean living forever. Just as the Israelites looked to the raised
          serpent to save their lives temporarily (Jn 3:14-15), we look to Jesus
          to save our lives eternally (Jn 3:16). This isn't complicated or
          cryptic language.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 7</b></p>
        <p>
          1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God has immortality, so man is not
          immortal. I agree with Morey's response that this means that only God
          has absolute immortality. However, I disagree that the unrighteous
          will be granted immortality. Post-fall humans are mortal, and eternal
          life and immortality are a gift for the righteous at the resurrection
          (1 Cor 15). The burden of proof is on Morey to show that the
          unrighteous will be granted eternal life and immortality too.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 8</b></p>
        <p>
          He presents the argument that Gehenna is a garbage dump whose fire and
          worms will go out after the trash is consumed. However, the first
          claim that Gehenna was a garbage dump comes from Rabbi David Kimhi
          around A.D. 1200. This mistake doesn't help his case though. The
          context for Gehenna in Jeremiah 7 indicates that the fire and worms
          will burn up and consume
          <em>dead bodies</em>. Gehenna is prophesied to be called the Valley of
          Slaughter because God is going to slay His enemies there. But even if
          a dump were the background, of course the garbage would be burned up
          and the garbage would still represent corpses which couldn't feel
          torment regardless.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 9</b></p>
        <p>
          I don't argue that olam, aion, and aionios mean something other than
          eternal, but eternal undeniably can refer to something either eternal
          in process or eternal in result when referring to certain nouns.
          Examples: Eternal salvation means something is eternally saved. If
          something is eternally saved, it is either being saved forever or is
          forever saved. Eternal destruction means something is eternally
          destroyed. If something is eternally destroyed, it is either being
          destroyed forever or is forever destroyed. Eternal judgment means
          something is eternally judged. If something is eternally judged, it is
          either being judged forever or forever judged. If something is
          eternally punished, it is either being punished forever or forever
          punished. This is not controversial and can be found in standard Greek
          lexicons and confirmed by linguistics.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 10</b></p>
        <p>
          It is very obvious from the biblical account that the soul is not
          preexistent. It is clear but less obvious that the soul is not
          necessarily immortal. The reason it is valid to claim that the
          traditional view is influenced by Plato's philosophy is that the very
          first proponents of ECT, Tertullian and Athenagoras of Athens, both
          cite Plato extensively in the context of their belief in the intrinsic
          immortality of the soul, an idea central to Plato's philosophy and
          absent from the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tertullian,
          <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm" target="_blank"
            >A Treatise on the Soul</a
          >: "[Socrates], in the face of death itself, asserts the immortality
          of the soul by a strong assumption" (1), an account which comes from
          Plato. Side note, "the operation of death is plain and obvious: it is
          the separation of body and soul" (51). Many conditionalists agree with
          this statement; however, there is a difference between the operation
          or technical details of death, separation of body and soul, and the
          definition of death, the loss of bodily life, which is often missed by
          modern traditionalists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Athenagoras of Athens,
          <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0205.htm" target="_blank"
            >A Plea for the Christians</a
          >: He expounds much on the philosophers including "Plato and Aristotle
          — not that I am about to go through all that the philosophers have
          said about God..." (6). He holds that "God has not made us as sheep or
          beasts of burden, a mere by-work, and that we should perish [apollumi]
          and be annihilated [aphanizo]" (31), explicitly contradicting John
          3:16, Acts 13:40-41, 2 Peter 2:12-13 and many other texts. About the
          resurrection he writes, "for nothing hinders, according to Pythagoras
          and Plato, that when the dissolution of bodies takes place, they
          should, from the very same elements of which they were constructed at
          first, be constructed again" (36). Influence from Plato is very clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morey admits that "the orthodox have always viewed life in this world
          or in the next as a gift of God," which logically entails that the
          traditional view holds that God grants the gift of immortality to
          sinners at the final judgment. A radical claim that is not supported
          in this section.
        </p>

        <p><b>Argument 11</b></p>
        <p>
          The conditionalist argument given is that all Jewish and early
          patristic writings support conditionalism. I agree that this claim is
          overstated. While the vast majority of early Jewish writings support
          conditionalism, ECT is occasionally found in some later Jewish
          writings. And while all the Apostolic Fathers appear to support
          conditionalism, ECT would enter the church a little over a century
          later from theologians in the late second century like Athenagoras of
          Athens (A.D. 133-190) and Tertullian (A.D. 160-240).
        </p>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
        <p>
          He believes to "have covered all the arguments for conditionalism and
          annihilationism... to be found in the literature on this subject." One
          of the most obvious arguments is that Christ died for sins. He was our
          substitute on the cross bearing the punishment we deserve. The
          punishment Christ suffered was a brutal, painful death. Therefore, the
          punishment for those not saved by Christ is a brutal, painful death:
          "For the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23). It is clear from this
          simple argument that Morey has not comprehensively responded to
          conditionalist arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though there were problems with Morey's responses, a big issue was
          that the arguments for conditionalism were just bad. They barely
          addressed Scripture at all. Responding to Edward Fudge would have been
          much more fruitful and exegetically focused. Also understanding that
          annihilationism is <em>only</em> about the final fate of the wicked
          would help further the discussion. Conditionalists hold different
          views on the anthropology of man, the intermediate state and other
          issues, but these are distinct from the doctrine of hell.
