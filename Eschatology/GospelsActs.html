          literal killing of a person... Some claims in biblical interpretation
          are matters of opinion and open to question, but this is not one of
          them... However theologically inconvenient it may be for defenders of
          the traditional doctrine of the eternal torments of hell, this is an

          Notice that it is a day of judgment that is said to be worse. It does
          not say that they will experience an everlasting time of greater
          misery. Whatever way degrees of punishment are worked out for each
          person, God's justice demands that the ultimate end of the unsaved is
          death. Other than the duration, type, and amount suffering that takes
          place, part of the justice may be the way they are remembered. The
          wicked in general will be remembered with "everlasting contempt" (Dan
          12:2) and "disgust" (Isa 66:24), but mass murders will be remembered
          with greater disdain than liars.

          crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the
          eternal fire."
        </p>
        <p>
          The very next verse says, "If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it
          out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with
          one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of
          fire" (Mat 18:9). The parallel of "eternal fire" with "Gehenna of
          fire" indicates that they are referring to the same fate. The Gehenna
          of fire is where God's enemies go to die. Gehenna is The Valley of
          Slaughter. It's a picture of God's enemies being slain, and the dead
          bodies are utterly consumed by scavengers and fire. Jeremiah 19:6-11
          says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place
            will no more be called ‘Topheth’, nor ‘The Valley of the son of
            Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’... I will cause them to fall
            by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek
            their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds
            of the sky and for the animals of the earth... Even so I will break
            this people and this city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that
            can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth until there is
            no place to bury.”

          Jude tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah "are shown as an example,
          suffering the punishment of eternal fire" (Jude 1:7). The complete
          destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah functions typologically to show the
          outcome of the unrighteous. The eternal fire represents complete
          destruction:

            the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground"
            (Gen 19:24-25).
          </p>
          <p>
            "and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned
            them to destruction, having made them an example to those who would
            live in an ungodly way" (2 Pet 2:6).
          </p>
          <p>
            "You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to stubble. Your
            breath is a fire that will devour you. The peoples will be like the
            burning of lime, like thorns that are cut down and burned in the
            fire... The sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the
            godless ones. Who among us can live with the devouring fire? Who

          Eternal fire reflects God's holiness and indicates total devestation

          destruction' because they were destroyed and are to never be
          rebuilt... he grants all the points sufficient for the annihilationist
          here. Sodom and Gomorrah themselves suffered the vengeance of 'eternal
          fire' in the eternal destruction of those cities, i.e by being
          destroyed and never coming back, not by their inhabitants being in a
          state of burning for eternity." "The one time where it is clear what
          eternal fire actually does, it refers to a fire that destroys

          meaning penal infliction cf. 1 Jn 4:18) can be translated as
          punishment or penalty, and it does not denote a specific type of
          punishment. The duration of the punishment is everlasting and the
          duration of the life is everlasting. There is a parallel in that they
          both last forever, but there is a contrast in that one is life and the
          other excludes life.

          From the very beginning of the Bible, the punishment for sins has
          always been death while the reward for obedience is eternal life. Even
          though all still face bodily death, Jesus emphasizes that the second
          death is complete and eternal. The wicked will not receive atonement
          for their sins based on the obedience of Christ, but will instead face
          the wrath of God who will destroy soul and body and cast into Gehenna.

          Matthew, Isaiah, and Daniel indicate that life everlasting is reserved
          for the righteous only. Daniel tells us that the unrighteous will feel
          shame when they rise, but he doesn't say they will feel shame forever.
          Daniel and Isaiah both indicate that the unrighteous will be held in
          contempt forever by the righteous, but this does not require the
          unrighteous to be alive. The only punishment with an eternal duration
          that is consistent with these facts is death. Isaiah says that in the
          new heavens and new earth, the unrighteous will be dead bodies that
          are eaten by worms and utterly consumed by fire. This confirms that
          death, the privation of life, is the punishment for the unrighteous.

            >City of God</a
          >, translated by Marcus Dods: "Cicero tells us that the laws recognize
          eight kinds of penalty,—damages, imprisonment, scourging, reparation,
          disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one of these which may
          be compressed into a brevity proportioned to the rapid commission of
          the offence, so that no longer time may be spent in its punishment
          than in its perpetration, unless, perhaps, reparation?... What shall
          we say of imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only for so long
          a time as he spent on the offence for which he is committed?... And as
          to damages, disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly inflicted so
          as to admit of no relaxation or pardon, do not these resemble eternal
          punishments in so far as this short life allows a resemblance? For
          they are not eternal only because the life in which they are endured
          is not eternal; and yet the crimes which are punished with these most
          protracted sufferings are perpetrated in a very brief space of
          time..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then as to the award of death for any great crime, do the laws reckon
          the punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death is
          inflicted, or in this, that the offender is eternally banished from
          the society of the living? And just as the punishment of the first
          death cuts men off from this present mortal city, so does the
          punishment of the second death cut men off from that future immortal
          city. For as the laws of this present city do not provide for the
          executed criminal’s return to it, so neither is he who is condemned to
          the second death recalled again to life everlasting."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But if temporal sin is visited with eternal punishment, how, then,
          they say, is that true which your Christ says, 'With the same measure
          that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again?' and they do
          not observe that 'the same measure' refers, not to an equal space of
          time, but to the retribution of evil or, in other words, to the law by
          which he who has done evil suffers evil. Besides, these words could be
          appropriately understood as referring to the matter of which our Lord
          was speaking when He used them, viz., judgments and condemnation.
          Thus, if he who unjustly judges and condemns is himself justly judged
          and condemned, he receives 'with the same measure' though not the same
          thing as he gave. For judgment he gave, and judgment he receives,
          though the judgment he gave was unjust, the judgment he receives
          just."

          this verse [Hebrews 6:2, '...eternal judgment'] teaches that God is

            >The Case for Conditional Immortality from Matthew</a
          >, 2021: "That Jesus is the source of 'eternal salvation' (Heb 5:9)
          does not mean he goes on saving forever, but that the salvation he
          offers is eternal... The same is true for 'eternal redemption,' Christ
          does not go on forever redeeming, but the result of his once for all
          act of redemption is eternal (Heb 9:12). When it comes to 'eternal
          punishment' (Matt 25:46) and 'eternal destruction' (2 Thess 1:9),
          where 'eternal' modifies an action, it seems plausible to suggest that
          the punishing and destruction do not go on forever, but that there is
          an act of punishment/destruction which leads to an eternal result."

          torture’ with ‘eternal reward’ or ‘eternal misery’ with ‘eternal
          happiness.’ He contrasts the eternal punishment of the wicked with
          eternal life. What is the opposite of life? It is not torture or

        <h2>Mark 9:47-48 // Matthew 5:22 // Isaiah 66:24</h2>
        <p>
          "...cast into the Gehenna of fire, 'where their worm doesn’t die, and
          the fire is not quenched.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          Gehenna, shorthand for "The valley of Hinnom," is a place filled with
          unburied corpses that are eaten by scavengers and burned by fire:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no
            more be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but
            ‘The valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there
            is no place to bury. The dead bodies of this people will be food for
            the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will
            frighten them away. Then I will cause to cease from the cities of
            Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the
            voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the
            bride; for the land will become a waste.” (Jer 7:32-42).
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24 where it clearly states that corpses are
          being consumed by fire and maggots, not living beings. The imagery of
          the unburied corpses, worm and fire in Isaiah is not about eternal
          conscious torment but emphasizes the shame and complete destruction of
          the wicked:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
            remain before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name
            shall remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and
            from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before
            me,” says Yahweh. “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of
            the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not
            die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to
            all mankind.” (Isa 66:22-24).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The original Hebrew phrase "does not die" doesn't mean "will never
          die" in other biblical contexts (e.g., Gen 42:20, Ex 30:20, Jer
          38:24). It often means "will not die at a particular time or in a
          particular context." In Isaiah 66:24, it means that the worms will not
          die before completely devouring the corpses. That is especially clear
          when it is connected with Gehenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, a fire that "is not quenched" does not imply a fire that
          burns forever. "Quench" means "extinguish." The fire in Isaiah cannot
          be extinguished until it fully consumes its fuel. This imagery
          emphasizes the complete and irreversible nature of the consumption.

          Mk. 9:48, they explain the context of Isa. 66:24: "By way of

          expansive vision of all flesh coming to worship Yahweh (66:23; cf.
          2:1-5) over against, not unlike Mal. 4:4-6, a final, chilling picture
          of the corpses of the rebels, 'whose worm will not die, and whose fire
          will not be quenched.'"

          >, 2018. Dear provides two arguments against the traditional
          interpretation: "1. The Old Testament background of the passage paints
          a very different picture from the idea of conscious, resurrected
          people alive in a place of fire and biting worms (or their symbolic
          equivalent) forever. 2. The terms used about worms not dying and fire
          not being quenched don’t even mean eternal duration in the first
          place. That part is read into the passage by people who already
          believe that hell is a place of eternal torment."
        </p>

        <h2>Luke 16:22-23</h2>
        <p>
          "The beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s
          bosom. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, he lifted up
          his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at
          his bosom."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is about Hades, the intermediate state. This passage doesn't tell
          us about Gehenna, the final state.

          the voices of the OT prophets, the parable reveals that the kingdom of

          cause rather than an algebra equation: Knowing God and Jesus causes
          eternal life. In other words, this is what causes eternal life: that

          >, 2020: "At face value, the phrase 'eternal life' would mean life
          that lasts for eternity... It makes perfect sense to interpret what
          Jesus says in John 17:3 as a figure of speech to mean that knowing God
          is what causes eternal life... so much of this seems to be little more
          than a false narrative, built upon tradition, that tells us that life
          and death language just obviously is metaphorical and it would be
          downright outrageous to suggest that a straightforward, face value
          reading of such language actually could tell us what hell entails."

        <h1>Acts</h1>
        <h2>Acts 24:15 // John 5:28-29 // Daniel 12:2</h2>
        <p>
          "there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and
          unjust."
        </p>
        <p>
          Believers and non-believers will be resurrected on the day of the
          Lord, but there will be a resurrection of the saved and a resurrection
          of the unsaved. This dual nature of the resurrection reflects the dual
          nature of the outcomes. Evil-doers will face "the resurrection of
          judgment" while the righteous will come out "to the resurrection of
          life" (Jn 5:29). The unrighteous will awake to "shame" while the
          righteous will rise to "everlasting life" (Dan 12:2). The consistent
          contrast of judgment with life reflects the fact that it will not
          include life. "Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to
          destroy" (Jam 4:12).

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "They are dead, they will not live; they are shades, they will not
            arise; to that end you have visited them with destruction and wiped
            out all remembrance of them... Your dead shall live; their bodies
            shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For
            your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the
            dead." (Isa 26:14, 19 ESV).
          </p>

        <h2>Acts 13:46</h2>
        <p>
          "Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, 'It was necessary that
          God’s word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it
          from yourselves, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life,
          behold, we turn to the Gentiles.'"
