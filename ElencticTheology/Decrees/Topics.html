        <h1>Fourth Topic: The Decrees of God</h1>

        <p>I. Are decrees in God, and how?</p>
        <p>II. Are the decrees of God eternal? We affirm against Socinus</p>
        <p>
          III. Are there conditional decrees? We deny against the Socinians,
          Remonstrants and Jesuits
        </p>
        <p>IV. Does the decree necessitate future things? We affirm</p>

        <h2>The End of Life</h2>
        <p>
          V. Is the fixed and immovable end of the life of each man with all its
          circumstances so determined by the decree of God, that he cannot die
          in another moment of time or by another kind of death than that in
          which he does die? We affirm against the Socinians and Remonstrants
        </p>

        <h2>Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          VI. Ought predestination to be publicly taught and preached? We affirm
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. In what sense are the words “predestination,” prognōseōs, eklogēs
          and protheseōs used in this mystery?
        </p>

        <h2>The Predestination of Angels</h2>
        <p>
          VIII. Was there a predestination of angels, and was it of the same
          kind and order with the predestination of men? The former we affirm;
          the latter we deny
        </p>

        <h2>The Object of Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          IX. Whether the object of predestination was man creatable, or capable
          of falling; or whether as created and fallen. The former we deny; the
          latter we affirm
        </p>

        <h2>The Cause of Election</h2>
        <p>
          X. Is Christ the cause and foundation of election? We deny against the
          Arminians and Lutherans
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Is election made from the foresight of faith, or works; or from
          the grace of God alone? The former we deny; the latter we affirm
        </p>

        <h2>The Certainty of Election</h2>
        <p>
          XII. Is the election of certain men to salvation constant and
          immutable? We affirm against the Remonstrants
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Can the believer be certain of his own election with a certainty
          not only conjectural and moral, but infallible and of faith? We affirm
          against the papists and Remonstrants
        </p>

        <h2>Reprobation</h2>
        <p>
          XIV. Is the decree of reprobation absolute, depending upon the good
          pleasure (eudokia) of God alone; or is sin its proper cause? We
          distinguish
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Is infidelity, or unbelief of the gospel, presupposed as a cause
          of reprobation? We deny against the Remonstrants
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. Is the will of God to save persevering believers and condemn the
          unbelieving, the whole decree of reprobation? We deny against the
          Remonstrants
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Can there be attributed to God any conditional will, or
          universal purpose of pitying the whole human race fallen in sin, of
          destining Christ as Mediator to each and all, and of calling them all
          to a saving participation of his benefits? We deny
        </p>

        <h2>The Order of the Divine Decrees in Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          XVIII. Is any order to be admitted in the divine decrees, and what is
          it?
