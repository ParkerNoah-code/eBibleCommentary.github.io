        <h1>Second Topic: Scripture</h1>
        <h2>The Word of God</h2>
        <p>I. Was a verbal revelation necessary? We affirm</p>
        <h2>The Necessity of Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          II. Was it necessary for the word of God to be committed to writing?
          We affirm
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Were the sacred Scriptures written only occasionally and without
          the divine command? We deny against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Authority of the Holy Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
          IV. Are the holy Scriptures truly authentic and divine? We affirm V.
          Do real contradictions occur in Scripture? Or are there any
          inexplicable (alyta) passages which cannot be explained and made to
          harmonize? We deny
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. From what source does the divine authority of the Scriptures
          become known to us? Does it depend upon the testimony of the church
          either as to itself or as to us? We deny against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Canon</h2>
        <p>VII. Has any canonical book perished? We deny</p>
        <p>
          VIII. Are the books of the Old Testament still a part of the canon of
          faith and rule of practice in the church of the New Testament? We
          affirm against the Anabaptists
        </p>
        <h2>The Apocryphal Books</h2>
        <p>
          IX. Ought Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, the two first books
          of the Maccabees, Baruch, the additions to Esther and Daniel to be
          numbered among the canonical books? We deny against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Purity of the Sources</h2>
        <p>
          X. Have the original texts of the Old and New Testaments come down to
          us pure and uncorrupted? We affirm against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Authentic Version</h2>
        <p>
          XI. Are the Hebrew version of the Old Testament and the Greek of the
          New the only authentic versions? We affirm against the papists
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Is the present Hebrew text in things as well as words so
          authentic and inspired (theopneustos) in such a sense that all the
          extant versions are to be referred to it as a rule and, wherever they
          vary, to be corrected by it? Or may we desert the reading it supplies,
          if judged less appropriate, and correct it either by a comparison of
          ancient translators or by suitable (stochastikÄ“) judgment and
          conjecture and follow another more suitable reading? We affirm the
          former and deny the latter
        </p>
        <h2>Versions</h2>
        <p>
          XIII. Are versions necessary, and what ought to be their use and
          authority in the church?
        </p>
        <h2>The Septuagint</h2>
        <p>
          XIV. Is the Septuagint version of the Old Testament authentic? We deny
        </p>
        <h2>The Vulgate</h2>
        <p>XV. Is the Vulgate authentic? We deny against the papists</p>
        <p>The Perfection of the Scriptures</p>
        <p>
          XVI. Do the Scriptures so perfectly contain all things necessary to
          salvation that there is no need of unwritten (agraphois) traditions
          after it? We affirm against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Perspicuity of the Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
          XVII. Are the Scriptures so perspicuous in things necessary to
          salvation that they can be understood by believers without the
          external help of oral (agraphou) tradition or ecclesiastical
          authority? We affirm against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Reading of the Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
          XVIII. Can the Scriptures be profitably read by any believer, and
          ought he to read them without permission? We affirm against the
          papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Sense of the Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
          XIX. Whether the Scriptures have a fourfold sense: literal,
          allegorical, anagogical and tropological. We deny against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Supreme Judge of Controversies and interpreter of the Scriptures
        </h2>
        <p>
          XX. Whether the Scriptures (or God speaking in them) are the supreme
          and infallible judge of controversies and the interpreter of the
          Scriptures. Or whether the church or the Roman pontiff is. We affirm
          the former and deny the latter against the papists
        </p>
        <h2>The Authority of the Fathers</h2>
        <p>
          XXI. Are the writings of the fathers the rule of truth in doctrines of
          faith and in the interpretation of the Scriptures? We deny against the
          papists
