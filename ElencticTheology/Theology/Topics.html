        <h1>First Topic: Theology</h1>
        <p>
          I. Should the word “theology” be used in the Christian schools, and in
          how many ways can it be understood?
        </p>
        <p>II. Whether there is a theology and its divisions</p>
        <p>III. Whether natural theology may be granted</p>
        <p>
          IV. Is natural theology sufficient for salvation; or is there a common
          religion by which all promiscuously may be saved? We deny against the
          Socinians and Remonstrants
        </p>
        <h2>The Object of Theology</h2>
        <p>V. Are God and divine things the objects of theology? We affirm</p>
        <h2>The Genus of Theology</h2>
        <p>VI. What is the genus of theology?</p>
        <p>VII. Is theology theoretical or practical?</p>
        <p>
          VIII. Is human reason the principle and rule by which the doctrines of
          the Christian religion and theology (which are the objects of faith)
          ought to be measured? We deny against the Socinians
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Does any judgment belong to reason in matters of faith? Or is
          there no use at all for it?
        </p>
        <p>
          X. May the judgment of contradiction be allowed to human reason in
          matters of faith? We affirm
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Is there any use of the testimony of the senses in mysteries of
          faith; or ought it to be entirely rejected? We affirm the former and
          deny the latter
        </p>
        <h2>The Use of Consequences</h2>
        <p>
          XII. Are the doctrines of faith and practice to be proved only by the
          express word of God? May they not also be legitimately proved by
          consequences drawn from Scripture? We affirm the latter
        </p>
        <p>XIII. Is there any use of philosophy in theology? We affirm</p>
        <h2>Fundamental Articles and Errors</h2>
        <p>
          XIV. Are some theological topics fundamental, others not; and how can
          they be mutually distinguished?
