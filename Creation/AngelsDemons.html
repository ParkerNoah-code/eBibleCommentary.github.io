          <a href="AngelsDemons/Angels.html">Angels</a>: As ministers of divine
          providence there is a class of finite beings, greater in intelligence
          and power than man in his present state, some of whom positively serve
          God's purpose by holiness and voluntary execution of his will, some
          negatively, by giving examples to the universe of defeated and
          punished rebellion, and by illustrating God's distinguishing grace in
          man's salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="AngelsDemons/Superstition.html">Superstition</a>: The
          scholastic subtleties which encumbered this doctrine in the Middle
          Ages, and the exaggerated representations of the power of evil spirits
          which then prevailed, have led, by a natural reaction, to an undue
          depreciation of it in more recent times.
