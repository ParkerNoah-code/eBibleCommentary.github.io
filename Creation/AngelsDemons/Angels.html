        <h2>Angels</h2>
        <p>
          As ministers of divine providence there is a class of finite beings,
          greater in intelligence and power than man in his present state, some
          of whom positively serve God's purpose by holiness and voluntary
          execution of his will, some negatively, by giving examples to the
          universe of defeated and punished rebellion, and by illustrating God's
          distinguishing grace in man's salvation.
        </p>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          1. <em>Created</em>: Ps. 148:2-5—“Praise ye him, all his angels....
          For he commanded, and they were created”; Col. 1:16—“for in him were
          all things created ... whether thrones or dominions or principalities
          or powers”; cf. 1 Pet. 3:32—“angels and authorities and powers.” God
          alone is uncreated and eternal. This is implied in 1 Tim. 6:16—“who
          only hath immortality.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. <em>Incorporeal</em>: In Heb. 1:14, where a single word is used to
          designate angels, they are described as “spirits”—“are they not all
          ministering spirits?” Men, with their twofold nature, material as well
          as immaterial, could not well be designated as “spirits.” That their
          being characteristically “spirits” forbids us to regard angels as
          having a bodily organism, seems implied in Eph. 6:12—“for our
          wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against ... the
          spiritual hosts [or “things”] of wickedness in the heavenly places”;
          cf. Eph. 1:3; 2:6. In Gen. 6:2, “sons of God” =, not angels, but
          descendants of Seth and worshipers of the true God (see Murphy, Com.,
          in loco). In Ps. 78:25 (A. V.), “angels' food” = manna coming from
          heaven where angels dwell; better, however, read with Rev. Vers.:
          “bread of the mighty”—probably meaning angels, though the word
          “mighty” is nowhere else applied to them; possibly = “bread of princes
          or nobles,” i. e., the finest, most delicate bread. Mat 22:30—“neither
          marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven”—and
          Luke 20:36—“neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
          angels”—imply only that angels are without distinctions of sex. Saints
          are to be like angels, not as being incorporeal, but as not having the
          same sexual relations which they have here.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no “souls of angels,” as there are “souls of men” (Rev.
          18:13), and we may infer that angels have no bodies for souls to
          inhabit; see under Essential Elements of Human Nature. Nevius,
          Demon-Possession, 258, attributes to evil spirits an instinct or
          longing for a body to possess, even though it be the body of an
          inferior animal: “So in Scripture we have spirits represented as
          wandering about to seek rest in bodies, and asking permission to enter
          into swine” (Mat. 12:43; 8:31). Angels therefore, since they have no
          bodies, know nothing of growth, age, or death. Martensen, Christian
          Dogmatics, 133—“It is precisely because the angels are only spirits,
          but not souls, that they cannot possess the same rich existence as
          man, whose soul is the point of union in which spirit and nature
          meet.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. <em>Personal</em>: That is, intelligent and voluntary—agents. 2
          Sam. 14:20—“wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God”; Luke
          4:34—“I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God”; 2 Tim.
          2:26—“snare of the devil ... taken captive by him unto his will”; Rev.
          22:9—“See thou do it not” = exercise of will; Rev. 12:12—“The devil is
          gone down unto you, having great wrath” = set purpose of evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. <em>Intelligent and Powerful</em>: They are possessed of superhuman
          intelligence and power, yet an intelligence and power that has its
          fixed limits. Mat. 24:36—“of that day and hour knoweth no one, not
          even the angels of heaven” = their knowledge, though superhuman, is
          yet finite. 1 Pet. 1:12—“which things angels desire to look into”; Ps.
          103:20—“angels ... mighty in strength”; 2 Thess. 1:7—“the angels of
          his power”; 2 Pet. 2:11—“angels, though greater [than men] in might
          and power”; Rev. 20:2, 10—“laid hold on the dragon ... and bound him
          ... cast into the lake of fire.” Compare Ps. 72:18—“God ... Who only
          doeth wondrous things” = only God can perform miracles. Angels are
          imperfect compared with God (Job 4:18; 15:15; 25:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          Power, rather than beauty or intelligence, is their striking
          characteristic. They are “principalities and powers” (Col. 1:16). They
          terrify those who behold them (Mat. 28:4). The rolling away of the
          stone from the sepulchre took strength. A wheel of granite, eight feet
          in diameter and one foot thick, rolling in a groove, would weigh more
          than four tons. Mason, Faith of the Gospel, 86—“The spiritual might
          and burning indignation in the face of Stephen reminded the guilty
          Sanhedrin of an angelic vision.” Even in their tenderest ministrations
          they strengthen (Luke 22:43; cf. Dan. 10:19). In 1 Tim. 6:15—“King of
          kings and Lord of lords”—the words “kings” and “lords” (βασιλευόντων
          and κυριευόντων) may refer to angels. In the case of evil spirits
          especially, power seems the chief thing in mind, e. g., “the prince of
          this world,” “the strong man armed,” “the power of darkness,” “rulers
          of the darkness of this world,” “the great dragon,” “all the power of
          the enemy,” “all these things will I give thee,” “deliver us from the
          evil one.”
        </p>
        <p>
          5. <em>Distinct</em>: Angels are distinct from man. 1 Cor. 6:3—“we
          shall judge angels”; Heb. 1:14—“Are they not all ministering spirits,
          sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit
          salvation?” They are not glorified human spirits; see Heb. 2:16—“for
          verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed
          of Abraham”; also 12:22, 23, where “the innumerable hosts of angels”
          are distinguished from “the church of the firstborn” and “the spirits
          of just men made perfect.” In Rev. 22:9—“I am a fellow-servant with
          thee”—“fellow-servant” intimates likeness to men, not in nature, but
          in service and subordination to God, the proper object of worship.
          Sunday School Times, Mch. 15, 1902:146—“Angels are spoken of as
          greater in power and might than man, but that could be said of many a
          lower animal, or even of whirlwind and fire. Angels are never spoken
          of as a superior order of spiritual beings. We are to ‘judge angels’
          (1 Cor. 6:3), and inferiors are not to judge superiors.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Angels are an order of intelligences older than man. The Fathers made
          the creation of angels simultaneous with the original calling into
          being of the elements, perhaps basing their opinion on the apocryphal
          Ecclesiasticus, 18:1—“he that liveth eternally created all things
          together.” In Job 38:7, the Hebrews parallelism makes “morning
          stars”—“sons of God,” so that angels are spoken of as present at
          certain stages of God's creative work. The mention of “the serpent” in
          Gen. 3:1 implies the fall of Satan before the fall of man. We may
          infer that the creation of angels took place before the creation of
          man—the lower before the higher. In Gen. 2:1, “all the host of them,”
          which God had created, may be intended to include angels. Man was the
          crowning work of creation, created after angels were created. Mason,
          Faith of the Gospel, 81—“Angels were perhaps created before the
          material heavens and earth—a spiritual substratum in which the
          material things were planted, a preparatory creation to receive what
          was to follow. In the vision of Jacob they ascend first and descend
          after; their natural place is in the world below.”
        </p>
        <p>
          6. <em>Not Abstractions</em>: The constant representation of angels as
          personal beings in Scripture cannot be explained as a personification
          of abstract good and evil, in accommodation to Jewish superstitions,
          without wresting many narrative passages from their obvious sense;
          implying on the part of Christ either dissimulation or ignorance as to
          an important point of doctrine; and surrendering belief in the
          inspiration of the Old Testament from which these Jewish views of
          angelic beings were derived.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus accommodated himself to the popular belief in respect at least
          to “Abraham's bosom”(Luke 16:22), and he confessed ignorance with
          regard to the time of the end (Mark 13:32); see Rush Rhees, Life of
          Jesus of Nazareth, 245-248. But in the former case his hearers
          probably understood him to speak figuratively and rhetorically, while
          in the latter case there was no teaching of the false but only
          limitation of knowledge with regard to the true. Our Lord did not
          hesitate to contradict Pharisaic belief in the efficacy of ceremonies,
          and Sadducean denial of resurrection and future life. The doctrine of
          angels had even stronger hold upon the popular mind than had these
          errors of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That Jesus did not correct or
          deny the general belief, but rather himself expressed and confirmed
          it, implies that the belief was rational and Scriptural. For one of
          the best statements of the argument for the existence of evil spirits,
          see Broadus, Com. on Mat. 8:28.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eph. 3:10—“to the intent that now unto the principalities and the
          powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church
          the manifold wisdom of God”—excludes the hypothesis that angels are
          simply abstract conceptions of good or evil. We speak of “moon-struck”
          people (lunatics), only when we know that nobody supposes us to
          believe in the power of the moon to cause madness. But Christ's
          contemporaries did suppose him to believe in angelic spirits, good and
          evil. If this belief was an error, it was by no means a harmless one,
          and the benevolence as well as the veracity of Christ would have led
          him to correct it. So too, if Paul had known that there were no such
          beings as angels, he could not honestly have contented himself with
          forbidding the Colossians to worship them (Col 2:18) but would have
          denied their existence, as he denied the existence of heathen gods (1
          Cor. 8:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Theodore Parker said it was very evident that Jesus Christ believed in
          a personal devil. Harnack, Wesen des Christenthums, 35—“There can be
          no doubt that Jesus shared with his contemporaries the representation
          of two kingdoms, the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil.”
          Wendt, Teaching of Jesus, 1:164—Jesus “makes it appear as if Satan was
          the immediate tempter. I am far from thinking that he does so in a
          merely figurative way. Beyond all doubt Jesus accepted the
          contemporary ideas as to the real existence of Satan, and accordingly,
          in the particular cases of disease referred to, he supposes a real
          Satanic temptation.” Maurice, Theological Essays, 32, 34—“The
          acknowledgment of an evil spirit is characteristic of Christianity.”
          H. B. Smith, System, 261—“It would appear that the power of Satan in
          the world reached its culminating point at the time of Christ, and has
          been less ever since.”
        </p>
        <h2>Number and Organization</h2>
        <p>
          1. They are of <em>great multitude</em>: Deut. 33:2—“Jehovah ... came
          from the ten thousands of holy ones”; Ps. 68:17—“The chariots of God
          are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands”; Dan.
          7:10—“thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand
          times ten thousand stood before him”; Rev. 5:11—“I heard a voice of
          many angels ... and the number of them was ten thousand times ten
          thousand, and thousands of thousands.” Anselm thought that the number
          of lost angels was filled up by the number of elect men. Savage, Life
          after Death, 61—The Pharisees held very exaggerated notions of the
          number of angelic spirits. They “said that a man, if he threw a stone
          over his shoulder or cast away a broken piece of pottery, asked pardon
          of any spirit that he might possibly have hit in so doing.” So in W.
          H. H. Murray's time it was said to be dangerous in the Adirondack to
          fire a gun,—you might hit a man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They constitute a <em>company</em>, as distinguished from a race:
          Mat. 22:30—“they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as
          angels in heaven”; Luke 20:36—“neither can they die any more: for they
          are equal unto the angels; and are sons of God.” We are called “sons
          of men,” but angels are never called “sons of angels,” but only “sons
          of God.” They are not developed from one original stock, and no such
          common nature binds them together as binds together the race of man.
          They have no common character and history. Each was created
          separately, and each apostate angel fell by himself. Humanity fell all
          at once in its first father. Cut down a tree, and you cut down its
          branches. But angels were so many separate trees. Some lapsed into
          sin, but some remained holy. See Godet, Bib. Studies O. T., 1-29. This
          may be one reason why salvation was provided for fallen man, but not
          for fallen angels. Christ could join himself to humanity by taking the
          common nature of all. There was no common nature of angels which he
          could take. See Heb. 2:16—“not to angels doth he give help.” The
          angels are “sons of God,” as having no earthly parentage and no
          parentage at all except the divine. Eph. 3:14, 15—“the Father, of whom
          every fatherhood in heaven and on earth is named,”—not “every family,”
          as in R. V., for there are no families among the angels. The marginal
          rendering “fatherhood” is better than “family,”—all the πατριαί are
          named from the πατήρ. Dodge, Christian Theology, 172—“The bond between
          angels is simply a mental and moral one. They can gain nothing by
          inheritance, nothing through domestic and family life, nothing through
          a society held together by a bond of blood.... Belonging to two worlds
          and not simply to one, the human soul has in it the springs of a
          deeper and wider experience than angels can have.... God comes nearer
          to man than to his angels.” Newman Smyth, Through Science to Faith,
          191—“In the resurrection life of man, the species has died; man the
          individual lives on. Sex shall be no more needed for the sake of life;
          they shall no more marry, but men and women, the children of marriage,
          shall be as the angels. Through the death of the human species shall
          be gained, as the consummation of all, the immortality of the
          individuals.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. They are of various <em>ranks</em> and <em>endowments</em>: Col.
          1:16—“thrones or dominions or principalities or powers”; 1 Thess.
          4:16—“the voice of the archangel”; Jude 9—“Michael the archangel.”
          Michael (= who is like God?) is the only one expressly called an
          archangel in Scripture, although Gabriel (= God's hero) has been
          called an archangel by Milton. In Scripture, Michael seems the
          messenger of law and judgment; Gabriel, the messenger of mercy and
          promise. The fact that Scripture has but one archangel is proof that
          its doctrine of angels was not, as has sometimes been charged, derived
          from Babylonian and Persian sources; for there we find seven
          archangels instead of one. There, moreover, we find the evil spirit
          enthroned as a god, while in Scripture he is represented as a
          trembling slave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wendt, Teaching of Jesus, 1:51—“The devout and trustful consciousness
          of the immediate nearness of God, which is expressed in so many
          beautiful utterances of the Psalmist, appears to be supplanted in
          later Judaism by a belief in angels, which is closely analogous to the
          superstitious belief in the saints on the part of the Romish church.
          It is very significant that the Jews in the time of Jesus could no
          longer conceive of the promulgation of the law on Sinai, which was to
          them the foundation of their whole religion, as an immediate
          revelation of Jehovah to Moses, except as instituted through the
          mediation of angels (Acts 7:38, 53; Gal. 3:19; Heb. 2:2; Josephus,
          Ant. 15:5, 3).”
        </p>
        <p>
          4. They have an <em>organization</em>: 1 Sam. 1:11—“Jehovah of hosts”;
          1 K. 22:19—“Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
          standing by him on his right hand and on his left”; Mat. 26:53—“twelve
          legions of angels”—suggests the organization of the Roman army;
          25:41—“the devil and his angels”; Eph. 2:2—“the prince of the powers
          in the air”; Rev. 2:13—“Satan's throne” (not “seat”); 16:10—“throne of
          the beast”—“a hellish parody of the heavenly kingdom” (Trench). The
          phrase “host of heaven,” in Deut. 4:19; 17:3; Acts 7:42, probably =
          the stars; but in Gen. 32:2, “God's host” = angels, for when Jacob saw
          the angels he said “this is God's host.” In general the phrases “God
          of hosts”, “Lord of hosts” seem to mean “God of angels”, “Lord of
          angels”: compare 2 Chron. 18:18; Luke 2:13; Rev. 19:14—“the armies
          which are in heaven.” Yet in Neh. 9:6 and Ps. 33:6 the word “host”
          seems to include both angels and stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan is “the ape of God.” He has a throne. He is “the prince of the
          world” (John 14:30; 16:11), “the prince of the powers of the air”
          (Eph. 2:2). There is a cosmos and order of evil, as well as a cosmos
          and order of good, though Christ is stronger than the strong man armed
          (Luke 11:21) and rules even over Satan. On Satan in the Old Testament,
          see art. by T. W. Chambers, in Presb. and Ref. Rev., Jan. 1892:22-34.
          The first mention of Satan is in the account of the Fall in Gen.
          3:1-15; the second in Lev. 16:8, where one of the two goats on the day
          of atonement is said to be “for Azazel,” or Satan; the third where
          Satan moved David to number Israel (1 Chron. 21:1); the fourth in the
          book of Job 1:6-12; the fifth in Zech. 3:1-3, where Satan stands as
          the adversary of Joshua the high priest, but Jehovah addresses Satan
          and rebukes him. Cheyne, Com. on Isaiah, vol. 1, p. 11, thinks that
          the stars were first called the hosts of God, with the notion that
          they were animated creatures. In later times the belief in angels
          threw into the background the belief in the stars as animated beings;
          the angels however were connected very closely with the stars.
          Marlowe, in his Tamburlaine, says: “The moon, the planets, and the
          meteors light, These angels in their crystal armor fight A doubtful
          battle.”

          With regard to the “cherubim” of Genesis, Exodus, and Ezekiel,—with
          which the “seraphim” of Isaiah and the “living creatures” of the book
          of Revelation are to be identified,—the most probable interpretation
          is that which regards them, not as actual beings of higher rank than
          man, but as symbolic appearances, intended to represent redeemed
          humanity, endowed with all the creature perfections lost by the Fall,
          and made to be the dwelling-place of God.
        </p>

          Some have held that the cherubim are symbols of the divine attributes,
          or of God's government over nature; see Smith's Bib. Dict., art.:
          Cherub; Alford, Com. on Rev. 4:6-8, and Hulsean Lectures, 1841: vol.
          1, Lect. 2; Ebrard, Dogmatik, 1:278. But whatever of truth belongs to
          this view may be included in the doctrine stated above. The cherubim
          are indeed symbols of nature pervaded by the divine energy and
          subordinated to the divine purposes, but they are symbols of nature
          only because they are symbols of man in his twofold capacity of image
          of God and priest of nature. Man, as having a body, is a part of
          nature; as having a soul, he emerges from nature and gives to nature a
          voice. Through man, nature, otherwise blind and dead, is able to
          appreciate and to express the Creator's glory.
        </p>

          The doctrine of the cherubim embraces the following points: 1. The
          cherubim are not personal beings, but are artificial, temporary,
          symbolic figures. 2. While they are not themselves personal
          existences, they are symbols of personal existence—symbols not of
          divine or angelic perfections but of human nature (Ex. 1:5—“they had
          the likeness of a man”; Rev. 5:9—A. V.—“thou hast redeemed us to God
          by thy blood”—so read א, B, and Tregelles; the Eng. and Am. Rev.
          Vers., however, follow A and Tischendorf, and omit the word “us”). 3.
          They are emblems of human nature, not in its present stage of
          development, but possessed of all its original perfections; for this
          reason the most perfect animal forms—the kinglike courage of the lion,
          the patient service of the ox, the soaring insight of the eagle—are
          combined with that of man (Ez. 1 and 10; Rev. 4:6-8). 4. These
          cherubic forms represent, not merely material or earthly perfections,
          but human nature spiritualized and sanctified. They are “living
          creatures” and their life is a holy life of obedience to the divine
          will (Ez. 1:12—“whither the spirit was to go, they went”). 5. They
          symbolize a human nature exalted to be the dwelling-place of God.
          Hence the inner curtains of the tabernacle were inwoven with cherubic
          figures, and God's glory was manifested on the mercy-seat between the
          cherubim (Ex. 37:6-9). While the flaming sword at the gates of Eden
          was the symbol of justice, the cherubim were symbols of mercy—keeping
          the “way of the tree of life” for man, until by sacrifice and renewal
          Paradise should be regained (Gen. 3:24).
        </p>
        <p>
          In corroboration of this general view, note that angels and cherubim
          never go together; and that in the closing visions of the book of
          Revelation these symbolic forms are seen no longer. When redeemed
          humanity has entered heaven, the figures which typified that humanity,
          having served their purpose, finally disappear. For fuller
          elaboration, see A. H. Strong, The Nature and Purpose of the Cherubim,
          in Philosophy and Religion, 391-399; Fairbairn, Typology, 1:185-208;
          Elliott, Horæ Apocalypticæ, 1:87; Bib. Sac., 1876:32-51; Bib. Com.,
          1:49-52—“The winged lions, eagles, and bulls, that guard the entrances
          of the palace of Nineveh, are worshipers rather than divinities.”It
          has lately been shown that the winged bull of Assyria was called
          “Kerub” almost as far back as the time of Moses. The word appears in
          its Hebrew form 500 years before the Jews had any contact with the
          Persian dominion. The Jews did not derive it from any Aryan race. It
          belonged to their own language.

          The variable form of the cherubim seems to prove that they are
          symbolic appearances rather than real beings. A parallel may be found
          in classical literature. In Horace, Carmina, 3:11, 15, Cerberus has
          three heads; in 2:13, 34, he has a hundred. Bréal, Semantics suggests
          that the three heads may be dog-heads, while the hundred heads may be
          snake-heads. But Cerberus is also represented in Greece as having only
          one head. Cerberus must therefore be a symbol rather than an actually
          existing creature. H. W. Congdon of Wyoming, N. Y., held, however,
          that the cherubim are symbols of God's life in the universe as a
          whole. Ez. 28:14-19—“the anointed cherub that covereth”—the power of
          the King of Tyre was so all-pervading throughout his dominion, his
          sovereignty so absolute, and his decrees so instantly obeyed, that his
          rule resembled the divine government over the world. Mr. Congdon
          regarded the cherubim as a proof of monism. See Margoliouth, The
          Lord's Prayer, 159-180. On animal characteristics in man, see Hopkins,
          Scriptural Idea of Man, 105.
