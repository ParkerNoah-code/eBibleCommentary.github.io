        <h2>Superstition</h2>
        <p>
          For scholastic discussions, see Thomas Aquinas, Summa (ed. Migne),
          1:833-993. The scholastics debated the questions, how many angels
          could stand at once on the point of a needle (relation of angels to
          space); whether an angel could be in two places at the same time; how
          great was the interval between the creation of angels and their fall;
          whether the sin of the first angel caused the sin of the rest; whether
          as many retained their integrity as fell; whether our atmosphere is
          the place of punishment for fallen angels; whether guardian-angels
          have charge of children from baptism, from birth, or while the infant
          is yet in the womb of the mother; even the excrements of angels were
          subjects of discussion, for if there was “angels' food” (Ps. 78:25),
          and if angels ate (Gen. 18:8), it was argued that we must take the
          logical consequences.

          Dante makes the creation of angels simultaneous with that of the
          universe at large. “The fall of the rebel angels he considers to have
          taken place within twenty seconds of their creation, and to have
          originated in the pride which made Lucifer unwilling to await the time
          prefixed by his Maker for enlightening him with perfect knowledge”—see
          Rossetti, Shadow of Dante, 14, 15. Milton, unlike Dante, puts the
          creation of angels ages before the creation of man. He tells us that
          Satan's first name in heaven is now lost. The sublime associations
          with which Milton surrounds the adversary diminish our abhorrence of
          the evil one. Satan has been called the hero of the Paradise Lost.
          Dante's representation is much more true to Scripture. But we must not
          go to the extreme of giving ludicrous designations to the devil. This
          indicates and causes scepticism as to his existence.

          In mediæval times men's minds were weighed down by the terror of the
          spirit of evil. It was thought possible to sell one's soul to Satan,
          and such compacts were written with blood. Goethe represents
          Mephistopheles as saying to Faust: “I to thy service here agree to
          bind me, To run and never rest at call of thee; When over yonderthou
          shalt find me, Then thou shalt do as much for me.” The cathedrals
          cultivated and perpetuated this superstition, by the figures of
          malignant demons which grinned from the gargoyles of their roofs and
          the capitals of their columns, and popular preaching exalted Satan to
          the rank of a rival god—a god more feared than was the true and living
          God. Satan was pictured as having horns and hoofs—an image of the
          sensual and bestial—which led Cuvier to remark that the adversary
          could not devour, because horns and hoofs indicated not a carnivorous
          but a ruminant quadruped.

          But there is certainly a possibility that the ascending scale of
          created intelligences does not reach its topmost point in man. As the
          distance between man and the lowest forms of life is filled in with
          numberless gradations of being, so it is possible that between man and
          God there exist creatures of higher than human intelligence. This
          possibility is turned to certainty by the express declarations of
          Scripture. The doctrine is interwoven with the later as well as with
          the earlier books of revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quenstedt (Theol., 1:629) regards the existence of angels as
          antecedently probable, because there are no gaps in creation; nature
          does not proceed per saltum. As we have (1) beings purely corporeal,
          as stones; (2) beings partly corporeal and partly spiritual, as men:
          so we should expect in creation (3) beings wholly spiritual, as
          angels. Godet, in his Biblical Studies of the O. T., 1-29, suggests
          another series of gradations. As we have (1) vegetables—species
          without individuality; (2) animals—individuality in bondage to
          species; and (3) men—species overpowered by individuality: so we may
          expect (4) angels—individuality without species.

          If souls live after death, there is certainly a class of disembodied
          spirits. It is not impossible that God may have created spirits
          without bodies. E. G. Robinson, Christian Theology, 110—“The existence
          of lesser deities in all heathen mythologies, and the disposition of
          man everywhere to believe in beings superior to himself and inferior
          to the supreme God, is a presumptive argument in favor of their
          existence.” Locke: “That there should be more species of intelligent
          creatures above us than there are of sensible and material below us,
          is probable to me from hence, that in all the visible and corporeal
          world we see no chasms and gaps.” Foster, Christian Life and Theology,
          193—“A man may certainly believe in the existence of angels upon the
          testimony of one who claims to have come from the heavenly world, if
          he can believe in the Ornithorhyncus upon the testimony of travelers.”
          Tennyson, Two Voices: “This truth within thy mind rehearse, That in a
          boundless universe Is boundless better, boundless worse. Think you
          this world of hopes and fears Could find no statelier than his peers
          In yonder hundred million spheres?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of angels affords a barrier against the false conception
          of this world as including the whole spiritual universe. Earth is only
          part of a larger organism. As Christianity has united Jew and Gentile,
          so hereafter will it blend our own and other orders of creation: Col.
          2:10—“who is the head of all principality and power”—Christ is the
          head of angels as well as of men; Eph. 1:10—“to sum up all things in
          Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth.” On
          Christ and Angels, see Robertson Smith in The Expositor, second
          series, vols. 1, 2, 3. On the general subject of angels, see also
          Whately, Good and Evil Angels; Twesten, transl. in Bib. Sac., 1:768,
          and 2:108; Philippi, Glaubenslehre, 2:282-337, and 3:251-354; Birks,
          Difficulties of Belief, 78 sq.; Scott, Existence of Evil Spirits;
