        <h2>I. Salutation (1-3)</h2>
        <h2>Ver 1. <em>The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, 
            and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,</em></h2>
        
        <p><span class="tab"></span>John refers to himself as the elder. The word elder can 
            refer more generally to either an older person or a person of authority such as when 
            Jesus says, “Now his elder son was in the field” (Lk 15:25) and when Jesus must "suffer 
            many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes" (Mat 16:21). It is also used for 
            Christian leadership such as when Paul told Titus to “appoint elders” (Titus 1:5-9) or when 
            Peter says, “I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder” (1 Pet 5:1). John’s use 
            of the term, like Peter's, affirms his pastoral role and in no way denies his apostleship.</p>
        
        <p><span class="tab"></span>The chosen lady and her children to whom this letter is addressed 
            may refer to a local congregation and its members,<a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1"><span>&#185;</span></a> or it may refer to a particular lady 
            and her children. No evidence finally decides the matter one way or another, however one's 
            interpretation of the letter as a whole may persuade them towards one of these views.</p>

            Clement of Alexandria says it “indicates the election of the holy church” 
            (Clement of Alexandria on 2 John), the Glossa Ordinaria says, “He writes therefore to the 
            universal Church that there is no perfection of faith outside charity, and he execrates the heretics 
            who divide Jesus Christ” (Glossa Ordinaria on 2 John), J. Vernon McGee says, "I have come to the opinion 
            that a local church was in view" (Outline for 2 John), ESV Study Bible says, "This more likely refers to a 
            congregation" (Wheaton: Crossway, 2008, p. 2439), and G. K. Beale and Benjamin L. Gladd in The Story 
            Retold: A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament say, "The audience of 2 John is metaphorically 
            portrayed as 'the lady chosen by God' " (Downders Grove: IVP, 2020, p. 460).
