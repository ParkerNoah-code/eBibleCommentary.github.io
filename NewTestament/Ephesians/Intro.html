        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          The historical evidence for the Pauline authorship of the Epistle is
          exceptionally strong. Some scholars claim that Ignatius even speaks of
          Paul as the author, when he says in his Epistle to the Ephesians:
          ”—who (referring back to Paul) throughout all his Epistle (έν πάσῃ
          ἐπιστολῇ) makes mention of you in Christ Jesus.” But it is very
          doubtful, whether the rendering, “in all the Epistle,” should not
          rather be, “in every Epistle.” Marcion ascribed the letter to Paul,
          and in the Muratorian Fragment the church of Ephesus is mentioned as
          one of the churches to which Paul wrote Epistles. Irenaeus and Clement
          of Alexandria refer to Paul by name as the author of this letter and
          quote it as his, while Tertullian mentions Ephesus among the churches
          that had apostolic Epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal evidence also points to Paul as the author. In the opening
          verse of the Epistle the writer is named, and the structure of the
          letter is characteristically Pauline. In the first place it contains
          the usual blessing and thanksgiving; this is followed in the regular
          way by the body of the epistle, consisting of a doctrinal and a
          practical part; and finally it ends with the customary salutations.
          The ideas developed are in perfect agreement with those found in the
          letters which we already discussed, although in certain particulars
          they advance beyond them, as in the theological conception of the
          doctrine of redemption; and in the doctrine of the Church as the body
          of Christ with its various organs. The style of the Epistle too is
          Pauline. It is true that it differs considerably from that of Romans,
          Corinthians and Galatians, but it shows great affinity with the style
          of Colossians and of the Pastorals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some critics have questioned Paul's authorship, arguing that Ephesians
          differs in style from his other epistles and contains words not found
          in his other letters. However, it is natural for a great writer like
          Paul to vary his style and vocabulary depending on his purpose. This
          can be seen in the different styles of Shakespeare's Hamlet compared
          to A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, or the Sonnets.
          Even an average writer will greatly change their vocabulary and style
          depending on the context. A letter to one's boss will sound very
          different than a letter to one's family member.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early Church leaves no doubt as to the canonicity of this Epistle.
          It is possible that we have the first mention of it in the New
          Testament itself, Col 4:16. The writings of Ignatius, Polycarp, Herman
          and Hippolytus contain passages that seem to be derived from our
          Epistle. Marcion, the Muratorian Canon, Irenaeus, Clement of
          Alexandria and Tertullian clearly testify to its early recognition and
          use. There is not a dissentient voice in all antiquity.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          From Eph 3:1 to Eph 4:1 we notice that Paul was a prisoner, when he
          wrote this Epistle. From the mention of Tychicus as the bearer of it
          in Eph 6:21, compared with Col 4:7 and Phm 1:13, we may infer that
          these three letters were written at the same time. And it has
          generally been thought that they were composed during the Roman
          imprisonment of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few scholars, however, such as Reuss and Meyer, who
          believe that they date from the imprisonment at Caesarea, A. D. 58-60.
          Meyer urges this view on the following grounds: (1) It is more natural
          and probable that the slave Onesimus had run away as far as Caesarea
          than that he had made the long journey to Rome. (2) If these Epistles
          had been sent from Rome, Tychicus and Onesimus would have arrived at
          Ephesus first and then at Colossae. But in that case the apostle would
          most likely have mentioned Onesimus along with Tychicus in Ephesians,
          like he does in Col 4:9, to insure the runaway slave a good reception;
          which was not necessary however, if they reached Colossae first, as
          they would in coming from Caesarea, since Onesimus would remain there.
          (3) In Eph 6:21 the expression, “But that ye also may know my
          affairs,” implies that there were others who had already been informed
          of them, viz, the Colossians, Col 4:8-9. (4) Pauls request to Philemon
          in Phm 1:22, to prepare a lodging for him, and that too, for speedy
          use, favors the idea that the apostle was much nearer Colossae than
          the far distant Rome. Moreover Paul says in Php 2:24 that he expected
          to proceed to Macedonia after his release from the Roman imprisonment.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these arguments are not conclusive. To the first one we may reply
          that Onesimus would be far safer from the pursuit of the fugitivarii
          in a large city like Rome than in a smaller one such as Caesarea. The
          second argument loses its force, if this Epistle was a circular
          letter, written to the Christians of Asia in general. The κάι in Eph
          6:21 is liable to different interpretations, but finds a sufficient
          explanation in the fact that the Epistle to the Colossians was written
          first. And in reply to the last argument we would say that Phm 1:22
          does not speak of a speedy coming, and that the apostle may have
          intended to pass through Macedonia to Colossae.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to us that the following considerations favor the idea that
          the three Epistles under consideration were written from Rome: (1)
          From Eph 6:19-20 we infer that Paul had sufficient liberty during his
          imprisonment to preach the gospel. Now this ill accords with what we
          learn of the imprisonment at Cesarea from Acts 24:23, while it
          perfectly agrees with the situation in which Paul found himself at
          Rome according to Acts 28:16. (2) The many companions of Paul, viz.
          Tychicus, Aristarchus, Marcus, Justus, Epaphras, Luke and Demas, quite
          different from those that accompanied him on his last journey to
          Jerusalem (cf. Acts 20:4), also point to Rome, where the apostle might
          utilize them for evangelistic work. Cf. Php 1:14. (3) In all
          probability Philippians belongs to the same period as the other
          Epistles of the imprisonment; and if this is the case, the mention of
          Caesars household in Php 4:22 also points to Rome. (4) Tradition also
          names Rome as the place of composition. Ephesians must probably be
          dated about A.D. 62.
        </p>
        <h2>Destination</h2>
        <p>
          There is considerable uncertainty respecting the destination of this
          Epistle. The question is whether the words ἐν ̓Εφέσῳ in Eph 1:1 are
          genuine. They are indeed found in all the extant MSS. with the
          exception of three, viz, the important MSS. Aleph and B and codex 67.
          The testimony of Basil is that the most ancient MSS. in his day did
          not contain these words. Tertullian informs us that Marcion gave the
          Epistle the title ad Laodicenos; and Origen apparently did not regard
          the words as genuine. All the old Versions contain them; but, on the
          other hand, Westcott and Hort say: “Transcriptional evidence strongly
          supports the testimony of documents against ἐν ̓Εφέσῳ.” New Testament
          in Greek, Appendix p. 123. Yet there was in the Church an early and,
          except as regards Marcion, universal tradition that the Epistle was
          addressed to the Ephesians. Present day scholars quite generally
          reject the words, although they are still defended by Meyer, Davidson,
          Eadie and Hodge. The conclusion to which the majority of scholars come
          is, either that the Epistle was not written to the Ephesians at all,
          or that it was not meant for them only, but also for the other
          churches in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if we examine the internal evidence, we find that it certainly
          favors the idea that this Epistle was not intended for the Ephesian
          church exclusively, for (1) It contains no references to the peculiar
          circumstances of the Ephesian church, but might be addressed to any of
          the churches founded by Paul. (2) There are no salutations in it from
          Paul or his companions to any one in the Ephesian church. (3) The
          Epistle contemplates only heathen Christians. while the church at
          Ephesus was composed of both Jews and Gentiles, Eph 2:11-12; Eph 4:17;
          Eph 5:8. (4) To these proofs is sometimes added that Eph 1:15 and Eph
          3:2 make it appear as if Paul and his readers were not acquainted with
          each other; but this is not necessarily implied in these passages.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all probability the words ἐν ̓Εφέσῳ were not originally in the text.
          But now the question naturally arises, how we must interpret the
          following words τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς οὖσιν και πιστοῖς; etc. Several
          suggestions have been made. Some would read: “The saints who are
          really such ;” others: “the saints existing and faithful in Jesus
          Christ;” still others: “the saints who are also faithful.” But none of
          these interpretations is satisfactory: the first two are hardly
          grammatical; and the last one implies that there are also saints who
          are not faithful, and that the Epistle was written for a certain
          select view. Probably the hypothesis first suggested by Ussher is
          correct, that a blank was originally left after τοῖς οὖσιν, and that
          Tychicus or someone else was to make several copies of this Epistle
          and to fill in the blank with the name of the church to which each
          copy was to be sent. The fact that the church of Ephesus was the most
          prominent of the churches for which it was intended, will account for
          the insertion of the words ἐν ̓Εφέσῳ in transcribing the letter, and
          for the universal tradition regarding its destination. Most likely,
          therefore, this was a circular letter, sent to several churches in
          Asia, such as those of Ephesus, Laodicea, Hierapolis, e. a. Probably
          it is identical with the Epistle ἐκ Λαοδικίας, Col 4:16.
        </p>
        <h2>The City of Ephesus</h2>
        <p>
          Next to Rome, Ephesus was the most important city visited by Paul. It
          has been called the third capital of Christianity, it being the center
          of work in Asia through which were founded all the churches of Asia,
          especially the seven churches of Asia to which Jesus sent the message
          of Revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded by colonists from Athens around the eleventh century B.C.,
          Ephesus displaced the original inhabitants and developed into a
          significant Greek civilization. Ephesus held a pivotal position as the
          gateway to Asia during ancient times. Its strategic location
          contributed to its growth, making it a sought-after military prize for
          various naval states of Greece and successive kingdoms ruling over
          Asia Minor, including the Lydians and the Persians. Even Alexander the
          Great received homage from Ephesian rulers in 334 B.C., and later in
          188 B.C., the Romans took control of the city from Antiochus the
          Great.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Paul's time, Ephesus was among the three major trading centers in
          the eastern Mediterranean, alongside Alexandria and Antioch. It served
          as the commercial and political capital of Asia and owed much of its
          importance to the religious significance attributed to the city. The
          city boasted an estimated population of around one-third of a million
          people in the first century. It held the status of a free city under
          Roman rule, with its own assembly, council, and governor. The town
          clerk, responsible for city records, held a position of considerable
          influence and responsibility.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Ephesian Landmarks</h2>
        <p>The Temple of Diana:</p>
        <p>
          The structure is said to have measured approximately 425 feet in
          length and 239 feet in width, supported by an impressive array of 100
          columns, each standing 55 feet tall. Its construction spanned a period
          of 220 years. Surrounding this grand shrine, which attracted both
          worshippers and tourists from distant places, there thrived a bustling
          community of tradesmen and hucksters. They catered to the needs of
          visitors by providing food, lodging, dedicatory offerings, and
          especially silver souvenir models of the shrine, a specialty of the
          Demetrius guild (Acts 19:38).
        </p>
        <p>
          The city of Ephesus was founded near the sanctuary of an ancient
          Anatolian goddess, whom the Greeks equated with their own deity,
          Artemis. This goddess was associated with fertility rituals and
          religious practices involving prostitution. The depiction of Artemis
          in Ephesus was a peculiar one, with a female figure adorned with a
          shrine and a basket on her head, a veil decorated with various
          creatures, long necklaces, embroidered sleeves, and legs covered with
          images of animals. She was often represented with multiple breasts or
          an apron adorned with clusters of grapes or dates, symbolizing her
          role as the nurturing spirit of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the prevalence of the Artemis cult and its influence in the
          city, the apostle Paul boldly preached against it and the cultural
          practices associated with it. He confronted the stronghold of pagan
          religion, as well as the active commercial life revolving around the
          extensive heathen worship, in this key city of the central
          Mediterranean and a vital communication hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul's message against idolatry had a significant impact on the city,
          causing disruptions in various related trades. Ephesus, being a
          prominent center of communication and commerce in Asia Minor, became a
          crucial starting point for the spread of Christianity to the
          surrounding regions. From Ephesus, the gospel reached other cities in
          Asia Minor, such as Pergamum, Sardis, Thyatira, Laodicea,
          Philadelphia, Smyrna, Colosse, and Hierapolis. The transformative
          influence of Paul's preaching was akin to confronting gambling in Las
          Vegas, homosexuality in San Francisco, or Islam in Iran, affecting the
          very heart of Ephesian culture and society.
        </p>
        <p>The Theater:</p>
        <p>
          The Ephesian Theater was positioned on the southern slope of Mount
          Pion, providing a stunning backdrop and enhancing its acoustics due to
          the natural amphitheater-like setting. The theater could accommodate
          approximately 25,000 spectators, making it one of the largest theaters
          in the ancient world. It hosted such activites as theatrical
          performances, musical concerts, religious ceremonies, political
          gatherings, public gatherings, festivals, and possibly even
          gladitorial contests although these were usually held in dedicated
          arenas.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          Paul had briefly touched base here on his second journey (Acts
          18:19-21). Then around 54 A.D., on his third journey Paul came to
          Ephesus and stayed for 3 years. (Acts 19:1; 19:10; 20:31). From the
          book of Acts and this letter we know the church had elders (Acts
          20:17). It was composed of many Christians from a Gentile background
          (Eph 2:1; 2:11; 3:1). This congregation would face the lure of false
          teachers (Acts 20:28-31), and yet the Ephesian letter does not really
          meet any specific false teaching head on, as does Galatians or
          Colossians, and the members here dearly loved Paul (Acts 20:36-38).
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          There is nothing in the Epistle to indicate that it was called forth
          by any special circumstances in the churches of Asia. To all
          appearances it was merely the prospective departure of Tychicus and
          Onesimus for Colossae, Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-9, combined with the
          intelligence that Paul received as to the faith of the readers in the
          Lord Jesus, and regarding their love to all the saints, Eph 1:15, that
          led to its composition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the Epistle was not called forth by any special historical
          situation, the purpose of Paul in writing it was naturally of a
          general character. It seems as if what he had heard of “the faith of
          the readers in the Lord Jesus, and of their love to all the saints,”
          involuntarily fixed his thought on the unity of believers in Christ,
          and therefore on that grand edifice,—the Church of God. He sets forth
          the origin, the development, the unity and holiness, and the glorious
          end of that mystical body of Christ. He pictures the transcendent
          beauty of that spiritual temple, of which Christ is the chief
          cornerstone and the saints form the superstructure.
        </p>
        <h2>Message</h2>
        <p>
          The particular significance of the Epistle lies in its teaching
          regarding the unity of the Church: Jews and Gentiles are one in
          Christ. It constantly emphasizes the fact that believers have their
          unity in the Lord and therefore contains the expression “in Christ”
          about twenty times. The unity of the faithful originates in their
          election, since God the Father chose them in Christ before the
          foundation of the world, 1:4; it finds expression in a holy
          conversation, sanctified by true love, that naturally results from
          their living relation with Christ, in whom they are builded together
          for a habitation of God in the Spirit; and it issues in their coming
          in the “unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
          unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
          Christ.” The great practical exhortation of the Epistle is that
          believers live worthily of their union with Christ, since they were
          sometime darkness, but are now light in the Lord, and should therefore
          walk as children of light, Eph 5:8.
        </p>
        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>The Epistle to the Ephesians is naturally divided into two parts:</p>
        <p>
          I. The Doctrinal Part, treating of the Unity of the Church, Eph
          1:1-23, Eph 2:1-22, Eph 3:1-21. After the address and salutation, Eph
          1:1-2, the apostle praises God for the great spiritual blessings
          received in Christ, in whom the Ephesians have been chosen, adopted
          and sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, Eph 1:3-14. He renders
          thanks for these blessings and prays that God may make known to the
          Church, the glorious body of Christ, who filleth all in all, the glory
          of its heavenly calling, Eph 1:15-23. Then he compares the past and
          present condition of the readers, Eph 2:1-13, and describes Christ’s
          work of reconciliation, resulting in the unity and glory of the
          Church, Eph 2:14-22. Next he enlarges on the mystery of the Gospel and
          reminds his readers that he has been commissioned by God to make it
          known to mankind, Eph 3:1-13. He prays that they may be strengthened
          and enabled to comprehend the greatness of the love of Christ to the
          glory of God, Eph 3:14-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Practical Part, containing Exhortations to a Conversation
          worthy of the Calling and Unity of the Readers, Eph 4:1-32, Eph
          5:1-33, Eph 6:1-20. The readers are exhorted to maintain the unity
          which God seeks to establish among them by distributing spiritual
          gifts and instituting different offices, Eph 4:1-16. They should not
          walk as the Gentiles do, but according to the principle of their new
          life, shunning the vices of the old man and practicing the virtues of
          the new, Eph 4:17-32. In society if must be their constant endeavor to
          be separate from the evils of the world and to walk circumspectly;
          husbands and wives should conform in their mutual relation to the
          image of Christ and the Church; children should obey their parents and
          servants their masters, Eph 5:1-33, Eph 6:1-9. Finally Paul exhorts
          the readers to be strong in the Lord, having put on the whole armour
          of God and seeking strength in prayer and supplication; and he closes
          his Epistle with some personal intelligence and a twofold salutation,
          Eph 6:10-24.
