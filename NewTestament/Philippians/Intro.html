        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>CONTENTS</p>
        <p>In the Epistle to the Philippians we may distinguish five parts:</p>
        <p>
          I. Pauls Account of his Condition, Php 1:1-26. The apostle addresses
          the Philippians in the usual way, Php 1:1-2; and then informs them of
          his gratitude for their participation in the work of the Gospel, of
          his prayer for their increase in spiritual strength and labor, of the
          fact that even his imprisonment was instrumental in spreading the
          Gospel, and of his personal feelings and desires, Php 1:3-26.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. His Exhortation to Imitate Christ, Php 1:27-30, Php 2:1-18. He
          exhorts the Philippians to strive after unity by exercising the
          necessary self-denial, Php 1:27-30, Php 2:1-4; points them to the
          pattern of Christ, who humiliated himself and was glorified by God,
          Php 2:5-11; and expresses his desire that they follow the example of
          their Lord, Php 2:12-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In formation respecting Paul’s Efforts in behalf of the
          Philippians, Php 2:19-30. He intends to send Timotheus to them that he
          may know of their condition, and therefore commends this worthy
          servant of Christ to them, Php 2:19-23; and though he trusted that he
          himself would come shortly he now sends Epaphroditus back to them, and
          bespeaks a good reception for him, Php 2:24-30.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Warnings against Judaism and Antinomian Error, Php 3:1-21. The
          apostle warns his readers against Judaeistic zealots that boasted in
          the flesh, pointed to his own example in renouncing his fleshly
          prerogatives that he might gain Christ and experience the power of His
          resurrection, and in striving after perfection, Php 3:1-15. By way of
          contrast this induces him to warn them also for the example of those
          whose lives are worldly and licentious, Php 3:16-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Final Exhortations and Acknowledgment, Eph 4:1-23. He urges the
          Philippians to avoid all dissension, Php 4:1-3; exhorts them to
          joyfulness, freedom from care, and the pursuit of all good things, Php
          4:4-9; gratefully acknowledges their gifts, invoking a blessing on
          their love, Php 4:10-20; and closes his Epistle with salutation and
          benediction, Php 4:21-23.
        </p>
        <p>CHARACTERISTICS</p>
        <p>
          1. The Epistle to the Philippians is one of the most personal of
          Paul’s letters, resembling in that respect II Corinthians. It has been
          called the most letter-like of all the writings of Paul, and may be
          compared in this respect with I Thessalonians and Philemon. The
          personal note is very marked throughout the Epistle. There is not much
          dogma, and what little is found is introduced for practical purposes.
          This holds true even with reference to the classical passage in Php
          2:6-11. The apostle, with the prospect of an early martyrdom before
          him, yet not without hope of a speedy release, opens his heart to his
          most beloved congregation. He speaks of the blessings that attend his
          labors at Rome, of the strait in which he finds himself, and expresses
          his desire to remain with them. He manifests his love for the
          Philippians, shows himself concerned for their spiritual welfare, and
          expresses his profound gratitude for their support. Though in bonds,
          he rejoices, and bids the readers be joyful. The tone of joyous
          gratitude rings through the entire Epistle.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The letter is in no sense a controversial one. There are in it no
          direct polemics; there is very little that has to any degree a
          polemical character. The apostle warns against errorists that are
          without the church, but might disturb its peace, and forestalls their
          attacks; he hints at dissensions, most likely of a practical nature,
          in the congregation, and admonishes the readers to be peaceful and
          self-denying; but he never once assumes a polemical attitude, like he
          does in Corinthians or Galatians. Stronger still, the Epistle is
          singularly free from all denunciation and reproof; it is written
          throughout in a laudatory spirit. The apostle finds little to chide
          and much to praise in the Philippian church.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The address of the Epistle is peculiar in that it names not only,
          “the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi,” but adds, “with
          the bishops and deacons.” In that respect it stands in a class by
          itself. The greetings at the end of the Epistle are also unique. On
          the one hand they are very general, while, on the other, “the
          household of Caesar” is singled out for special mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. As to style, Alford reminds us, that this letter, like all those in
          which Paul writes with fervor, “is discontinuous and abrupt, passing
          rapidly from one theme to another; full of earnest exhortation,
          affectionate warnings, deep and wonderful settings-forth of his
          individual spiritual condition and feelings, of the state of the
          Christian and of the sinful world, of the loving councils of our
          Father respecting us, and the self-sacrifice and triumph of our
          Redeemer.” Prolegomena Sec. IV. There are constant expressions of
          affection, such as ἀγαπητοί andἀδελφοἰ. Notice especially Php 4:1,
          “Therefore my brethren, my dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
          crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.”
        </p>
        <p>AUTHORSHIP</p>
        <p>
          The Pauline authorship of this Epistle is established as well as
          anything can be. We probably find the first reference to it in the
          epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, where we read: “The glorious
          Paul who, being personally among you, taught you exactly and surely
          the word of truth; who also, being absent, wrote you letters (or, a
          letter) which you have only to study to be edified in the faith that
          has been given you.” The passage does not necessarily refer to more
          than one letter. Our Epistle formed a part of Marcions collection, is
          mentioned in the Muratorian canon, is found in the Syriac and old
          Latin Versions, and is quoted by Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria,
          Tertullian and many others.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this testimony of antiquity is clearly borne out by the evidence
          furnished by the Epistle itself. It is self-attested and has, at the
          beginning, the usual Pauline blessing and thanksgiving. Above all,
          however, it is like II Corinthians in that the personality of the
          apostle is so strongly stamped on it as to leave little room for
          doubt. The historical circumstances which the Epistle presupposes, the
          type of thought which it contains, the language in which it is
          couched, and the character which it reveals,—it is all Pauline.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence in its favor is so strong that its authenticity has been
          generally admitted, even by radical critics. Of course, Baur and the
          majority of his school rejected it, but even Hilgenfeld, Julicher and
          Pfleiderer accept it as Pauline. The great majority of New Testament
          scholars regard the objections of Baur as frivolous, as that the
          mention of bishops and deacons points to a post-Pauline stage of
          ecclesiastical organization; that there is no originality in the
          Epistle; that it contains evident traces of Gnosticism; that the
          doctrine of justification which it sets forth is not that of Paul; and
          that the Epistle aims at reconciling the opposing parties of the
          second century, typified by Euodia and Syntyche.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of late Holsten has taken up the cudgels against the genuineness of
          this letter. Dismissing several of the arguments of Baur as
          irrelevant, he bases his attack especially on the Christological and
          Soteriological differences that he discerns between this Epistle and
          the other writings of Paul. The most important points to which he
          refers are these: (1) The idea of the pre-existent Christ in Php
          2:6-11 does not agree with that found in 1 Cor 15:45-49. According to
          the first passage the manhood of Christ begins with his incarnation;
          according to the second, He was even in his pre-existence “a heavenly
          man.” (2) There is a glaring contradiction between Php 3:6, where the
          writer says that he was blameless as touching the righteousness which
          is in the law, and Rom 7:21, where the apostle declares:—when I would
          do good, evil is present.” (3) The doctrine of forensic, imputed
          righteousness is replaced by that of an infused righteousness in Php
          3:9-11. (4) The writer shows a singular indifference to the objective
          truth of his Gospel in Php 1:15-18, an attitude which compares
          strangely with that of Paul in 2 Cor 11:1-4, and especially in Gal
          1:8-9.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these objections are not of sufficient weight to disprove the
          Pauline authorship. In 1 Cor 15:1-58 the apostle does not speak of the
          pre-existent Christ, but of Christ as he will appear at the parousia
          in a glorified body. With what Paul says in Php 3:6 we may compare Gal
          1:14. In both places he speaks of himself from the standpoint of the
          Jew who regards the law merely as an external carnal commandment. From
          that point of view he might consider himself blameless, but it was
          quite different, if he contemplated the law in its deep spiritual
          sense. It is not true that Paul substitutes an infused for an imputed
          righteousness in this Epistle. He clearly speaks of the latter in Php
          2:9, and then by means of an infinitive of purpose passes on to speak
          of the subjective righteousness of life. The persons spoken of in Php
          1:15-18 are not said to preach a Gospel different from that of the
          apostle; they preached Christ, but from impure motives. Hence they can
          not be compared with the adversaries of whom Paul speaks in
          Corinthians and Galatians. To these he probably refers in Php 3:2.
          Schurer says: “The arguments of Holsten are such that one might
          sometimes believe them due to a slip of the pen.”
        </p>
        <p>THE CHURCH AT PHILIPPI</p>
        <p>
          The city of Philippi was formerly called Crenides, and derived its
          later name from Philip, the king of Macedonia, who rebuilt it and made
          it a frontier city between his kingdom and Thrace. It was situated on
          the river Gangites and on the important Egnatian highway that
          connected the Adriatic with the Hellespont. After the defeat of his
          enemies Octavius about 42 B. C. determined on Philippi as one of the
          places, where Roman soldiers who had served their time were to dwell.
          He constituted it a Roman colony, with the special privilege of the
          jus Italicum, which included ”(1) exemption from the oversight of the
          provincial governors; (2) immunity from the poll and property taxes;
          and (3) right to property in the soil regulated by Roman law.” These
          privileges, no doubt, attracted many colonists, so that Philippi soon
          became a city of considerable size. It is described in Acts 16:12 as,
          “the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colony.”
        </p>
        <p>
          To that city Paul first came, when about the year 52, in obedience to
          the vision of the Macedonian man, he passed from Asia into Europe.
          This was in harmony with his general policy of preaching in the main
          centers of the Roman empire. Apparently the Jews were not numerous in
          Philippi: there was no synagogue, so that the small band of Jews and
          proselytes simply repaired to the river side for prayer; and one of
          the charges brought against Paul and Silas was that they were Jews. At
          the place of prayer the missionaries addressed the assembled women,
          and were instrumental in converting Lydia who, with characteristic
          generosity, immediately received them in her house. We read no more of
          the blessings that crowned their labors there, but find that on their
          departure there was a company of brethren to whom they spoke words of
          comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little can be said regarding the composition of the Philippian church.
          In the narrative of its founding we find no specific mention of Jews,
          although the assembly by the river points to their presence. However
          the fact that there was no synagogue, and that the enemies
          contemptuously emphasized the Jewish nationality of the missionaries
          leads us to think that they were few and greatly despised. It may be
          that those who did live there had, under the pressure of their
          environment, already lost many of their distinctive features. The
          presumption is that some of them accepted the teaching of Paul and
          Silas, but we cannot tell how large a proportion of the church they
          formed. In all probability they were a small minority and caused no
          friction in the congregation. Paul does not even refer to them in his
          letter, much less condemn their Jewish tenets, like he does the errors
          of the false brethren at Corinth and in the Galatian churches. The
          adversaries of whom he speaks in Php 3:2 were evidently outside of the
          church. On the whole the Philippian church was an ideal one,
          consisting of warmhearted people, diligent in the work of the Lord,
          and faithfully devoted to their apostle.
        </p>
        <p>COMPOSITION</p>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. The immediate occasion of this Epistle was a
          contribution brought by Epaphroditus from the Philippian church. They
          had often sent the apostle similar tokens of their love (cf. Php
          4:15-16; 2 Cor 11:9), and now, after they had for some time lacked the
          opportunity to communicate with him, Php 4:10, they again ministered
          to his wants. From over-exertion in the work of Gods Kingdom their
          messenger was taken sick at Rome. On his recovery Paul immediately
          sends him back to Philippi, in order to allay all possible fears as to
          his condition; and utilizes this opportunity to send the Philippians a
          letter.
        </p>
        <p>
          His purpose in writing this Epistle was evidently fourfold. In the
          first place he desired to express his gratitude for the munificence of
          the Philippians, especially because it testified to the abundance of
          their faith. In the second place he wished to give utterance to his
          sincere love for the Philippian church that constituted his crown in
          the Lord. In the third place he felt it incumbent on him to warn them
          against the dangers that were present within the fold, and the enemies
          that were threatening them from without. Apparently there was some
          dissension in the church, 1:27—2:17; Php 4:2-3, but, in all
          probability this was not of a doctrinal character, but rather
          consisted of personal rivalries and divisions among some of the church
          members. In Php 3:2 the apostle most likely referred to the Judaeizing
          Christians that traveled about to make proselytes, and also threatened
          the church of Philippi. Finally he desires to exhort his most beloved
          church to be joyful, notwithstanding his imprisonment, and to lead a
          truly Christian life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. Like the Epistle to the Ephesians that to the
          Philippians was written at Rome. While several scholars assign the
          former to the Caesarean captivity, very few refer the latter to that
          period. The apostles evident residing in some great center of
          activity, the many friends that surrounded him, his joyful expectation
          of being set free soon, his mention of the praetorian, Php 1:13, which
          may be the praetorian guard (so most commentators), or the supreme
          imperial court (so Mommsen and Ramsay), and the greetings of Caesars
          household,—all point to Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle was written, therefore, between the years 61-63. The only
          remaining question is, whether it was composed before or after the
          other three Epistles of the captivity. The prevailing view is that
          Philippians is the last of the group. This view is supported by the
          following arguments: (1) The apostles words in Php 1:12 seem to imply
          that a long period of imprisonment has already elapsed. (2) A rather
          long time was required in the communications between Rome and Philippi
          indicated in the letter. The Philippians had heard of Pauls
          imprisonment, had sent Epaphroditus to Rome, had heard of the latter’s
          illness there, and of this their messenger, in turn, had received
          intelligence. Four journeys are, therefore, implied. (3) Paul
          anticipates that his case will soon come up for decision, and although
          uncertain as to the outcome, he somewhat expects a speedy release.
          These arguments are not absolutely conclusive, but certainly create a
          strong presumption in favor of dating the Epistle after the other
          three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bleek was inclined to regard Philippians as the earliest of the
          Epistles of the captivity. This view found a strong defender in
          Lightfoot, who is followed by Farrar in his St. Paul. Lightfoot
          defends his position by pointing to the similarity of this Epistle to
          Romans, which implies, according to him, that it immediately follows
          this in order of time; and to the fact that in this Epistle we have
          the last trace of Paul’s Judaeistic controversy, while in Ephesians
          and Colossians he begins to deal with an incipient Gnosticism, and his
          teachings respecting the Church bear a close resemblance and are
          intimately related to the views presented in the pastorals. These
          Epistles, therefore, represent a further development in the doctrine
          of the Church. But these proofs do not carry conviction, since the
          character of Paul’s Epistles was not necessarily determined by the
          order in which they were written, and the apostle did not write as one
          who is presenting his system of thought to the world in successive
          letters. His Epistles were called forth and determined by special
          situations. And the question may be asked, whether it seems plausible
          that any considerable development of doctrine should take place within
          the course of at most a year and a half.
        </p>
        <p>CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE</p>
        <p>
          The Epistle to the Philippians is not quoted as much as some of the
          preceding ones, which is probably due to the fact that it contains
          little doctrinal matter. Notwithstanding this its canonicity is well
          established. There are traces of its language in Clement of Rome and
          Ignatius. Polycarp, addressing the Philippians, speaks more than once
          of Pauls writing to them. The Epistle to Diognetus, Justin Martyr and
          Theophilus contain references to our letter. In the Epistle of the
          churches of Vienne and Lyons Php 2:6 is quoted. Marcion has it and the
          Muratorian canon speaks of it. And it is often directly quoted and
          ascribed to Paul by Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the Epistle is primarily of a practical nature, it has also
          great and abiding dogmatic significance. It contains the classical
          passage on the important doctrine of the kenosis of Christ, Php
          2:6-11. Aside from this, however, its great permanent value is of a
          practical character. It reveals to us the ideal relation between Paul
          and his Philippian church, a relation such as the church of God should
          constantly seek to realize: he, sedulously seeking to promote the
          spiritual welfare of those entrusted to his care, even in a time of
          dire distress; and they, though possessing no great wealth, willingly
          and lovingly ministering to the natural wants of their beloved
          apostle. It points us to Christ as the pattern of that self-denial and
          humiliation that should always characterize his followers. It comes to
          us with the grand exhortation, enforced by the example of the great
          apostle, to press forward for “the prize of the high calling of God in
          Christ Jesus.” And finally it pictures us the Christian satisfied and
          joyful, even when the shades of night are falling.
