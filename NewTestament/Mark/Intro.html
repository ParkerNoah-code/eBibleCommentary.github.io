        <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          Though the external testimony to the canonicity of Markâ€™s Gospel is
          not so abundant as that for the Gospel of Matthew, yet it is
          sufficient to establish this beyond a shadow of doubt. It is quoted by
          at least two of the apostolic fathers, by Justin Martyr and by the
          three great witnesses of the end of the second century, Irenaeus,
          Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian, and is referred to as a part of
          the Word of God by several others. We find no expressions of doubt in
          the early Church.
        </p>
        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The special purpose of this Gospel in the canon is to show us Christ
          in his divine power, destroying the works of Satan, and conquering sin
          and death. More than other Gospels it places prominently before us the
          work of Christ in behalf of those that are bound by the shackles of
          Satan and are suffering the consequences of sin. We here see the Lion
          out of the tribe of Judah, conquering and ever to conquer. Mark is the
          only one of the evangelists that speaks of the future Kingdom of God
          as coming with power (9:1). In that way this Gospel has special
          significance for the Church of all ages. It gives her the blessed
          assurance that her future is entrusted to One who has shown himself a
          mighty Conqueror, and who is abundantly able to save to the uttermost
          all who believe in Him.
