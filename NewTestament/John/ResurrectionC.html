            said, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins,
            they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not
            forgiven.&quot; - John 20:21-23.
          </p>
          <p>
            IT is not easy to conceive what disappointment our Lord&#x27;s
            disciples must have felt, when they found that he was dead upon the
            cross, and committed to the silent tomb. &quot;They had expected
            that he was the person who would redeem Israel:&quot; and the
            wonderful works which he had done, had appeared to justify that
            expectation, Luke 24:19-21. But, behold, his enemies had prevailed
            against him, and the hopes which they had entertained were
            altogether frustrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            But our blessed Lord left them not long in this disconsolate
            condition. He soon gave them evidences that he was risen from the
            dead. To some he appeared on the morning of his resurrection: and
            &quot;in the evening of that day&quot; he came to them all, while
            they were assembled within closed doors, for fear of the Jews; and
            both spoke peace to their troubled minds, and renewed to them the
            commission which he had given them to preach his Gospel to the
            world; enduing them, at the same time, with a more abundant measure
            of qualifications for their ministry than he had hitherto conferred;
            and assuring them, that all which they either said, or did, on
            earth, under the influence of his good Spirit, would be confirmed
            and ratified in Heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interested as we are in the office which was here assigned them, it
            will be well for us to ascertain, with some precision,
          </p>
          <h2>I. The measure of inspiration given them—</h2>
          <p>
            The commission which the Apostles now received from Christ resembled
            that which Christ himself had received from the Father—
          </p>
          <p>
            Christ was furnished by the Father for the office that was assigned
            to him. &quot;The Spirit of the Lord God was upon him, Isaiah
            61:1,&quot; yes, and &quot;was given to him without measure, John
            3:34.&quot; &quot;The Spirit of the Lord rested upon him, the Spirit
            of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the
            Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord, and made him of
            quick understanding in the fear of the Lord, Isaiah 11:2-3.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of his baptism, the Holy Spirit was sent down in a
            visible manner, both to attest his mission, and to qualify him for
            it, Matthew 3:16-17. And this was the way chosen by God for
            manifesting to the world the commission given to the Apostles, and
            for imparting to them, at the same time, the qualifications
            necessary for the discharge of their high office.
          </p>
          <p>
            On them the Lord Jesus poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit, to
            fit and qualify them for their work—
          </p>
          <p>
            His &quot;breathing on them&quot; was merely an emblematic sign, to
            show them that he was empowered to communicate the Holy Spirit to
            whomever he would. He had before told them, that &quot;he would send
            unto them the Holy Spirit from the Father, John 15:26; John
            16:7;&quot; and he now imparted to them that heavenly gift; and
            assured them, that, within the space of a few days, they would be
            baptized with the Holy Spirit, Acts 1:5,&quot; and receive him in
            that abundant measure which would be necessary for the perfect
            execution of the various duties to which they would be called.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there was, doubtless, an infinite disparity between our Lord and
            his disciples, both as to the measure of inspiration with which they
            were endued, and as to the perfection of holiness which they
            possessed. The knowledge of our blessed Savior was co-extensive with
            the knowledge of his heavenly Father, John 5:20; John 10:15; John
            16:30; and in him was not the smallest possible imperfection,
            Hebrews 7:26. But his disciples were still weak and sinful, and
            liable to err, except when under the immediate guidance of the Holy
            Spirit. In acting, we know, in the instance of Peter, how fallible
            they were: and in recording what they had been commissioned to
            declare, they were left to themselves, to use their own language,
            and to report what they knew: they were indeed assisted by the Holy
            Spirit, who &quot;brought all things to their remembrance;&quot; and
            by the Spirit they were instructed in things which they could not
            otherwise have known: and by the same Spirit they were kept from
            error of every kind: so that all which they have spoken must be
            regarded as the word of God, no less than if their very words had
            been dictated from above: for though, I say again, they were left to
            record everything in their own language, yet, in all that they
            stated, and in all that they revealed, they were kept from error of
            every kind and every degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, on some occasions, they delivered anything from their own minds,
            as matters of opinion, and not as divine authority, they failed not
            to inform the reader in what light he was to regard that particular
            sentiment which was so delivered, 1 Corinthians 7:6; 1 Corinthians
            7:10; 1 Corinthians 7:25; 1 Corinthians 7:40; but in all other
            matters they claimed the authority of God himself, as sanctioning
            and confirming all that they uttered in his name, 1 Thessalonians
            2:13; 1 Thessalonians 4:8.
          </p>
          <p>This will yet more fully appear, while we consider,</p>
          <h2>II. The authority committed to them—</h2>
          <p>
            The words in which this authority was conveyed have been grievously
            misinterpreted and perverted—
          </p>
          <p>
            The ministers of the Church of Rome found on this, and other similar
            passages of Holy Writ, a claim to the power of forgiving sins. When,
            indeed, they are accused of this, they will deny it, and will
            endeavor to explain away their arrogant assertions. But it is a
            fact, that they teach their people to conceive of them as possessing
            this power: and their people do entertain this opinion, and do look
            to them to exercise this power; and do submit to their unscriptural
            impositions, under this fallacious hope; yes, and do pay them, too,
            for administering to them this indulgence.
          </p>
          <p>
            This power, say they, was given to Peter, Matthew 16:19; and
            therefore the Pope, as the successor of Peter, possesses it. This
            power too, say they, was given to the Church; and therefore they, as
            constituting the Church, possess it, Matthew 18:18. And again: this
            power was given to all the Apostles; and therefore they, as
            descendants of the Apostles, possess it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when did Peter ever exercise this power? Did he, when he first
            preached to the Jews? When, under great agony of mind, they cried,
            &quot;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&quot; did he say, &quot;I,
            Peter, forgive you.&quot; No! he assumed no such power to himself;
            but said, &quot;Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the
            name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, Acts
            2:37-38.&quot; Did he arrogate to himself any such power, when he
            opened the kingdom of Heaven to the Gentiles? No! when they would
            have been ready enough to yield him even divine honors, he forbad
            them Acts 10:25-26; and, instead of saying &quot;I forgive
            you,&quot; he referred Cornelius and his company to the Lord Jesus
            Christ, as the only source of hope and peace; saying, &quot;To him
            give all the prophets witness, that, through his name, whoever
            believes in him shall receive remission of sins, Acts 10:43.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            When our blessed Lord himself forgave sins, the surrounding Jews,
            conceiving of him as a mere man, accused him of blasphemy. And their
            accusation was just, if he was not God; for, &quot;who can forgive
            sins, but God alone, Mark 2:7.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>What, then, is the true import of the passage?</p>
          <p>
            The authority vested in the Apostles was not personal, but official;
            or rather, I would say, did not exist at all in themselves, but only
            as declaring the character of those whom God would accept or reject
            in the day of judgment. So far as this power was exercised in
            inflicting or removing censures from any members of the Church, it
            had relation only to this world. So far as it related to the eternal
            world, it was altogether declarative, and in no respect judicial. It
            accorded exactly with the authority of the priests under the law,
            when they were called upon to judge respecting lepers: there were
            given marks whereby they were to try every case that came before
            them: where those marks were found, they pronounced the person
            leprous: and where they were not found, they absolved him from the
            charge of leprosy, Leviticus 13:38-46.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the Apostles have laid down, with the utmost clearness, the marks
            whereby a child of God may be discerned, and be distinguished from
            an hypocritical professor. According to what they have declared,
            shall every case be decided in the day of judgment: those whom they
            have pronounced forgiven, shall be forgiven; and those to whom they
            have assigned a sentence of condemnation, shall assuredly be
            condemned.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the power which they exercised: and this power still
            resides in those who, as God&#x27;s ambassadors, are authorised by
            him to declare his will to men. So far as they judge according to
            the written word, the sins of men, as remitted or retained by them,
            shall be remitted or retained in Heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            That we may bring this subject home for more general use, I would
            call you to notice from it,
          </p>
          <h2>
            1. What aid is reserved for you in the discharge of your duties—
          </h2>
          <p>
            You need, in your respective callings, the influence of the Holy
            Spirit, as much as ever the Apostles did. And to you shall it be
            given, as freely as ever it was conferred on them. The Lord Jesus
            Christ has &quot;the fullness of the Spirit&quot; still abiding in
            him, Malachi 2:15; and if you pray, &quot;Lord Jesus, breathe on
            me!&quot; he will never refuse your request, Luke 11:13.
          </p>
          <h2>2. How to judge of your state before God—</h2>
          <p>
            Men will pretend to declare, with great confidence, that such and
            such characters, which they account good, have nothing to fear. You
            yourselves, too, may have formed a strong opinion on such points.
            But I warn you, that whatever you or the world may think, God&#x27;s
            judgment shall stand; and his final sentence shall be in exact
            accordance with his written word. Your one inquiry therefore must
            be, &quot;What says the Scripture?&quot; for assuredly those whom
            the Scripture acquits, shall be acquitted; and those whom the
            Scripture condemns, shall be condemned. &quot;To the word,
            therefore, and to the testimony. Whoever they be that speak not
            according to this word, there is no light in them.&quot;
