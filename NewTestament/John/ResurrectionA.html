              >Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early,
              while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw that the stone had

          <p>
            <em>Now on the first day of the week</em>. On the sixth day of the
            week, towards the close of it, Christ was place in the grave; he lay
            in the grave all the seventh day, and on the first day of the week
            rose from the dead: so the women, after they had observed where the
            body was laid, went home and prepared spices and ointments, to
            anoint it; but the sabbath coming on, they were prevented; on which
            they rested, according to the Jewish law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Mary Magdalene went early</em>. Other women with her, who had
            attended Christ at the cross, observed where he was buried, and had
            prepared spices to anoint him, and now came for that purpose; for
            not merely to see the sepulchre, and weep at the grave, did she with
            the rest come, but to perform this piece of funeral service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>While it was still dark, to the tomb</em>. The day just began to
            dawn when she set out for the tomb.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb</em>.
            The tomb had been sealed and guarded. This was removed by an angel;
            for though Christ himself could easily have done it, it was proper
            it should be done by a messenger from heaven, by the order of divine
            justice, who had laid him as a prisoner there. Mary's coming so
            early to the grave, shows her great love and affection to Christ,
            her zeal, courage, and diligence, in manifesting her respect unto
            him: and oftentimes so it is, that the greatest sinners, when
            converted, are most eminent for grace, particularly faith, love, and
            humility; and are most diligent in the discharge of duty.

          <p>Jewish views on the testimony of women:</p>
          <p>
            "But let not a single witness be credited, but three, or two at the
            least, and those such whose testimony is confirmed by their good
            lives. But let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of
            the levity and boldness of their sex" (Josephus,
            <a
              href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D4%3Asection%3D219"
              target=""
              ><em>Antiquities</em></a
            >, 4:219).
          </p>
          <p>
            "If a woman’s testimony contradicted a man’s testimony, the man’s
            testimony was generally accepted unless two women both testified
            against the man. Even then, there was no guarantee that the woman’s
            testimony would be accepted (see m. Ned. 11:10). In rabbinical
            tradition—not the law of God—a woman could not participate in the
            reading of the Torah in the synagogue. She was not even permitted to
            cite the Shema, the greatest commandment found in Deut. 6:5 (Ber.
            3:3)" (Brian Chilton,

          <p>
            <em>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter</em>. She made all the

          </p>

            <em>And to the other disciple whom Jesus loved</em>. John the writer

            >! Who they were that had taken the body of Christ away, whether
            friends or enemies, she could not say; nor did she, or any of the
            women that were with her, know where it was put; whether in some
            other grave, or was exposed to the insults of men, or to birds and
            beasts of prey; whether it was laid in a more suitable and
            convenient place, or in a scandalous one; and whether this removal
            was for his greater honour, or reproach; to know this, gave her
            great concern and uneasiness, as she knew it must the disciples
            also.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christ, in a spiritual sense, may be removed from his people for a
            time, and they know not where he is; sometimes he removes himself,
            to chastise them for their former carriage, to try and exercise
            their grace, to inflame their love to him, and sharpen their desires
            after him, and to endear his presence to them the more, when they
            enjoy it again; sometimes he is taken away from them by preachers,
            when they leave him out of their discourses; and by their own sins
            and transgressions, which separate between him and them, with
            respect to communion; and who, for a time, may not know where to
            find him: and for the direction of such it may be observed, that he
            is to be found in the ministration of his word and ordinances in his
            churches.

          </h2>
          <p>
            John, the Evangelist and Apostle went out to see with their own eyes
            what was done, and whether things were as Mary had related; and to
            make a more particular inquiry into, and examination of them; the
            rest of the disciples staying at home and continuing together,
            waiting to hear what account these two would bring.

          <p>
            <em>They both ran together</em>. At first setting out, and for a
            while; not content to walk, they ran, being eagerly desirous to know
            the truth of things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first</em>.
            John was a younger man than Peter, and so more nimble, and swift of
            foot, and got to the sepulchre before him; and besides, had not that
            concern of mind to retard him, Peter might have; as, supposing
            Christ was risen, and he should see him, how he should be able to
            look him in the face, whom he had so shamefully denied.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Stooping and looking in</em>. That is, John; when he came to the
            sepulchre, stooped down to look into it, and see what he could see;
            he only went into the court, or stood upon the floor, where the
            bearers used to set down the bier, before they put the corpse into
            one of the graves in the sepulchre.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>He saw the linen cloths lying there</em>. In which the body had
            been wrapped, but that itself not there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Yet he didn’t enter in</em>. To the sepulchre itself, but waited
            in the court or porch, till Peter came; and perhaps might be
            timorous and fearful of going into such a place alone.
          </p>

            Ver 6-7.

              He saw the linen cloths lying, and the cloth that had been on his

            of two or three witnesses everything is confirmed, so was this.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>He saw the linen cloths lying</em>. Both saw the linen in which
            the body was wrapped, but that was gone; and which was a sign that
            the body was not stolen away, otherwise the linen would not have
            been left; and besides, it would have taken up some time, and given
            a good deal of trouble, to have unwrapped the body, when it is
            considered how many foldings the Jews used to wind up their corpse
            in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em

              cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself</em
            >. Christ, by laying aside the tokens of death, testified that he
            had clothed himself with a blessed and immortal life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calvin comments, "When the Evangelist says, that a napkin was
            wrapped about his head, this refutes the falsehood of the Papists,
            who pretend that the whole body was sewed up in one linen garment,
            which they hold out to the wretched populace, calling it 'the holy
            winding-sheet'... nor do I say any thing about their impudence in
            boasting that they have this very napkin in five or six different
            places."

            <em>And he saw and believed</em>. Luke 24:12 relates that Peter,
            departed home, "wondering what had happened"; meaning by this, that
            Peter thought of something greater and loftier than what Mary had
            told him.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For as yet they didn’t know the Scripture</em>. Meaning not some
            particular passage of Scripture, but the writings of the Old
            Testament in general, and the various places in it, which spoke of
            the resurrection of Christ, either in a way of type, or prophecy;
            such as Genesis 22:3 and though our Lord had often referred to some
            of them, at least as in Matthew 12:40 yet such was the dulness of
            the disciples, or such their prejudices in favour of the Messiah
            being to continue, and set up a temporal kingdom, that even John,
            who leaned on his breast, and Peter, who was so inquisitive and
            desirous of knowing our Lord's meaning in everything, did not
            understand the sense of his words, nor of those places of Scripture
            he had reference to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That he must rise from the dead</em>. It was determined, and
            thus it was predicted. The justification and salvation of God's
            elect required it; and yet they knew not the thing, nor the
            necessity and importance of it.

            place from whence they came, and where the rest were assembled
            together, to pray, converse, and consult together, what was to be
            done at this juncture.

            &quot;Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first,
            also went inside. He saw and believed. (They still did not
            understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the
            dead.)&quot; - John 20:8-9.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this day was fulfilled that prophecy, which is so often quoted in
            the New Testament, &quot;The stone which the builders disallowed,
            the same is made the cornerstone.&quot; Yes, &quot;this is the day
            which the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it, Psalm
            118:22-24.&quot; It is true, the arrival of it in the first instance
            afforded no satisfaction either to the friends or enemies of our
            Lord. The earthquake that attended his resurrection filled the
            soldiers with consternation and dismay; insomuch that, when they saw
            &quot;the angel who rolled away the stone from his sepulcher, they
            shook, and became as dead men:&quot; and all the heads of the Jewish
            nation, when they saw how ineffectual their precautions had been,
            were mad with disappointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The disciples too were overwhelmed with grief: they had been taught
            to expect the resurrection of their Lord; yet they seemed to have
            really less expectation of it than his very enemies; so wholly were
            they absorbed in grief, and given up to despondency. At last,
            however, their sorrow was turned into joy; and they were constrained
            to believe, when they found it no longer possible to doubt.
          </p>
          <p>We will endeavor to show,</p>
          <h2>I. The reason of their unbelief—</h2>
          <p>
            Our text informs us, that &quot;They still did not understand from
            Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead&quot;—
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Lord had often told them, that &quot;he must be killed, and on
            the third day rise again.&quot; He had spoken of it figuratively,
            John 2:19; John 2:21; he had declared it plainly, Matthew 20:19; he
            had laid the whole stress of his religion upon it, Matthew 12:39-40;
            and his very enemies considered that on this point depended either
            the proof of his Messiahship, or a decisive evidence of his
            imposture, Matthew 27:63-64.
          </p>
          <p>
            But his disciples never understood him, Mark 9:9-10; Mark 9:31-32;
            one of them had even presumed &quot;to rebuke him,&quot; as though
            to talk of his death and resurrection was the result of needless
            fear or gloomy superstition, Matthew 16:21-22. Thus, for lack of
            considering what the Holy Scriptures, and their Lord, had spoken on
            this subject, they could not conceive that such an event as his
            resurrection would ever take place.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the same source must be traced the unbelief that generally
            prevails—
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scriptures speak plainly respecting our undone state by nature,
            and our recovery through Christ alone. But when we declare these
            things to men, they are ready to reply, &quot;Does he not speak
            parables, Ezekiel 20:49.&quot; &quot;They know not the
            Scripture;&quot; they do not understand it; they do not regard it;
            they form their own opinions without any reference to it; and
            therefore they neither will, nor can, receive its decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as their unbelief was at last vanquished, we proceed to inquire
            into,
          </p>
          <h2>II. The means by which it was overcome—</h2>
          <p>
            The Apostles diligently investigated the subject proposed to them—
          </p>
          <p>
            They were informed by Mary Magdalen, that the body of our Lord was
            removed from the sepulcher. Without loss of time they set out, as
            expeditiously as possible, to investigate the point. John being the
            younger man, and not, like Peter, oppressed with a load of guilt,
            arrived first at the place, and looked into the sepulcher. But
            Peter, being the more intrepid character, as soon as he arrived,
            went directly, and without hesitation, into the sepulcher, and saw
            the careful manner in which the linen and the napkin were folded up
            and laid in separate places, evidently showing that the body had not
            been taken away, nor had escaped but with the utmost calmness and
            composure.
          </p>
          <p>
            John, emboldened by his example, used the same means of ascertaining
            the fact; and, on discovering it, &quot;believed&quot; that Christ
            was indeed risen; while Peter, though &quot;wondering at the things
            that had come to pass,&quot; still retained some doubts respecting
            them. Still, however, the measure of conviction which was wrought in
            both their minds, was produced by the same means: but it was
            strongest on him whose mind was most under the influence of love.
          </p>
          <p>In a similar way must all unbelief be vanquished—</p>
          <p>
            We must search and examine for ourselves: we must also vie with each
            other, as it were, in the pursuit of truth, animating and
            encouraging one another both by testimony and example. To such
            diligent and candid exertions is the faith of the Bereans ascribed,
            Acts 17:11-12; and wherever they are used, with prayer to God for
            the illumination of his Spirit, they will sooner or later assuredly
            succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the circumstance of their not yielding an easy assent to what
            was told them, we shall be led to notice,
          </p>
          <h2>III. The grounds which are hereby afforded for our faith—</h2>
          <p>
            The Apostles were very slow to believe the fact of Christ&#x27;s
            resurrection—
          </p>
          <p>
            They would not believe the woman that had seen a vision, Luke
            24:4-11; nor even when Mary had had a personal interview with him,
            would they believe, Mark 16:9-11; nor even when two of their own
            body had conversed with him, Mark 16:12-13. They would scarcely
            believe the evidence of their own senses, Luke 24:36-41. Nor, when
            all the others had been overpowered with the weight of evidence,
            would Thomas yield assent, until, by feeling the very wounds which
            had been made in the hands and side of Christ, he had a testimony
            which he could no longer doubt, John 20:24-27.
          </p>
          <p>But all this tends exceedingly to confirm our faith—</p>
          <p>
            Had the disciples yielded an easy assent, their report had been the
            less worthy of credit: but when they were so incredulous, as to
            bring on themselves a severe rebuke from Christ for &quot;their
            unbelief and hardness of heart, Mark 16:14,&quot; their testimony
            may be relied upon; because they asserted nothing which they had not
            ascertained to be true by the most solid and incontrovertible
            evidence. In this view their word may be implicitly received: but
            when, in addition to all this, their testimony was confirmed by the
            visible descent of the Holy Spirit, and by miracles without number,
            and, lastly, by their willingness at all times to seal it with their
            blood, there can be no room to entertain a doubt respecting it; nor
            can any testimony whatever be worthy of the smallest credit, if
            theirs be not considered as beyond the reach of doubt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assuming then the doctrine of Christ&#x27;s resurrection as proved,
            let us contemplate,
          </p>
          <h2>1. The benefits dependent on it—</h2>
          <p>
            Every part of our salvation depends on this, even more than on his
            death itself, Romans 8:34; Romans 4:25; Romans 5:10. O learn to see
            this, as the Apostles, when fully instructed, saw it! and rejoice in
            seeing everything secured to you both for time and eternity!
            Colossians 3:3-4.
          </p>
          <h2>2. The duties arising from it—</h2>
          <p>
            Your great duty is, to be conformed to his resurrection; dying to
            sin, as he died for it, and living to God, even as he does. All the
            affections of your soul must follow him, Colossians 3:1-2; and the
            renovation of your life must correspond in all things with the
            pattern which his resurrection exhibits to your view. Remember
            however to look to him for strength; for &quot;without him you can
            do nothing,&quot; but &quot;through his strength you can do all
            things&quot;.
