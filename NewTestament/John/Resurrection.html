        <h2>IX. The Resurrection (20:1-31)</h2>
        <p>
          The empty tomb is a sign that Jesus has triumphed over sin and death.
          In the tomb lies not a lifeless body because Jesus has risen and taken
          on a new glorious body. Jesus has shattered the chains that held
          humanity captive, offering a path to salvation. His death is not just
          a personal victory, but a universal victory. It is the beginning of
          God's plan to renew and transform all of creation, healing its wounds
          and ushering in the kingdom of God. The resurrection declares that
          Jesus is the eternal and living Christ, and the Lord of all creation.
        </p>
        <p><a href="ResurrectionA.html">A. The Empty Tomb (20:1-10)</a></p>
        <p>
          On Sunday morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the
          tomb and discovered that it was empty (1). Supposing that they had
          moved the body, she ran to tell Peter and John that she didn't know
          where they had taken him (2). After hearing the news, Peter and John
          ran to the tomb, which they likewise found empty, and upon walking in
          discovered the linen cloths and face cloth from Jesus' body lying
          neatly there (3-8). The disciples return home believing that Jesus had
          risen from the dead but not yet understanding how this fulfills the
          Old Testament (9-10).
        </p>

            >B. Appearance to Mary Magdalene (20:11-18)</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary Magdalene, who was weeping, moved to see inside the tomb, and saw
          two angels in white, one where the head of the body of Jesus had been
          and one where his feet had been (11-12). The angels asked her why she
          was weeping, and she told them it was because they had taken away her
          Lord (13). At that moment, she turned around and saw Jesus, who she
          mistook to be a gardener because of his resurrected body, who asked
          why she was weeping and whom she was seeking, and again she asked
          about the location of the body of Jesus (14-15). Right after that,
          Mary recognizes Jesus and is sent to tell the disciples that he will
          ascend to the Father soon, so she goes and annouces to the disciples
          that she has seen the Lord (17-18).
        </p>

            >C. Appearance to the Disciples (20:19-23)</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A few hours later, Jesus entered the place where the disciples were
          despite the locked doors (19). He showed them his hands and his side
          where he had been pierced and commisions them to go out and proclaim
          the gospel (20-21). Jesus breathes on them and tells them to recieve
          the Holy Spirit (22). The gospel they are to proclaim is about the
          forgiveness of sins (23).
        </p>

          <a href="ResurrectionD.html">D. Appearance to Thomas (20:24-31)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas refuses to believe the resurrection until Jesus appears again
          to the disciples and allows Thomas to touch the wounds (24-27). This
          leads to Thomas' great confession of his faith in Jesus: "My Lord and
          my God!" (28). John tells us that his purpose in writing is that we
          also may have faith in Jesus, believing that Jesus is the Christ, the
          Son of God, and that by believing we might have life in his name
          (29-31).
