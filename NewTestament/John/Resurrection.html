        <h2>IX. The Resurrection (20:1-31)</h2>
        <p>
          The empty tomb is a sign that Jesus has triumphed over sin and death.
          In the tomb lies not a lifeless body because Jesus has risen and taken
          on a new glorious body. Jesus has shattered the chains that held
          humanity captive, offering a path to salvation. His death is not just
          a personal victory, but a universal victory. It is the beginning of
          God's plan to renew and transform all of creation, healing its wounds
          and ushering in the kingdom of God. The resurrection declares that
          Jesus is the eternal and living Christ, and the Lord of all creation.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          On Sunday morning while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the
          tomb and discovered that it was empty (1). Supposing that they had
          moved the body, she ran to tell Peter and John that she didn't know
          where they had taken him (2). After hearing the news, Peter and John
          ran to the tomb, which they likewise found empty, and upon walking in
          discovered the linen cloths and face cloth from Jesus' body lying
          neatly there (3-8). The disciples return home believing that Jesus had
          risen from the dead but not yet understanding how this fulfills the
          Old Testament (9-10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary Magdalene, who was weeping, moved to see inside the tomb, and saw
          two angels in white, one where the head of the body of Jesus had been
          and one where his feet had been (11-12). The angels asked her why she
          was weeping, and she told them it was because they had taken away her
          Lord (13). At that moment, she turned around and saw Jesus, who she
          mistook to be a gardener because of his resurrected body, who asked
          why she was weeping and whom she was seeking; again she asked about
          the location of the body of Jesus (14-15). Right after that, Mary
          recognizes Jesus and is sent to tell the disciples that he will ascend
          to the Father soon, so she goes and annouces to the disciples that she
          has seen the Lord (17-18).
        </p>
        <p>
          A few hours later, Jesus entered the place where the disciples were
          despite the locked doors (19). He showed them his hands and his side
          where he had been pierced and commisions them to go out and proclaim
          the gospel (20-21). Jesus breathes on them and tells them to recieve
          the Holy Spirit (22). The gospel they are to proclaim is about the
          forgiveness of sins (23).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas refuses to believe the resurrection until Jesus appears again
          to the disciples and allows Thomas to touch the wounds (24-27). This
          leads to Thomas' great confession of his faith in Jesus: "My Lord and
          my God!" (28). John tells us that his purpose in writing is that we
          also may have faith in Jesus, believing that Jesus is the Christ, the
          Son of God, and that by believing we might have life in his name
          (29-31).

        <h2>Context in John</h2>
        <p>
          “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (Jn 2:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended out of heaven,
          the Son of Man, who is in heaven. As Moses lifted up the serpent in
          the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever
          believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so
          loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that whoever believes
          in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God didn’t send
          his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should
          be saved through him. He who believes in him is not judged. He who
          doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed
          in the name of the only born Son of God" (Jn 3:13-18).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes in which all who are in the
          tombs will hear his voice and will come out; those who have done good,
          to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the
          resurrection of judgment" (Jn 5:28-29).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know
          where I came from, and where I am going; but you don’t know where I
          came from, or where I am going." (Jn 8:14).
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still
          live, even if he dies." (Jn 11:25).
        </p>
        <p>
          "The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Most certainly
          I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it
          remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who
          loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world will
          keep it to eternal life. If anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where
          I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father
          will honor him" (Jn 12:23-26).
        </p>

        <h2>Old Testament Resurrection</h2>
        <p>
          "For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,<br />
          neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption." (Ps 16:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          "You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles,<br />
          you will let me live.<br />
          You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth" (Ps 71:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          "But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.<br />
          In the end, he will stand upon the earth.<br />
          After my skin is destroyed,<br />
          then I will see God in my flesh,<br />
          whom I, even I, will see on my side.<br />
          My eyes will see, and not as a stranger" (Job 19:25-27).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your dead shall live.<br />
          Their dead bodies shall arise.<br />
          Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust" (Isa 26:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost. We
          are completely cut off.’ Therefore prophesy, and tell them, ‘The Lord
          Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come
          up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land
          of Israel. You will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your
          graves and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people. I will
          put my Spirit in you, and you will live. Then I will place you in your
          own land; and you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and
          performed it,’ says Yahweh" (Ez 37:11-14).
        </p>
        <p>
          "At that time your people will be delivered, everyone who is found
          written in the book. Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth
          will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
          everlasting contempt. Those who are wise will shine as the brightness
          of the expanse. Those who turn many to righteousness will shine as the
          stars forever and ever" (Dan 12:1-3).
        </p>

        <h2>New Testament Resurrection</h2>
        <p>
          "But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first
          fruit of those who are asleep. For since death came by man, the
          resurrection of the dead also came by man. For as in Adam all die, so
          also in Christ all will be made alive. But each in his own order:
          Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s at his coming.
          Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God the
          Father, when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and
          power. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his
          feet. The last enemy that will be abolished is death." (1 Cor
          15:20-26).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Therefore we are always confident and know that while we are at home
          in the body, we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by faith, not by
          sight. We are courageous, I say, and are willing rather to be absent
          from the body and to be at home with the Lord. Therefore also we make
          it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him. For
          we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ that each
          one may receive the things in the body according to what he has done,
          whether good or bad" (2 Cor 5:6-10).
        </p>
        <p>
          "But we don’t want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who
          have fallen asleep, so that you don’t grieve like the rest, who have
          no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God
          will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we
          tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left
          until the coming of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have
          fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a
          shout, with the voice of the archangel and with God’s trumpet. The
          dead in Christ will rise first, then we who are alive, who are left,
          will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
          the air. So we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore comfort one
          another with these words" (1 Thess 4:13-18).
        </p>
        <p>
          "I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them.
          I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of
          Jesus and for the word of God, and such as didn’t worship the beast
          nor his image, and didn’t receive the mark on their forehead and on
          their hand. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
          The rest of the dead didn’t live until the thousand years were
          finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who
          has part in the first resurrection. Over these, the second death has
          no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will
          reign with him one thousand years" (Rev 20:4-6).
