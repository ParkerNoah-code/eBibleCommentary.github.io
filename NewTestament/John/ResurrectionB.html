              wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb, and she saw two angels

            <em>But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping</em>. She
            returned from the city to the sepulchre again, following Peter and
            John thither, who continued here when they departed, being willing
            to get some information of her Lord, if possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>So as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb</em>.
            Weeping that the body of her dear Lord was taken away, and she was
            prevented of showing that respect unto it she designed; and not
            knowing in whose hands it was, but fearing it would be insulted and
            abused by wicked men, her heart was ready to break with sorrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            She looked in to see if she could see him, if she and the disciples
            were not mistaken, being loath to go without finding him: so it is
            in a spiritual sense, the absence of Christ is cause of great
            distress and sorrow to gracious souls; because of the excellency of
            his person, the near and dear relations he stands in to them and on
            account of the nature of his presence and company, which is
            preferable to everything in this world; nor can such souls, when
            they have lost sight of Christ, sit down contented; but will seek
            after him in the Scriptures, under the ministry of the word, and at
            the ordinances of the Gospel, where a crucified, buried, risen Jesus
            is exhibited.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And she saw two angels in white sitting</em>. What an amazing
            forbearance displayed by our Lord, in bearing with so many faults in
            Mary and her companions! For it is no small honor which he confers
            on them by sending his angels, and, at length, making himself known
            to them, which he had not done to the apostles. Though the apostles
            and the women were afflicted with the same disease, yet the
            stupidity of the apostles was less excusable, because they had
            profited so little by the valuable and careful instruction which
            they had received. These ministering spirits were clothed in white,
            expressive of their spotless purity and innocence.

              >One at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had
              lain</em
            >. When the author adds certain unusual details, it indicates that
            he may be recalling an Old Testament parallel. The mercy seat means
            "'that which makes expiation' or 'propitiation.' It carries the idea
            of the removal of sin" (Got Questions,
            <a
              href="https://www.gotquestions.org/mercy-seat.html"
              target="_blank"
              ><em>What is the mercy seat?</em></a
            >). It fits well in context with the atoning death of Jesus and the
            cherubim on either side of the ark of the covenant:
          </p>
          <p>
            "You shall make two cherubim of hammered gold. You shall make them
            at the two ends of the mercy seat. Make one cherub at the one end,
            and one cherub at the other end. You shall make the cherubim on its
            two ends of one piece with the mercy seat. The cherubim shall spread
            out their wings upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings,
            with their faces toward one another. The faces of the cherubim shall
            be toward the mercy seat. You shall put the mercy seat on top of the
            ark, and in the ark you shall put the covenant that I will give you.
            There I will meet with you, and I will tell you from above the mercy
            seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the
            covenant, all that I command you for the children of Israel." (Ex
            25:18-22).

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>They asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping”</em>? Signifying,
            that she had no reason to weep, but to rejoice and be glad; since,
            though the body of her Lord was not there, yet he was risen from the
            dead, and was alive.

            Which reason sufficient for her weeping because she wouldn't be able

            an answer from the angels, she turned herself back perceiving,
            either by the looks and gesture of one of the angels, or by hearing
            a noise, that somebody was behind her.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And didn’t know that it was Jesus</em>. She saw a person, but
            did not know who he was, by reason of the form of his appearance,
            the difference of his clothes, and not expecting to see him alive;
            or through modesty, she might not look wistfully at him; and
            besides, her eyes were filled with tears, and swollen with weeping;
            so that she could not see clearly; and her eyes might be holden
            also, as the disciples were, that as yet she might not know him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, in a spiritual sense, Christ is with, and near his
            people, and they know it not: Christ, as God, is omnipresent; he is
            every where, and in all places; the spiritual presence of Christ, is
            more or less, in some way or another, always in all his churches,
            and among his dear people; but the sight of him is not always alike
            to them, nor does he appear to them always in the same form;
            sometimes against them, at least in their apprehensions, nor always
            in a manner agreeably to their expectations; nor is his grace always
            discovered in the same way, nor has it the same effect.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 15.
            <em
              >Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you
              looking for?” She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him,
              “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid
              him, and I will take him away.”</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?"</em> The same
            question he puts to her, as was put by the angels, but he adds one
            more question after.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who are you looking for</em>? For she was not only weeping for
            the loss of him, but was inquiring after him, if anyone saw him
            removed from thence, and where he was carried.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>She, supposing him to be the gardener</em>. That had the care of
            the garden, in which the sepulchre was; for not the owner of the
            garden, who was Joseph, but the keeper of it is meant; she could not
            imagine that Joseph should be there so early in the morning, but
            might reasonably think the gardener was.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where
              you have laid him, and I will take him away.”</em
            >
            She addresses him, though she took him to be but the gardener, in a
            very civil and courteous manner; which was rightly judged,
            especially since she had a favour to ask of him: she does not
            mention the name of her Lord, but imagined he knew who she meant,
            being so lately buried there; and suggests, that perhaps it might
            not have been so agreeable to the gardener to have his body lie
            there, and therefore had removed it; and would he but be so kind as
            to let her know where he was put, she, with the assistance of her
            friends close by, would take him away with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a spiritual sense, a truly gracious soul is willing to do
            anything, and to be at any trouble, so that it may but enjoy Christ;
            it dearly loves him, as this good woman did; it early, and
            earnestly, and with its whole heart, seeks after him, as she did;
            and absence of him, or loss of his presence for a while, sharpens
            the desire after him, and makes his presence the more welcome.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 16.
            <em
              >Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!”
              which is to say, “Teacher!”</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Jesus said to her, “Mary.”</em> He might alter the tone of his
            voice, and speak unto her as he used to do, calling her by her name
            in his usual manner: so Christ has personal knowledge of all his
            people, and can call them by name; he knows them, and makes himself
            known to them, before they can know him; and though he may absent
            himself from them for a while, yet not always
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!” which is to say,
              “Teacher!”</em
            >
            The efficacy of the address is evident from this circumstance, that
            Mary immediately renders to Christ the honor which is due to him;
            for the word Rabboni is not only respectful, but involves a
            profession of obedience. Mary therefore declares, that she is a
            disciple of Christ, and submits to him as her Master. This is a
            secret and wonderful change effected on the human understanding,
            when God, enlightening her by his Spirit, renders her clear-sighted,
            who formerly was slow of apprehension, and, indeed, altogether
            blind. Besides, the example of Mary ought to serve the purpose of
            exhortation, that all whom Christ invites to himself may reply to
            him without delay.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 17.
            <em
              >Jesus said to her, “Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to
              my Father; but go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to
              my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ”</em

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Jesus said to her, “Don’t hold me"</em>. Not that his body was
            an aerial one, or a mere "phantom", which could not be touched; the
            prohibition itself shows the contrary; and besides, Christ's body
            was afterwards presented to Thomas, to be touched by him, and to be
            handled by all the disciples; and his feet were held by the women,
            which is what Mary would have now done: upon the discovery of him,
            she threw herself at his feet, and was going to embrace and kiss
            them, to testify her affection and joy, when she is forbid; not as
            unworthy of the favour, because she sought him among the dead, for
            which the angels reproved her and the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            But either because he was not to be conversed with, as before his
            death, his body being raised immortal and glorious; or rather,
            because he had an errand to send her on to his disciples, which
            required haste; nor need she stay now to show her respect to him,
            since she would have opportunity enough to do that, before his
            ascension; which though it was to be quickly, yet not directly and
            immediately; and this seems to be the sense of our Lord's reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For I haven’t yet ascended to my Father</em>. Nor does he
            immediately go to him; for he stayed forty days before his
            ascension; when he intimates, she might see him again, and
            familiarly converse with him; at present he would have her stay no
            longer with him.

            God was his Father, not by creation, as he is to angels, and the
            souls of men, and therefore is called the Father of spirits; nor by
            adoption, as he is to the saints; nor with respect to the
            incarnation of Christ, for, as man, he had no father; or with regard
            to his office as Mediator, for as such he was a servant, and not a
            Son; but he was his Father by nature, or with regard to his divine
            person, being begotten of him, and so his own proper Son, and he his
            own proper Father; which hold forth the natural and eternal sonship
            of Christ, his equality with him, and distinction from him: and God
            was the Father of his disciples by adopting grace, in virtue of the
            covenant of grace made with Christ, and through their spiritual
            relation to him, as the natural and eternal Son of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            God the Father is the God of Christ as man, who prepared, formed,
            anointed, supported, and glorified his human nature; and in which
            nature, he prayed to him as his God, believed in him, loved and
            obeyed him as such; wherefore the Jews very wrongly infers from
            hence, that he is not God, because the God of Israel was his God;
            since this is spoken of him as he is man: and he was the God of his
            disciples, in and by the covenant of grace made with Christ, as
            their head and representative; so that their interest in God, as
            their covenant God and Father, was founded upon his being the God
            and Father of Christ, and their relation to, and concern with him;
            and which therefore must be firm and lasting, and will hold as long
            as God is the God and Father of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was good news to be brought to his disciples; which, as it
            carried the strongest marks of affection, and expressions of
            nearness of relation; and implied, that he was now risen from the
            dead; so it signified, that he should ascend to God, who stood in
            the same relation to them, as to him; when he should use all his
            interest and influence on their behalf, whilst they were on earth;
            and when the proper time was come for a remove, that they might be
            with him, and with his God and Father and theirs, where they would
            be to all eternity.
