              >But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So as she
              wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb, and she saw two angels

            <em>But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping</em>. She
            returned from the city to the sepulchre again, following Peter and
            John thither, who continued here when they departed, being willing
            to get some information of her Lord, if possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>So as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb</em>.
            Weeping that the body of her dear Lord was taken away, and she was
            prevented of showing that respect unto it she designed; and not
            knowing in whose hands it was, but fearing it would be insulted and
            abused by wicked men, her heart was ready to break with sorrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            She looked in to see if she could see him, if she and the disciples
            were not mistaken, being loath to go without finding him: so it is
            in a spiritual sense, the absence of Christ is cause of great
            distress and sorrow to gracious souls; because of the excellency of
            his person, the near and dear relations he stands in to them and on
            account of the nature of his presence and company, which is
            preferable to everything in this world; nor can such souls, when
            they have lost sight of Christ, sit down contented; but will seek
            after him in the Scriptures, under the ministry of the word, and at
            the ordinances of the Gospel, where a crucified, buried, risen Jesus
            is exhibited.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And she saw two angels in white sitting</em>. What an amazing
            forbearance displayed by our Lord, in bearing with so many faults in
            Mary and her companions! For it is no small honor which he confers
            on them by sending his angels, and, at length, making himself known
            to them, which he had not done to the apostles. Though the apostles
            and the women were afflicted with the same disease, yet the
            stupidity of the apostles was less excusable, because they had
            profited so little by the valuable and careful instruction which
            they had received. These ministering spirits were clothed in white,
            expressive of their spotless purity and innocence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever we read that the angels appeared in the visible form of men
            and clothed with garments, this was done on account of the ignorance
            of men. For my part, I have no doubt that they sometimes were
            clothed with real bodies; but whether or not those two angels had
            merely the appearance of bodies, would be a useless inquiry, and I
            shall therefore leave it undetermined. To me it is enough that the
            Lord gave them a human shape, that the women might see and hear
            them, while the magnificent and uncommon dress which they wore
            distinguished them from the ordinary rank of men, and pointed out
            something divine and heavenly.

            >. When the author adds certain unusual details, it indicates that
            he may be recalling an Old Testament parallel. The mercy seat means
            "'that which makes expiation' or 'propitiation.' It carries the idea
            of the removal of sin" (Got Questions,
            <a
              href="https://www.gotquestions.org/mercy-seat.html"
              target="_blank"
              ><em>What is the mercy seat?</em></a
            >). This fits well with the atoning death of Jesus and the cherubim
            on either side of the ark of the covenant:
          </p>
          <p>
            "You shall make two cherubim of hammered gold. You shall make them
            at the two ends of the mercy seat. Make one cherub at the one end,
            and one cherub at the other end. You shall make the cherubim on its
            two ends of one piece with the mercy seat. The cherubim shall spread
            out their wings upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings,
            with their faces toward one another. The faces of the cherubim shall
            be toward the mercy seat. You shall put the mercy seat on top of the
            ark, and in the ark you shall put the covenant that I will give you.
            There I will meet with you, and I will tell you from above the mercy
            seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the
            covenant, all that I command you for the children of Israel." (Ex
            25:18-22).
