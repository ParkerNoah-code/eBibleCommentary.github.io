          <p><em>Thomas&#x27; Unbelief Reproved</em></p>
          <p>
            Then he said to Thomas, &quot;Put your finger here; see my hands.
            Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and
            believe.&quot; - John 20:27-28.
          </p>
          <p>Thomas said to him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot;</p>
          <p>
            IT is worthy of observation, that the inspired writers show no
            solicitude to conceal their own faults, or the faults of each other;
            but that they relate everything with artless simplicity, precisely
            as it occurred. The disciples were all, without exception, reproved
            as &quot;fools, and slow of heart to believe what had been written
            by the prophets&quot; of old. But Thomas in particular gave way to
            unbelief, and would not credit the resurrection of his Lord, even
            after all the others were convinced of it. This, however, was
            overruled by his Divine Master, for the good of the Church in all
            ages: for, while it was an occasion of a particular manifestation of
            Christ to him, it brought forth from him as glorious a confession of
            Christ, as any we find in the inspired volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            From that manifestation, and that confession, we shall be led to
            show,
          </p>
          <h2>I. The evidence we have of the truth of Christianity—</h2>
          <p>
            Of course we cannot enter now into the consideration of the
            evidences at large; we must confine our attention to the two which
            are mentioned in the passage before us:
          </p>
          <p>1. The testimony of the Apostles in general—</p>
          <p>
            They had no expectation that their Lord and Master would rise again:
            and when they were informed that he was risen, they knew not how to
            believe it. However, the numerous proofs which they had of it on the
            very day on which he arose, and particularly his presence with them
            all on the close of that day, convinced them fully that he was
            indeed risen, and that the same body which had been crucified was
            restored to life, Luke 24:39-40. From that time they entertained no
            doubt respecting this fundamental article of their faith. On the
            contrary, as soon as ever the Holy Spirit had descended on them on
            the day of Pentecost, they spoke of it with great boldness, and
            urged it as a decisive proof that Jesus was the true Messiah. In
            this testimony they all concurred; nor could the most cruel threats
            or persecutions at all abate their confidence in maintaining it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having themselves had such abundant opportunities of ascertaining
            the truth of his resurrection during the forty days that he
            continued upon earth, they were ready to seal their testimony with
            their own blood, and did actually lay down their lives in
            confirmation of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            To this conduct they had no temptation whatever; for they knew that
            nothing but trials and persecutions, imprisonments and death, would
            be their portion in this world. With what confidence they themselves
            relied upon this truth, may be seen from their writings, Acts 1:3;
            Acts 10:41. 1 Corinthians 15:3-8. 1 John 1:1-3; and, if we receive
            not their testimony, there must be an end of all testimony whatever;
            since nothing ever was, or can be, so incontrovertibly established,
            as this fact.
          </p>
          <p>2. The testimony of Thomas in particular—</p>
          <p>
            His doubts might seem to justify a suspicion of the veracity, or at
            least of the judgment, of all the other Apostles: but it rather adds
            weight to their testimony; since it shows his absolute determination
            never to acknowledge that fact to have taken place, until it would
            be proved to him by such evidence as it would be impossible to
            withstand. Indeed the proof which he required was most unreasonable;
            for, if our Lord was to submit his wounds to be inspected by all
            mankind, in order to gain their assent to the truth of his
            resurrection, he could never go up to Heaven at all, but continue on
            earth to the very end of the world, in order that every person in
            every successive generation might have the evidence here required.
            For, if Thomas could not credit the other Apostles who had touched
            and handled their Lord&#x27;s body, why would he expect others to
            credit him? And why would not every one to the end of time demand
            for himself the same evidence that he did? But our Lord was pleased
            to gratify his unreasonable desire; and by thus extorting from him
            an acknowledgment of his resurrection, he has given to the world
            such a proof of it as incredulity itself can now no longer
            withstand.
          </p>
          <p>Thomas, overcome by this evidence, shows in his acknowledgment,</p>
          <h2>II. The faith it should produce in us—</h2>
          <p>
            It is not an assent to the mere fact of Christ&#x27;s resurrection
            that is required of us, but,
          </p>
          <p>
            1. An assent to all those truths which the resurrection of Christ
            was intended to confirm—
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Lord referred men to his resurrection as the proof of his
            Messiahship, and as the evidence that the religion which he
            established was of God. Accordingly, we must consider every word of
            Christ as confirmed beyond all doubt, the very moment we acknowledge
            the truth of his resurrection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The divinity of his person, as &quot;Emmanuel, God with us;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            the nature of his death, as &quot;a atoning sacrifice for the sins
            of the world;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>the certainty of acceptance to all that would believe in him;</p>
          <p>together with the whole plan of the Gospel salvation;</p>
          <p>
            must be regarded as inseparably connected with that event, and
            infallibly established by it.
          </p>
          <p>2. A cordial approbation of them—</p>
          <p>
            To suppose that the words of Thomas were a mere exclamation, only
            shows to what miserable shifts Socinians are reduced, in order to
            maintain their views of Christianity. For, not to mention that such
            a horrible profanation of God&#x27;s holy name could not be supposed
            to issue from an Apostle, in the very presence of his Lord, under
            such peculiar circumstances, we are expressly told that Thomas
            addressed those words to our Lord himself; and consequently they can
            be interpreted in no other way than an acknowledgment of Christ as
            &quot;his Lord and his God.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we may observe, that Thomas does not merely acknowledge Christ
            from the conviction of his mind, in the same way as the worshipers
            of Baal acknowledged the supremacy of Jehovah, &quot;The Lord, He is
            the God; the Lord, He is the God! 1 Kings 18:39;&quot; but with most
            affectionate endearment claims him as his Lord, and his God. Thus
            must we do: we must receive him as our God and Savior, determining:
          </p>
          <p>to rely on him alone,</p>
          <p>to confess him before the whole world,</p>
          <p>to consecrate to him all our powers both of body and soul,</p>
          <p>
            to glory in him as &quot;all our salvation and all our desire.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The language of our hearts must be, &quot;Whom have I in Heaven but
            you? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides you! Song of
            Solomon 5:16. Psalm 73:25.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>From a more particular view of this narrative, we may learn—</p>
          <h2>1. The evil of unbelief—</h2>
          <p>
            Infidels pretend that their doubts arise from a lack of evidence:
            but they in reality arise from an indisposition of heart to weigh
            with fairness the evidence before them. This was the fault which
            Thomas now committed. He did not dispassionately consider the
            testimony of the other Apostles, but determinately set himself
            against it; and would admit of no proof, except such as he himself
            would presume to dictate. Justly might he have been left for ever to
            perish in his unbelief, because he would not receive a testimony
            that was decisive of the point.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is precisely thus also with nominal Christians, who, while they
            admit the truth of Christianity in general, deny every truth that
            presses on their consciences, and will receive nothing that does not
            accord with their own preconceived notions. But, as those who came
            out of Egypt, as the Lord&#x27;s people, perished in the wilderness
            through their unbelief, so will these never enter into the heavenly
            Canaan, unless they receive, and act upon, the whole &quot;truth as
            it is in Christ Jesus.&quot; There is quite evidence enough to
            satisfy the humble inquirer: there is no real ground for doubt,
            either respecting the way of salvation through a crucified Redeemer,
            or respecting that holiness of heart and life which he requires. If
            men will not &quot;receive the truth in the love of it,&quot; they
            must expect that &quot;God will give them up to believe a lie,&quot;
            to the everlasting ruin of their souls! 2 Thessalonians 2:11-12.
          </p>
          <h2>2. The folly of neglecting ordinances—</h2>
          <p>
            Thomas was not with the other Apostles on the evening when our Lord
            first appeared to them; if he had been, there is reason to suppose
            that he would have been satisfied of the truth of Christ&#x27;s
            resurrection, as well as they. But, through his absence, he lost
            that opportunity of beholding his risen Lord; and thus continued in
            a state of anxious suspense for a whole week, after the rest were
            &quot;filled with joy and peace in believing.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            As we know not the reason of his absence, we do not condemn him for
            it: but his loss was the same, by whatever it might be occasioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have not many of us suffered loss through our absence from the house
            of God, or the neglect of private ordinances? It is highly probable
            that the doubts and fears of many are to be traced to this source:
            they live without the light of God&#x27;s countenance, because they
            are not careful &quot;to walk with God:&quot; they neglect him; and
            then he hides himself from them, 2 Chronicles 15:2. We can scarcely
            doubt but that all of us might have enjoyed far richer
            manifestations of the Savior&#x27;s love, if we had been more
            diligent and watchful in our performance of religious duties.
            &quot;Let us not then forsake the assembling of ourselves together,
            as the manner of some is,&quot; or intermit our exertions in our
            secret chamber: but, if we would even wait without a blessing as
            long as the cripple waited at Bethesda&#x27;s pool, let us at least
            secure this consolation, that we have not lost it through our own
            neglect; and expect assuredly, that, if we are &quot;steadfast and
            immoveable in waiting upon God, our labor shall not be in vain in
            the Lord.&quot;
          </p>
          <h2>3. The wonderful condescension of the Lord Jesus—</h2>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding the obstinate unbelief of Thomas, our Lord did not
            cast him off, but even appeared a second time to his disciples, on
            purpose to grant him the evidence he desired. What amazing
            condescension was this! Yet it is precisely such as all of us
            experience at his hands. &quot;He is not extreme to mark what is
            done amiss&quot; by any of us. He bears with our infirmities,
            &quot;not breaking the bruised reed nor quenching the smoking flax,
            but bringing forth judgment unto truth.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            We, alas! are too often unreasonably dictating to him, when we
            should rather be meekly submitting to his providence and grace: we
            refuse to rest upon his promises, unless they be applied to us in
            such a particular way, or we are enabled to find in ourselves some
            particular warrant for our faith. But we should take his promises
            simply as they are given; and expect the accomplishment of them, not
            because we are worthy, but &quot;because He is faithful who has
            promised.&quot; We do not mean that we are to expect him to save us
            while we are living in sin; for he has not anywhere promised any
            such thing: but we would have all to &quot;walk by faith, and not by
            sight;&quot; for it is still as true as ever, that &quot;blessed are
            they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p><em>The Use and Intent of Our Lord&#x27;s Miracles</em></p>
          <p>
            &quot;Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his
            disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are
            written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
            God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.&quot; -
            John 20:30-31.
          </p>
          <p>
            THOUGH the miracles which are recorded in the Gospel are very
            numerous—yet are they few in comparison with those which were
            wrought by our blessed Lord. If all that he performed were
            distinctly related with all their attendant circumstances, John
            tells us, in the hyperbolical language of the east, that the whole
            world would scarcely be able to contain the books that would be
            written, John 21:25. Some however are transmitted to posterity as a
            specimen of the rest, in order that we may be assured of
            Christ&#x27;s divine mission, and be led to believe in him to the
            salvation of our souls.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evangelist, stating both the immediate and the ultimate end for
            which his Gospel was written, declares, that the assuring us of
            Christ&#x27;s divine mission was,
          </p>
          <h2>I. The immediate end—</h2>
          <p>
            Our blessed Lord declared himself to be &quot;the Christ, the Son of
            God&quot;—
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not in the character of a common prophet that our Lord
            appeared; he assumed to himself titles to which no human being had
            aspired, and declared himself to be the Son of God, the incarnate
            Deity, the Savior of the world. His enemies themselves accused him
            of affecting equality with God: and finding, from the very defense
            that he made, that they were right in their conjecture, they again
            sought to put him to death as a blasphemer, John 5:18; John 10:33;
            John 10:37-39.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the conviction of the people of that day he wrought unnumbered
            miracles—
          </p>
          <p>
            Miracles are works contrary to the common course of nature, works
            which God alone is able to perform. Hence, when wrought in
            confirmation of any point, they are justly considered as
            authenticating that which they are intended to support; because they
            prove a divine concurrence; and we cannot suppose that God would
            enable any man to work miracles merely to establish falsehood, and
            to deceive his people.
          </p>
          <p>
            There have indeed been sorceries and enchantments practiced, perhaps
            also miracles, in support of error, Exodus 7:10-11. But, in the case
            alluded to, God allowed Satan to exercise extraordinary powers in
            order to harden him who obstinately opposed his will, and to confirm
            him in the delusions which he had chosen for himself, Isaiah, 66:4.
            Psalm 9:16. Exodus 7:3; Exodus 7:13-14.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet in those instances did he give abundant proof of his own
            superiority, and leave the confounded monarch without excuse.
            Aaron&#x27;s rod swallowed up all the rods of the sorcerers, Exodus
            7:12. The sorcerers were permitted to bring calamities on the land,
            but not to remove them, Exodus 7:21-22; Exodus 8:6-7. And they
            themselves were constrained to acknowledge a divine power working by
            Moses and Aaron, when they could no longer imitate the miracles
            wrought by them, Exodus 8:18-19.
          </p>
          <p>
            That the miracles which Jesus did were intended to convince the Jews
            of his Divine mission, and that they were sufficient for that end,
            is manifest from the appeal which he himself repeatedly made to them
            in this very view, John 5:36; John 14:11. The completion of prophecy
            was indeed a decisive proof of his Messiahship to those who could
            compare the prophecies with the outcomes; but that was a long and
            arduous process; a work which but few were competent to undertake.
            Whereas the working of miracles afforded a short, compendious, and
            incontestible evidence to the eyes of all who beheld them.
          </p>
          <p>For the conviction of future ages these miracles were recorded—</p>
          <p>
            If there had been no written documents of the things that were
            transacted, we could not have been sure that our information
            respecting them was correct; seeing that many variations must
            inevitably happen in traditions handed down through so many
            succeeding ages. But when the miracles of our Lord were recorded by
            persons who were eye-witnesses of the same, and these records were
            speedily circulated among myriads who also had been spectators of
            them; and when in these very writings an appeal was made to the
            bitterest enemies of our Lord, who would have been glad enough to
            contradict the assertions of the Evangelists on a supposition that
            they could have been disproved; these records come down to us with
            an evidence not at all inferior to ocular demonstration: and if any
            man rejects the testimony which is thus sanctioned both by friends
            and enemies, he is willfully blind, and would reject any other
            evidence that could be given to him, Luke 16:31.
          </p>
          <p>
            But though this was the immediate intent of these written memorials,
            the salvation of our souls was,
          </p>
          <h2>II. The ultimate end—</h2>
          <p>
            Merely to prove to us that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God,
            would have been a fruitless task—unless our believing of that record
            would conduce to our benefit. But the Apostle knew that our whole
            salvation depends upon it; and therefore, in transmitting an account
            of our Savior&#x27;s miracles, he sought to bring us to the
            enjoyment of life:
          </p>
          <p>1. Of spiritual life—</p>
          <p>
            The unbeliever is &quot;dead in trespasses and sins, Ephesians
            2:1;&quot; he is as incapable of spiritual exertion, as dry bones
            that have been entombed for many years, are of exercising the
            functions belonging to the body, Ezekiel 37:4. Nor is it by working,
            that he is to obtain life (for he must have life before he can work
            aright) but by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ. By believing, he
            becomes united to Christ, as a scion that is grafted into a new
            stock; and he derives life from him, as a branch does from the tree,
            or as a member from the head, 1 Corinthians 6:17. Ephesians 4:15-16.
            No sooner is that union formed, than he becomes a new creature, 2
            Corinthians 5:17; &quot;he has passed from death unto life, John
            5:24;&quot; and is &quot;purged from dead works to serve the living
            God.&quot; For the sake of Christ he is made &quot;a partaker of the
            Divine nature, 2 Peter 1:4;&quot; &quot;Christ himself lives in
            him,&quot; and &quot;is that very life whereby he is enabled to live
            to God, Galatians 2:20. Colossians 3:4.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>2. Of eternal life—</p>
          <p>
            The life begun on earth, is not like the natural life that shall
            soon expire; it is an incorruptible seed, an immortal principle,
            which, when watered and invigorated by continued supplies of grace,
            shall flourish in Heaven for evermore. The soul that is quickened by
            faith in the Lord Jesus, has also its iniquities forgiven. It stands
            immediately in the nearest relation to the Deity. The believer is a
            child of God, an heir of God, a joint-heir with Christ, John 1:12. A
            throne is prepared for him in Heaven: and, on his dismissal from the
            body, he shall be exalted to an eternal participation of the Divine
            glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now this is the object which the Evangelists had in view, when they
            recorded the miracles of our Lord. They endeavored to convince us
            that Jesus was the Christ; yet not merely to extort from us a
            speculative assent to this truth, but to make us rely on him as our
            Savior, that we might experience the true &quot;end of our faith,
            even the salvation of our souls.&quot; This was an end worthy of the
            inspired writers, an end, which has in myriads of instances already
            been accomplished, though its success hitherto has been only as the
            drop before the shower.
          </p>
          <h2>INFERENCES—</h2>
          <h2>1. How should we value the Holy Scriptures!</h2>
          <p>
            All the books that ever were written are of no value, when compared
            with the sacred volume. In the Scriptures, we not only think, but
            know, that we have eternal life, John 5:39. They testify of Christ;
            they declare him to be:
          </p>
          <p>our incarnate God,</p>
          <p>our all-sufficient sin-atoning sacrifice,</p>
          <p>our ever-living advocate,</p>
          <p>our Almighty friend.</p>
          <p>
            He is no longer sojourning with us on earth; but we may see him,
            hear him, converse with him, and enjoy the most intimate fellowship
            with him, in his word. In that word we may find abundance:
          </p>
          <p>to confirm our faith,</p>
          <p>to enliven our hope,</p>
          <p>to direct our feet,</p>
          <p>to answer every purpose which our hearts can wish.</p>
          <p>
            Let us then &quot;search the Scriptures:&quot; let our meditation be
            upon them: let them be &quot;sweeter to us than honey and the
            honey-comb:&quot; let them be &quot;esteemed by us more than our
            necessary food.&quot;
          </p>
          <h2>2. How careful should we be to exercise faith in Christ!</h2>
          <p>
            All our knowledge even of the Scriptures themselves will be of
            little use to us, unless we are possessed of a living faith: they
            will indeed &quot;make us wise unto salvation;&quot; but then it is
            &quot;through faith in Christ Jesus, 2 Timothy 3:15.&quot; More can
            not be said, and less must not, respecting the excellency of faith,
            than what is spoken in the words of our text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything relating to spiritual or eternal life must be received by
            faith, and maintained by faith. In Heaven this principle will be
            superseded; but until we arrive at those happy mansions, we must
            &quot;walk by faith,&quot; and &quot;live altogether by faith in the
            Son of God, who loved us, and gave himself for us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us then read the Scriptures, in order to increase and confirm
            our faith: let even the strongest believer improve them to this end,
            1 John 5:13; and in due time he shall be where faith is lost in
            sight, and hope in enjoyment!
