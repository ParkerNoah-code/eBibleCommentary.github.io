        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to recognize the fact that the author of the Gospel of
          John was an eyewitness to the events he records. The author's identity
          as John the apostle, the son of Zebedee, is virtually unainmous in the
          early tradition,<sup>1</sup> and as Criag Keener notes, "there appears
          to be unanimity regarding the authorship of the four Gospels,
          suggesting the traditions are early."<sup>2</sup> The title, “The
          Gospel According to John,” was likely used from the time it began
          being circulated because there are no extant manuscripts with other
          names.<sup>3</sup> If the gospel was originally published anonymously
          as some claim, this is in distinction from the apocryphal gospels
          which were originally published with false names.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal evidence: The “disciple whom Jesus loves” (Jn 13:23; 19:26;
          20:2; 21:20) is “the disciple who testifies about these things, and
          wrote these things.” (Jn 21:24). This disciple “whom Jesus loved, was
          at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast” at the Last Supper (Jn
          13:23). The Synoptics only mention the disciples and Jesus at this
          celebration (Mk 14:12-26; Mat 26:17-30; Lk 22:7-23). He is standing by
          the cross when Jesus says, “Woman, behold your son!” and commissions
          him to care of Mary (Jn 19:27). He is also the one that raced Peter to
          look inside the empty tomb (Jn 20:2-8). It should be clear from these
          verses that the author was not only an eyewitness but one of the
          Twelve. The most notable objection against the internal evidence is
          that John couldn’t have written such fluent Greek, but D. A. Carson
          writes that “the argument no longer stands” pointing out that John had
          years to learn how to write, John's Greek “is not elegant,” and he
          mostly uses the language of the Septuagint, the Greek translation of
          the OT.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          External evidence: There is a strong tradition that the apostle John
          was the author of this Gospel that has been accepted by nearly all
          throughout church history. Irenaeus, in about 180 AD, writes,
          “Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon
          His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at
          Ephesus in Asia” (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Against Heresies</a
          >, 3.1.1). Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp who was a disciple of
          John the apostle, so his testimony is particularly strong. Clement of
          Alexandria (150-215 AD), who's testimony is saved by Eusebius, says,
          "But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external facts had been
          made plain in the Gospel...composed a spiritual Gospel" (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Church History</a
          >, 6.14.7).
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          Since John was undoubtedly the writer of the fourth Gospel, we have an
          upper limit of A. D. 98, for Irenaeus says that John lived to the time
          of Trajan, who began his reign in that year. The testimony of Jerome
          is to the same effect: “The apostle John lived in Asia to the time of
          Trajan, and dying at a great age in the sixty-eighth year of our Lords
          passion, was buried near the city of Ephesus.” The same writer places
          the death of John in A. D. 100.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all probability, John wrote his Gospel several years before his
          death, since its style is that of a matured, but not of an aged
          writer. We may be sure that the apostle did not compose the Gospel
          until after the death of Paul in A. D. 68. Tradition teaches that John
          wrote later than the Synoptics. The congregations of Asia Minor were
          the special charge of the great apostle of the Gentiles, and he never
          makes any mention in his Epistles of Johns being in their midst, nor
          does he send him a single salutation; and when he parted from the
          Ephesian elders, he evidently did not anticipate the coming of an
          apostle among them. Moreover we infer from Jn 21:19 that John knew of
          the manner in which Peter died, and presupposes this knowledge in his
          readers. Therefore it is unlikely that the Gospel was written before
          A. D. 70. John’s utter silence regarding the destruction of the city
          favors the idea that he wrote the Gospel several years after that
          calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important considerations that led many rationalistic critics
          to the conclusion that the fourth Gospel was written in the second
          century, are the following: (1) The theology of the Gospel, especially
          its representation of Christ, is developed to such a degree that it
          points beyond the first and reflects the consciousness of the Church
          of the second century. (2) The Gospel was evidently written under the
          influence of the philosophic and religious tendencies that were
          prevalent in the second century, such as Montanism, Docetism and
          Gnosticism. (3) The great difference between the fourth Gospel and the
          Synoptics appears to be the result of second century cavilling
          respecting the nature of Christ, and of the Paschal controversy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the idea that the Gospel of John is a second century product goes
          counter to both the internal evidence to which we already referred,
          and to the external testimony, which is exceptionally strong and which
          can be traced back to the very beginning of the second century. Some
          of the Epistles of Ignatius show the influence of John’s Christology,
          and the writings of both Papias and Polycarp contain allusions to the
          first Epistle of John, which was evidently written at the same time as
          the Gospel. The latter was in existence, therefore, in the beginning
          of the second century. The theology of the Gospel of John is no more
          developed than that of Paul’s Epistles to the Ephesians and the
          Colossians, that were written between A. D. 61 and 63. Critics
          generally ceased to place any reliance on the so-called Montanistic
          features of the Gospel, and although they still maintain that some
          passages contain traces of a Docetic Gnosticism, these are purely
          imaginary and readily vanish, when the light of exegesis is turned on.
          The connection of the Gospel with the Paschal controversy is now
          admitted to be very dubious. And the difference between it and the
          Synoptics can be satisfactorily explained without regarding it as a
          work of the second century.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospel of John was in all probability written primarily for the
          Christians of Asia Minor, among whom especially the heresy of
          Cerinthus had arisen. Early tradition has it that John wrote it at the
          request of the bishops of Asia to combat that heresy. Internal
          evidence certainly favors the hypothesis that it was composed for
          Greek readers. The author carefully interprets Hebrew and Aramaic
          words, as in Jn 1:38; Jn 1:41-42; Jn 9:7; Jn 11:16; Jn 19:13; Jn
          19:17; Jn 20:16. He makes it a point to explain Jewish customs and
          geographical designations, Jn 1:28; Jn 2:1; Jn 4:4-5; Jn 7:37; Jn
          11:54, . . . Jn 19:31; Jn 19:40; Jn 19:42. Moreover, notwithstanding
          his characteristically Hebrew style, he usually quotes from the
          Septuagint.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          It was not John’s purpose to furnish a supplement to the Synoptics,
          though his Gospel certainly contains a good deal of supplemental
          matter; neither did he mean to produce a direct polemic against the
          Cerinthian heresy, even if this did to a certain degree determine his
          special way of stating the truth. He did not aim at conciliating the
          discordant parties of the second century by leading them up to a
          higher unity, as the Tubingen school asserted; nor at refuting “Jewish
          objections and invectives,” and at providing “his fellow-Christians
          with weapons ready to hand ;” a hypothesis of which Wrede asserts:
          “This view is on the whole a recent one, but it is making victorious
          progress among scholars.” The Origin of the New Testament, p. 84.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle himself gives expression to his purpose, when he says:
          “These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the
          Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life in his
          name,” Jn 20:31. His aim is twofold, therefore, theoretical and
          practical. He desires to prove that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
          God, and to lead believers to a life of blessed communion with him.
          The means he employs to that end are: (1) The miracles of the Lord, on
          which special emphasis is placed, cf. Jn 20:30; Jn 21:25; and which
          are contemplated as σημεῖα, as signs of the divine glory of Christ.
          (2) The long discourses of the Saviour, which serve to interpret his
          signs and to describe the unique relation in which He stands to the
          Father. And (3) the narratives touching Jesus dealing with
          individuals, such as Nathaniel, Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman,
          Philip, Mary Magdalena and Thomas, showing, how He led them to faith,
          a faith culminating in the confession of Thomas: “My Lord and my God.”
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The great significance of this Gospel in Holy Writ is that it places
          prominently before us the Son of Man as the Son of God, as the eternal
          Word that became flesh. According to this Gospel Christ is the Son of
          God, who descended from the Father, stood in a unique relation to the
          Father, had come to do the Father’s will on earth, and would return to
          the glory that He had eternally possessed with the Father, that He
          might send the Holy Spirit from the Father to abide with his Church
          throughout all ages. In that Spirit He himself returns to his
          followers to dwell in them forever. He is the highest revelation of
          God, and our relation to him, either of faith or of unbelief,
          determines our eternal destiny. Before this Christ the Church bows
          down in adoration with Thomas and calls out: “My Lord and my God.”

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          The contents of the Gospel of John can be divided into five parts:
        </p>
        <p>
          The Advent and Incarnation of the Word (1:1-13): This section delves
          into the pre-existence and divine origin of Christ. It elaborates on
          how John the Baptist heralded the arrival of Christ, portraying Him as
          the light of the world. It further emphasizes Christ’s role in
          empowering believers to become children of God, highlighting the
          profound spiritual transition from darkness to light.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incarnate Word as the Only Life of the World (1:14-6:71): This
          extensive section unpacks the combined testimony of John the Baptist
          and the deeds and words of Christ himself. It encompasses several key
          events: the initial testimony of John the Baptist and Christ
          (1:14-51), the cleansing of the temple (2:12-25), the significant
          conversation with Nicodemus (3:1-21), Christ’s public testimony
          (3:22-36), the encounter with the Samaritan woman (4:1-42), the
          healing of the nobleman’s son (4:43-54), the healing of the impotent
          man (5:1-47), and the miracle of the loaves followed by a crucial
          discourse (6:1-71).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incarnate Word in Conflict with Spiritual Darkness (7:1-11:54):
          This part of the Gospel highlights the clash of Christ with the
          prevailing spiritual darkness of his time. Notable incidents include
          Christ’s teachings at the Feast of Tabernacles (7:1-52), the episode
          with the adulterous woman (8:1-59), the healing of the blind man
          combined with the proclamation of being the good shepherd (9:1-41,
          10:1-21), teachings at the Feast of Dedication and the affirmation of
          His unity with the Father (10:22-42), and the raising of Lazarus which
          led to both belief in and opposition against Jesus (11:1-54).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incarnate Word Saving the World through Sacrificial Death
          (11:55-19:42): This segment chronicles the events leading up to and
          including Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. It covers the plot to kill Jesus
          and his anointing by Mary of Bethany (11:55-57, 12:1-50), the Last
          Supper and Jesus&#x27; teachings on servitude and betrayal (13:1-38),
          discourses on his departure and communion with the Father (14:1-31,
          15:1-27, 16:1-33), the intercessory prayer (17:1-26), and the capture,
          trial, and eventual crucifixion of Jesus (18:1-40, 19:1-42).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Incarnate Word Risen (20:1-21:25): The concluding part of the
          Gospel narrates the resurrection of Jesus and his subsequent
          appearances. This includes His appearances to Mary Magdalene and the
          disciples (20:1-31) and the encounter at the Sea of Tiberias where
          Jesus restores Peter and alludes to the future of John, the writer of
          the Gospel (21:1-25).
