        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to recognize the fact that the author of the Gospel of
          John was an eyewitness to the events he records. The author's identity
          as John the apostle, the son of Zebedee, is virtually unainmous in the
          early tradition,<sup>1</sup> and as Criag Keener notes, "there appears
          to be unanimity regarding the authorship of the four Gospels,
          suggesting the traditions are early."<sup>2</sup> The title, “The
          Gospel According to John,” was likely used from the time it began
          being circulated because there are no extant manuscripts with other
          names.<sup>3</sup> If the gospel was originally published anonymously
          as some claim, this is in distinction from the apocryphal gospels
          which were originally published with false names.<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal evidence: The “disciple whom Jesus loves” (Jn 13:23; 19:26;
          20:2; 21:20) is “the disciple who testifies about these things, and
          wrote these things.” (Jn 21:24). This disciple “whom Jesus loved, was
          at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast” at the Last Supper (Jn
          13:23). The Synoptics only mention the disciples and Jesus at this
          celebration (Mk 14:12-26; Mat 26:17-30; Lk 22:7-23). He is standing by
          the cross when Jesus says, “Woman, behold your son!” and commissions
          him to care of Mary (Jn 19:27). He is also the one that raced Peter to
          look inside the empty tomb (Jn 20:2-8). It should be clear from these
          verses that the author was not only an eyewitness but one of the
          Twelve. The most notable objection against the internal evidence is
          that John couldn’t have written such fluent Greek, but D. A. Carson
          writes that “the argument no longer stands” pointing out that John had
          years to learn how to write, John's Greek “is not elegant,” and he
          mostly uses the language of the Septuagint, the Greek translation of
          the OT.<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          External evidence: There is a strong tradition that the apostle John
          was the author of this Gospel that has been accepted by nearly all
          throughout church history. Irenaeus, in about 180 AD, writes,
          “Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon
          His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at
          Ephesus in Asia” (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Against Heresies</a
          >, 3.1.1). Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp who was a disciple of
          John the apostle, so his testimony is particularly strong. Clement of
          Alexandria (150-215 AD), who's testimony is saved by Eusebius, says,
          "But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external facts had been
          made plain in the Gospel...composed a spiritual Gospel" (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Church History</a
          >, 6.14.7).
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          Since John was undoubtedly the writer of the fourth Gospel, we have an
          upper limit of A. D. 98, for Irenaeus says that John lived to the time
          of Trajan, who began his reign in that year. The testimony of Jerome
          is to the same effect: “The apostle John lived in Asia to the time of
          Trajan, and dying at a great age in the sixty-eighth year of our Lords
          passion, was buried near the city of Ephesus.” The same writer places
          the death of John in A. D. 100.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all probability, John wrote his Gospel several years before his
          death, since its style is that of a matured, but not of an aged
          writer. We may be sure that the apostle did not compose the Gospel
          until after the death of Paul in A. D. 68. Tradition teaches that John
          wrote later than the Synoptics. The congregations of Asia Minor were
          the special charge of the great apostle of the Gentiles, and he never
          makes any mention in his Epistles of Johns being in their midst, nor
          does he send him a single salutation; and when he parted from the
          Ephesian elders, he evidently did not anticipate the coming of an
          apostle among them. Moreover we infer from Jn 21:19 that John knew of
          the manner in which Peter died, and presupposes this knowledge in his
          readers. Therefore it is unlikely that the Gospel was written before
          A. D. 70. John’s utter silence regarding the destruction of the city
          favors the idea that he wrote the Gospel several years after that
          calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important considerations that led many rationalistic critics
          to the conclusion that the fourth Gospel was written in the second
          century, are the following: (1) The theology of the Gospel, especially
          its representation of Christ, is developed to such a degree that it
          points beyond the first and reflects the consciousness of the Church
          of the second century. (2) The Gospel was evidently written under the
          influence of the philosophic and religious tendencies that were
          prevalent in the second century, such as Montanism, Docetism and
          Gnosticism. (3) The great difference between the fourth Gospel and the
          Synoptics appears to be the result of second century cavilling
          respecting the nature of Christ, and of the Paschal controversy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the idea that the Gospel of John is a second century product goes
          counter to both the internal evidence to which we already referred,
          and to the external testimony, which is exceptionally strong and which
          can be traced back to the very beginning of the second century. Some
          of the Epistles of Ignatius show the influence of John’s Christology,
          and the writings of both Papias and Polycarp contain allusions to the
          first Epistle of John, which was evidently written at the same time as
          the Gospel. The latter was in existence, therefore, in the beginning
          of the second century. The theology of the Gospel of John is no more
          developed than that of Paul’s Epistles to the Ephesians and the
          Colossians, that were written between A. D. 61 and 63. Critics
          generally ceased to place any reliance on the so-called Montanistic
          features of the Gospel, and although they still maintain that some
          passages contain traces of a Docetic Gnosticism, these are purely
          imaginary and readily vanish, when the light of exegesis is turned on.
          The connection of the Gospel with the Paschal controversy is now
          admitted to be very dubious. And the difference between it and the
          Synoptics can be satisfactorily explained without regarding it as a
          work of the second century.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospel of John was in all probability written primarily for the
          Christians of Asia Minor, among whom especially the heresy of
          Cerinthus had arisen. Early tradition has it that John wrote it at the
          request of the bishops of Asia to combat that heresy. Internal
          evidence certainly favors the hypothesis that it was composed for
          Greek readers. The author carefully interprets Hebrew and Aramaic
          words, as in Jn 1:38; Jn 1:41-42; Jn 9:7; Jn 11:16; Jn 19:13; Jn
          19:17; Jn 20:16. He makes it a point to explain Jewish customs and
          geographical designations, Jn 1:28; Jn 2:1; Jn 4:4-5; Jn 7:37; Jn
          11:54, . . . Jn 19:31; Jn 19:40; Jn 19:42. Moreover, notwithstanding
          his characteristically Hebrew style, he usually quotes from the
          Septuagint.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          It was not John’s purpose to furnish a supplement to the Synoptics,
          though his Gospel certainly contains a good deal of supplemental
          matter; neither did he mean to produce a direct polemic against the
          Cerinthian heresy, even if this did to a certain degree determine his
          special way of stating the truth. He did not aim at conciliating the
          discordant parties of the second century by leading them up to a
          higher unity, as the Tubingen school asserted; nor at refuting “Jewish
          objections and invectives,” and at providing “his fellow-Christians
          with weapons ready to hand ;” a hypothesis of which Wrede asserts:
          “This view is on the whole a recent one, but it is making victorious
          progress among scholars.” The Origin of the New Testament, p. 84.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle himself gives expression to his purpose, when he says:
          “These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the
          Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life in his
          name,” Jn 20:31. His aim is twofold, therefore, theoretical and
          practical. He desires to prove that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
          God, and to lead believers to a life of blessed communion with him.
          The means he employs to that end are: (1) The miracles of the Lord, on
          which special emphasis is placed, cf. Jn 20:30; Jn 21:25; and which
          are contemplated as σημεῖα, as signs of the divine glory of Christ.
          (2) The long discourses of the Saviour, which serve to interpret his
          signs and to describe the unique relation in which He stands to the
          Father. And (3) the narratives touching Jesus dealing with
          individuals, such as Nathaniel, Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman,
          Philip, Mary Magdalena and Thomas, showing, how He led them to faith,
          a faith culminating in the confession of Thomas: “My Lord and my God.”
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The great significance of this Gospel in Holy Writ is that it places
          prominently before us the Son of Man as the Son of God, as the eternal
          Word that became flesh. According to this Gospel Christ is the Son of
          God, who descended from the Father, stood in a unique relation to the
          Father, had come to do the Father’s will on earth, and would return to
          the glory that He had eternally possessed with the Father, that He
          might send the Holy Spirit from the Father to abide with his Church
          throughout all ages. In that Spirit He himself returns to his
          followers to dwell in them forever. He is the highest revelation of
          God, and our relation to him, either of faith or of unbelief,
          determines our eternal destiny. Before this Christ the Church bows
          down in adoration with Thomas and calls out: “My Lord and my God.”
        </p>
        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          The contents of the Gospel of John is also divided into five parts:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The Advent and Incarnation of the Word, Jn 1:1-13. John takes his
          point of departure in the pre-existence and divine origin of Christ,
          and points out that He was heralded by John the Baptist, was the light
          of the world and gave believers the power to become the children of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Incarnate Word the only Life of the World, Jn 1:14-51, Jn
          2:1-25, Jn 3:1-36, Jn 4:1-54, Jn 5:1-47, Jn 6:1-71. The evangelist
          records the testimony to the grace and truth of the incarnate Word
          given by John the Baptist and by Christ himself in word and deed, Jn
          1:14-51, Jn 2:1-11; and the self-revelation of Christ in the cleansing
          of the temple, Jn 2:12-25; in the conversation with Nicodemus, Jn
          3:1-21; followed by the public testimony of Jn 3:22-36; in the
          conversation with the Samaritan woman, Jn 4:1-42; and in the healing
          of the nobleman’s son, Jn 4:43-54. More particularly he shows, how
          Christ reveals himself as the author and sustainer of life in the
          healing of the impotent man and its vindication, Jn 5:1-47; and in the
          miracle of the loaves with the following discourse, leading to
          desertion on the one and to confession on the other hand, Jn 6:1-71.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The Incarnate Word, the Life and Light, in Conflict with
          Spiritual Darkness, Jn 7:1-53, Jn 8:1-59, Jn 9:1-41, Jn 10:1-42, Jn
          11:1-54. On the feast of tabernacles Christ reminds the Jews of the
          fact that He is the life of the world, and presents himself to them as
          the water of life, wherefore officers were sent to take him, Jn
          7:1-52. The following day He brings out the spiritual darkness of the
          Jews in connection with the adulterous woman, and declares that He is
          the light of the world, the only light that can truly enlighten them;
          and that He only could liberate them from their spiritual bondage;
          which leads to an attempt to stone him, Jn 8:1-59. On a subsequent
          occasion He proves himself to be the light of the world by healing the
          blind man and speaks of himself as the good Shepherd that lays down
          his life for his sheep; thereby provoking unbelief and rage, Jn
          9:1-41, Jn 10:1-21. At the feast of the dedication He declares that He
          and the Father are one, which again leads to an attempt to stone him,
          Jn 10:22-42. In raising Lazarus Jesus presents himself as the
          resurrection and the life, thus leading some of the people to believe
          in him, but his enemies to the settled purpose to kill him, Jn
          11:1-54.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Incarnate Word saving the Life of the World through his
          Sacrificial Death, Jn 11:55-57, Jn 12:1-50, Jn 13:1-38, Jn 14:1-31, Jn
          15:1-27, Jn 16:1-33, Jn 17:1-26, Jn 18:1-40, Jn 19:1-42. The enemies
          plan to kill Jesus, but Mary of Bethany anoints him and the people
          meet him with glad hosannas; the Greeks seek him at Jerusalem, but the
          multitude turns from him in unbelief, Jn 11:55-57, Jn 12:1-50. He sits
          at the Paschal supper with his disciples, gives them a lesson in
          humble service, exposes the traitor and announces that the time has
          now come to leave his disciples, Jn 13:1-38. He discourses on the
          significance of his departure and on the new life in communion with
          the Father, Jn 14:1-31, Jn 15:1-27, Jn 16:1-33; and offers the
          intercessory prayer committing his followers to the Father, Jn
          17:1-26. In Gethsemane He is taken captive, and after a preliminary
          hearing before the high priest is brought before Pilate who, though
          finding no guilt in Jesus, yet delivers him into the hands of the Jews
          to be crucified, Jn 18:1-16. After his crucifixion He is buried by
          Joseph and Nicodemus, Jn 19:17-42.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The Incarnate Word, risen from the Dead, the Saviour and Lord of
          all Believers, Jn 20:1-31, Jn 21:1-25. Having risen from the dead,
          Jesus appears to Mary Magdalena and on two successive Lords days to
          his disciples, Jn 20:1-31. Later He is seen by some of his disciples
          at the sea of Tiberias, where He restores Peter and points
          significantly to the career of John, the writer of the Gospel, Jn
          21:1-25.
