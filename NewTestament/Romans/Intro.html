        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Paul, the author, was a Hebrew by descent, a native of Tarsus in
          Cilicia, and educated by Gamaliel, the great Pharisaic teacher. He was
          one of the most unmerciful persecutors of the early Christians, but
          was converted by the sudden appearance to him of the risen Lord. He
          began preaching at Damascus, but on account of persecution went into
          Arabia. Returning from Arabia he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and
          then went to Cilicia, where he doubtless did evangelistic work until
          Barnabas sought him at Tarsus and brought him to Antioch, where he
          worked a year with Barnabas. After this they went up to Jerusalem with
          contributions for the brethren. Upon return to Antioch he was called
          by the Holy Ghost to mission work in which he continued till his
          death, making at least three great missionary journeys, during which
          and afterward he suffered "one long martyrdom" till his death.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>Paul's epistles are commonly put into four groups as follows:</p>
        <p>
          (1) The Eschatological group, or those dealing with the second coming
          of Christ. These are I. and II. Thessalonians and were written from
          Corinth about 62 to 63 A. D.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The Anti-Judaic group, or those growing out of controversy with
          Judaistic teachers. They are I. Corinthians. II. Corinthians,
          Galatians and Romans, written during the third Missionary journey,
          probably at Ephesus, Philippi, and Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The Christological group, which center their teachings around the
          character and work of Jesus, and were written during the imprisonment
          at Rome. They are Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and
          Hebrews (many think Paul did not write Hebrews).
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The Pastoral Group, or those written to young preachers touching
          matters of church organization and government and practical
          instructions concerning evangelists, pastors, and other Christian
          workers. They are 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romans falls into the Anti-Judaic group and was likely written from
          Corinth which makes the date circa 58 A. D.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Church at Rome was doubtless in a very prosperous condition the
          time of Paul's writing. It was perhaps organized by some Jews heard
          and believed while at Jerusalem, probably on the day of Pentecost.
          While its membership included both Jews and Gentiles (1:6- 13; 7:1),
          it was regarded by Paul as especially a Gentile church (1:3-7; 13-15).
        </p>
        <p>
          He had never been there up to this time (1:11, 13, 15) and it is not
          likely that any other apostles had been there. For then Paul would
          have not have been planning to go since his rule was not to go where
          another had worked (15:20; 2 Cor. 10:14-16). This strikes a heavy blow
          at Catholicism, claiming that Peter was first bishop of Rome. If Paul
          would not have followed him, then Peter had not been there, and the
          most important test of papacy is overthrown. Paul had, however, many
          intimate friends and acquaintances at Rome, many of whom were
          mentioned in chapter 16. Among them were his old friends, Aquila and
          Priscilia.
        </p>
        <h2>Occasion</h2>
        <p>
          It is impossible to speak with absolute certainly respecting the
          occasion of Paul’s writing this Epistle, although scholars are quite
          well agreed that the apostle found it in the fact that he had finished
          his work in the East and now intended to visit the imperial city, on
          which he had long since cast his eye. Probably an imminent journey of
          Phebe to the capital offered him, on the eve of his departure for
          Jerusalem, the desired opportunity to send his communication to Rome.
        </p>
        <h2>Theme</h2>
        <p>
          The gift of the righteousness of God as our justification which is
          received through faith in Christ (or put simply, justification by
          faith).
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          If the question is asked, why the apostle wrote this letter to the
          Romans, why he gave it the particular character that it has, we find
          that there is a great variety of opinions. Some regard the Epistle as
          historical and occasional; others, as dogmatic and absolute. There are
          those who hold that the particular form of the letter was determined
          by the condition of the readers; and those that would make it
          dependent on the state of Paul’s mind. Some believe that the apostle
          in writing it had in mind his Gentile readers, while others hold that
          he had special reference to the Jewish constituents of the church at
          Rome. The different theories respecting the purpose of the letter may
          be reduced to three.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          It is the most systematic of all the writings of Paul, containing a
          profound and comprehensive statement of the way of salvation, a
          statement made with special reference to the legalistically inclined
          Romans. That salvation can be had through faith only, and not by the
          works of the law, not by one’s works of morality, on which the man of
          the Roman type was inclined to place his reliance, is at once the
          great central doctrine of this epistle and its permanent lesson for
          all ages.
        </p>
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          Touching the integrity of the Epistle to the Romans two questions have
          arisen:1. Is the doxology, Rom_16:25-27, in the right place, or does
          it belong between Rom_14:23 to Rom_15:1, or is it spurious? And 2. Are
          Rom_15:1-33 and Rom_16:1-27 genuine or spurious?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The place of the doxology at the end of Rom_16:1-27 was doubted as
          early as the days of Origen. External testimony favors it, since it is
          found there in most of the MSS, while some have it at the end of
          Rom_14:1-23, and a few, in both places. Zahn is of the opinion,
          however, that internal evidence decidedly favors placing it at the end
          of Rom_14:1-23, because: (1) Paul’s letters are often interspersed
          with doxologies, but never end with them. (2) It seems unlikely that
          Paul should add a doxology, closely connected with the body of the
          letter, after a list of personal greetings not so connected with it.
          (3) The doxology is closely related to the subject-matter of Rom_14:23
          and Rom_15:1. (4) It is far harder to explain its transfer from
          Rom_16:1-27 chapter to Rom_14:1-23 than the reverse. Einl. I p. 268
          ff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, as Davidson and Baljon, doubt the genuineness of the doxology,
          but: (1) It is found in all the MSS. (2) The thought expressed in it
          is too rich and varied to be an interpolation. (3) No possible motive
          can be found for forging such a doxology.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Rom_15:1-33 is regarded by some as spurious, (1) because it is not
          found in the canon of Marcion; and (2) since the appellative applied
          to Christ in Rom_15:8 is considered very strange as coming from Paul;
          the expression in Rom_15:19 is not characterized by the usual Pauline
          modesty; and the Rom_15:24, Rom_15:28-29 are held to be in conflict
          with Rom_1:10-15, because they imply that Paul merely desired to pay a
          short visit to Rome, when he was on his way to Spain. But the first
          argument has little weight, since Marcion omits many other parts of
          the New Testament, and several that are generally admitted to be
          genuine; and the difficulties mentioned under (2) easily yield to
          exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          A far greater number of scholars reject Rom_16:1-27, (1) because
          Marcions canon does not contain it; (2) since it is contrary to the
          apostles custom to end his letters with so many greetings; and (3)
          because Paul was not in a position to know so many persons at Rome. To
          the first argument we need not reply again (cf. above); and as far as
          the greetings are concerned, it may be that Paul intentionally greeted
          so many persons at Rome to bring out clearly that, though he had not
          founded the church there, he was not a stranger to it, and to
          cultivate a certain familiarity. It deserves our attention that the
          only other Epistle in which we find a list of greetings is that to the
          Colossian church, which was like the church of Rome, in that it was
          not founded by the apostle. And taking in consideration the extensive
          travels of Paul in the East, and the constant movement of people in
          all parts of the empire to and from Rome, it causes no surprise that
          so many of the apostles acquaintances were in the capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some who doubt the destination rather than the genuineness of this
          chapter surmise that it or a part of it originally constituted an
          epistle, or a fragment of one, that was addressed to the Ephesians.
          They point out that Phebe would be more likely to journey to Ephesus
          than to Rome; that, in view of what is said in Act_18:19; 1Co_16:19;
          2Ti_4:19, there is a greater probability that Aquila and Priscilla
          were at Ephesus than in the imperial city; and that Epenetus is called
          “the first-fruits of Achaia unto Christ, Rom_16:5. But none of these
          proofs are conclusive. Moreover Dr. Gifford points out in the Speakers
          Commentary that of the twenty-two persons named in Rom_16:6-15, not
          one can be shown to have been at Ephesus; while (1) Urbanus, Rufus,
          Ampliatus, Julia and Junia are specifically Roman names; and (2)
          besides the first four of these names, “ten others, Stachys, Apelles,
          Tryphaena, Tryphosa, Hermes, Hernias, Patrobas (or Patrobius),
          Philologus, Julia, Nereus are found in the sepulchral inscriptions on
          the Appian way as the names of persons connected with ‘Ceasars
          household (Php_4:22), and contemporary with St. Paul.”
