        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Paul, the author, was a Hebrew by descent, a native of Tarsus in
          Cilicia, and educated by Gamaliel, the great Pharisaic teacher. He was
          one of the most unmerciful persecutors of the early Christians, but
          was converted by the sudden appearance to him of the risen Lord. He
          began preaching at Damascus, but on account of persecution went into
          Arabia. Returning from Arabia he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and
          then went to Cilicia, where he doubtless did evangelistic work until
          Barnabas sought him at Tarsus and brought him to Antioch, where he
          worked a year with Barnabas. After this they went up to Jerusalem with
          contributions for the brethren. Upon return to Antioch he was called
          by the Holy Ghost to mission work in which he continued till his
          death, making at least three great missionary journeys, during which
          and afterward he suffered "one long martyrdom" till his death.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>Paul's epistles are commonly put into four groups as follows:</p>
        <p>
          (1) The Eschatological group, or those dealing with the second coming
          of Christ. These are I. and II. Thessalonians and were written from
          Corinth about 62 to 63 A. D.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The Anti-Judaic group, or those growing out of controversy with
          Judaistic teachers. They are I. Corinthians. II. Corinthians,
          Galatians and Romans, written during the third Missionary journey,
          probably at Ephesus, Philippi, and Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The Christological group, which center their teachings around the
          character and work of Jesus, and were written during the imprisonment
          at Rome. They are Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and
          Hebrews (many think Paul did not write Hebrews).
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The Pastoral Group, or those written to young preachers touching
          matters of church organization and government and practical
          instructions concerning evangelists, pastors, and other Christian
          workers. They are 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romans falls into the Anti-Judaic group and was likely written from
          Corinth which makes the date circa 58 A. D.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Church at Rome was doubtless in a very prosperous condition the
          time of Paul's writing. It was perhaps organized by some Jews heard
          and believed while at Jerusalem, probably on the day of Pentecost.
          While its membership included both Jews and Gentiles (1:6- 13; 7:1),
          it was regarded by Paul as especially a Gentile church (1:3-7; 13-15).
        </p>
        <p>
          He had never been there up to this time (1:11, 13, 15) and it is not
          likely that any other apostles had been there. For then Paul would
          have not have been planning to go since his rule was not to go where
          another had worked (15:20; 2 Cor. 10:14-16). This strikes a heavy blow
          at Catholicism, claiming that Peter was first bishop of Rome. If Paul
          would not have followed him, then Peter had not been there, and the
          most important test of papacy is overthrown. Paul had, however, many
          intimate friends and acquaintances at Rome, many of whom were
          mentioned in chapter 16. Among them were his old friends, Aquila and
          Priscilia.
        </p>
        <h2>Occasion</h2>
        <p>
          It is impossible to speak with absolute certainly respecting the
          occasion of Paul’s writing this Epistle, although scholars are quite
          well agreed that the apostle found it in the fact that he had finished
          his work in the East and now intended to visit the imperial city, on
          which he had long since cast his eye. Probably an imminent journey of
          Phebe to the capital offered him, on the eve of his departure for
          Jerusalem, the desired opportunity to send his communication to Rome.
        </p>
        <h2>Theme</h2>
        <p>
          The gift of the righteousness of God as our justification which is
          received through faith in Christ (or put simply, justification by
          faith).
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          If the question is asked, why the apostle wrote this letter to the
          Romans, why he gave it the particular character that it has, we find
          that there is a great variety of opinions. Some regard the Epistle as
          historical and occasional; others, as dogmatic and absolute. There are
          those who hold that the particular form of the letter was determined
          by the condition of the readers; and those that would make it
          dependent on the state of Paul’s mind. Some believe that the apostle
          in writing it had in mind his Gentile readers, while others hold that
          he had special reference to the Jewish constituents of the church at
          Rome. The different theories respecting the purpose of the letter may
          be reduced to three.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          It is the most systematic of all the writings of Paul, containing a
          profound and comprehensive statement of the way of salvation, a
          statement made with special reference to the legalistically inclined
          Romans. That salvation can be had through faith only, and not by the
          works of the law, not by one’s works of morality, on which the man of
          the Roman type was inclined to place his reliance, is at once the
          great central doctrine of this epistle and its permanent lesson for
          all ages.
