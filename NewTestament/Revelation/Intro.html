        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, the author is identified as John the Apostle, the son
          of Zebedee. This attribution is supported by early Christian
          testimonies and internal textual clues.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse, is widely
          believed to have been written in the late first century, around 95 AD.
          This dating is based on historical and textual evidence suggesting it
          was composed during the reign of Emperor Domitian, a period marked by
          significant persecution of Christians. Irenaeous records that "him who
          beheld the apocalyptic vision" saw it "almost in our day, towards the
          end of Domitian's reign."<sup>1</sup>
          Sweet provides a balanced conclusion: "To sum up, the earlier date
          <em>may</em> be right, but the internal evidence is not sufficient to
          outweigh the firm tradition stemming from Irenaeus."<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          "This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to
          his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made
          known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God's word
          of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.
          Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy,
          and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is near."
          (Rev. 1:1-3). The primary purpose of Revelation is to provide hope and
          encouragement to Christians facing persecution, by affirming God's
          ultimate sovereignty and the eventual triumph of good over evil.
          Revelation calls followers of Jesus to resist idolatry, to worship God
          alone, and to patiently endure suffering knowing that God will
          ultimately judge evil and redeem creation.
        </p>
        <h2>Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
          There are four main problems to work through when it comes to
          interpreting Revelation aright: What do the symbols represent? What is
          the structure of the book? How does John make use of the OT? Which
          school of thought, historicist, preterist, idealist, or futurist,
          should we follow?
        </p>
        <h2>Symbolism</h2>
        <p>
          Revelation is rich in symbolic and allegorical imagery, drawing
          extensively on Old Testament motifs. The symbols represent various
          spiritual and historical realities, often conveying messages about the
          struggle between God and evil, the perseverance of the faithful, and
          the final judgment and redemption of creation. The use of symbols was
          also a way to communicate messages covertly in a time of persecution.
        </p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The structure of Revelation is both linear and cyclical, containing a
          series of seven visions that John records. The structure of Revelation
          incorporates imagery and themes from Old Testament prophetic books
          like Daniel, Ezekiel, and Zechariah. John creatively weaves these
          allusions to Israel’s Scriptures to craft a rich tapestry of poetry,
          prophecy, and apocalyptic literature that points to Jesus as the
          fulfillment of all God’s promises. The structure is designed to convey
          a sense of unfolding divine revelation.
        </p>
        <h2>Old Testament</h2>
        <p>
          John heavily references and alludes to the Old Testament, using its
          imagery, language, and themes. This not only roots Revelation in the
          Jewish prophetic tradition but also provides a rich interpretive
          context for understanding its symbolism and message. The Old Testament
          should be the primary means for interpreting Revelation.
        </p>
        <h2>School's of Thought</h2>
        <p>
          Revelation is a timeless depiction of the cosmic struggle between good
          and evil, rather than a linear prediction of future events. This
          idealist perspective focuses on the theological and spiritual truths
          of the book, applicable to all Christians across time, rather than
          tying its fulfillment to specific historical events or future
          predictions. This contrasts with the historicist, preterist, and
          futurist schools of thought, which interpret Revelation as primarily
          relating to specific historical events, first-century occurrences, or
          future prophetic fulfillment, respectively.
