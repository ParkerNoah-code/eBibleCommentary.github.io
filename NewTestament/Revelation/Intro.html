        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, the author is identified as John the Apostle, the son
          of Zebedee. This attribution is supported by early Christian
          testimonies and internal textual clues.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse, is widely
          believed to have been written in the late first century, around 95 AD.
          This dating is based on historical and textual evidence suggesting it
          was composed during the reign of Emperor Domitian, a period marked by
          significant persecution of Christians. Irenaeous records that "him who
          beheld the apocalyptic vision" saw it "almost in our day, towards the
          end of Domitian's reign."<sup>1</sup>
          Sweet concludes that "the earlier date
          <em>may</em> be right, but the internal evidence is not sufficient to
          outweigh the firm tradition stemming from Irenaeus."<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          "This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to
          his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made
          known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God's word
          of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.
          Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy,
          and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is near."
          (Rev. 1:1-3). The primary purpose of Revelation is to provide hope and
          encouragement to Christians facing persecution by affirming God's
          ultimate sovereignty and the eventual triumph of good over evil.
          Revelation calls followers of Jesus to resist idolatry, to worship God
          alone, and to patiently endure suffering knowing that God will
          ultimately judge evil and redeem creation.
