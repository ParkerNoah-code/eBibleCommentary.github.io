        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, the author is identified as John the Apostle, the son
          of Zebedee. This attribution is supported by early Christian
          testimonies and internal textual clues.
        </p>

        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          The Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse, is widely
          believed to have been written in the late first century, around 95 AD.
          This dating is based on historical and textual evidence suggesting it
          was composed during the reign of Emperor Domitian, a period marked by
          significant persecution of Christians. Irenaeous records that "him who
          beheld the apocalyptic vision" saw it "almost in our day, towards the
          end of Domitian's reign."<sup>1</sup>
          Sweet concludes that "the earlier date
          <em>may</em> be right, but the internal evidence is not sufficient to
          outweigh the firm tradition stemming from Irenaeus."<sup>2</sup>
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          "This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to
          his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made
          known by his angel to his servant, John, who testified to God's word
          of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.
          Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy,
          and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is near."
          (Rev. 1:1-3). The primary purpose of Revelation is to provide hope and
          encouragement to Christians facing persecution by affirming God's
          ultimate sovereignty and the eventual triumph of good over evil.
          Revelation calls followers of Jesus to resist idolatry, to worship God
          alone, and to patiently endure suffering knowing that God will
          ultimately judge evil and redeem creation.

            >Hermeneutics Needed for Revelation</a
          >: "Hermeneutics provide principles for sound exegesis. Exegesis in
          this case is the application of hermeneutical rules of the sacred text
          in order to obtain its setting, historic context, proper meaning and
          sense. And if ever there is a requirement to do so in such a
          disciplined manner it is this controversial book. Failing to employ
          such a solid structured method of interpretation will bring much
          confusion upon the reader."

            >The Introduction Proper (Revelation)</a
          >: "Hermeneutics is called a science because it follows rules that
          guide and control the interpreter. It is called an art because it
          requires skill and practice to apply the rules correctly as in any
          skill. This is evident in Paul’s words to Timothy and the context for
          the words, “accurately handling the Word of truth” in 2 Timothy 2:15.
          Without an accurate handling of the Bible, we end up with error, not
          truth. We must, then, using the science of hermeneutics, seek to
          ground interpretation in fact or the objective data of
          Scripture—context, grammar, historical setting, meaning and use of
          words, literary style, etc."

          48, New Studies in Biblical Theology (Downers Grove: IVP, 2019), 8:
          "Like Jesus and the Old Testament prophets, Revelation presents its
          message in symbolic, pictorial language to unveil true spiritual
          realities compellingly to those with ears to hear... Jesus Christ
          ‘made known’ or ‘signified’ (<em>sēmainō</em>) the revelation to John
          by sending an angel (Rev. 1:1). Similarly, Daniel 2:30, 45 LXX says
          that the mystery of the king’s dream ‘was shown’ (<em>sēmainō</em>) to
          Daniel and ‘the great God has shown [<em>sēmainō</em>] the king what
          will be at the end of the days’ (NETS)."

            >Revelation: Baker Exegetical Commentary</a
          >, (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2002): "John deliberately uses... made known
          ['the verb cognate of the noun “sign” in john’s Gospel']... in 1:1
          because of its parallels with Dan. 2:28-30, 45, where God 'signifies'
          truths through pictorial or symbolic visions. Thus it means to
          'communicate by symbols' and connotes the need to interpret the
          reality behind the symbol... Symbols are metaphorical utterances that
          are meant to be understood first pictorially and then referentially...
          The sources for interpreting them come from the OT, intertestamental
          literature, and the Greco-Roman world—in other words, in the common
          world of the original readers in the province of Asia."

            The Book of Revelation</a
          >, (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999), 50-52, 56: "Rev. 1:1 introduces the
          book... with the word 'apocalypse'... a clear allusion to Dan. 2...
          The revelation is not abstract but pictorial... Dan. 2:28-30, 45
          indicates that a symbolic vision and its interpretation is going to be
          part of the warp and woof of the means of communication throughout
          Revelation. This conclusion is based on the supposition that John uses
          OT references with significant degrees of awareness of OT context, for
          which I will argue later... [A] number of authors of both popular and
          scholarly commentaries contend that one should interpret literally
          except where one is forced to interpret symbolically by clear
          indications of context... But the results of the analysis above of 1:1
          indicate that... the essence of the book is figurative ['1:12-20 and
          4:1-22:5 at the least']... The OT and Judaism are the primary
          background against which to understand the images and ideas of the
          Apocalypse."

          Vern S. Poythress, The Returning King (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R
          Publishing, 2000), 47: "Some people today come to Revelation with the
          recipe, 'Interpret everything literally, if possible.' That recipe
          misunderstands what kind of book Revelation is. Of course, John
          literally saw what he says he saw. But what he saw was a vision. It
          was filled with symbols, like the Beast of 13:1–8 and the seven
          blazing lamps in 4:5. It never intended to be a direct, nonsymbolical
          description of the future. People living in John’s own time understood
          this matter instinctively, because they recognized that John was
          writing in an 'apocalyptic' manner, a manner already as familiar to
          them as a political cartoon is to us today."

            >Jews And Gentiles in the Ecclesia</a
          >, 25: "Each biblical genre has its own interpretive hermeneutic;
          parables, poetry, and prophecy are all interpreted differently. Unlike
          historical narrative, visions are interpreted symbolically, not
          literally. Jeremiah’s vision of the boiling cauldron (Jer 1:13) had
          nothing to do with food. Ezekiel’s vision of the dry bones (Ezek
          37:1–14) had nothing to do with bones. Zechariah’s vision of the woman
          in the basket (Zech 5:5–11) had nothing to do with women or baskets.
          Amos’ vision of summer fruit (Amos 8) concerned neither summer nor
          fruit. And Peter’s vision had nothing to do with unclean food any more
          than it did with sheets."

          (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1999): "This book contains a series of
          word pictures, as though a number of slides were being shown upon a
          great screen. As we watch we allow ourselves to be carried along by
          impressions created by these pictures. Many of the details of the
          pictures are intended to contribute to the total impression, and are
          not to be isolated and interpreted with wooden literalism."

          response... In reporting his visionary experiences, John frequently
          uses symbolic language. Sometimes he explains the meaning of the
          symbols... [I]n attempting to understand John’s symbolism, we must
          consider not only the book itself but also his use of the Old
          Testament... In any case, it is important to recognize that the
          descriptions

          SBJT 14/1 (Spring 2010) 46-58: "In other words, if Revelation is
          prophetic or apocalyptic, ascribing literalism to its numbers, proper
          nouns, and other images may prevent adjudicating John’s intended
          meaning— the literal sense. A more profitable hermeneutical approach
          is to reverse the interpretive order by placing the symbolic in the
          foreground while shifting the literal into the background."

          (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2001), 4, 11, 13, 22: "Although, as
          we will see, applying the literal-where-possible maxim to prophetic
          literature is problematic, its inadequacy does not mean that
          Revelation is a wax nose, to be manipulated into any shape we
          choose... The literal meaning of symbolic language is the symbolic
          correspondence between the imagery of the language and the referent
          that it describes... We dare not tackle the symbolism of Revelation
          without immersing our minds in the rich imagery of the Old
          Testament... Revelation makes sense only in light of the Old
          Testament. Not only the visions of such prophets as Ezekiel, Daniel,
          and Zechariah but also historical events such as creation, the fall,
          and the exodus provide the symbolic vocabulary for John’s visions."

            >John's Use of the Old Testament in Revelation</a
          >, (England: Sheffield, 1998), 23: "Bauckham observes that John uses
          the Old Testament in a careful and not haphazard way throughout, so
          that an understanding of these Old Testament texts is crucial to the
          interpretation of the Apocalypse at every point along the way and is
          necessary for understanding his literary strategy. Consequently, the
          Old Testament 'forms a body of literature which John expects his
          readers to know and explicitly to recall in detail while reading his
          own work'. Furthermore, a study of Jewish exegetical tradition of
          various Old Testament texts can also shed light on John's own
          understanding of the same texts."
        </p>
        <p>
          Richard Bauckham, Climax of Prophecy, (Edinburgh: T&T, 1993), xi: "It
          is a book designed to be read in constant intertextual relationship
          with the Old Testament. John was writing what he understood to be a
          work of prophetic scripture, the climax of prophetic revelation, which
          gathered up the prophetic meaning of the Old Testament scriptures and
          disclosed the way in which it was being and was to be fulfilled in the
          last days. His work therefore, presupposes and conveys an extensive
          interpretation of large parts of Old Testament prophecy. Allusions are
          meant to recall the Old Testament context, which thereby becomes part
          of the meaning the Apocalypse conveys, and to build up, sometimes by a
          network of allusion to the same Old Testament passage in various parts
          of the Apocalypse, an interpretation of whole passages of Old
          Testament prophecy."

            >Ezekiel in Revelation: Literary and Hermeneutic Aspects</a
          >, 222: "[John's] profound knowledge of the OT in general and of
          Ezekiel in particular, noticed already in the past, is confirmed in
          this study. Our investigations, however, have shown that the depth of
          John's knowledge of the book of Ezekiel is to be perceived not only in
          his heavy use of the materials from Ezekiel, but in his following the
          hermeneutics of the prophet. This aspect of analogy between John and
          Ezekiel, then, confirms what has been observed by Fekkes from the book
          of Revelation, i.e., John, as a Christian, is the heir of the prophets
          of Israel."
