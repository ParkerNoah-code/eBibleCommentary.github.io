        <h2>D. The King Setting Up (Matthew 4:12-25)</h2>

        <h2>
          12.
          <em
            >Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into
            Galilee.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The history is not consecutive, for it was not Matthew’s design to
          make it so. He leaves out much that others record, because not
          suitable for his purpose. Possibly John was put in prison more than
          once. It seems that the imprisonment of John called our Lord away from
          the immediate scene of persecution to the more rustic region of
          Galilee. He became the more publicly active when his forerunner was
          laid aside. As the morning star is hidden, the sun shines out the more
          brightly. His departure was not caused by fear, nor by desire of
          self-pleasing, but He moved under the guidance of the Lord God who
          sent Him.
        </p>

        <h2>
          13-16.
          <em
            >Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the
            sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, that it might be
            fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,<br />
            “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,<br />
            toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,<br />
            Galilee of the Gentiles,<br />
            the people who sat in darkness saw a great light;<br />
            to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,<br />
            to them light has dawned.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Note how the movements of our King are all ordered according to diving
          prophecy. “Leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum” to
          fulfill a passage in the book of Isaiah. There was an ancient program
          which settled from of old the track of His royal progresses. He went
          where the foreknowledge and predestination of Jehovah had declared His
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went, moreover, where He was needed, even to “the borders of
          Zabulon and Nepthalim.” The “real light” encountered the great
          darkness. The far-off ones were visited by Him who gathers together
          the outcasts of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord courts not those who glory in their light, but those who pine
          in their darkness. He comes with heavenly life, not to those who boast
          of their own life and energy, but to those who are under condemnation
          and who feel the shades of death shutting them out from light and
          hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Great light” is a very suggestive figure for the Gospel and “sitting
          in the region and shadow of death” is a very graphic description of
          men bowed under the power of sin and paralyzed by fear of
          condemnation. What a mercy that to those who appear out of the reach
          of the usual means, to those who dwell “by the way of the sea, beyond
          Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,” Jesus comes with power to enlighten
          and quicken!
        </p>
        <p>
          If I feel myself to be an out-of-the-way sinner, Lord, come to me and
          cause me to know that “light is sprung up” even for me!
        </p>

        <h2>
          17.
          <em
            >From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, “Repent! For the
            Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          He continued the warning which John had given, “Repent: for the
          kingdom of heaven is at hand.” The King exceeds his herald, but He
          does not differ from him as to His message. Happy is the preacher
          whose word is such that his Lord can endorse it! Repentance is the
          demand of the Law, of the Gospel, and of John, who was the connecting
          link between the two. Immediate repentance is demanded because the
          theocracy is established. The kingdom demands turning from sin. In
          Christ Jesus, God was about to reign among the sons of men and
          therefore men were to seek peace with Him. How much more ought we to
          repent who live in the midst of that kingdom! What manner of persons
          ought we to be who look for His Second Advent! “The kingdom of heaven
          is at hand,” let us be as men that look for their Lord. O my gracious
          King and Savior, I pray Thee, accept my repentance as to past
          rebellions as a proof of my present loyalty!
        </p>

        <h2>
          18-19.
          <em
            >Walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who is
            called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea;
            for they were fishermen. He said to them, “Come after me, and I will
            make you fishers for men.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our Lord not only preached the kingdom, but He now began to call one
          and another into its service and privilege. He was “walking by the
          sea” and there and then he began His converting, calling, and
          ordaining work. Where He found Himself living, there He put forth His
          power. Our sphere is where we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus had a special eye for fishers. He summoned to His side the
          fishing brothers whom He had chosen from of old. He had previously
          called them by grace and now He calls them into the ministry. They
          were busy in a lawful occupation when He called them to be ministers.
          Our Lord does not call idlers but fishers. His word was
          imperial—“Follow me.” His work was appropriate to their occupation as
          fishers. It was full of royal promise—“I will make you fishers of men”
          and it was eminently instructive, for an evangelist and a fisher have
          many points of likeness. From this passage we learn that nobody can
          make a man-fisher but our Lord Himself and that those whom He calls
          can only become successful by following Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, as a winner of souls cause me to imitate Thy spirit and method
          that I may not labor in vain!
        </p>

        <h2>20. <em>They immediately left their nets and followed him.</em></h2>
        <p>
          The call was effectual. No nets can entangle those whom Jesus calls to
          follow Him. They come straightway. They come at all cost. They come
          without a question. They come to quit old haunts. They come to follow
          their Leader without stipulation or reserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, cause me ever to be Thy faithful and unhesitating follower as
          long as I live! May no nets detain me when Thou cost call me!
        </p>

        <h2>
          21-22.
          <em
            >Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of
            Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their
            father, mending their nets. He called them. They immediately left
            the boat and their father, and followed him.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our Lord delighted in fishermen, possibly their bold heart and
          outspoken character fitted them for His service. At any rate, these
          would be the briars upon which He could graft the roses of His grace.
          Some He calls to preach when casting their nets and some while mending
          them, but in either case they are busy. We shall need both to cast and
          mend nets after we are called unto our Lord’s work. Note how our Lord
          again calls two brethren. Two together are better far than one and one
          acting singly. The Lord knows that our nature seeks companionship. No
          companion in work is better than a brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          This second pair of brothers “left their father” as well as their
          fishery. The first left their nets, but these “left the ship.” The
          first have no relatives mentioned, but these quitted father and mother
          for Christ’s sake and they did it as unhesitatingly as the others. It
          did not seem much of a prospect, to follow the houseless Jesus, but an
          inward attraction drew them and they followed on, charmed to obey the
          voice divine. Zebedee may have thought his sons’ going was a great
          loss to him, but it is not recorded that he expressed any objection to
          their doing so. Perhaps he gladly gave up his boys for such a service.
          We feel sure that their mother did. In the service of Jesus, we are
          not to be restrained by ties of kindred. He has a higher claim than
          father or husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, call me and my brother and all my family into Thy grace, if not
          into Thy ministry!
        </p>

        <h2>
          23.
          <em
            >Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
            preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease
            and every sickness among the people.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our Lord was ever on the move, “he went about all Galilee.” The Great
          Itinerant made a province His parish. He taught “in their synagogues,”
          but He was equally at home in their streets. He cared nothing for
          consecrated places. Teaching and preaching go well with healing. Thus
          soul and body are both taken care of. Our Lord’s great power is seen
          in the universality of His healing energy, healing “all manner of
          sickness and all manner of disease.” Dwell on those words, “all
          manner.” But our Lord was not content with miracles for the body, He
          had the Gospel for the soul, that Gospel which lies in His own person
          as King, in His promise of pardon to believers, and in His rule of
          love over those who are loyal to Him. He preached “the gospel of the
          kingdom,” a right royal Gospel, which made men kings and priests. To
          this Gospel the miracles of healing were so many seals. At this day,
          the healing of souls is an equally sure seal of God upon the Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, I know the truth and certainty of Thy Gospel, for I have felt
          Thy healing hand upon my heart. May I feel the rule and power of Thy
          kingdom and joyfully yield myself to Thy sway!
        </p>

        <h2>
          24.
          <em
            >The report about him went out into all Syria. They brought to him
            all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments,
            possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed
            them.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Of course, men told one another of the great prophet. Even the regions
          beyond began to hear of Him. Syria heard again that there was a God in
          Israel who could recover a man of his leprosy. Now the worst cases are
          brought to him—epileptics, the possessed, and the mad were led to Him
          and were not led in vain. What a bill of diseases we find in this
          verse!
        </p>
        <p>
          Diseases, torments, devils, lunacy, palsy, and so forth. And what a
          receipt at the foot, “and he healed them”! Oh, that men were eager to
          bring their spiritual ailments to the Savior! It would lead to the
          same result. In every case we should read, “he healed them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Our King surrounded Himself with the spiritual pomp of gratitude by
          displaying His power to bless the afflicted. Some kings have pretended
          to heal by their touch, but Jesus really did so. Never king or prophet
          could work such marvels as He did. Well might “his fame” be great!
        </p>

        <h2>
          25.
          <em
            >Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and
            from beyond the Jordan followed him.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Such a teacher is sure to have a following. Yet how small His
          spiritual following compared with the “great multitudes” who outwardly
          came to Him! Our King has many nominal subjects, but few there are who
          know Him as their Lord, so as to be renewed in heart by the power of
          His grace. These alone enter truly into His kingdom and it is foolish
          and wicked to talk of including any others in His spiritual domain.
          Yet is it a hopeful sign when there is a great inquiry after Jesus and
          every region and city yields its quota to the hearing throng.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we shall hear more from the blessed lips of Him who was King in
          Jerusalem and also Preacher to the people.
