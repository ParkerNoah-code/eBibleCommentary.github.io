        <h2>B. Baptism of Jesus (3:13-17)</h2>
        <p>
          It was meet that there should be some public recognition of the King,
          some pointing of Him out by truthful witness among men, and some
          indication from the Father in heaven that He was indeed His beloved
          Son.
        </p>

        <h2>
          13.
          <em
            >Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan‡ to John, to be baptized
            by him.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          In due time, when all was prepared, the Prince quitted His obscurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting Himself in a lowly place, He did not summon the Baptizer to
          come to the Lake of Galilee, but went down the country along the banks
          of the Jordan to him, seeking baptism. Should any of the servants
          neglect what their Lord so heartily attended to? Do any say, “It is
          not essential”? Was it essential to our Lord Jesus? He said, “It
          becometh us” and what was becoming in Him is not unbecoming in His
          followers. If it should cost us a journey, let us attend to the
          command which is binding on all believers.
        </p>

        <h2>
          14.
          <em
            >But John would have hindered him, saying, “I need to be baptized by
            you, and you come to me?”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          This was very natural. John knew Jesus to be eminently more holy than
          himself and therefore he protested against appearing to be His
          purifier. John was strong in this protest. He “forbad him.” It seemed
          to him to be out of order for him to baptize one so supremely good.
          Although he was not yet assured from heaven that Jesus was the Messiah
          (for he had not yet seen the Spirit descending and resting upon Him),
          yet he shrewdly guessed that Jesus was indeed the Christ. He knew Him
          to be a very special favorite of heaven, superior to Himself, and he
          therefore expected that sign by which he had been assured the Christ
          would be known.
        </p>
        <p>
          John never shirked a duty, but he declined an honor. He would not even
          seem to be of any consequence as compared with his Lord. Blessed
          Jesus, teach us like humility!
        </p>

        <h2>
          15.
          <em
            >But Jesus, answering, said to him, “Allow it now, for this is the
            fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed
            him.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Jesus answered John so completely that he ceased his opposition at
          once. It was becoming both in John and in Jesus that our Lord should
          be baptized of him. This assurance satisfied the Baptist so far that,
          still under protest, “he suffered him.” Baptism was becoming even in
          our Lord, who needed no personal purification, for He was the Head
          over all things to His Church and it was becoming that He should be as
          the members should be. Baptism beautifully sets forth our Lord’s
          immersion in suffering, His burial, and His resurrection. Thus
          typically, it fulfills “all righteousness.” The ordinance is most full
          of meaning when rightly observed and it is to be most reverently
          regarded, since our Lord Himself submitted to it. Shall I refuse to
          follow my Lord? Shall I think that there is nothing in an ordinance of
          which He said, “Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness?”
        </p>

        <h2>
          16-17.
          <em
            >Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly from the water: and
            behold, the heavens were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God
            descending as a dove, and coming on him. Behold, a voice out of the
            heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
            pleased.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our Lord went down into the water, for “he went up out of the water.”
          He did not tarry, but when one duty had been fulfilled at the river,
          He straightway went on His way to carry out another. In baptism, our
          Lord was openly attested and sealed as the “beloved Son,” both by the
          Word of God and the Spirit of God. What more witness is needed? It is
          often so with His people. Their sonship is made clear during an act of
          obedience and the Word and the Spirit bear witness with their
          consciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord Jesus had now to enter on his public life-work and He did so
          in the best manner. The world was opening before Him, “and the heavens
          were opened unto him.” As his need appeared, his source of supply was
          set open before Him. On Him also the divine anointing descended. Like
          a swift-winged, pure, and quiet dove, “the Spirit of God” came, and
          found a resting-place in Him. When He had been immersed into the
          element of water, He was immediately surrounded by the divine element
          of the Spirit. Then, also, was His ear charmed with the Father’s
          audible acknowledgment of Him and with the expression of that good
          pleasure which the Lord God had always felt in Him. It was a glorious
          moment. Our King was now proclaimed and anointed. Would not His next
          step be to take the Kingdom? We shall see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord and King is now fully before us. He has been preceded,
          predicted, and pointed out by John the Baptist. He has been dedicated
          to His work in baptism. He has been anointed by the Spirit and
          confessed by the Father and therefore He has fairly entered upon His
          royal work. May none of us in the service of the Lord run before our
          time or go forward without a sense of the Father’s approval, and
          without that spiritual unction which is from above!
        </p>
        <p>
          O my Lord, let me be anointed and approved in my measure, even as Thou
          wast in Thine. In order to this, I would behold Thine anointing of the
          Spirit with the full belief that I am anointed in Thee, as the body
          receives unction in the anointing of the Head.
