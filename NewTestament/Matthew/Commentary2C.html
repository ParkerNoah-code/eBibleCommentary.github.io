        <h2>C. Temptation in the Wilderness (4:1-11)</h2>

        <h2>
          1.
          <em
            >Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
            tempted by the devil.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          No sooner anointed than assailed. He did not seek temptation, but was
          “led up of the Spirit.” The time selected was immediately after His
          Sonship had been attested, when we might have thought that He was
          least likely to be attacked upon that point. Times of hallowed
          enjoyment verge on periods of temptation. Our Lord was led “into the
          wilderness.” The place was one of great solitude, where He would be
          alone in the conflict. The devil himself came to the spot and plied
          his diabolical arts upon the man ordained to be his Destroyer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me be ever on my watch-tower and particularly during seasons of
          great enjoyment, for then is Satan most likely to assail me. Lord
          Jesus, be Thou with me in the hour of my testing, for Thou knowest how
          to succor the tempted.
        </p>

        <h2>
          2.
          <em
            >When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry
            afterward.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the long fast, He was miraculously sustained, but at the
          close of it, hunger began to try Him. We are more in danger when our
          labor or suffering is over than during the time of its continuance.
          Now that the Lord is drained dry by His long fast and is made faint by
          hunger, the enemy will be upon Him. The devil is a great coward and
          takes a mean advantage of us.
        </p>
        <p>Lord make me a match for the enemy!</p>

        <h2>
          3.
          <em
            >The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God,
            command that these stones become bread.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          He adapted the temptation to the circumstances. He tempted a hungry
          man with bread. He put it very cunningly. Only one single word and the
          hard stone of the desert would be biscuit. Let Him undertake to be His
          own provider and use His miraculous power as “Son of God” to spread a
          table for Himself. The tempter begins his suggestion with an “if,” an
          “if” about his Sonship. This is his usual fashion. He bids the Lord
          prove his Sonship by catering for Himself and yet that would have been
          the surest way to prove that He was not the Son of God. A true son
          will not doubt his father and undertake to provide his own bread. He
          will wait to be fed by his father’s hand. The evil one would have the
          only-begotten Son cease to depend on God and take matters into His own
          hands. Temptations to unbelieving self-help are common enough, but
          very dangerous.
        </p>

        <h2>
          4.
          <em
            >But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread
            alone, but by every word that proceeds out of God’s mouth.’ ”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Out flashed the sword of the Spirit. Our Lord will fight with no other
          weapon. He could have spoken new revelations, but He chose to say, “It
          is written.” There is a power in the Word of God which even the devil
          cannot deny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our life and its sustenance are not dependent upon the visible, though
          the visible is ordinarily used for our support. We “live not by bread
          alone,” though it is the usual means of our support. He who sustained
          the Savior fasting for forty days could still keep Him alive without
          bread. The secret influence of the word of Omnipotence could keep the
          vital forces in action even without bread. Bread owes its power to
          nourish our bodies to the secret agency of God, and that divine agency
          could work as surely without the usual means as with them. The word of
          the Lord which made the heavens can assuredly support all that it has
          made. Our Lord Jesus, in fact, told the tempter that He would not
          distrust the providence of God, but would wait his Father’s time for
          feeding Him and would by no means be driven to an act of unbelief and
          self-reliance.
        </p>

        <h2>
          5-6.
          <em
            >Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the
            pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God,
            throw yourself down, for it is written,<br />
            ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’<br />
            and,<br />
            ‘On their hands they will bear you up,<br />
            so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’ ”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          This second temptation is a cunning one. He is persuaded rather to
          believe too much than too little. He is not now to take care of
          Himself, but recklessly to presume and trust His Father’s promise
          beyond its meaning. The place was cunningly chosen. Temple-pinnacles
          are not safe standing. High and holy places are open to temptation.
          The posture was advantageous to the tempter, for nature feels a
          tendency to fall when set “on a pinnacle.” The aim of the fiery dart
          was at our Lord’s Sonship, “If thou be the Son of God.” If the enemy
          could have hurt our Lord’s filial confidence, he would have gained his
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satan borrowed our Lord’s weapon and said, “It is written,” but he did
          not use the sword lawfully. It was not in the nature of the false
          fiend to quote correctly. He left out the necessary words, “in all thy
          ways,” thus he made the promise say what in truth it never suggested
          and then boldly prescribed a course which the law of God would
          condemn, saying, “Cast thyself down.” We are to be kept in our ways,
          but not in our follies. The omission of a word may spoil the meaning
          of a Scripture. Verbal inspiration makes accurate quotation to be a
          duty, as the omission of a word or two entirely alters the sense. What
          reliable inspiration can there be except that which suggests words as
          well as ideas?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hear how the devil talks about angels, their Lord, their charge, their
          care, and their diligence. A man may handle holy subjects with great
          familiarity and yet be himself unholy. It is ill to talk of angels and
          yet to act like devils.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how the fiend passes from a temptation about humble bread to one
          of an ambitious and daring character. He hopes by a sudden change to
          catch the Lord in one way, even if He escaped from him in another. But
          our Lord was ready for him. His sword was on guard for all kinds of
          strokes. May His grace keep us in the same manner well-armed against
          the foe! Though the enemy alters his tactics, we must not cease our
          resistance or change our weapon.
        </p>

          7.
          <em
            >Jesus said to him, “Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          “It is written again.” One text must not be looked at alone and
          magnified out of proportion, as if it were the whole Bible. Each
          utterance of the Lord must be taken in connection with other parts of
          Scripture. There is a balance and proportion in divine truth. “It is
          written” is to be set side by side with, “It is written again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          How short and decisive was the stroke of our Lord upon the great
          enemy! He meets a falsely-quoted promise with a plain precept,
          forbidding us to presume. “Thou shalt not” from the mouth of God is
          the shield of conscience against a foul temptation. Our rule of action
          is neither a promise nor a providence, but the clear command of the
          Lord. Presumption is a tempting of God and to “tempt the Lord” is not
          to be thought of for a moment. Remember, believer, He is “thy God,” to
          be trusted, not to be tempted. The second time the adversary was so
          completely, baffled that he made no reply, but changed his line of
          warfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, suffer me not to sin presumptuously, nor to act rashly! I see
          that faith is for ways of obedience, not for flights of fancy. Let me
          not cast myself down and so throw myself out of the range of Thy
          promised keeping.
        </p>

        <h2>
          8-9.
          <em
            >Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and
            showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. He said to
            him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and
            worship me.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Wretched traitor! None of these kingdoms were really his own. They
          were in truth the rightful heritage of the Lord to whom he pretended
          he could give them. How he opened his mouth and said, “All these
          things will I give thee”! A poor all after all and it would only have
          been a stolen gift had he bestowed it. Yet it would have been to any
          of us a very dazzling and fascinating sight, for the glories of even
          one kingdom make hearts beat and eyes glisten and feet slip. The bait
          is sweet, but the hook lies under it. The glittering glory would be
          bought too dear by that demand—”fall down and worship me.” If Jesus
          would have adopted carnal means, He would soon have had “the kingdoms
          of the world” at His feet. A little tampering with truth and a little
          flattery of prejudice, and he might have had many men around him,
          irresistible in their fanaticism. By their enthusiastic effort, He
          would soon have been able to wield a mighty power, before which Rome
          would have fallen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our holy Lord disdained to use the help of evil, though the master of
          wickedness promised Him success. How could He bow down before the
          devil? It was the height of impudence for the false fiend to invite
          worship from the perfect One. Christ at the devil’s feet! It reminds
          us of religion supported by theatricals and raffles. What gift of the
          foul fiend could tempt the Son of God to be the servant of evil? The
          tempter does not dare to mention Sonship in this case, for that would
          have laid the blasphemous suggestion too bare. No son of God can
          worship the devil. O Lord, grant that if ever we should hunger and be
          in poverty, like our Lord, we may never yield to the temptation to do
          wrong to gain wealth and honor or even the supply of pressing need!
          May Thy Church never yield to the world with the idea of setting up
          the kingdom of Christ in a more easy and rapid manner than by the
          simple preaching of the Gospel!
        </p>

        <h2>
          10.
          <em
            >Then Jesus said to him, “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written,
            ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’
            ”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Lord spake strongly to the tempter. Satan had betrayed his own
          character and now he gets his proper name and is ordered into his
          proper place. How that word staggered him—“Get thee hence”! This was
          the final word which banished him from the Lord’s presence. How he
          slunk away. He hastened off ashamed, like a dog who is sent home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord gave him a parting stroke with the sword of the Spirit. Again
          He said, “It is written.” God’s command, which demands all worship and
          service for Jehovah the covenant God only, was a word for Satan to
          remember when he dived hastily into the nether deep to hide his head
          in confusion at his complete defeat. He, too, is under law to God and
          cannot cast away His cords from him. Oh, that we may own the power of
          this precept and feel that we have nothing to do with winning even the
          whole world and its glory, but are to give our entire lives to the
          service of the one Lord! Idolatry of the creature withers under the
          scorching heat of this imperative law of the Highest. We must not pay
          even a shade of deference to evil, though the whole world should be
          the reward of a single act of sinful submission to it, “Him only shalt
          thou serve.” Ours it is to choose Jehovah for our God and then to live
          alone for His praise and service.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is noteworthy that all the passages quoted by our Lord are from the
          Book of Deuteronomy, which book has been so grievously assailed by the
          destructive critics. Thus did our Lord put special honor upon that
          part of the Old Testament which He foresaw would be most attacked. The
          past few years have proved that the devil does not like Deuteronomy.
          He would fain avenge himself for the wounds it caused him on this most
          memorable occasion.
        </p>

        <h2>
          11.
          <em
            >Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served
            him.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The enemy left Him when He had shot his last bolt, but even then he
          left him only for a season, minding to return at the first
          opportunity. Only when he has tried his utmost will the tempter let a
          child of God alone, and even then he will watch for another
          opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          So soon as the evil one had departed, angels appeared to fulfill a
          ministry for which they eagerly longed, but which the presence of the
          devil hindered. No doubt they had been hovering near, waiting their
          opportunity. These holy beings might not come upon the scene while the
          battle was being fought, lest they should seem to divide the honors of
          the day, but when the duel was ended, they hastened to bring food for
          the body and comfort for the mind of the champion King. It was a
          battle royal and the victory deserved to be celebrated by the
          courtiers of the heavenly King. Let us behold these angels, learn from
          their example, and believe that they are also near to all the warriors
          of the cross in their hour of conflict with the fiend.
        </p>
        <p>
          O Tempted but Triumphant King, Thy servants worship Thee and ask
          permission and grace to minister to Thee as angels did!
