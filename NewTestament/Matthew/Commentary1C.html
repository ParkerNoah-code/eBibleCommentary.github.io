        <h2>C. Visit of the Magi (2:1-12)</h2>

        <h2>
          1-2.
          <em
            >Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King
            Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
            “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in
            the east, and have come to worship him.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The King is born and now He must be acknowledged. At the same moment
          He will be assailed. His birth was in the days of another king, of
          Edomite stock, who had usurped the throne of David. The world’s
          kingdom is opposed to that of our Lord. Where Jesus is born there is
          sure to be a Herod in power. It is a marvelous thing that Magi from
          afar should know that a great king was born and should come from so
          great a distance to do Him homage, for the world’s wise men are not
          often found bowing at the feet of Jesus. When wise men seek our King,
          they are wise indeed. These were devout men to whom the stars spoke of
          God. An unusual luminary was understood by them to indicate the birth
          of the Coming Man for whom many in all lands were looking. Stars might
          guide us if we were willing to be led. Lord Jesus, make everything
          speak to me concerning Thee and may I be truly led till I find Thee!
        </p>
        <p>
          The wise men were not content with having “seen his star,” they must
          see Himself and seeing, they must adore. These were not in doubt as to
          His Godhead. They said, “We are come to worship him.” Lord, I pray
          Thee, make all the wise men to worship Thee!
        </p>

        <h2>
          3.
          <em
            >When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with
            him.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Herod is expressly called, “Herod the king.” In that capacity, he is
          the enemy of our King. They are in a sad state to whom the Savior is a
          trouble. Some, like Herod, are troubled because they fear that they
          shall lose position and honor if true religion makes progress and many
          have an undefined dread that the presence of Jesus will deprive them
          of pleasure or call them to make unwilling sacrifices. O Thou who art
          the King of heaven, Thou dost not trouble me. Thou art my joy!
        </p>
        <p>
          See the influence of one man. Herod’s trouble infects “all Jerusalem.”
          Well it might, for this cruel prince delighted in shedding blood and
          the darkness of his brow meant death to many. Unhappy Jerusalem, to be
          troubled by the birth of the Savior! Unhappy people, to whom true
          godliness is a weariness!
        </p>

        <h2>
          4.
          <em
            >Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people,
            he asked them where the Christ would be born.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          When the earth-king dabbles in theology, it bodes no good to truth.
          Herod, among priests and scribes, is Herod still. Some men may become
          well-instructed in their Bibles and yet be all the worse for what they
          have discovered. Like Herod, they make ill use of what they learn or
          like these scribes, they may know much about the Lord Jesus and yet
          have no heart towards Him.
        </p>

        <h2>
          5-6.
          <em
            >They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written
            through the prophet,<br />
            ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,<br />
            are in no way least among the princes of Judah;<br />
            for out of you shall come a governor<br />
            who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’ ”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          They were right in their conclusion, though somewhat cloudy in their
          quotation. Jesus was to be born in the city of David, in Bethlehem,
          which is, being interpreted, “the house of bread.” Though the city was
          but a little one, His birth therein made it famous. Jesus ennobles all
          that He touches. These scribes knew where to find the text about the
          Savior’s birth and they could put their finger upon the spot in the
          map where He should be born, and yet they knew not the King, neither
          cared to seek Him out. May it never be my case, to be a master of
          Scriptural geography, prophecy, and theology, and yet to miss HIM of
          whom the Scripture speaks!
        </p>
        <p>
          With joy would we note the name of Governor, here given to Jesus. We
          are of the spiritual Israel if He rules us. Oh, that the day may soon
          come when the literal Israel shall behold the government laid upon His
          shoulder!
        </p>

        <h2>
          7.
          <em
            >Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them
            exactly what time the star appeared.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          We delight in anxious inquirers, but here was one of a very evil sort.
          Many pry into holy things that they may ridicule or otherwise oppose
          them. What an evil diligence is this! When very private inquiries are
          made, we may suspect that something is wrong and yet it is not always
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, truth fears not the light. Whether men inquire privily or
          not, we are ready to give them information about our Lord and about
          everything which concerns Him.
        </p>

        <h2>
          8.
          <em
            >He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for
            the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I
            also may come and worship him.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Artful wretch! Murder was in his heart, but pious pretenses were on
          his tongue. May none of us be Herodians in hypocrisy! To promise to
          worship, and to intend to destroy, is a piece of trickery very usual
          in our own days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, that the wise men never promised to return to Herod. They
          probably guessed that all this eager zeal was not quite so pure as it
          seemed to be and their silence did not mean consent. We must not
          believe everybody who makes loud professions, nor do all that they ask
          of us, lest we aid them in some evil design.
        </p>

        <h2>
          9-10.
          <em
            >They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star,
            which they saw in the east, went before them until it came and stood
            over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they
            rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Yes, “they departed,” and were wise to get out of Herod’s vile
          company. They made no compact with him. They heard his false
          professions and they went their way. The star appeared when the tyrant
          disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The star was probably a meteor or moving light, which having shone
          long enough in the western heavens to guide them to Judea, then ceased
          to be visible, but shone forth again as they quitted Jerusalem. We
          must not always expect to have visible signs to cheer us, but we are
          very glad of them when the Lord grants them to us. We seek not the
          star of inward feelings or outward signs, but Jesus Himself. Yet have
          we great joy when heavenly comfort shines into our souls. Lord, show
          me a token for good. This will make me glad. Show me Thyself and I
          will rejoice with exceeding great joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how the stars above as well as men below pay their obeisances to
          the Newborn King! My soul, be not slow to adore thy Savior! The star
          moved “till it came and stood over where the young child was.” So will
          my heart never rest till it finds out the Lord.
        </p>

        <h2>
          11.
          <em
            >They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his
            mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their
            treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and
            myrrh.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Those who look for Jesus will see Him. Those who truly see Him will
          worship Him. Those who worship Him will consecrate their substance to
          Him. The gold and spices were presented, not to Mary, but “unto him.”
          The wise men kept their caskets closed till they saw Jesus and then
          they opened their treasures. Let us keep our love and our holy service
          for our Lord’s eye and never wish to expose them to the world’s gaze.
          The wise men’s gifts were royal, with a touch of the priestly in them,
          “gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.” These choice offerings,
          especially the gold, would help Joseph and Mary to provide for the
          Royal Child, who was so soon to be exiled. God brought providers from
          the far East to supply the needs of His Son. “Remember that
          Omnipotence has servants everywhere.” Before the babe starts for
          Egypt, Oriental sages must pay His charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lord, thou shalt have my worship and my gifts, for Thou art the sole
          Monarch of my soul and I will aid Thy missionary cause that when Thou
          goest into Africa with Thy Gospel, my gifts may go with Thee.
        </p>

        <h2>
          12.
          <em
            >Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to
            their own country another way.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Probably, they half suspected Herod already and the Lord by a dream
          led their thoughts further in the same direction. Wise men need to be
          “warned of God.” When they are so, they alter their minds at once.
          Though they had planned to return by one route, they took another.
          They did not linger, but “departed into their own country another
          way.” Oh, that I may never be disobedient to a hint from the throne!
          “Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel.”
