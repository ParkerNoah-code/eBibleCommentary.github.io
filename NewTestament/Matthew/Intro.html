        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          As in most books of the Bible, the name of the author is not mentioned
          in Matthew's gospel. But right from the beginning the Christian
          tradition confirms that the apostle Matthew is the author of this
          gospel. The heading of the first book of the New Testament is in most
          manuscripts "Gospel according to Matthew". There is only one good news
          of the great work that God had accomplished by His Son, the Lord Jesus
          Christ, but in His wisdom it needed four different men to make this
          news of salvation known to the world in written form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthew was by occupation a publican, or tax-gatherer, and was in his
          employ when Christ called him by his grace. He was one of the twelve
          Apostles sent forth by Christ to preach the Gospel of the kingdom (Mat
          10:3). Though he was employed in collecting the Roman tax, yet he was
          of Jewish extract; as appears from his being called the son of
          Alphaeus (Mk 2:14) and from his name Matthew Levi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name of the author, Matthew, is listed in all lists of apostles at
          the seventh or eighth place (Mat 10:2-4, Mk 3:16-19, Lk 6:13-16, Acts
          1:13). All three synoptic gospels - so called because of their
          similarity - tell us about his calling (Mat 9:9, Mk 2:13, Lk 5:27).
          While on this occasion Luke calls him "Levi, the tax-gatherer" and
          Mark "Levi, the son of Alphaeus", he is called "Matthew" only in
          Matthew.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name Matthai or Matthew (מתאי) signifies a "gift" or "given"; he
          was one of those the Father had given to Christ, and was kept by him,
          when the son of perdition was lost (Jn 17:6).
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          The gospel does not contain any details about its exact time of
          writing, therefore the opinions in regard to that vary considerably.
          While some researchers believe the gospel was written after the
          destruction of Jerusalem (70 AD), others think that there are no facts
          supporting this, and they date it as 60-70 AD. The church father
          Irenaeus (ca 140-202 AD) hints on the gospel of Matthew having been
          written around 61-66 AD.
