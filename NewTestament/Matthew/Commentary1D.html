        <h2>D. Flight to Egypt (2:13-23)</h2>

        <h2>
          13.
          <em
            >Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
            to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and
            his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you,
            for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Angels were busy in those days, for they had special charge of their
          Royal Master. Joseph’s high office, as guardian of the young child and
          his mother, involved him in care and made him an exile from his
          country. We cannot expect to serve the Lord and yet have an easy time
          of it. We must cheerfully journey across a desert if we have a charge
          to keep for our God and we must tarry in banishment, if need be, and
          never venture to come back till the Lord sends us our passports. Our
          orders are, “Be thou there until I bring thee word.” The Lord’s
          servants must wait for the Lord’s word before they make a move,
          whether it be to go abroad or to come home. Waiting is hard work,
          especially waiting in Egypt, but it is safe to tarry till we have our
          marching orders.
        </p>

        <h2>
          14-15.
          <em
            >He arose and took the young child and his mother by night and
            departed into Egypt, and was there until the death of Herod, that it
            might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,
            saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Night journeys, both actual and spiritual, may fall to the lot of
          those who carry Jesus with them. Even the Son of God, who is
          preeminent above all others, must depart into Egypt like the rest of
          the family, and must only come out of it when He is called. Let us not
          wonder if we also have to go down to Egypt and go in a hurry, and go
          by night and are allowed to stay there for many a day. We, too, shall
          be called out in due time by Him whose call is effectual. The angel
          who leads us into Egypt will bring us word to come forth from it, for
          all our times are in the Lord’s hands. Let us never forget that the
          chosen may have to go into Egypt, but they must be brought out of it,
          for the rule is of universal bearing, “Out of Egypt have I called my
          son.”
        </p>
        <p>
          How the prophecies mark out our Lord’s way from the beginning! The
          King of Israel comes out of Egypt, even as Moses did, who in his day
          was King in Jeshurun.
        </p>

        <h2>
          16.
          <em
            >Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was
            exceedingly angry, and sent out and killed all the male children who
            were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two
            years old and under, according to the exact time which he had
            learned from the wise men.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Herod, with all his craftiness, misses his mark. He considers that he
          is made a fool of, though the wise men had no such intention. Proud
          men are quick to imaging insults. He is furious. He must kill this
          newborn King lest He claim his crown, and therefore he orders the
          death of every two-year-old child in Bethlehem, taking good margin,
          that none might escape through error in the age. What mattered it to
          him if a few babes were needlessly slain? He must make sure that the
          little King is made an end of and he imagines that a speedy and
          indiscriminate slaughter of all who have reached their second year
          will put him beyond all fear of this reputed rival. Men will do
          anything to be rid of Jesus. They care not how many children, or men,
          or women, are destroyed, so that they can but resist His kingdom and
          crush His holy cause in its infancy. Yet vain is their rage. The holy
          child is beyond their jurisdiction and their sword.
        </p>

        <h2>
          17-18.
          <em
            >Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled,
            saying,<br />
            “A voice was heard in Ramah,<br />
            lamentation, weeping and great mourning,<br />
            Rachel weeping for her children;<br />
            she wouldn’t be comforted,<br />
            because they are no more.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our Prince steps along a pathway paved with prophecies. Yet see what
          trouble attends His early days! The weeping prophet foretells the
          wailing over the innocents. He is the innocent cause of the death of
          many innocents. Men say that religion has been the cause of cruelty
          and bloodshed. Honesty should compel them to admit, that not religion,
          but opposition to religion, has done this. What! blame Jesus because
          Herod sought to murder Him and therefore made so many mothers weep
          over their dead babes! What three drops of gall are
          these—“lamentation, and weeping and great mourning”! The triple
          mixture is all too common.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Rachels still weep, but holy women who know the Lord Jesus do not
          now say concerning their little ones that “they are not.” They know
          that their children are and they know where they are, and they expect
          to meet them again in glory. Surely, if these women had but known,
          they might have been comforted by the fact that though their little
          ones were slain, the Children’s Friend had escaped and still lived to
          be the Savior of all who die before committing actual transgression.
        </p>

        <h2>
          19-20.
          <em
            >But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a
            dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Arise and take the young child
            and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought
            the young child’s life are dead.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Angels again! Yes, and they are busy still around “the beloved of the
          Lord.” Joseph still watches over his honored charge, even as Joseph of
          old watched over Israel in Egypt. See the order in which the family is
          arranged—“the young child and his mother.” The Lord is placed first.
          It is not here, as at Rome, “the Virgin and child.” The angel loathed
          to mention Herod’s name, but said, “They are dead.” Such a wretch did
          not deserve to be named by a holy angel. Herod had gone to his own
          place and now the Lord brings back His banished ones to their own
          place. Instead of making Jesus to die, the tyrant is dead himself.
          Sword in hand, he missed the young child, but without a sword, that
          child’s Father struck home to his heart. It is a relief to the world
          when some men die. It was certainly so in the case of Herod. Those who
          keep our King out of His own are not likely to live long. My soul,
          ponder the lessons of history concerning the King’s adversaries!
        </p>

        <h2>
          21-23.
          <em
            >He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the
            land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over
            Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there.
            Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee, and
            came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled
            which was spoken through the prophets that he will be called a
            Nazarene.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Joseph obeyed without question. “He arose,” that is to say, as soon as
          he was awake he set about doing as he was bidden. At once he made the
          journey and came into the land of Israel. So should we hasten to obey.
          He had his fears about Judea, yet he did not follow his fears, but
          only went as his guide from heaven directed him. This Joseph was a
          dreamer like his namesake of old and he was also a practical man and
          turned his dreams to wise account.
        </p>
        <p>
          He “came into the land of Israel,” but he was allowed to go into that
          part of it which was under a gentler sway than that of Archelaus, who
          was no improvement upon his father. Galilee, a despised country, a
          land where Gentiles mixed with the Jews, a dark and ignorant part, was
          to be the land of our Lord’s early days. He was of the common people
          and He was educated in a rustic region, in “the parse of Galilee,”
          among a plain folk, who had none of the fine manners of the towns.
          Blessed King, the days of Thy minority were not spent at court, but
          among the common multitude, whom still Thou dost delight to bless! I
          pray Thee, turn aside into the parts of this Galilee and abide with
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Lord was called “Netzar,” The Branch. Probably this is the
          prophecy referred to, for “Nazareth” signifies sprouts or shoots.
          Possibly some unrecorded prophecy, often repeated by the prophets and
          known to all the people, is here alluded to. Certainly He has long
          been called a “Nazarene,” both by Jews and violent unbelievers.
          Spitting on the ground in disgust, many a time has His fierce
          adversary hissed out the name, “Nazarene,” as if it were the climax of
          contempt. Yet, O Nazarene, Thou hast triumphed! Jesus of Nazareth,”
          the greatest name among men. O Lord, my King, as Thou art dishonored
          by Thy foes, so shalt Thou be adored among Thy friends, with all their
          heart and all their soul. While others call Thee, “Nazarene,” we call
          Thee Jesus—Jehovah, King of kings, and Lord of lords.
