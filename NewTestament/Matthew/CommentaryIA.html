        <h2>A. Genealogy of the Messiah (1:1-17)</h2>
        <p>
          The portion before us looks like a string of names and we might fancy
          that it would yield us little spiritual food, but we may not think
          lightly of any line of the inspired volume. Here the Spirit sets
          before us the pedigree of Jesus and sketches the family tree of “the
          King of the Jews.” Marvelous condescension, that He should be a man
          and have a genealogy, even HE who “was in the beginning with God,” and
          “thought it not robbery to be equal with God”! Let us read each line
          of “The book of the generation” with adoring gratitude that we have a
          King who is one with us in our nature—“in ties of blood with sinners
          one.”
        </p>
        <h2>
          1.
          <em
            >The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the
            son of Abraham.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          This verse gives us a clue to the special drift of Matthew’s Gospel.
          He was moved of the Holy Spirit to write of our Lord Jesus Christ AS
          KING—“the son of David.” He is to be spoken of as specially reigning
          over the true seed of Abraham, hence He is called, “the son of
          Abraham.” Lord Jesus, make us each one to call Thee, “My God and
          King!” As we read this wonderful GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM may we be full
          of loyal obedience and pay Thee humble homage! Thou art both a King
          and a King’s Son.
        </p>
        <h2>
          2.
          <em
            >Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas
            and his brethren.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          With Abraham was the covenant made that in his seed should all the
          nations of the earth be blessed. The line ran not in Ishmael, the
          offspring of the flesh, but in Isaac, who was born after the promise
          and by the divine purpose it flowed in elect Jacob and not in the
          firstborn, Esau. Let us observe and admire the sovereignty of God. Our
          Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe nothing is said concerning
          the priesthood, that it might be clear that His priesthood is “not
          after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an
          endless life.” Yet comes He of Judah’s royal tribe, for He is King.
        </p>
        <h2>
          3-4.
          <em
            >And Judas begat Phares and Ezra of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom;
            and Esrom begat Aram; and Aram, begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat
            Naamon; and Naamon begat Salmon.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Observe the dash of unclean blood which enters the stream through
          Judah’s incest with Thamar. O Lord, thou art the sinner’s Friend!
        </p>
        <h2>
          5.
          <em
            >And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and
            Obed begat Jesse.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          We note that two women are mentioned in this fifth verse, a Canaanite
          and a Moabitess. Thus Gentile blood mingled with the Hebrew strain.
          Our King has come to break down the partition wall. As Gentiles, we
          rejoice in this. Jesus is heir of a line in which flows the blood of
          the harlot Rahab and of the rustic Ruth. He is akin to the fallen and
          to the lowly, and He will show His love even to the poorest and most
          obscure. I, too, may have part and lot in Him.
        </p>
        <h2>
          6-9.
          <em
            >And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of
            her that had been the wife of Urias; and Solomon. begat Roboam; and
            Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; and Asa begat Josaphat; and
            Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; and Ozias begat
            Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Well may our hearts melt at the memory of David and Bathsheba! The
          fruit of their unholy union died, but after repentance, she who “had
          been the wife of Uria” became the wife of David and the mother of
          Solomon. Signal was the grace of God in this case that the line should
          be continued in this once guilty pair, but oh, what kinship with
          fallen humanity does this indicate in our Lord! We will not pry into
          the mystery of the incarnation, but we must wonder at the
          condescending grace which appointed our Lord such a pedigree.
        </p>
        <h2>
          10.
          <em
            >And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat
            Josias.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          A line of kings of a mixed character—not one of them perfect and some
          of them as bad as bad could be. Three are left out altogether, even
          sinners who were only fit to be forgotten were in the line of this
          succession, and this shows how little can be made of being born of the
          will of man or of the will of the flesh. In this special line of
          descent, salvation was not of blood, nor of birth. Specially let us
          think of such a one as Manasses being among the ancestors of our Lord,
          as if to hint that, in the line which comes after Him, there would be
          some of the chief of sinners who would be miracles of mercy. Again we
          say, how near does Jesus come to our fallen race by this His
          genealogy!
        </p>
        <h2>
          11.
          <em
            >And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they
            were carried away to Babylon.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Poor captives, and those who are bound with the fetters of sin, may
          see some like themselves in this famous ancestry. They are prisoners
          of hope, now that the Christ is born of a race which was once “carried
          away to Babylon.”
        </p>
        <h2>
          12-16.
          <em
            >And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;
            and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; and Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud
            begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; and Azor begat Sadoc; and
            Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; and Eliud begat Eleazar;
            and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
            Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called
            Christ.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          With one or two exceptions these are names of persons of little or no
          note. The later ones were persons altogether obscure and
          insignificant. Our Lord was “a root out of dry ground,” a shoot from
          the withered stem of Jesse. He set small store by earthly greatness.
          He must needs be of human race, but He comes to a family which was of
          low estate and there finds His reputed father, Joseph, a carpenter of
          Nazareth. He is the poor man’s King. He will not disdain any of us
          though our father’s house be little in Israel. He will condescend to
          men of low estate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wonder surpassing all wonders—the Word, by whom all things were made,
          was Himself made flesh and dwelt among us! He was born of a human
          mother, even of the lowly virgin, Mary. “Forasmuch then as the
          children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise
          took part of the same.” Our hearts would anoint with sweet perfume of
          love and praise the blessed head of Him “who is called Christ,” the
          Anointed One.
        </p>
        <h2>
          17.
          <em
            >So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
            generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are
            fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto
            Christ are fourteen generations.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Holy Ghost led His servant Matthew to adopt a rough and simple
          method to help weak memories. Here are three fourteens. Let us learn
          from this to make ourselves familiar with our Lord’s pedigree and
          think much of His being born into the world. Specially let us see that
          He was literally of the house of David and the seed of Abraham, for
          many prophecies in the Old Testament pointed to this fact. He is truly
          the Messiah, the Prince, which was to come.
