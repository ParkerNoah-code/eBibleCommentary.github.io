        <h2>A. Ministry of John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-12)</h2>

        <h2>
          1-2.
          <em
            >In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness
            of Judea, saying, “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
            hand!”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          While Jesus still remained at Nazareth, His kinsman, the Baptizer,
          made his appearance. The morning star is seen before the sun. John
          came not to the court, but to lone wildernesses, places left to sheep
          and a handful of rural folk. The mission of Christ Jesus is to the
          moral wastes and to the desolate places of the earth. To them the
          Lord’s harbinger makes his way and there he fitly preaches the
          command, “Repent ye.” Give up your thorns and briars, O ye
          wildernesses, for your Lord is coming to you! See how John announces
          the coming kingdom, how he bids men make ready for it and how he urges
          them to be speedy in their preparation, “For the kingdom of heaven is
          at hand.” Let me be ready for my Lord’s coming and put away all that
          would grieve His Holy Spirit!
        </p>

        <h2>
          3.
          <em
            >For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,<br />
            “The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br />
            make the way of the Lord ready!<br />
            Make his paths straight!”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Matthew keeps to his custom of quoting from the Old Testament. The
          prophets not only described the King, but His forerunner also. They
          mention the character of this harbinger. He was a “voice”—(Jesus is
          “the Word”); his tone, “crying”; his place, “in the wilderness”; and
          his message, which was one of announcement, in which he required
          preparation for the coming King, “Prepare ye the way of the Lord.”
          Men’s hearts were like a wilderness, wherein there is no way, but as
          loyal subjects throw up roads for the approach of beloved princes, so
          were men to welcome the Lord, with their hearts made right and ready
          to receive Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          O Lord, I would welcome Thee if Thou wouldst come to me. I have great
          need of Thy royal presence and therefore I would prepare a way for
          Thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Into my heart my desires have made for Thee a path most short and
          smooth. Come, Lord, and tarry not! Come into my wilderness nature and
          transform it into a garden of the Lord.
        </p>

        <h2>
          4.
          <em
            >Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather
            belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          He was rough and stern, like Elijah. His garments betokened his
          simplicity, his sternness, his self-denial. His food, the product of
          the desert where he dwelt, showed that he cared nothing for luxuries.
          His whole bearing was symbolical, but it was also fit and suitable for
          his office. The plainest of food is best for body and mind and spirit,
          and moreover, it fosters manliness. Lord, let not my meat, or drink,
          or garments hinder me in Thy work!
        </p>

        <h2>
          5-6.
          <em
            >Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around
            the Jordan went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan,
            confessing their sins.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The people were expecting a Messiah and so they went en masse to John
          as soon as his shrill voice had startled the solitudes. Baptism, or
          the washing of the body in water, most fitly accompanied the cry,
          “Repent ye.” The “confessing their sins,” which went with baptism in
          Jordan gave it its meaning. Apart from the acknowledgment of guilt, it
          would have been a mere bathing of the person without spiritual
          significance, but the confession which went with it made it an
          instructive sign. John must have inwardly wondered to see the
          multitudes come, but his chief thought ran forward to his coming Lord.
          He thought more of Him than of “all Judea.
        </p>

        <h2>
          7.
          <em
            >But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his
            baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you
            to flee from the wrath to come?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          It was strange to see the proud Separatists and the skeptical
          Moralists come to be baptized and therefore, as a test, John addressed
          them with scorching words. He saw that they were serpentine in their
          motives and viperish in their tempers, and so he calls them, “progeny
          of vipers.” Thus would he see whether they were sincere or not. He
          asks who suggested to them to flee from that wrath of which he was the
          forerunner, according to the closing words of the Old Testament. This
          inquiry was not complimentary, but it is no business of the Lord’s
          servants to make themselves pleasing. They must be faithful and
          especially so to the great and learned. Thus faithful was John the
          Baptist and he was honored for it by Him that sent him.
        </p>

        <h2>8. <em>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance!</em></h2>
        <p>
          Act as a change of mind would lead you to do. Above all, quit the
          pride in which you enwrap yourselves and leave the serpent motives
          which now actuate you. Lord, save us from a fruitless repentance,
          which would be only an aggravation of our previous sins.
        </p>

        <h2>
          9.
          <em
            >Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I
            tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these
            stones.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Do not imagine that God needs you in order to fulfill His promise to
          His servant Abraham, for he can make each stone in Jordan into an heir
          of grace. Do not presume upon your ancestry and think that all the
          blessings of the coming kingdom must be yours because you are of the
          seed of the father of the faithful. God can as easily make sons of
          stones as of a generation of vipers. He will never be short of means
          for fulfilling His covenant, without bowing his Gospel before the
          caprice of vainglorious men. He will find a people in the slums if His
          Gospel is rejected by the respectable. Let none of us, because we are
          orthodox or exceedingly Scriptural in our religious observances, dream
          that we must, therefore, be in the favor of God and that we are under
          no necessity to repent. God can do without us, but we cannot do
          without repentance and the works which prove it true. What a blessing
          that He can transform hearts of stone into filial spirits! Wonders of
          grace to God belong!
        </p>

        <h2>
          10.
          <em
            >Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree
            that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and cast into the
            fire.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          He means, the King is come—the Cutter-down of every fruitless tree has
          arrived. The Great Woodman has thrown down His axe at “the root of the
          trees.” He lifts the axe. He strikes. The fruitless tree is felled. It
          is cast into the fire. The sketch is full of life. The Baptizer sees
          forests falling beneath the axe, for He whom he heralds will be the
          Judge of men and the Executioner of righteousness. What an
          announcement he had to make! What a scene his believing eye beheld!
          Our vision is much the same. The axe is still at work. Lord, cut me
          not down for the fire. I know that the absence of good fruit is as
          fatal as the presence of corrupt fruit. Lord, let me not be a mere
          negative, lest I be “hewn down, and cast into the fire.”
        </p>

        <h2>
          11.
          <em
            >I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes
            after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.
            He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          John could plunge the penitent into water, but a greater than he must
          baptize men into the Holy Ghost and into fire. Repentance is well
          attended by washing in water, but the true baptism of the believer by
          the Lord Jesus Himself brings us into spiritual floods of holy fire.
          John considered himself to be nothing more than a household slave,
          unworthy of the office of removing his Master’s sandals, and his
          baptism in water was as much inferior to the Spirit-baptism as a slave
          to his lord. Jesus is the divine Lord who covers us with the fiery
          influences of the Holy Spirit. Do we know this baptism? What is
          water-baptism without it? What are all the Johns in the world, with
          their baptisms in water, when compared with Jesus and His baptism into
          fire!
        </p>

        <h2>
          12.
          <em
            >His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse
            his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the
            chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          He sets forth his Lord under another figure—that of a Husbandman. This
          time He holds in His hand, not the axe, but the winnowing shovel.
          Pharisees, Sadducees, and all the rest, lie on his floor. It is with
          them he deals, “He will thoroughly purge his floor.” If they do not
          wish to be purified by Him, they should not be there. But there they
          are, and he deals with them. His fan is in his hand. He throws up the
          heap to the breeze that He may test and divide. His wheat He gathers,
          for this He seeks. The chaff is blown further off to the place where a
          fire is burning and so it is consumed out of the way by what he tells
          us is unquenchable fire. Our Lord’s teaching would act like a great
          winnowing fan, leaving the true by themselves and driving off the
          false and worthless to utter destruction. It was so in the life of our
          Lord. It is so every day where He is preached. He is the Great
          Divider. It is His Word which separates the sinners from the saints
          and gathers out a people for Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the herald prepared the people for the King, who would be the
          Cleanser, the Hewer, the Winnower. My soul, behold thy Lord under
          these aspects and reverence Him!
