        <h2>B. Birth of the King (1:18-25)</h2>

        <h2>
          18.
          <em
            >Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother,
            Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was
            found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          A word or two sufficed to describe the birth of all the kings whose
          names we have read, but for our Lord Jesus Christ there is much more
          to be said. The evangelist girds himself up for his solemn duty and
          writes, “Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.” It is a
          deep, mysterious, and delicate subject, fitter for reverent faith than
          for speculative curiosity. The Holy Ghost wrought in the chosen virgin
          the body of our Lord. There was no other way of His being born, for
          had He been of a sinful father, how should He have possessed a sinless
          nature? He is born of a woman, that He might be human, but not by man
          that He might not be sinful. See how the Holy Ghost co-operates in the
          work of our redemption by preparing the body of our Lord!
        </p>

        <h2>
          19.
          <em
            >Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make
            her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mary was espoused to him and he was saddened and perplexed when he
          learned that she would become a mother before they had been actually
          married. Many would have thrust her away in indignation and put her to
          an open shame, but Joseph was of royal mind as well as royal race. He
          would not expose what he thought to be the sin of his espoused
          wife—although he felt that she must be put away, he would do it
          quietly. When we have to do a severe thing, let us choose the
          tenderest manner. May be, we shall not have to do it at all.
        </p>

        <h2>
          20.
          <em
            >But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the
            Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David,
            don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that
            which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          He could not but feel very anxious and no doubt he prayed about these
          things both day and night. God would not leave the honor of the chosen
          virgin-mother without protection. Soon Joseph had the best of
          guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          From heaven, he had the assurance that Mary had not sinned, but had
          been favored of the Lord. Joseph is reminded of his royal rank, “thou
          son of David,” and is bidden to cast away his fear. How he must have
          been comforted by the Lord’s “fear not”! He was to take Mary under his
          tender care and be a foster-father to the Son who would be born of
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mary must have been in great anxiety herself as to whether her story
          of angelic visitation would be believed, for it looked improbable
          enough. We doubt not that faith sustained her, but she needed much of
          it. Every great favor brings a great trial with it as its shadow and
          becomes thus a new test of faith. The Lord very graciously removed all
          suspicion from Joseph’s mind and thus provided for the honor of the
          mother and for the comfort of the holy child. If Jesus is born in our
          hearts, we shall have trouble, but the Lord will witness that Christ
          is ours and He will surely bear us through.
        </p>

        <h2>
          21.
          <em
            >She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus,‡ for it is
            he who shall save his people from their sins.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Lord of glory is born the Son of man and is named by God’s
          command, and by man’s mouth, JESUS the Savior. He is what He is
          called.
        </p>
        <p>
          HE saves us from the punishment and the guilt of sin and then from the
          ill effect and evil power of sin. This He does for “his people,” even
          for all who believe in Him. It is His nature to do this, as we see in
          the fact that His very name is JESUS— Savior. We still call Him by
          that name, for He still saves us in these latter days. Let us go and
          tell out His name among men, for He will save others.
        </p>

        <h2>
          22-23.
          <em
            >Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was
            spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,<br />
            “Behold, the virgin shall be with child,<br />
            and shall give birth to a son.<br />
            They shall call his name Immanuel,”<br />
            which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Who would have thought that the prophecy contained in Isaiah 7:14
          could have referred to our Lord? One of these days, we shall discover
          a great deal more in the inspired Word than we can see today. Perhaps
          it is needful to our understanding a prophecy that we should see it
          actually fulfilled. What blind eyes we have!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is pleasant to mark that, according to this verse and the
          twenty-first, EMMANUEL and JESUS mean the same thing. “God with us” is
          our Savior. He is with us as God on purpose to save us. The
          incarnation of Jesus is our salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To cheer Joseph and decide his mind, Holy Scripture is brought to his
          remembrance and truly, when we are in a dilemma, nothing gives us such
          confidence in going forward as the sacred oracles impressed upon the
          heart. How conversant was Joseph with the prophets to have their words
          before him in a dream! Lord, whether I read Thy Word when awake or
          have it brought to my memory in my sleep, it is always precious to me!
          But Thou, Lord Jesus, God with us, art dearer still and the written
          Word is chiefly precious because it speaks of Thee, the incarnate
          Word.
        </p>

        <h2>
          24-25.
          <em
            >Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord
            commanded him, and took his wife to himself; and didn’t know her
            sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named
            him Jesus.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Joseph was not disobedient to the heavenly vision in any respect. He
          did not delay, but as soon as he rose he “did as the angel of the Lord
          had bidden him.” Without delay, demur, or reservation, he obeyed. What
          holy awe filled his heart as he welcomed the favored virgin to his
          home, to be respectfully and affectionately screened from all evil!
          What must he have thought when he saw the Son of the Highest lying on
          the bosom of her whom he had espoused! He was happy to render any
          service to the newborn King. Since he accepted Mary as his espoused
          wife, her child was the heir of Joseph and so of David, and thus was
          by right the King of the Jews. Our Lord Jesus had a birthright by His
          mother, but His right on the father’s side was, by Joseph’s act and
          deed, also put beyond dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us leave this wonderful passage worshipping the Son of God, who
          condescended to be born the Son of man. Thus our God became our
          brother, bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh. The nearer He comes
          to us, the more humbly let us adore Him. The more true the kinship of
          our King, the more enthusiastically let us crown Him Lord of all!
