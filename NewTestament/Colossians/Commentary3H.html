            IT is often a matter of complaint with some, that many who have been
            ordained to preach the Gospel leave the great and mysterious
            doctrines of the Gospel in the background, and bring forward little
            else than dry <i>morality</i>. But, whatever ground there may be for
            that complaint, it may be well to inquire, Whether there be not too
            much reason to complain of another class, who pay such exclusive
            attention to the <i> doctrines</i>, as almost entirely to overlook
            the duties, of the Gospel? Among some it would be almost thought
            superfluous, and even wrong, to devote an entire discourse to the
            subject of moral duties; since, according to their views, the
            discharge of them may well be left to the simple operation of faith,
            without any distinct statement of them from the teachers of
            Christianity.

            But the Apostle Paul did not think so. On the contrary, in those two
            epistles (to the Ephesians, and Colossians) in which he enters most
            deeply into the mysteries of Christianity, he enlarges most fully on
            the relative duties. We are persuaded that a similar plan ought to
            be adopted by every minister of Christ. We should have no exclusive
            preference for doctrines or duties, but would put each in their
            place, and bring them both forward in their proper season. Convinced
            of this, we enter with great pleasure on the consideration of our
            <u>relative duties</u>; that is, of the duties,

            It is worthy of observation, that, not in this place only, but in
            all other places where the Apostles speak of the relative duties,
            they mention those of the inferior first. The reason of this seems
            to be, that the duties of the inferior arise solely from the command
            of God, and are totally independent of the conduct of the superior;
            so that no neglect of duty on the one part can justify any neglect
            of it on the other. Agreeably therefore to the Apostolic plan, we
            shall notice the duty,

            is indeed exceedingly great: it reaches to everything that is not
            contrary to the will of God: it is, if I may so speak, co-extensive

            I am aware that this expression is very strong; but I conceive it is
            not at all stronger than the declarations of Paul. True, in the text
            it is only said, "Submit yourselves, as it is fitting in the Lord:"
            but in the Epistle to the Ephesians he draws the very parallel that
            I have drawn, and shows that your duty to your husband corresponds
            exactly with the Church's duty to the Lord Jesus Christ: "Wives,
            submit yourselves to your own husbands, <u>as</u> unto the Lord: for
            the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of
            the Church: and he is the Savior of the body. Therefore, as the
            Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own
            husbands in everything,

            imperious behavior towards them is most offensive to God, who will
            regard every harsh, bitter, or contemptuous expression towards them
            as an abuse of your authority and a violation of his commands.
            Though he has constituted you <i>lords</i>, he has not authorized
            you to be <i>tyrants</i>; but requires you to be precisely such
            lords over your wives, as Christ is over his Church. You are to
            govern, it is true; but you are to govern only for the good of the
            wife; you are to seek only, and at all times, her best interests,
            and to promote to the utmost of your power her real happiness. You
            must not require anything unreasonable at her hands, nor ever fail
            to recompense with testimonies of your love, the efforts which she
            makes to please you. Nor must you merely endeavor to render her
            happy, but you must be ready to make great sacrifices for this end.

          <p align="justify">
            What the Lord Jesus Christ has done for his Church, is set forth as
            the proper model and pattern of your duty towards your wife:
            "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church,
            and gave himself for it." O! what an example is here! Methinks, no
            wife would complain of the obedience that is required of her, if the
            authority of her husband were exercised in such a way as this! On
            the contrary, obedience on her part would be her chief delight.

          <p align="justify">
            Know then, you husbands, that this is the duty assigned to you: if
            your wives are to be obedient, as the Church is to Christ—then you
            also on your part are to be loving, even as Christ is to the Church.
            Your wives should be to you as your own flesh. "Now no man ever yet
            hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the
            Lord does the Church,

            Obedience is your duty also: nor is there any limit to the exercise
            of this duty, except where you are required to violate a command of
            God. Reason indeed is sufficient to teach you this: for your own
            ignorance and inexperience must of necessity direct you to look up
            to your parents for instruction and guidance. But Scripture teaches
            you to regard the authority of your parents as God's authority, and
            to consider obedience to them as obedience to him. In fulfilling the
            commands of parents, there should be no reluctance: on the contrary,
            to please, and serve, and honor his parents would be the desire and
            delight of every child. He should have no wish to shake off their
            yoke; no desire to act independently of them.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor let this be thought hard: for God has annexed a special promise

            does rest in a more especial manner, throughout the whole of their
            lives, on those who have honored and obeyed their earthly parents.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            This may be accounted for on natural principles; for the
            dispositions which are exercised in filial obedience argue a degree
            of self-government, which will go far to render a man both amiable
            and prosperous in every situation and condition of life. But besides
            this, the blessing of God will assuredly rest on such characters;
            and He, as the universal Parent, will recompense into their bosom
            their compliance with this command.

          <p align="justify">
            Both in the text, and in the parallel passage in the Epistle to the
            Ephesians, there is a restraint laid on parents with regard to the
            exercise of their authority: it is not to be attended with harshness
            or severity, "lest they provoke their children to anger, and
            discourage them" from attempting to fulfill their duty, under the
            idea, that, whatever efforts they may use to please their parents,
            it will he a hopeless task.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Parents have much to answer for, when they produce such an effect as
            this on their children's minds. If on the one hand it be said, that
            "there is much folly in the heart of a child, and that the rod of
            correction must drive it out;" it must be remembered, on the other
            hand, that the mind of a child may soon be cast down, and that we
            may by harsh restrictions and undue severity augment that very
            rebellion which we endeavor to subdue.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            There can be no doubt but that many parents harden their children's
            hearts against their authority in the first instance, and ultimately
            against the authority of God himself, purely by the
            <i>tyranny </i>which they exercise, and by the continual irritations
            which they occasion. That is a humiliating view which the Apostle
            gives of parents, but, alas! how true in too many instances,

            <i> example </i>which we are to follow in every part of our conduct
            both towards God and man.

            Behold him as a son and a servant; what an entire devotion was there
            in him to his Father's will! It was his food and drink to do it.

            View him also as the Husband and Lord of his Church; what
            inconceivable love and kindness does he exercise towards her at all
            times, notwithstanding her innumerable defects! Let us then study
            his character; and whether we move in the higher or inferior
            relation, let it be the one aim of our lives to walk in his steps,
            and to follow his example.

            Now I grant that there are many who discharge in a most commendable
            manner their relative duties, while yet they have no regard for God
            in their hearts. Consequently, I cannot exactly say that the
            fulfillment of relative duties will stamp you as pious characters:
            but this I must say, that the <i>not </i> discharging of these
            aright will prove to demonstration, either that "your religion is
            altogether vain," or that it is at a very low ebb indeed.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But supposing that there be no manifest neglect of these duties, I
            would ask: How much is there of God in them? Is the authority which
            you either obey or exercise, regarded as God's? Is
            <i>his will </i> considered as the rule of all that you do, and
            <i>his glory </i>as the end? Here is the point to be inquired into:
            it is this which makes your actions pleasing and acceptable to him:
            and I may add, that it is this which will make obedience easy and
            delightful to yourselves.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Habituate yourselves then to realize the thought that it is Christ
            whom you serve, or in whose place you stand while others are serving
            you. So shall your whole deportment become exquisitely pure, and
            holy, and refined; and you will "adorn the doctrine of God our
            Savior in all things!"
