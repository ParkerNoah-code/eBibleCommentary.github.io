        <h2>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h2>
        <p>
          There were three neighboring cities in Phrygia, as made mention of by
          Paul in this Epistle -- Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colosse which, as
          Orosius informs us, were overthrown by an earthquake till the times of
          the emperor Nero. Accordingly, not long after this Epistle was
          written, three Churches of great renown perished by a mournful as well
          as horrible occurrence -- a bright mirror truly of divine judgment, if
          we had but eyes to see it. The Colossians had been instructed in the
          gospel by Epaphras and other ministers; but immediately afterwards,
          Satan had, with his tares, crept in, (Mat 13:25), according to his
          usual and invariable manner, that he might there pervert the right
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some are of opinion that there were two classes of men that endeavored
          to draw aside the Colossians from the purity of the gospel; -- that,
          on the one hand, the philosophers, by disputing in reference to stars,
          fate, and trifles of a like nature, and that the Jews, on the other
          hand, by urging the observance of their ceremonies, had raised up many
          mists with the view of throwing Christ into the shade. Those who are
          of this opinion are influenced by a conjecture on the ground that Paul
          makes mention of <em>thrones</em>, and <em>powers</em>, and
          <em>elements</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is abundantly evident, from Paul's words, that those profligates
          were intent upon this -- that they might mix up Christ with Moses, and
          might retain the shadows of the law along with the gospel. Hence it is
          probable that they were Jews. As, however, they coloured over their
          fallacies with specious disguises, Paul, on this account, calls it a
          vain philosophy. (Col 2:8) At the same time, in employing that term,
          he had in his eye, in my opinion, the speculations with which they
          amused themselves, which were subtle, it is true, but at the same time
          useless and profane: for they contrived a way of access to God through
          means of angels, and put forth many speculations of that nature. This,
          therefore, is the principal object at which he aims -- to teach that
          all things are in Christ, and that he alone ought to be reckoned amply
          sufficient by the Colossians.
        </p>
        <h2>Structure and Outline</h2>
        <p>
          After the inscription usually employed by him, he commends them, with
          the view of leading them to listen to him more attentively. He then,
          with the view of shutting up the way against all new and strange
          contrivances, bears testimony to the doctrine which they had
          previously received from Epaphras. Afterwards, in entreating that the
          Lord would increase their faith, he intimates that something is still
          wanting to them, that he may pave the way for imparting to them more
          solid instruction. On the other hand, he extols with suitable
          commendations the grace of God towards them, that they may not lightly
          esteem it. Then follows the instruction, in which he teaches that all
          parts of our salvation are to be found in Christ alone, that they may
          not seek anything elsewhere; and he puts them in mind that it was in
          Christ that they had obtained every blessing that they possessed, in
          order that they might the more carefully make it their aim to retain
          him to the end.
