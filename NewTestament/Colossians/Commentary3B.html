            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>As therefore you received Christ Jesus the Lord</em>. Receiving
            Christ is believing in him: faith is the eye of the soul, that sees
            the beauty, glory, fulness, and suitableness of Christ; the foot
            that goes to him, and the hand that takes hold on him, and the arm
            that receives and embraces him; so that this is not a receiving him
            into the head by notion, but into the heart by faith; and not in
            part only, but in whole: faith receives a whole Christ, his person
            as God and man; him in all his offices, as prophet, priest, and
            King; particularly as a Saviour and Redeemer, he being under that
            character so exceeding suitable to the case of a sensible sinner;
            and it receives all blessings of grace along with him, from him, and
            through him; as a justifying righteousness, remission of sins,
            adoption of children, grace for grace, and an inheritance among all
            them that are sanctified; and both Christ and them, as the free
            grace gifts of God; which men are altogether undeserving of, and
            cannot possibly give any valuable consideration for.
          </p>
          <p>
            So these Colossians had received Christ gladly, joyfully, willingly,
            and with all readiness; and especially as "the Lord", on which there
            is a peculiar emphasis in the text; they had received him and
            believed in him, as the one and only Lord and head of the church; as
            the one and only Mediator between God and man, to the exclusion of
            angels, the worship of which the false teachers were introducing;
            they had received the doctrines of Christ, and not the laws of
            Moses, which judaizing preachers were desirous of joining with them;
            they had heard and obeyed the Son, and not the servant; they had
            submitted to the authority of Christ as King of saints, and had been
            subject to his ordinances; wherefore the apostle exhorts them to
            continue and go on, believing in him, and holding to him the head.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Walk in him</em>. Not only in imitation of him as he walked, in
            the exercise of grace, as love, patience, humility, and meekness,
            and in the discharge of duty; but by faith in him, going on in a way
            of believing in him, always looking to him, leaning on him, and
            deriving grace and strength from him: to walk in Christ, is to walk
            in and after the Spirit of Christ, under his influence, by his
            direction, and through his assistance; and to walk in the doctrine
            of Christ, abiding by it, and increasing in the knowledge of it; and
            to walk in the ordinances of Christ, which with ills presence and
            spirit, are ways of pleasantness and paths of peace: particularly
            here it may signify, to make use of Christ, and walk on in him, as
            the way, truth, and the life; as the only way of access to God, and
            acceptance with him; as the way of salvation, as the only true way
            to eternal life and happiness, in opposition to every creature,
            angels, or men; the worshipping of the one, or works done by the
            other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Rooted and built up in him</em>. By these metaphors, the apostle
            expresses the safe and happy state of these believers; and which he
            makes use of as arguments, to engage them to walk on in Christ, and
            as pointing out the manner in which they should. Believers are
            sometimes compared to trees, and are trees of righteousness, the
            planting of the Lord; and their root is Christ, from whence as such
            they spring, and by whom they are filled with the fruits of
            righteousness; in him they are to abide, keep close unto him, and
            walk in him; deriving all their life, nourishment, fruitfulness,
            grace, and perseverance in it, from him as their root: they are also
            sometimes compared to a building, to an house, a temple, an
            habitation for God; and Christ is the sure and only foundation on
            which they are laid, and where they are safe and secure; and, being
            fitly joined together, grow up as an holy temple to the Lord; and
            this being their case, they are to go on laying the whole stress of
            their salvation on him, building their faith and hope of eternal
            glory entirely upon him; and building up one another also on their
            most holy faith, of which he is the substance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And established in the faith</em>. That of Christ, or in the
            doctrine of faith which respects Christ: the apostle here expresses
            the same thing without a figure, which he had signified by the two
            foregoing metaphors, and explains what he means by them; namely,
            that they were well settled and grounded in their faith in Christ,
            and thoroughly instructed and established in the doctrines of the
            Gospel; and a very good thing it is to have the heart established
            with grace, both as a principle and a doctrine; which is God's work,
            and was the happy case of these persons; wherefore it became them to
            act as such, and not be like children tossed to and fro with every
            wind of doctrine, or carried about with divers and strange
            doctrines, but abide by those which had been preached to them by the
            faithful ministers of Christ, and they had received.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Even as you were taught</em>. By Epaphras their minister, and
            others; and therefore should not listen to false teachers, and to a
            contrary doctrine taught by them; considering of whom they had
            learnt the true doctrine, what evidence it carried with it, and what
            use it had been of to them, in convincing, converting, comforting,
            instructing, and establishing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Abounding in it in thanksgiving</em>. That is, in the faith; as
            in the grace, so in the doctrine of faith; for as saints are to
            abound in the work of the Lord, and in every good work, and in the
            exercise of every grace, so in the knowledge of truth; see 2
            Corinthians 8:7; and to make use of all means for the increase of,
            and growth in Gospel grace and light, and the knowledge of a
            crucified Christ, which is meant by abounding: for all which there
            is great reason for thanksgiving; both for the unspeakable gift of
            Christ, who is received as such by faith, and in whom believers are
            rooted and built up; and for faith itself, which is the gift of God;
            and also for the Gospel, and the truths of it; and for every degree
            of spiritual light in it, and knowledge of it.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Be careful that you don’t let anyone rob you</em>. Or despoil
            you; rob you of the rich treasure of the Gospel, strip you of your
            spiritual armour, take away from you the truths and doctrines of
            Christ, and divest you of your spiritual privileges and blessings;
            suggesting, that the false teachers were thieves and robbers, and
            men of prey: or drive and carry you away as spoils, as the innocent
            harmless sheep are drove, and carried away by wolves, and by the
            thief that comes to steal, to kill, and destroy; intimating, that
            such as these were the heretics of those times; wherefore it became
            them to be upon their guard, to watch, look out, and beware, lest
            they should be surprised by these deceitful workers, who lay in wait
            to deceive; were wolves in sheep's clothing, who transformed
            themselves into the apostles of Christ; and therefore it became them
            to take heed, lest any man hurt them, be he ever so wise and
            learned, or be thought ever so good, religious, and sincere; since
            men of this cast put on such masks and false appearances, on purpose
            to beguile. The things by which they imposed upon weak minds are as
            follow, and therefore to be shunned, avoided, and rejected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through his philosophy</em>. Not right philosophy, or true
            wisdom, the knowledge of God, of the things of nature, of things
            natural, moral, and civil; which may be attained unto by the use of
            reason, and light of nature. The apostle does not mean to condemn
            all arts and sciences, as useless and hurtful, such as natural
            philosophy in its various branches, ethics, logic, rhetoric, c. when
            kept within due bounds, and in their proper place and sphere for
            with instances of these the Scriptures themselves abound; but he
            means that philosophy, or science, which is falsely so called, the
            false notions of philosophers;
          </p>
          <p>
            Such as the eternity of matter, and of this world, the mortality of
            souls, the worshipping of demons and angels, c. and also such
            principles in philosophy, which in themselves, and in the things of
            nature, are true, but, when applied to divine things, to things
            above nature, the mere effects of divine power and grace, and of
            pure revelation, are false as that out of nothing, nothing can be
            made, which in the things of nature is true, but not to be applied
            to the God of nature, who has made the world out of nothing; as also
            that from a privation to an habit there is no return, which is
            naturally true, but not to be applied to supernatural things, and
            supernatural agency; witness the miracles of Christ, in restoring
            sight to the blind, life to the dead, c. and therefore is not to be
            employed against the resurrection of the dead: philosophy may be
            useful as an handmaid it is not to be a mistress in theological
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may subserve, but not govern; it is not to be made use of as a
            judge, or rule in such matters; the natural man, on these
            principles, neither knows nor receives the things of the Spirit of
            God; judgment is not to be made and formed according to them; as of
            a trinity of persons in the Godhead; of the sonship of Christ, and
            his incarnation; of man's redemption by him, of reconciliation and
            satisfaction by his blood and sacrifice, of the pardon of sin, of a
            sinner's justification, of the resurrection of the dead, and such
            like articles of faith: that philosophy which is right, can only be
            a rule of judgment in things relating to it, and not in those which
            are out of its sphere: in a word, the apostle here condemns the
            philosophy of the Jews, and of the Gnostics; the former had
            introduced natural philosophy into the worship and service of God,
            and the things appertaining to their religion; and had made the
            tabernacle and temple, and the most holy place, and the things
            belonging thereunto, emblems and hieroglyphics of natural things; as
            of the sun, moon, and stars, and their influences, and of the four
            elements, and of moral virtue, c. as appears from the writings of
            Josephus r, and Philo s when they were types and representatives of
            spiritual things under the Gospel dispensation; and the latter had
            brought in the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato, concerning
            abstinences, purgations, sacrifices, and ceremonies of worship,
            given to demons and angels.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, the apostle's meaning is, that philosophy is not to be
            mixed with the pure Gospel of Christ; it has always been fatal to
            it; witness the school of Pantaenus in Alexandria, in the early
            times of Christianity, by which the simplicity of the Gospel was
            greatly corrupted; and the race of schoolmen a few centuries ago,
            who introduced the philosophy of Aristotle, Averrois, and others,
            into all the subjects of divinity: to observe no more, such kind of
            philosophy is here meant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vain deceit</em>. That is, that which is vain and empty, and has
            no solid foundation, even in nature and reason itself; and which
            being applied to divine things and religious observances, is
            deceitful and delusory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>After the tradition of men</em>. Either of the Gentiles, who had
            their traditions in religion; or of the Jews, called the traditions
            of the elders, and of the fathers, which the Pharisees were fond of,
            by which they transgressed the commandments of God; which the
            apostle was brought up in, and was zealous of formerly, but now was
            delivered from, and rightly condemned as idle, trifling, and
            pernicious.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>After the elemental spirits of the world</em>. Not the four
            elements of earth, air, fire, and water; or the worship of the sun,
            moon, and stars, c. among the idolatrous Gentiles, but the
            ceremonial laws of the Jews see Galatians 4:8; which were that to
            them in religion, as the A B C, or letters, are in grammar, the
            elements and rudiments of it; and though these were to them, when
            children, useful, but now under the Gospel dispensation are weak,
            beggarly, and useless, and not to be attended to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And not after Christ</em>. What he has taught and prescribed,
            the doctrines and commandments of Christ, the treasures of wisdom
            and knowledge which are in him; and therefore all such vain and
            deceitful philosophy, human traditions, and worldly rudiments, are
            to be rejected; Christ and his Gospel, the revelation he has made,
            are the standard of doctrine and worship; he only is to be heard and
            attended to, and whatever it contrary thereunto is to be guarded
            against.

            <em>For in him all the fullness of the Deity dwells bodily</em>.
            This is to be understood, not of the doctrine, or Gospel of Christ,
            as being a perfect revelation of the will of God; but of Christ, and
            particularly of his human nature, as consisting of a true body and a
            reasonable soul, in which the Godhead dwells in a most eminent
            manner: God indeed is everywhere by his powerful presence, was in
            the tabernacle and temple in a very singular manner, and dwells in
            the saints in a way of special grace; but resides in the human
            nature of Christ, in the highest and most exalted manner; that is to
            deity what the human body is to an human soul, it is the house in
            which it dwells: so Philo the Jew t calls the "Logos" the house of
            God, who is the soul of the universe; and elsewhere says u, that God
            himself has filled the divine Logos wholly with incorporeal powers.

          <p>
            The Godhead dwells in Christ as in a tabernacle, in allusion to the
            tabernacle of Moses, which looked mean without side, but glorious
            within; where God granted his presence, and accepted the sacrifices
            of his people; the human nature of Christ is the true antitypical
            tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man; and sometimes is called
            a temple, in allusion to Solomon's; and which is filled with the
            train of the divine perfections, signified by fulness here: for not
            the fulness of grace, or a communicative fulness, is here meant; nor
            the relative fulness, the church; but the fulness of the divine
            nature, of all the perfections of deity, such as eternity,
            immensity, omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, immutability,
            necessary and self existence, and every other; for if anyone
            perfection was wanting, the fulness, much less all the fulness of
            the Godhead, would not be in him.

          <p>
            The act of inhabitation denotes the union of the two natures in
            Christ, and expresses the distinction of them; and is to be
            understood of the Godhead, as subsisting in the person of the Son of
            God, and not as subsisting in the person of the Father, or of the
            Spirit; and shows the permanency of this union, it is a perpetual
            abiding one; and this fulness is not dependent on the Father's
            pleasure; it is not said of this as of another fulness, Colossians
            1:19; that it pleased the Father that it should dwell in him: the
            manner in which it dwells, is "bodily"; not by power, as in the
            universe; nor by grace, as in the saints; nor by any glorious
            emanations of it, as in heaven; nor by gifts, as in the prophets and
            eminent men of God; nor by signs symbols, and shadows, as in the
            tabernacle and temple; but essentially and personally, or by
            personal union of the divine nature, as subsisting in the Son of God
            to an human body, chosen and prepared for that purpose, together
            with a reasonable human soul; which is the great mystery of
            godliness, the glory of the Christian religion, and what qualified
            Christ for, and recommends him to us as a Saviour; and is a reason
            why, as these words are, that the Gospel should be abode by,
            continued in, and that with thankfulness: nor should any regard be
            had to vain and deceitful philosophy, to the traditions of men, or
            rudiments of the world: Christ only is to be looked to, attended,
            and followed, who has all fulness in him.

            <em>And in him you are made full</em>. Or "filled up", or "filled
            full" in him; that is, are perfect in him: saints are in Christ, and
            all fulness being in him, they are full too, of as much as they
            stand in need, and are capable of containing: for these words are
            not an exhortation to perfection, as the Arabic version reads then,
            be ye complete in him, like those in Genesis 17:1; but are an
            affirmation, asserting not what the saints shall be hereafter, or in
            heaven, but what they now are; not in themselves, for in themselves
            none are perfect, not even those who are truly sanctified.

            For though all grace is seminally implanted in them, and they have a
            perfection of parts, of all the parts of the new man, or new
            creature, and are perfect in comparison of what they sometimes were,
            and of profane persons and hypocrites, and with respect to weaker
            believers, yet none are absolutely perfect; the good work of grace
            is not yet finished in them, sin dwells in them, they are full of
            wants and complaints; the best of them disclaim perfection as
            attained to by them, and express their desires of it; but they are
            perfect in Christ their head, who has all fulness in him, in whom
            they are chosen and blessed: they are complete and perfect in him as
            to sanctification.
          </p>
          <p>
            He having all fulness of grace and holiness for them, they have it
            in him; and he is made perfect sanctification to them: and as to
            justification, he has perfectly fulfilled the law for them, he has
            made full atonement for sin, has obtained eternal redemption,
            brought in a complete and perfect righteousness, by which they are
            justified from all things; are freed from sin, and made perfectly
            comely, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: and as to
            knowledge, though it is imperfect in them in their present state,
            yet in Christ all the treasures of it are, and they have no need to
            go elsewhere for any; they are filled with the knowledge of God and
            of his will, and are complete therein in Christ; and what knowledge
            they have, is eternal life, the beginning, pledge, and earnest of
            it; so that they have no reason to be beholden to angels or men,
            only to Christ.

            <em>Who is the head of all principality and power</em>. Not only of
            the body the church, and who is to be held unto as such, from whom
            all light, life, grace, and strength, are to be derived; but of all
            others, though in a different sense; and not only of the kings,
            princes, and potentates of this world, who hold their kingdoms, and
            receive their crowns from him, and rule by him; but also of the
            angels, good and bad, often called principalities and powers;
            especially the former is here meant, of whom Christ is head, being
            their Creator, Governor, and upholder; who not only maintains them
            in their beings, but has confirmed them in their state of holiness;
            so that they are dependent upon him, and beholden to him for all
            they have and are: with the Jews, "Metatron", which with them is the
            name of the angel in Exodus 23:20 and seems to be a corruption of
            the word "mediator", and to design the Messiah, is said w to be King
            over all the angels. This is mentioned, partly to set forth the
            glory and excellency of Christ; and partly against worshipping of
            angels, making use of them as mediators, or applying to them on any
            account, since Christ is the head of these, and of every creature;
            therefore no creature is to be looked and applied unto, trusted and
            depended on: unless rather should be meant the Jewish rulers,
            Scribes, and Pharisees, their doctors, wise men, and Rabbins, called
            the princes of this world; the Jews' tutors and governors, to whom
            Christ is superior; he is the only master and Father, and in whom
            perfection of wisdom is, and not in them; and therefore should not
            regard them, their vain philosophy, worldly rudiments and
            traditions.

            <em>In him you were also circumcised</em>. This is said to prevent
            an objection that might be made to the perfection of these Gentile
            believers, because they were not circumcised; for the Jews thought
            that perfection lay in circumcision, at least that there could be no
            perfection without it:
          </p>
          <p>
            "great is circumcision (say they x), for notwithstanding all the
            commands which Abraham our father did, he was not called perfect
            until he was circumcised; as it is written, Genesis 17:1; 'walk
            before me, and be thou perfect:'"
          </p>
          <p>
            which objection the apostle anticipates, by observing, that they
            were circumcised in Christ their head, who is made unto them
            sanctification; and by him as the meritorious and efficient cause of
            their regeneration and conversion, or internal circumcision, the
            antitype and perfection of circumcision in the flesh; for the
            former, and not the latter, is here meant: these believers were
            circumcised in Christ, or by him; not with external circumcision,
            which was peculiar to the Jews, the natural seed of Abraham,
            prefigured Christ, and had its accomplishment in him, the body and
            substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law; and so was now
            nothing, either to Jew or Gentile: as for the Gentiles, they never
            were obliged unto it; and as for the Jews, it was an insupportable
            yoke to them, binding them to keep the whole law of Moses, which
            they could not do, and so it made nothing perfect; but Christ the
            substance of that, and the end of the whole law, has, the head of
            the body the church, in whom all the members of it are complete, and
            are circumcised.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>With a circumcision not made with hands</em>. Which is that of
            the heart, in the spirit; every man, though he may be circumcised in
            the flesh, is uncircumcised in heart, until he is circumcised by
            Christ and his Spirit; which is done, when he is pricked to the
            heart, and thoroughly convinced of sin, and the exceeding sinfulness
            of it; when the callousness and hardness of his heart is taken off
            and removed, and the iniquity of it is, laid open, the plague and
            corruption in it discerned, and all made naked and bare to the
            sinner's view; and when he is in pain on account of it, is broken
            and groans under a sense of it, and is filled with shame for it, and
            loathing and abhorrence of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now this is effected not "by the hand of man", as the Ethiopic
            version reads it, as outward circumcision was; this is not done by
            any creature whatever; not by angels, who rejoice at the repentance
            of sinners, but cannot produce it; nor by ministers of the Gospel,
            who at most are but instruments of regeneration and conversion; nor
            by men themselves; this is not by might or power of man, by the
            strength of his free will, but by the Spirit of God: for though men
            are sometimes exhorted to circumcise themselves, as in Deuteronomy
            10:16, in order to convince them of the corruption of their nature,
            and the need they stand in of spiritual circumcision; yet whereas
            there is an utter disability in them to effect it, and they need the
            power and grace of God for that purpose, the Lord has graciously
            promised his people to do it himself for them, Deuteronomy 30:6; so
            that this circumcision is in the name sense made without hands, as
            the human nature of Christ is said to be a tabernacle not made with
            hands, that, is of men, but of God, being what God has pitched, and
            not man; and it stands opposed to circumcision in the flesh, which
            was made with hands, Ephesians 2:11; and by some instrument, as a
            sharp knife or stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh</em>.
            The Vulgate Latin version leaves out the word "sins", and so the
            Alexandrian copy and some others; and the Syriac version the word
            "body": by "the flesh" is meant corrupt nature, which is born of the
            flesh, and propagated in a carnal way, and is the source and spring
            of all sin; by "the sins" of it are intended the works of the flesh,
            the inward motions of sin in the members, and the outward actions of
            it: these are said to be a "body", because sin consists of various
            parts and members, as a body does; and these united together, and
            which receive frequent and daily additions; and which are committed
            and yielded to by the members of the natural body; and which body
            and bulk of sins arising from the corruption of nature are compared
            to a garment, and a very filthy one it is; in the putting off of
            which lies spiritual circumcision: this is done several ways; partly
            by Christ's wrapping himself in the sins of his people, bearing them
            in his body, and becoming a sacrifice for them, whereby the old man
            was crucified, and the body of sin destroyed; and by an application
            of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, to the consciences of
            his people, whereby their iniquities are caused to pass from them,
            and they are clothed with change of raiment; and by the power of his
            Spirit, laying sin under the restraints of grace, not suffering it
            to have dominion, but causing grace to reign through righteousness;
            and by the saints themselves, under the influence of grace, who put
            off the old man with his deeds, according to the former
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the circumcision of Christ</em>. Not that with which Christ
            was circumcised at eight days old, that he might appear to be truly
            man, and a son of Abraham, and under the law, and to fulfil all the
            righteousness of it, but that which he by his Spirit is the author
            of, and what is before expressed.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Having been buried with him in baptism</em>. The apostle goes on
            to observe how complete and perfect the saints are in Christ; that
            they are not only circumcised in him in a spiritual sense, and the
            body of the sins of their flesh is put off, and removed from them,
            in allusion to the cutting off and casting away of the foreskin in
            circumcision; but that they and all their sins were buried with
            Christ, of which their baptism in water was a lively representation:
            Christ having died for their sins, was laid in the grave, where he
            continued for a while, and then rose again; and as they were
            crucified with him, they were also buried with him, as their head
            and representative; and all their sins too, which he left behind him
            in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there; and baptism
            being performed by immersion, when the person baptized is covered
            with water, and as it were buried in it, is a very significant
            emblem of all this; it is a representation of the burial of Christ,
            and very fitly holds him forth to the view of faith in the state of
            the dead, in the grave, and points out the place where the Lord lay;
            and it is also a representation of our burial with him, as being
            dead to sin, to the law, and to the world, by him. This shows now,
            that baptism was performed by dipping, or covering the whole body in
            water, for no other form of administration of baptism, as
            sprinkling, or pouring water on the face, can represent a burial, or
            be called one; and this is what many learned interpreters own, and
            observe on this place.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In which you were also raised with him</em>. Christ is risen
            from the dead as the head and representative of his people, and they
            are risen with him; and their baptism is also an emblem of his and
            their resurrection, being administered by immersion, in which way
            only this can be signified; for as the going down into the water,
            and being under it, represents Christ's descending into the state of
            the dead, and his continuance in it, so the emersion, or coming up
            out of the water, represents his rising from the dead, and that of
            his people in him, in order to walk in newness of life; for the
            apostle's meaning is, that in baptism saints are risen with Christ,
            as well as in it buried with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through faith in the working of God</em>. That is, it is through
            faith that saints see themselves buried and risen with Christ, to
            which the ordinance of baptism is greatly assisting, where there is
            true faith; for otherwise, without faith, this ordinance will be of
            no use to any such end and purpose; and it is not any faith that
            will avail, but that which is of God's operation; faith is not
            naturally in men, all men have it not; and those that have it, have
            it not of themselves, it is the gift of God; it is what be works in
            them, and by his power performs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who raised him from the dead</em>. This is a periphrasis of God
            the Father, to whom the resurrection of Christ from the dead is
            generally ascribed; though not to the exclusion of Christ, and of
            the Spirit, who were also concerned; and is here added, partly to
            show in what respect faith, which is God's work, has him for its
            object, as having raised Christ from the dead, who was delivered for
            offences, but is risen again through the power of God for
            justification, and whoever with his heart believes this shall be
            saved; and partly to show, that the same power is exerted in working
            true faith in the heart, as was put forth in raising Christ from the
            dead.

          <p>
            <em>You were dead through your trespasses</em>. Not corporeally,

            were really mortal, and in a little time must die; but morally, sin
            had brought a death upon them in a moral sense, they were separated
            from God, as at death the body is from the soul, and so were
            alienated from the life of God, and consequently must be dead; they
            had lost the image of God, which consisted in knowledge,
            righteousness, and holiness; and were dead as to the understanding
            of what was good, as to their affections for it, or will and
            capacity to do it; and, like dead men, were insensible of their
            state, their sin, and misery; and altogether inactive and helpless
            in spiritual things, being destitute of spiritual life, strength,
            and motion; and were moreover in themselves deserving of eternal
            death, and according to the law of works, under the sentence of it,
            and so liable and exposed unto it; and all this for, and on account
            of their sins, their actual sins and transgressions here meant;
            which separated them from God, deformed his image in them, and
            hardened their hearts, that they had no true sight and sense of
            themselves; as also on account of the corruption of their nature,

            not literally, for the prepuce, or foreskin of their flesh, which
            was a sign and token of the corruption of nature, but figuratively
            that itself; it being usual with the Jews to call the vitiosity of
            nature ערל, "uncircumcision"; which, they say y, is one of the seven
            names of יצר רע, "the evil imagination", or corrupt nature, denoting
            the pollution, loathsomeness, and abominableness of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>He made you alive together with him</em>. That is, with Christ;
            this may be understood either of the quickening of them in
            conversion and sanctification; for as they were dead in sin in a
            moral sense, in conversion a principle of life was implanted in
            them, or grace, as a living principle, was wrought in their souls by
            the Spirit of life from Christ; so that they could see their lost
            state, their need of Christ, the glory of his person and
            righteousness, the fulness and suitableness of his grace; feel their
            burdens, and handle the word of life; could hear the Gospel, speak
            the language of Canaan, breathe in prayer and spiritual desires,
            walk in Christ, and do all things through him; and this was God's
            act and not theirs, and owing to his rich mercy and great love: and
            this may be said to be done "with Christ", because this is in
            consequence of his being quickened, or raised from the dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            And by it they were made partakers of the life of Christ, they
            became one spirit with him; and it was not so much they that lived,
            but Christ lived in them; and besides, they were quickened, in order
            to live a life of grace and communion with him here, and of glory
            hereafter: or it may be interpreted of the quickening of them in
            justification; and the rather, because of what is said in the next
            clause; and that either openly, as when a sinner is convinced that
            he is dead in a legal sense, and faith is wrought in him to behold
            pardon and righteousness in Christ; upon which he prays for the one,
            and pleads the other; and the Spirit of God seals unto him the
            pardon of his sins, brings near the righteousness of Christ, enables
            him to lay hold on it as his, and pronounces him justified by it;
            and may well be called justification of life, for he is then alive
            in a legal sense, in his own comfortable view and apprehension of
            things: or secretly in Christ, as the head and representative of all
            his people; who when he was quickened, they were quickened with him;
            when he rose from the dead, they rose with him; and when he was
            justified, they were instilled in him, and this seems to be the true
            sense of this passage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Having forgiven us all our trespasses</em>. This was a past act,
            being done and over; not only at first conversion, when a discovery
            of it was made, but at the death of Christ, whose blood was shed for
            the remission of sin; yea, even as early as Christ became a surety,
            when the sins of his people were not imputed to them, but to him:
            and this was a single act, and done and complete at once;
            forgiveness of sin is not done by piecemeals, or at different times,
            or by divers acts, but is done at once, and includes sin past,
            present, and to come; and is universal, reaches to all sin, original
            and actual, before and after conversion; sins of thought, word, and
            action: and this is God's act, and his only; not men, nor ministers,
            nor angels, can forgive sin; this is the peculiar prerogative of
            God, and is owing to his abundant mercy and free grace, and which is
            signified by the word here used. The Syriac and Arabic versions
            read, "having forgiven us all our trespasses"; and so the
            Alexandrian copy, and some others, read "us" instead of "you".

            <em>Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances</em>. Various are the
            senses interpreters give of these words; some think by the
            handwriting is meant the covenant God made with Adam, Genesis 2:17,
            which being broken, obliged him and all his posterity to the penalty
            of death, but is cancelled and abolished by Christ; others, the
            agreement which the Israelites made with God at Mount Sinai, when
            they said, "all that the Lord hath said will we do, and be
            obedient", Exodus 24:7; which was as it were setting their hands,
            and laying themselves under obligation to obedience, and, in case of
            failure, to the penalty of the law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others, God's book of remembrance of the sins of men, out of which
            they are blotted when pardoned; others, the book of conscience,
            which bears witness to every debt, to every violation and
            transgression of the law, which may be said to be blotted out, when
            pacified with an application of the blood and righteousness of
            Christ; rather with others it signifies the ceremonial law, which
            lay in divers ordinances and commands, and is what, the apostle
            afterwards speaks of more clearly and particularly; and may be
            called so, because submission to it was an acknowledgment both of
            the faith and guilt of sin; every washing was saying, that a man was
            polluted and unclean; and every sacrifice was signing a man's own
            guilt and condemnation, and testifying that he deserved to die as
            the creature did, which was offered in sacrifice: or rather the
            whole law of Moses is intended, which was the handwriting of God,
            and obliged to obedience to it, and to punishment in case of
            disobedience; and this the Jews z call חוב שטר, "the writing of the
            debt", and is the very phrase the Syriac version uses here: now this
            was as a debt book, which showed and testified the debts of men;
            that is, their sins, how many they are guilty of, and what
            punishment is due unto them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Which was against us</em>. Its nature being holy, just, good,
            and spiritual, is contrary to the unholy and carnal heart of man,
            and its commands disagreeable to his mind and will; nor can he
            perform what it requires; nor can he be subject to it without the
            grace of God, any more than he can like its precepts; and besides,
            it is contrary to him, and against him, as it charges him with
            debts, and proves them upon him, so that he has nothing to say in
            his defence; yea, it proceeds against him, and curses and condemns,
            and kills him: but God has "blotted" it out, Christ having engaged
            as a surety for his people, to pay off all their debts; and this
            being done by him, God has crossed the debt book of the law, has
            blotted it out, so that this book is of no force; it does not stand
            against these persons, it cannot show or prove any standing debt, it
            cannot demand any, or inflict any penalty.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>He has taken it out of the way</em>. It is not to be seen or
            looked into as a debt book; it is abolished and done away; it is no
            more as administered by Moses, as a covenant of works, or as to its
            rigorous exaction, curse, and condemnation; this is true of the
            whole law of Moses, as well as of the ceremonial, which is utterly
            abolished and disannulled in every sense, because of the weakness
            and unprofitableness of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Nailing it to the cross</em>. To the cross of Christ, showing
            that the abolition of it is owing to the cross of Christ; where and
            when he bore the curse and penalty of the law for his people, as
            well as answered all the types and shadows of it: it is thought to
            be an allusion to a custom in some countries, to cancel bonds, or
            antiquate edicts and decrees, by driving a nail through them, so
            that they could not be legible any more: or it may be to the writing
            of Pilate, which contained the charge and accusation against Christ;
            and which was placed over his head upon the cross, and fastened to
            it with nails a; every nail in the cross made a scissure in this
            handwriting, or bond of the law, that lay against us, whereby it was
            so rent and torn, as to be of no force: thus the Holy Ghost makes
            use of various expressions, to show that there is nothing in the law
            standing against the saints; it is blotted out, and cannot be read;
            it is took away, and cannot be seen; it is nailed to the cross of
            Christ, and is torn to pieces thereby, that nothing can ever be
            produced from it to their hurt and condemnation.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Having stripped the principalities and the powers</em>.
            Principalities of hell, the infernal powers of darkness, the devil
            that had the power of death, the accuser of the brethren, who often
            objected their debts, with all his works and posse: these Christ has
            divested of their armour, wherein they trusted to have ruined men,
            as sin, the law, and death; he has ransomed his people from him that
            was stronger than they, and taken the prey out of the hands of the
            mighty; he has bruised the serpent's head, demolished his works,
            destroyed him himself, and all his powers, and defeated all their
            counsels and designs against his elect: some render the word
            απεκδυσαμενος, "having put off", or "unclothed": and which some of
            the ancient writers apply to the flesh of Christ, and understand it
            of his putting off the flesh by death, whereby he gave the death
            blow to Satan and his powers, Hebrews 2:14, to which sense agrees
            the Syriac version, which renders the words, ובשלח פגרה, "and by the
            putting off of his body, he exposed to shame principalities and
            powers."
          </p>
          <p>
            But it may be better interpreted of unclothing, or stripping
            principalities and powers of their armour, with which they were
            clothed; as is usually done to enemies, when they fall into the
            hands of their conquerors: unless rather this is to be understood of
            Christ's taking away the power and authority of the Jewish
            ecclesiastical rulers and governors, by abolishing the ceremonial
            law, and the ordinances of it; declaring himself to be the alone
            King and Lawgiver in his house, and requiring subjection to his
            institutions and appointments, which sense agrees with the context.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>He made a show of them openly</em>. When being raised from the
            dead, he ascended on high, and led captivity captive; he led Satan
            and his principalities and powers captive, who had led others, as he
            passed through the air, the territories of the devil, in the sight
            of God and the holy angels.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Triumphing over them in it</em>. Which some understand of the
            cross, as if where and by what he got the victory, there he
            triumphed; the cross, where his enemies thought to make a show of
            him, expose him to public scorn and contempt, and to triumph over
            him, was as it were the triumphant chariot, in which he triumphed
            over all the powers of hell, when he had conquered them by it: but
            the words may be rendered "in himself", as they are by the Vulgate
            Latin and Syriac versions; and the sense be, that as he by himself
            got the victory, his own arm brought salvation to him, so he alone
            shared the glory and honour of the triumph: or it may be rendered
            "in him", and the whole in this and the preceding verse be applied
            to God the Father, who, as in Colossians 2:12; is said to raise
            Christ from the dead, to quicken sinners dead in sins, and to
            forgive all their trespasses.
          </p>
          <p>
            So he may be said to blot out the handwriting of ordinances, and to
            spoil principalities and powers, expose them to public view and
            shame, and triumph over them, "in him", in and by his Son Jesus
            Christ: the whole is an allusion to the victories, spoils, and
            triumphs, of the Roman emperors, who when they had obtained a
            victory, a triumph was decreed for them by the senate; in which the
            emperor was drawn in an open chariot, and the captives being
            stripped of their armour, and their hands tied behind them, were led
            before him and exposed to public view and disgrace; while he was
            shouted and huzzaed through the city of Rome, and had all the marks
            of honour and respect given him b: now all that is said in the
            preceding verses show how complete the saints are in and by Christ;
            and stand in no need of the philosophy of the Gentiles, or the
            ceremonies of the Jews; nor have anything to fear from their
            enemies, sin, Satan, and the law, for sin is pardoned, the law is
            abolished, and Satan conquered.

            THE Church of Christ in the first ages was composed of Jews and
            Gentiles. Now, the Jews were at all times fond of their own
            traditions, as the Gentiles were of the dogmas of philosophy: and
            the two, meeting together upon one common ground, were ready to
            incorporate their respective peculiarities with the Gospel of
            Christ. To what extent this has been done in Roman Catholic Church
            is well known. In truth,<i>
              the whole system of the Catholics is little better than a mixture
              of heathen rites with Jewish superstitions</i
            >. And those corruptions, which have prevailed to such an awful
            extent in the Church of Rome, began at a very early period to make
            their way into the house of God.

          <p align="justify">
            Symptoms of an alarming nature had already appeared in the different
            Churches of Asia: and against them the Apostle put the Colossian
            converts on their guard; reminding them, that, whatever they might
            hope to <i>add </i>to Christ and his Gospel, their efforts would be
            in vain; since "in Him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
            bodily;" and, consequently, without any addition from the conceits
            of philosophy, or the traditions of Judaism, he was amply sufficient
            for the work assigned him, and was "able to save to the uttermost
            all that would come unto God by him."

            There are some texts, which, to a superficial observer, bear
            somewhat of a similar aspect with that before us. For instance, it
            is said in this very epistle, "It has pleased the Father, that in
            Christ would all fullness dwell,
            <a

              >Colossians 1:19</a

            grace,
            <a

              rel="noopener"
              >John 1:16</a
            >." There is yet a stronger expression in the Epistle to the
            Ephesians, wherein we are exhorted to contemplate the love of
            Christ, until we are "filled with all the fullness of God,
            <a

            fills all in all,
            <a
              class="rtBibleRef"

          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            From such Scriptures as these it is argued by many, that the
            fullness spoken of in my text is only a fullness of gifts committed
            to Christ for the use of his Church; and that we may as well assume
            to ourselves the character of the Godhead, as give it to him; since
            we, no less than he, are said to be "filled with all the fullness of
            God."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But, on a closer inspection, there will be found a wide difference
            between all the foregoing passages and our text. The fullness spoken
            of in the text is the fullness of "the Godhead;" residing in Christ,
            not symbolically, and for a season, as the Shechinah did in the
            tabernacle, but corporeally, substantially, permanently. There is no
            doubt a reference here to the Shechinah, which was a shadowy
            representation of the Deity. But the reference is rather in a way of
            contrast than of comparison: for, in my text, it is not God who is
            spoken of, and who is frequently said to dwell in his people, but
            the Godhead. Nor is Christ said to "be filled" with it, but to have
            it essentially dwelling in him; and this, not in a type or shadow,
            but really, vitally, necessarily, immutably: "In Him dwells all the
            fullness of the Godhead bodily."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Suppose, now, the Lord Jesus Christ to be truly and unquestionably
            God: suppose, too, it is God's purpose to make this known to us:
            then, I would ask, can we conceive of any words that would more
            clearly convey that truth than the language of my text? I must say,
            that if the words of my text do not clearly and decidedly declare
            the Godhead of Christ, no words whatever can express it. Nay, more;
            if Christ be not truly and properly God, the Apostle has done more,
            by his unguarded expressions, to lead us to idolatry, than all the
            most impious sophists in the universe could have done by their most
            ingenious arguments.

          <p align="justify">
            To enter fully into this subject, would embrace too large a field
            for one discourse. I shall therefore confine myself to a few
            passages only, which establish the Divinity of Christ in connection
            with his humanity. And here let me call to your remembrance that
            prophecy of Isaiah, where it is said, "To us a child is born; to us
            a son is given: and his name shall be called, The Mighty God!
            <a
              class="rtBibleRef"

          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Again, in another part of the same prophecy, it is said, "A Virgin
            shall conceive, and bring forth a son; and they shall call his name

            attentive to this point, and, more than all the other inspired
            writers, anxious to impress it on our minds, says expressly, "In the
            beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
            <i>was </i>God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            Supposing the Lord Jesus Christ to have been a creature, how could
            he make atonement for sin, or work out a righteousness that would be
            imputable to us? He could do no more than what, by the law of his
            creation, he was bound to do; and, after having done it, he would
            have been only "an unprofitable servant." Supposing him to be
            capable of meriting anything, he could have merited only for
            himself. If it is said, that the Divine appointment was sufficient
            to make his sufferings available for us also, I answer that,
            according to that argument, the same value might as easily have been
            stamped on the sacrifices of the Mosaic law, if God had seen fit to
            do so. But the Apostle has said, that "it is not possible for the
            blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins." And why not
            possible? If a Divine appointment were to stamp on one sacrifice a
            value which it possessed not, it might as well do so on another.
            But, if the impossibility arises from the inefficacy of a creature's
            blood, then it must attach to one creature as well as to another.
            For however remote two creatures may be asunder, their distance is
            but finite: whereas, to take away sin, the value of a sacrifice must
            be infinite: it must satisfy the demands of infinite justice, and
            entail upon the sinner all the blessings of infinite love and
            unbounded mercy. The divinity, of our blessed Lord renders all tins
            practical to him.

            The Mosaic code was perverted by the Jews. The Christian code has

            assigned to them a variety of ranks and offices, those who had been
            converted from among them still felt inclined to look to subordinate
            deities as their mediators and protectors: while others from among

            What, I would ask, can "<i>philosophy</i>, with all its vain
            deceits," add to us? Can it suggest one single truth which is not
            contained in the Holy Scriptures, or give us one atom of spiritual
            discernment? Can it devise any other way for a sinner's
            justification before God, besides that which the Scripture reveals,
            through the blood and righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ? Can it
            add any thing to the operations of the Holy Spirit for the
            transformation of our souls into the Divine image? Can it further,
            in any one respect, the everlasting redemption of our souls, so that
            we shall say, this is the work of philosophy, and not of Christ? If
            the maxims of philosophy cannot effect anything, can its deities?
            Can they help us, either by their personal efficiency, or by their

            Christian is "complete in Christ:" he has in Christ all that he can
            stand in need of; and to confide in any other is to rob him of his

            to, which yet it is of importance to remark; namely, that as he is
            an example to us in his <i>life</i>, so is he also, if we may so

            Christ having undertaken to redeem our souls, submitted to all that
            was necessary for that end: he was circumcised, as being made under
            the law for us: he died under the curse of that law; and after
            having been buried in the grave, he rose again for our justification
            before God. Now all this which was done in him corporeally, is to be
            done in us spiritually: the one was intended to be a pattern of the
            other. This is very minutely set forth by the Apostle Paul, who
            tells us that the power exercised towards us who believe, exactly
            accords with that which was exercised towards our Lord Jesus Christ
            in all the fore-mentioned particulars:<br />
            his quickening from the dead, <br />
            his rising from the grave, <br />
            his ascension to Heaven, and <br />
            his session at the right hand of God far above all the
            principalities and powers of Heaven or Hell, <br />
            have all a counterpart in us, wrought by the same divine Agent.

            lack of seeing it before our eyes, we are apt to conceive of it as

            its masses, penances, indulgences, such a system of delusion and

            such a system of tyranny and imposture would have ever gained
            footing in the world. Little do the Protestants of the present day

            is still, in some places, as there was even in the apostolic age, a
            leaven of these deadly evils: but we speak, to those who have
            learned to seek a completeness in Christ and a conformity to Christ,

            </p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            It was a false humility that led those in the apostolic age to seek
            other mediators or protectors besides Christ, and other means of
            obtaining his blessings than by faith alone. But while they assumed
            this "voluntary humility," they in reality were "vainly puffed up
            with a fleshly mind, verse 18." So it is with those in the present
            day, who look for something to recommend them to Christ, while they
            would be receiving all out of his fullness as a free unmerited gift.
            Their principle is precisely that of which the Apostle complained in
            the Colossian Church. They think it would be presumption in them to
            go directly to Christ, and to expect to be admitted by him with such
            a load of guilt and corruption as they feel: and therefore they hope
            to make themselves better before they go, so that they may find a
            readier acceptance with him. But this is to dishonor Christ, and to
            take from him both the sovereignty, and the riches, of his grace. We
            must never forget the terms on which alone we are to obtain the
            blessings of his salvation: we are to buy them, it is true; but we
            are to "buy them all without money and without price".

            It is "through faith in the Divine power" that all our completeness
            in Christ, or conformity to Christ, is to be obtained; and to
            exercise that faith, we are encouraged by the recollection of what
            that power has effected "in raising Christ from the dead The text."
            Take a view then of the Lord Jesus after his crucifixion: see him
            dead, and buried, and guarded by a host of enemies who were
            determined in a few hours to prove him an impostor. Is he beyond the
            reach of Divine power? No; at the appointed moment he rises, and
            ascends to Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, far above
            all the principalities and powers of earth and Hell. Are you then in
            a more desperate state than he? or is not the power of God alike
            able to effect this change for you? Yes, is it not as much pledged
            for you as it was for him? Fear not then, "nor stagger at the
            promises of God through unbelief;" but as Abraham before you was,
            "be strong in faith, giving glory to God."

            Paul in particular insists upon it in all his epistles; he declares

          <p align="justify">
            We must not be understood to say that believers have obtained a
            licence to commit sin with impunity; for nothing can be more
            contrary to truth: this would make "Christ himself a minister of
            sin." But our meaning is this: the <i>moral </i>law denounces a
            curse against every one that transgresses it even in the smallest
            point. The <i>ceremonial </i> law illustrates and confirms those
            penal sanctions. The very sacrifices which were the appointed means
            of expiating sin, declared that the offerer deserved to die, and
            that he could not be saved but by the sufferings and death of an
            innocent victim. From hence it appears, that "the hand-writing of
            ordinances," which, in its external obligation, related only to the
            Jews, did, in its spiritual and more enlarged sense, declare the
            state of all mankind, whether Jews or Gentiles: and in this view it
            was equally "against us, and contrary to us."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now this hand-writing Christ has "blotted out," and, by "nailing it
            to his cross," has "taken it out of the way." There were different
            ways of cancelling a bond: sometimes it was blotted out; and
            sometimes it was pierced with a nail, and rendered thereby of no
            effect. Both these ways, if we may so speak, has Christ adopted,
            that we might have the fullest security that we shall never be dealt
            with according to the rigor of the law; and that the debt we owe on
            account of our sins shall never be required at our hands.

            ῾Ως οὖν παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν ᾿Ιησοῦν τὸν Κύριον, ἐν αὐτῷ
            περιπατεῖτε - “As then ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk
            in Him.” The particle οὖν turns us to the preceding verse, and to
            the fact of their order and stedfast faith. Calvin rightly says -
            laudi attexit exhortationem. He has commended them for their order
            and stedfast faith, and he now adds a word of warning and counsel.
            Gradually does he approach the main end of his writing. Ever as he
            comes near it does he utter some sentiment which delays his full
            admonition. He wishes by his previous allusions and warnings to
            prepare their minds for the final and thorough exposure and
            condemnation. And thus he has intimated-what thanks he offers for
            them, what prayers he presents for their deeper illumination and
            persistency in the truth-what sufferings he has endured for them,
            and what sympathies he has with them-what joy he felt in being
            mentally present with them, and surveying their good order and
            unswerving faith. And he has eulogized that gospel which they had
            received-as the truth-as a fruit-bearing principle-as a disclosure
            of the Divine person, exalted dignity, and saving work of the Son of
            God; and as a mystery long hidden, but at length revealed, and
            comprising in it the deep and inexhaustible treasures of all
            spiritual science. Since, therefore, they had received Christ Jesus,
            the Lord, the giver and subject of that gospel, it surely became
            them to walk in Him.

          <p>
            The verb παραλαμβάνω, signifying to take to oneself, is used
            emphatically to appropriate wisdom or instruction-much as in
            Scotland the faculty of acquiring knowledge is termed uptake. 1 Cor
            11:23; 1 Cor 15:1; 1 Cor 15:3; Gal 1:9; Gal 1:12; Php 4:9; 1 Thes
            2:13. They had received him, in the way of being taught about
            Him-verse 7. They had been instructed, and they had apprehended the
            lesson. It is a superficial exegesis on the part of Theophylact,
            Grotius, and others, to make the proper name Χ. ᾿Ι. mean merely the
            doctrine of Christ. For it was Christ Himself whom they had
            received-the sum and life of all evangelical instruction. Nay, more,
            the repetition and structure of the sentence show that the full
            meaning is-ye have received Christ Jesus as the Lord. In the
            character of Lord they had accepted Him. This was the testing
            element of their reception. The Anointed Jesus is now “Lord of all,”
            and to acknowledge His Lordship is to own the success of His atoning
            work as well as to bow to His sovereign authority. Thus we
            understand the apostle when he says, 1 Cor 12:3, “Wherefore I give
            you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth
            Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but
            by the Holy Ghost.” On the special meaning and use of the terms see
            Eph 1:2. The form of error introduced among them, which would rob
            the Saviour of His dignity, led to the denial of the Messiahship in
            its true sense; and in its spiritualism, it would, at the same time,
            explain away His humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            These expressive terms are thus the symbols of a vast amount of
            instruction. Whatever men receive in the gospel, it is Christ. He is
            the soul of doctrine-for prophets foretold Him, and apostles
            preached Him; and the oracles of the one and the sermons of the
            other had no splendour but from Him, and no vitality but in Him.
            Ethical teaching has as close a connection with Him, for it expounds
            His law, defers to His authority, and exhibits the means of
            obedience and fertility in His imparted Spirit and strength. Promise
            is based upon His veracity, and sealed in His blood, and suffering
            looks for sympathy to Him who bled and wept. The great mystery of
            the Divine government is solved in Him, and in Him alone is the
            enigma of man&#x27;s history and destiny comprehended. Spiritual
            life has its root in Him-the growth of the Divine image, and the
            repose of the soul in the bosom of Him who made it. In believing the
            gospel, men receive no impersonal abstraction, but Christ
            Himself-light, safety, love, pattern, power, and life. And they
            receive Him as “the Lord.” He won the Lordship by His death. He rose
            from the sepulchre to the throne. To Him the universe bends in awful
            homage, and the church worships Him in grateful allegiance. The
            Colossians had received Him as the Lord, and surely no seduction
            would ever lead them to discrown Him, and transfer their fealty to
            one of the crowded and spectral myriads which composed the celestial
            hierarchy-one of a dim and cloudy mass which was indistinct from its
            very number, surrounding the throne, but never daring to depute any
            of its members to ascend it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “As ye have received Him, walk in Him.” The particle ὡς denotes
            something more than a reason, for it indicates manner—“according
            as.” Mat 8:13; Lk 14:22; 1 Cor 3:5; Titus 1:5. The demonstrative
            adverb which follows ὡς, in sense, is here as often omitted. ᾿Εν
            αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε—“Walk in Him.” The verb is often used to describe
            manner of life, or visible conduct; and that life is to be enjoyed
            in union with Christ. If reception of Christ the Lord refer to inner
            life, then this walk refers to its outer manifestation. It was to be
            no inert or latent principle. Christ was not merely a theme to be
            idly contemplated or admired in a supine and listless reverie; nor a
            creed to be carelessly laid up as in a distant and inaccessible
            deposit; nor an impulse which might produce a passing and periodical
            vibration, and then sink into abeyance and exhaustion; but a power,
            which, in diffusing itself over mind and heart, provided for its own
            palpable manifestation and recognition in the daily life. For there
            could be no walking in Him, without the previous reception of Him.
            The outer life is but the expression of the inner. Ability to walk
            is the result of communicated animation. Nay, more, if they received
            Him, they could not but walk in Him. The reception of such truth
            necessitates a change of heart. It is a belief which, from its very
            nature, produces immediate results. In Him, and in Him according to
            the character in which they had received Him, were they to walk. And
            they would not walk in Him as they received Him, if they were
            tempted to reject His functions and qualifications as the Christ, or
            in any form, or on any pretext, to modify, depreciate, or set aside
            His claims; or if they were prompted to deny or explain away His
            true humanity as Jesus-taking from His life its reality, and from
            His death its atoning value; or if they were induced to wit hhold
            their allegiance from Him as Lord, the one rightful governor,
            proprietor, and judge. There must therefore be faith in Him as the
            Christ, the consciousness of a near and living relation to Him as
            Jesus, the kinsman, the brother-man; and deep and loyal obedience to
            Him as Lord. “He is thy Lord, worship thou Him.” “In Him”
            presupposes the reception of Him; and to “walk in Him,” is to have
            life in Him and from Him, with thought and emotion shaped and
            inspired by His presence. The hallowed sphere of walk is in Him, but
            beyond this barrier are sin and danger, false philosophies, and mazy
            entanglements. If they walked in Christ, they would be fortified
            against those doubts which the pernicious teachings of error, with
            their show of wisdom, were so apt to superinduce.
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εῤῥιζωμένοι καὶ ἐποικοδομούμενοι ἐν αὐτῷ—“Having been rooted, and
            being built up in Him.” [᾿Εῤῥιζωμένοι, Eph 3:17. ᾿Εποικοδ. Eph
            2:20.] The participles are used in a tropical sense, and are
            connected with the preceding clause—“walk in Him.” The figures, as
            Meyer remarks, neither agree with the preceding verb, nor with one
            another. But the main ideas are stability and growth-the root, “in
            Him,” beyond the possibility of eradication; and the growth that of
            a symmetrical structure, which, “in Him,” has its unshaken
            foundation. The first participle, by its tense, indicates a previous
            state, and the second a present condition. They had already been
            rooted, but they were still to be making progress. Were such their
            character, were they rooted in Christ, and not simply adhering to
            Him by some superficial tie, and were they being built up, or
            growing in gracious attainment, then might they defy all the efforts
            of the false teachers to detach them from the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ βεβαιούμενοι ἐν τῇ πίστει καθὼς ἐδιδάχθητε—“And stablished in
            the faith, as ye have been taught.” The preposition is omitted in
            some Codices, and by Lachmann and Tischendorf. If this reading be
            adopted, we should be inclined, with Meyer, to take the dative in an
            instrumental sense—“stablished by means of the faith;” but if ἐν be
            retained, perhaps the common rendering is preferable. See under Col
            1:7. They were to be confirmed in the faith which had been taught
            them-that system of belief which Epaphras had preached to them. We
            should agree with Olshausen, against Meyer, that πίστις is faith in
            the objective sense, were it not for ἐν αὐτῇ in the following
            clause, which we believe to be genuine, though it is wanting in A
            and C. For the apostle says-περισσεύοντες ἐν αὐτῇ. This abounding
            bids us take faith in a subjective sense-the conscious belief of the
            truth-and in that belief they were not to be stinted, cautious, or
            timid, but they were to abound. Their faith was not to be scanty as
            a rivulet in summer, but like the Jordan in harvest, overflowing its
            banks. And they were to abound in it-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν εὐχαριστίᾳ—“With thanksgiving.” A similar construction is found
            in Rom 15:13; 2 Cor 3:9; 2 Cor 8:7. They could not but be thankful
            that the truth had been brought to them, and that by the Divine
            grace they had been induced fully and unreservedly to believe it.
            Two other and opposing forms of construction have been proposed.
            Grotius renders per gratiarum actionem crescentes in fide, as if the
            thanks were the means of abounding in faith; while Storr, Flatt,
            Böhmer, and Huther take it thus-abounding by means of the same in
            thanksgiving, as if faith were the means of thanksgiving. But the
            connection, as we have first given it, is more in harmony with the
            sequence and position of the words. The entire verse is at once a
            precept and a warning, and were the precept obeyed and the warning
            listened to, then “philosophy and vain deceit” would ply their
            machinations in vain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having again and again approached his subject by indirect allusions,
            the apostle now boldly and fully brings it out. “Beware lest any man
            spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit.” And we may remark in
            introduction, that the sentiment of the verse has been sometimes
            greatly abused. The apostle has been quoted in condemnation of
            philosophy in general, though he expressly identifies the philosophy
            which he reprobates with “vain deceit.” Philosophy, science, or the
            pursuit and love of wisdom, cannot be stigmatized, as in itself
            hostile to faith. The apostle himself has employed philosophy to
            prove the existence of the Creator, and show the sin and folly of
            polytheism and idolatry. Rom 1:19-23. The attributes of the Divine
            nature-not in themselves cognizable by the senses-have assumed a
            visible embodiment in the works of creation, and he who fails to
            discover the one God in His productions is “without excuse.” So that
            the teaching of Natural Theology is not erroneous, but defective-it
            needs not to be corrected, but only to be supplemented. Why should
            the love of wisdom be reckoned vanity, when the page on which man is
            invited to study is wide as the universe, and rolls back to
            creation? Wherever he turns his eye, on himself or beyond
            himself-above, around, or beneath him, ten thousand things invite
            his examination. Earth and heaven, mind and matter, past and
            present, summon him to wake up his faculties, and scrutinize and
            reflect on the universe around him. Let him look down on the sands
            and rocks of his home, and he enters into Geology. Let him know this
            ball to be one of many similar orbs in the sky, and Astronomy
            entrances him. Let him gaze at the munificent plenty around him,
            spread over zone and continent in the shape of trees, flowers, and
            animals, and he is introduced into Geography, Botany, and Zoology.
            Let him survey the relations of matter-its forms, quantities, and
            laws of mixture and motion, and at once he finds himself among
            Mathematics, Optics, Mechanics, and Chemistry. Let him turn his
            vision upon himself, and observe the attributes and functions of his
            physical life, and he dips into the mysteries of Anatomy and
            Physiology. Let him strive to learn what has happened before him,
            and in what connection he stands to brethren of other tongues and
            countries, and he is brought into acquaintanceship with History,
            Philology, and Political Economy. And, in fine, let his own
            conscious mind make itself the theme of reflection-in its powers and
            aspirations, its faculties and emotions, its obligations and
            destiny, and he is initiated into the subtleties and wonders of
            Metaphysics and Morals, Legislation and Theology. Thus, Strabo, in
            the first chapter of his Geography, says—“That acquaintance with
            Divine and human things constitutes what is called philosophy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, not only is philosophy a necessary result of our being and
            condition, but it is full of benefit, for the more a man knows his
            own nature, the more will he feel the adaptation of Christianity to
            it, and be persuaded of its Divine origin. The inner nature has its
            religious instincts and susceptibilities, which are not grafted upon
            it, but are of its very essence. As the eye is fitted for the
            reception of light, and light alone can enable it to fulfil its
            functions-as it is made for the light and the light for it-so
            religious truth alone is fitted to satisfy those yearnings and
            aspirations. There is a perfect harmony between God&#x27;s inner
            revelation of Himself in man, and His external revelation of Himself
            in Scripture. Wrong belief may be against reason, but unbelief is
            against nature. A sound philosophy comes to this conclusion-that
            Christianity fulfils every condition-that in its God and its
            incarnate Jesus-its revelation and its atonement-its sanctifying
            agency and its future heaven-it responds to every want and hope of
            humanity. Man must have some God-it gives him the true one. He seeks
            to some revelation, and it sends him the genuine oracle. He relies
            on some sacrifice, and it shows the perfect atonement. He
            anticipates a heaven, and it provides him with such a home, and
            enables him to reach it. This philosophy develops what Tertullian
            has happily called testimonium animae naturaliter Christianae.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is not such philosophy, or such use of philosophy, that the
            apostle condemns—“Philosophy was, in its first descent, a generous,
            noble thing; a virgin beauty, a pure light, born of the Father of
            lights.” At the same time, it is not to be denied that the greater
            portion of heresies have been allied to a false philosophy.
            Tertullian, in the seventh chapter of his De Praescriptione
            Haereticorum, says-ipsae denique haereses a philosophia
            subornantur.Platonism and Aristotelianism had each in turn the
            ascendency, and Christianity has suffered from the four great forms
            of philosophy-Sensationalism, Idealism, Scepticism, and Mysticism,
            the error of each of which lies in pushing to extravagance some
            important truth. And in modern times, has not Hegelian Pantheism
            clothed itself in biblical phraseology? Its doctrine, that “the
            consciousness which man has of himself is the consciousness which
            God has of Himself,” finds its appropriate mythical representation
            in the mediatorial person of the God-man; while “eternal life” is
            but the symbol of an immortality without individual existence. Have
            not men in their wildness invoked “the stars in their courses” to
            fight against Him who, enthroned above them, has not forgotten that
            distant and insignificant planet on which sin and misery dwell? Have
            they not called to them the rocks and fossils of the early infancy
            of the globe to prove that the record of creation was not furnished
            by the Creator? Are there not those at the present time who regard
            inspiration as but the “fine frenzy” of an Oriental temperament, or
            look upon it as being “as wide as the world, as common as God,” and
            who, therefore, take f rom the biblical records their sole,
            infallible, and supreme authority, leaving us an Old Testament
            without prophecies, and a New Testament without miracles and
            redemption? These are, verily, abuses of philosophy—“oppositions of
            science, falsely so called.” We do not, therefore, object to
            philosophy, or to the philosophical treatment of Christianity. We
            can have no horror at free thoughts and bold inquiry, so long as men
            indicate their desire to submit to the decisions of Evidence. There
            is a legitimate province for philosophy to work in, and “faith is
            the synthesis of reason and the individual will.”

            But the system condemned by the apostle was something which assumed
            the name of philosophy, yet had nothing of its spirit. It sprang
            from a wrong motive. So far from being the love of wisdom, it was
            the fondness of folly. It was nursed in a fantastic imagination, and
            intruded into a supersensuous sphere. It did not deal with nature
            around it, but with the supernatural beyond it. It did not
            investigate its own constitution, but it pryed into the arcana of
            the spirit-world. It was wholly spectral and baseless. It developed
            superstition and crossed the path of the gospel. It lived in a
            cloud-land which it had created, and withdrew itself from the
            influence and faith of apostolical Christianity. The plain truths of
            redemption did not satisfy its prurient appetite, nor could it
            content itself with the “manifold wisdom” of the cross. It longed
            for something more ethereal than historical facts, something more
            recondite than the mystery of godliness. It forestalled the
            Rosicrucian vanities. It peopled the spheres with imaginary
            Essences, to which it assigned both names and functions. It laboured
            to purge itself from the vulgarities of physical life, in order to
            enter this spiritual circle. It battled with the flesh, till the
            crazy nerves gave it such sights and sounds as it longed to enjoy.
            The ordinances of the New Testament were too tame for it, and it
            created a new and emaciating ritual for itself. It was, in short, an
            eccentric union of Judaism with the Gnostic Theosophy-a mixture of
            Jewish ritualism with Oriental mysticism. It took from Moses those
            special parts of his economy, which “sanctified to the purifying of
            the flesh,” and it seems to have deepened and exaggerated them. It
            selected from the Eastern Theosophy its armies of AEons, its array
            of principalities and powers, whom it marshalled as its mediators,
            and to whom it inculcated homage. It was smitten with the disease of
            him who will look into the sun, and who soon mistakes for realities
            the gaudy images that float before him. Such was the visionary
            science which had special charms for the inhabitants of Phrygia, and
            which in after years produced unmistakeable results. That the
            apostle means such philosophy is evident, for in no other way could
            his warning be appropriate. It was of a present, and not a future
            danger-a real, and not an imaginary jeopardy that he so earnestly
            cautioned them. It was not, as Tertullian imagines, the whole Greek
            philosophy, for that lay not in his way; nor yet any special form of
            it, as Grotius and others have held, for the philosophy of the
            Academy and the Porch, of Epicurus and Pythagoras, was not the
            source of immediate danger to the Colossian church.

            Βλέπετε, μή τις ὑμᾶς ἔσται ὁ συλαγωγῶν διὰ τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς
            ἀπάτης—“Be on your guard lest any one make a spoil of you through
            philosophy and vain deceit.” The verb βλέπω, in this sense, is
            sometimes followed by the accusative of the persons to be guarded
            against, occasionally by the genitive preceded by ἀπό, sometimes
            also by ἵνα; but most usually by μή, and its compounds with the
            aorist subjunctive. Here, however, we have the future indicative,
            ἔσται, as in Heb 3:12. The apostle therefore does not say that the
            evil had happened, but he expresses his fear that it would
            happen-his misgiving, that what he apprehended would take place.
            Winer, § 56, 2 (b), α; Bernhardy, p. 402; Hartung, vol. 2.139. He
            saw the attractive subtlety, and he could not withhold the warning
            and pre-intimation. The expression, too, is pointed and emphatic-τις
            ὁ συλαγωγῶν-more so than if he had employed the subjunctive,
            συλαγωγῇ. It individualizes the spoiler-represents him as at his
            work-associates vividly the actor with the action. Gal 1:7. When
            some infer from the language that the apostle had only one person
            specially in his eye-one restless and attractive heresiarch, we
            would not contradict, though we are not prepared to come decidedly
            to the same conclusion. The participle, which occurs only here,
            belongs to the later Greek, and denotes-making a prey of-driving off
            as booty, though it is finical on the part of Meyer to base the
            latter signification upon the expression of the 6th verse, walk in
            Him, as if they might be caught when not in that walk, and forced
            away as a spoil. The expression shows the strong feeling of the
            apostle, and how he regarded their capture by that philosophy as
            fatal, almost beyond recovery , to their faith and peace. It is not
            in accordance with the language to think of the false teacher or
            teachers taking faith, mind, or purity, or anything else as a prey
            from the Colossians, for the Colossians themselves are the booty.
            The means employed were-
          </p>
          <p>
            Διὰ τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης—“By philosophy and empty
            delusion.” This philosophy is none other than the theme of the
            πιθανολογία of Col 2:4, and is nothing else in essence than “vain
            deceit.” For the second clause, where neither preposition nor
            article is repeated, explains the first-philosophy which was
            expressed in “vain words,” is identical with “vain deceit.” There is
            no reality about it. It is out and out a delusion, a tissue of airy
            figments. The term philosophy was a favourite one in the Greek
            world, but it was extended in course of time to portions and objects
            of Jewish study by the affectation of Philo and Josephus. Tittmann,
            in his very one-sided essay, restricts the term solely to Jewish
            doctrine, and Heinrichs no less narrowly to Jewish worship. Perhaps
            the apostle would not have given any mere Jewish system such an
            appellation, but he uses the term because there might be in it some
            mixture of Gentile lore, and especially because the false teachers
            dignified their views by such a title.
          </p>
          <p>
            Κατὰ τὴν παράδοσιν τῶν ἀνθρώπων—“After the tradition of men.” The
            preposition does not connect this with the first clause of the
            verse, as Meyer construes, and as if it showed the direction in
            which they were seduced, but it is to be joined with the immediately
            preceding words. It points out, not so much, as Storr supposes, the
            authority of that philosophy, as its general source and character.
            It is according to the tradition of men, and not according to Divine
            revelation. In 2 Thes 3:6, the construction is fully expressed.
            Elements of the tradition here referred to are found in Mat 15:2; Mk
            7:3; Mk 7:5; Mk 7:8-9; Mk 7:13; Gal 1:14. It is not simply doctrine,
            as Olshausen and Huther take it; nor perhaps Graeco-Jewish doctrine,
            as others supposed. It was, to a great extent, that tangled mass of
            oral teaching, which, age after age, the Jews had unwarrantably
            engrafted on the written law. That farrago of unwritten statute and
            ritual is contrasted by Jesus with the “commands of God.” It was
            solely of man, and partook largely of his vanity and weakness. As in
            the instance adduced by Christ, it explained away the obligation of
            the fifth commandment by a mean quibble, which added impiety to
            filial neglect, and permitted a son to starve his parent under a
            pretence of superior liberality to God. It taught the payment “of
            mint, anise, and cumin,” but forgot “the weightier matters of the
            law, judgment, mercy, and faith.” It scrupled to eat with unwashed
            hands, but was forward to worship with an unregenerate heart. It was
            eloquent and precise about cleaning of cups, but vague and dumb
            about the purifying of conscience. It converted religion into a
            complicated routine, with a superstitious and perplexing ritual, as
            if man were to be saved by the observance of ceremonies as puerile
            as they were cumbrous-a series of postures, ablutions, amulets, and
            vain repetitions. It lost sight of the spir ituality of worship, but
            enjoined a careful genuflexion. It buried ethics under a system of
            miserable and tedious casuistry. It attempted to place everything
            under formal regulation, and was now busied in solemn trifling, and
            now lost in utter indecency. It was mighty about the letter, and
            oblivious of the spirit. It rejoiced in the oblation of a ram, but
            had no sympathy with the “sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart.”
            It drew water every year from the well at Siloam with a pompous
            procession, but had no thirst for the living stream which its
            prophets had predicted and described. It would drill man into a
            fatiguing devotion. It trained to the mere mummery of worship when
            it prescribed the movement of eye and foot, of head and arm. It
            intruded its precepts into every relation, and attempted to fill out
            the Divine law by laying down directions for every supposable case.
            It was not content with leading principles, but added innumerable
            supplements. It surrounded the rite of circumcision with many
            ridiculous minutiae. It professed to guard the sanctity of the
            Sabbath by a host of trifling injunctions, descending to the needle
            of the tailor, the pen of the scribe, and the wallet of the beggar.
            The craftsman was told that he was guilty if he tied a
            camel-driver&#x27;s knot, or a sailor&#x27;s knot, on that day, but
            not guilty if he merely tied a knot which he could loose with one of
            his hands; and that he might leap over a ditch, but not wade through
            the water that lay in it. It declared by what instrument the paschal
            lamb should be roasted, and how a jar of wine must be carried during
            a festival; with what gestures a phylactery was to be put on, and
            with what scrupulous order it was to be laid aside. It left nothing
            to the impulse of a living piety. It was ignorant that a sanctified
            spirit needed no such prescriptions; that the “due order” could only
            be learned from the inner oracle; and that obedience to all its
            ramified code, apart from the spirit of genuine faith and devotion,
            was only acting a part in a heartless pantomime.
          </p>
          <p>
            And these traditions proved that they were from man, not only from
            their character, but from their verbiage and appended sanctions. If
            the Mishna be, as we believe it to be, on the whole, a faithful
            record of many such traditions, then, that they were of men is a
            fact inscribed on their very front. The recurring formula is-Rabbi
            Eleazar said this, but Rabbi Gamaliel said that; this was the
            opinion of Rabbi Meir, but that of Rabbi Jehudah; Hillel was of this
            mind, but Beth Shammai of that; Rabbi Tarphon pronounced in this
            way, but Rabbi Akivah in that; thus thought Ben Azai on the one
            hand, but thus thought Rabbi Nathan on the other; such was the
            decision of Jochanan Ben Saacchai, but such was the opposite
            conclusion of Matthias Ben Harash. It never rose above a mere human
            dictum, and it armed its jurists with supreme authority. It never
            shook the mire off its wings, or soared into that pure and lofty
            empyrean which envelopes the Divine tribunal, so that in His light
            it might see light. What had been thus conceived in the dry
            frivolity of one age, was handed down to another, and the mass was
            swiftly multiplied in its long descent. The Pharisee selected one
            portion and practised it, and the Essene chose another and made it
            his rule of life. It was carried in one or other of these shapes to
            other lands, and though it commingled with other opinions of similar
            source and tendency, it never belied its parentage as the TRADITIONS
            OF MEN.
          </p>
          <p>
            Κατὰ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου—“After the rudiments of the world.” The
            reference is somewhat obscure. The noun στοιχεῖον is employed in 2
            Pet 3:10; 2 Pet 3:12, to denote the elements of physical nature,
            while in Heb 5:12 it signifies the simple lessons and truths of
            Christianity, and is opposed to τελειότης. In the former sense it
            frequently occurs in the ancient philosophy, as comprising fire,
            air, earth, and water. It is amusing to observe with what ingenuity
            some of the Greek Fathers give it such a sense in the passage before
            us, because, forsooth, all the elements are employed in the Jewish
            service-water for purification and fire for sacrifice, earth for the
            erection of altars, and the revolution of the aerial bodies for the
            determination of the sacred festivals. The noun sometimes signifies
            an elementary sound, or a letter, and so came to denote what is
            rudimentary-what is suited to the tuition of infancy. In this sense
            we understand the apostle to use it in Gal 4:3; Gal 4:9, and with
            special reference to the Jewish ritual and worship. The churches in
            Galatia had a strong and wayward tendency to revert to Judaism, or
            at least to incorporate it, or a portion of it, into the new
            religion. And as they had embraced a system which was spiritual and
            mature-which was not embodied in types and ceremonies, but in pure,
            simple, universal truths-the apostle wonders why, with their higher
            and manly privilege, they should go back to “the weak and beggarly
            elements;” why, when they had been reading the book of Divine
            instruction with its complete and lasting lessons, they should
            revert and descend again to the mere alphabet. It was as if one who
            was able to sweep the heavens, and tell the sizes, distances, and
            revolutio ns of its luminaries, should forswear this noble exercise,
            and seat himself in an infant school, and find the highest pleasure
            among the first and trite axioms and diagrams of geometry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term κόσμος marks the nature of these elements. It is said that
            the Jewish economy had ἅγιον κοσμικόν—“a worldly sanctuary,” an
            epithet placed in contrast with τὰ ἐπουράνια, and with σκηνὴ οὐ
            χειροποίητος. Our opinion is, that in the clause under discussion,
            the apostle refers to the Jewish worship. Some interpreters, such as
            Meyer and Böhmer, think this exposition too restricted, and give the
            meaning as referring both to the ritual of the Jewish and the
            heathen world, supposing the “world” to signify, as it often does,
            the non-Christian portion of its population. Huther also gives it a
            similar extension of meaning-Elemente des ethischen Lebens in der
            Welt. His objections to the common interpretation are fully set
            aside by De Wette, and are not in themselves of any weight. But the
            phrase before us has a definite meaning affixed to it in the Epistle
            to the Galatians, and there it denotes simply the Jewish system.
            There was in the Galatian churches no attempt to heathenize, but
            only to Judaize; no endeavour to engraft heathenism, but only
            Judaism on the new dispensation.
          </p>
          <p>
            That the Mosaic economy should receive the name of elements is
            easily understood, but why should such a genitive as κόσμου be
            added? It belonged to the world in a special sense, not to the world
            or age in the Jewish sense of the term, as if, as Wahl supposes, the
            meaning were-adapted to the men of this age. It was of the world, as
            being like it, evident to the senses, visible, and material, in
            contrast with what is spiritual and invisible. In this sense, the
            whole economy was mundane, for it was sensuous; it pictured itself
            to the eye in the stones of its edifice, the robes of its priests,
            the victims of its altars, its restrictions on diet, its frequent
            washings, the blood of its initiatory rite, and the periods of its
            sacred festivals. It was a worldly panorama, and it portrayed but
            the elements of spiritual truth. It set before its votaries the
            merest first principles, which were indeed often expounded and
            developed by its prophets. It was “a shadow of things to come,” not
            even a full and vivid picture. Under the 17th verse the exposition
            will be more fully given. The party at Colosse, who attempted to
            seduce, presented some elements of the Mosaic ritual and worship as
            a special instrument of spiritual elevation and ascetic discipline.
            They inculcated a philosophy which, whatever might be its mysticism
            or its metaphysical or heathen features, was in essence an
            adaptation of Judaism, not as found in the Mosaic writings, but as
            overlaid and disfigured by a mass of accumulated traditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ οὐ κατὰ Χριστόν—“And not after Christ.” That philosophy was not
            according to Christ. It is a needless dilution of the sense, on the
            part of Erasmus and Röell, etc., to render—“not according to the
            doctrine of Christ.” It was not based upon Christ, but was in
            contrariety to His person and work. It depreciated Him, and
            undervalued His mediation. But true Christian science has Him for
            its centre, and Him for its object. It bows to His authority, and
            ever seeks to exalt Him. Any new doctrine may be safely tested by
            the estimation in which it holds Christ; for all that is false and
            dangerous in speculation, invariably strives to lower His rank and
            official dignity, and therefore is neither in source, spirit,
            substance, nor tendency, according to Him. And they were to be on
            their guard against such dangerous deceptions, which were not
            according to Christ. Though the apostle says—“not after Christ”-it
            must not be inferred that the errorist or errorists made no
            profession of Christianity, or were openly hostile to it. Had this
            been the case, their non-Christian character would have been boldly
            and distinctly pointed out by the apostle. They seem to have been
            disciples in name. Nor did they come like mere Judaizers and make an
            open assault, or insist in plain terms that Christian Gentiles
            should be circumcised and keep the law. Then they would have been
            confronted like the Judaizers in Galatia. But they were more
            insidious in their attack-boasted the possession of an inner and a
            higher knowledge, and preached an ide al system of specious
            pretensions, and made up apparently of Judaism and Gnosticism, - or
            Judaism deeply imbued with that mysticism which distinguished the
            Essenes, and that kind of theosophy which is found in Philo.

            ῞Οτι ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικεῖ πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς θεότητος σωματικῶς. This is
            an irresistible argument. Any system not after Christ must be human
            and wrong—“for in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”
            The noun πλήρωμα has been fully explained under Eph 1:23. The
            substantive θεότης is an abstract term, like Deity, in which God is
            viewed in essence rather than personality. The word is quite
            different in meaning from θειότης, Rom 1:20 -a term which describes
            quality rather than being. The words differ as divinitas and
            deitas-divineness and Deity; or, as the Germans express
            it-Göttlichkeit and Gottheit. The Syriac uses the expressive term
            ãÈàìåÉäÈðåÉà. The fulness of the Godhead is a fulness filled up by
            it-is that Godhead in all its native attributes and prerogatives.
            And it is the whole fulness-not one cycle of Divine perfections-a
            single cluster of Divine properties-not a partial possession of
            isolated glories-nor a handful of meted and fractional resources,
            but the entire assemblage of all in existence and character that
            constitutes the Divinity. What He is, and as He is, in being, mode,
            and manifestation, dwells in Christ. See under Col 1:15. One blushes
            to mention the Socinian misinterpretation, which so reduces this
            sublime statement as to make it signify merely, that the whole will
            of God was manifested by Him-an attempt which Calovius well names
            detorsio mera. Nor are we less confounded with the capricious and
            baseless exposition of Heinrichs, Baumgarten-Crusius, Schleusner,
            Gerhard, and Junker, that πλήρωμα can mean the church gathered
            without distinction from all nations, and that the apostle intends
            to say-that the whole church has its existence, wellbeing, or
            instruction in Christ. Nor is the singularly ungrammatical exegesis
            of some early expositors less wonderful-that “in Him” means in the
            church, and that in this church dwells the fulness of the Godhead.
            Bähr ably refutes the view of Noesselt, which, though a little more
            ingenious than the Socinian hypothesis, does not essentially differ
            from it in result. The sense naturally suggested by the terms is the
            correct one. Nor are we to search for any recondite meaning, as if
            πλήρωμα must be taken in a Gnostic sense; or as if in the verb
            κατοικεῖ there were a necessary allusion to the so-named
            Shechinah-in which dwelt the Divinity. Whatever be the polemical
            reference, the ordinary meaning of the verb cannot be set aside, as
            denoting actual and prolonged habitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mode of this mysterious inhabitation is declared to be
            σωματικῶς—“in a bodily form,” for such is the first and plain
            meaning of the adverb. Other and vaguer ideas have been attached to
            it. It is a necessary result of the interpretation which takes
            πλήρωμα to signify the church, that it must regard σωματικῶς as
            intense and hyperbolical, and therefore we have the dilution of a
            quasi. The church dwells in Christ, as if in a bodily form-as if it
            formed His body. But-
          </p>
          <p>
            1. The least plausible hypothesis is that of Capellus and Heumann,
            who look upon the term as equivalent to ὅλως, and as signifying
            “altogether.” Such a translation makes the clause tautological, for
            πᾶν is already employed, and besides it cannot be borne out by any
            legitimate examples. Why resort to a rare and technical use of the
            word, as peculiar as in our familiar phrase, a body of divinity,
            meaning a full course of theological instruction?
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Others, again, under the influence of the previous contrast
            between the law and the gospel, imagine an antithesis in the word,
            as if it stood in antagonism to τυπικῶς. There was a symbolical
            residence in the temple, but an actual one in Christ Jesus. The
            polemical Augustine first broached the idea. Non ideo corporaliter
            quia corporeus est Deus, sed aut verbo translato usus est, tanquam
            in templo manufacto non corporaliter sed umbratiliter habitaverit,
            id est, praefigurantibus signis, nam illas omnes observationes
            umbras futurorum vocat, etiam ipso translato vocabulo, . . . . aut
            certe corporaliter dictum est, quia et in Christi corpore, quod
            assumpsit ex virgine, tanquam in templo habitat Deus.Augustine has
            been followed by Vatablus, a-Lapide, Grotius, Glassius, Hackspann,
            Vitringa, Röell, Crellius, Schoettgen, Noesselt, Michaelis, Bengel,
            and Bretschneider. But there is no such implied contrast in this
            verse as between σῶμα and σκιά in Col 2:17, and there is therefore
            no just ground of departure from the common and absolute
            signification. Christ is held up as the grand centre and source of
            true philosophy, and the reason is that Godhead was incarnate in
            Him, and that therefore His claims are paramount, both in person and
            function. He is not only the Wonder of wonders in Himself, but
            creation and redemption-the two prime books of study-trace
            themselves to Him as their one author.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. A large number of critics give to σωματικῶς the meaning of
            essentialiter, that is, the Godhead dwells in Christ really, or in
            substance - οὐσιωδῶς. Names of high authority are leagued in favour
            of this interpretation. Theophylact and OEcumenius, and Isidore the
            Pelusiot, among the Fathers; Calvin, Beza, and Melancthon, among the
            reformers; with Steiger, Huther, Olshausen, and Usteri, among the
            more recent expositors. The ground of this interpretation lies again
            in a supposed polemical contrast, which certainly does not appear in
            the context. Melancthon says-est oppositum inhabitationi separabili
            ut habitat Deus in sanctis, that is, the union of Divinity with
            Christ is a personal union-not like the influential indwelling of
            God in a believing heart. Huther supposes such a contrast as this,
            that the Deity did not dwell in Christ as it dwelt in the old
            prophets who preceded Him. Olshausen again gives prominence to a
            Gnostic antagonism, as if the apostle meant to distinguish between a
            merely temporary influence of a higher spirit, and a permanent union
            of the Godhead-an idea as naturally brought out by giving to the
            adverb its usual signification. To fall back for defence upon any
            uses of the Hebrew word ÆòöÆí, H6795, is all but to surrender the
            cause. The Hebrew noun does signify ipse, but never in connection
            with persons-de rebus tantummodo, as Gesenius, sub voce, remarks.
            The noun σῶμα does signify person in the New Testament, though Bähr
            denies it. Davenant says—“the Hebrew put souls for persons, and the
            Greek put bodies;” but the instances of the latter usage adduced by
            him will not bear him out; for in them there is usually distinct
            reference to the corporeal part of the person. In those instances in
            the New Testament in which σῶμα appears to signify person, it is not
            only followed with a genitive of person, but there is always some
            special reason why the term should be so employed-some implied
            contrast, some contextual point, or some tacit reference to the body
            or external person. Thus, among the classics, it is appropriately
            used of soldiers and slaves, whose bodies are in special request. As
            in the New Testament it is used in connection with the eye, Mat
            6:22; with marriage-a union characterized as “one flesh,” Eph 5:28;
            with the idea of death, Php 1:20; and the notion of a living
            sacrifice, in which the dead bodies of victims were offered, Rom
            12:1. Indeed, in Homeric usage σῶμα always denotes a corpse. So
            that, absolutely, the noun does not signify person; and such a sense
            is never given to the cognate adjective or adverb. This exegesis
            seems to have arisen from an attempt to define by it the nature of
            that union which subsisted between Divinity and humanity in the
            person of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. The last and best interpretation is that which takes σωματικῶς in
            its literal and only meaning-in a bodily shape, and not as Theodoret
            paraphrases-ὡς ἐν σώματι. Such is also the view of Calovius, Estius,
            Storr, De Wette, Bähr, Böhmer, and Meyer. Yet Steiger calls
            it-abgeschmackt-insipid, and Olshausen regards it as tautological,
            because the words “in Him” occur in the same clause. But the words
            “in Him” are the general reference, and the adverb specifies the
            mode in which He possessed the Divine fulness. The fulness of the
            Godhead was embodied in Him, or dwelt in Him-in no invisible shape,
            and by no unappreciable contact. It assumed a bodily form. It abode
            in Him as a man. It made its residence the humanity of Jesus.
            Divinity was incarnated in Christ. It shrank not from taking upon it
            our nature, and realizing the prophetic title—“Immanuel, God with
            us.” The same idea is contained in Jn 1:14—“the Word was made flesh,
            and dwelt among us.” The Logos, yet unfleshed, was God, and was with
            God, Divine and yet distinct from the Father; but the fulness of
            Godhead was only spiritually within Him. Now, it has made its abode
            in his humanity without consuming it or deifying it, or changing any
            of its essential properties. It hungered and it ate, it thirsted and
            it drank, it grieved and it wept, it watched and prayed, it wearied
            itself and it lay down, it was exhausted and it slept, it bled and
            it died. That body so filled and honoured was no phantom, as many
            even in the apostolic age imagined, for it had “flesh and bones,”
            and, after its resurrection, it bore the scar of its recent wounds.
            It was therefore no vehicle which Divinity assumed by any singular
            process, but in the same way as the children become “partakers of
            flesh and blood,” so did Christ partake of them. He was born as
            children are born, and the infant was wrapt “in swaddling bands.” He
            was nursed as children are nursed, for “butter and honey should he
            eat.” His young soul grew in wisdom as His physical frame grew in
            stature. It was easily seen that Godhead dwelt in that humanity, for
            glimpses of its glory flashed again and again through its earthly
            covering. The radiance was vailed, but never entirely eclipsed. His
            disciples “beheld His glory, the glory indeed of the only begotten
            of the Father.” Peter felt impressed by it, and urged his own
            sinfulness as the reason why intercourse should be suspended; while
            Thomas, under the impulse of wonder and faith, cried out—“My Lord,
            and my God.” Jesus prayed for others, and bade others pray on their
            own behalf; but He never solicited their prayers for Himself. When
            suppliants bowed the knee to Him, He never said—“See thou do it
            not;” never thought it to be idolatry on their part to offer Him
            homage, or felt it to be “robbery” on His part to accept it. His
            second coming is “the glorious appearing of the great God.” At His
            baptism and transfiguration, the voice from the excellent glory
            hailed Him as God&#x27;s beloved Son. He detected the inmost
            thoughts and enmities of the multitude, for he possessed a species
            of intuition which lies far above humanity. “He knew what was in
            man.” “The wind bloweth where it listeth,” but it listened to Him;
            and He who trod upon the waves of the Sea of Galilee, made them a
            path which God marks as His own. He wrought miracles at discretion,
            and wielded at pleasure the prerogative of forgiving sins. He
            assumed a co-ordinate power with the Father, and claimed with Him an
            equal right of dispensing with those obligations of the sabbatic
            law, which had been enacted for men by Divine authority. The most
            ordinary eye discovered something extraordinary about Him. The crowd
            that heard Him said—“He speaketh as one having authority;” for He
            spoke in the tones of conscious Divinity. “We have seen strange
            things to-day,” shouted the spectators; and no wonder, those strange
            things were the characteristic acts of the strangest of Beings-the
            only Being who is God-man. A perfection not of earth belonged to His
            nature; for “the prince of this world,” who finds so much to work
            upon in common humanity, could find nothing in Him; and the demons,
            whose appetite for evil leads them ever to detect it and vaunt over
            it, acknowledged Him to be “the Holy One of God.” Referring to His
            death as the destruction of a temple, He asserted Himself able in
            three days to raise it again-a task that could be achieved only by
            the Divine Creator and Life-giver. While He walked on earth, He
            spoke of Himself as one “who is in heaven.” Born centuries after
            Abraham, He yet pre-existed the great father of His nation. Lowly
            and humble-the son of Mary, He was the Image of the invisible God;
            and so close was His likeness to Him who sent Him, that He said—“He
            who hath seen me, hath seen the Father.” And the apostle uses the
            present tense-the Divine fulness still “dwells” in Him. It was no
            temporary union, but an abiding possession. His glorious body has in
            it the same fulness of the Godhead, as had the body of His
            humiliation. The mode of inhabitation the apostle does not specify.
            What may be inferred is, that the union is a personal union of His
            natures-not a simple concord of will, so that there are two persons;
            nor such an absorption of the one element into the other, that there
            is only one nature. We know not whether Docetic views prevailed at
            that early period in the Colossian church, but it is certain that
            Christ was undervalued and His person misunderstood, in the false
            philosophy. Therefore the apostle affirms, in this brief but weighty
            clause, the great mystery of His mediatorial nature-the personal
            union in Him of Divinity and manh ood. Any philosophy not “after
            Christ,” must be earthly and delusive. It has missed the central
            truth-is amused with the stars, but forgetful of the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καί ἐστε ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι—“And ye are made full in Him.” The
            clause is still in continuation of the warning, and crowns the
            argument. It is in entire opposition to the usus loquendi of the New
            Testament, on the part of Grotius, Bos, and Heumann, to make ἐστέ an
            imperative, for it emphasizes their present state. The phrase ἐν
            αὐτῷ has a meaning found with peculiar frequency-in Him-in union
            with Him; and it is wrong in Erasmus to render it—“by, or by means
            of Him.” The participle πεπληρωμένοι is evidently used with a
            reference to the πλήρωμα of the preceding verse-ye are filled out of
            Christ&#x27;s fulness, or are full in His fulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opinions on the sense or reference of the participle are modified by
            the view entertained of the meaning of the preceding verse.
            Schoettgen narrows the meaning by far too much, and gives but one
            aspect of the sense, which he renders-per istum estis perfecte
            edocti; for though the apostle has been referring to instruction,
            yet far more is here implied. The exegesis of Grotius is rather an
            inference-illo contenti estote; for if they were complete in Jesus,
            it followed that they needed no supplemental endowments from any
            other quarter. The meaning of the clause is much the same as that
            found in Eph 3:19, to the exposition of which the reader may turn.
            Meyer says that nothing is to be supplied after πεπληρ., neither τῆς
            θεότητος with Theophylact, nor τοῦ πληρώματος τῆς θεότητος with De
            Wette. But the question recurs, of what elements is this fulness
            composed? or, if the participle be rendered “perfect”—“ye are
            perfect in Him,” of what elements is this perfection made up? The
            clause has a very close connection with the foregoing verse, and
            with the phrase—“all the fulness of the Godhead.” It is because that
            fulness dwells in Christ that they are filled up in Him. Being in
            Him, they are brought into contact with what is in Him; and that
            fulness of God contains a life whose pulsations create a responsive
            throbbing within them. There is in Christ complete provision, and
            what is so furnished is pledged to be conferred. There needs,
            therefore, be no want, and no casting about for any other source of
            supply. Believers have actual and present completeness of provided
            blessing, and there is the guaranteed completeness of prospective
            gifts. “Ye ARE complete in Him,” for the scriptural view of
            Christ&#x27;s person meets the deepest necessities of our spiritual
            nature. “What does it mean?” asks Chrysostom, “that you have no
            thing less than Him”-τὶ οὖν ἐστιν… ὅτι οὖδὲν ἔλαττον ἔχετε αὐτοῦ.
            The apostle adds another and striking clause-
          </p>
          <p>
            ῞Ος ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας—“Who is the head of all
            principality and power.” On the authority of B, D, E, F, G, Lachmann
            reads ὅ, but ὅς is retained on the authority of A, C, J, K, and that
            of the Greek Fathers. Lachmann&#x27;s choice is vindicated by
            Steiger and Böhmer, though it appears to have sprung from a
            grammatical fondness for πλήρωμα as the principal preceding noun. If
            this reading be adopted, the foregoing clause must be placed in a
            parenthesis. “In Him, and that bodily, dwells all the Godhead&#x27;s
            fulness . . . which is the Head of all principalities and powers.”
            The authorities are nearly balanced, but the reading ὅς is most in
            analogy with the apostle&#x27;s style of thought and expression.
            Besides, with the reading ὅ, the words ἐν ᾧ in Col 2:11 must refer
            also to πλήρωμα, and no tolerable sense could be extracted from such
            a connection. The terms ἀρχή and ἐξουσία are abstract ones, having
            reference to celestial dignities, and to such as were unfallen. The
            relative, as in Col 1:18, may be rendered—“as being He who is;” or,
            perhaps, “inasmuch as He is.” Jelf, § 836, 3. The Head of
            principalities and powers. Eph 1:21. There is no exception; the
            entire hierarchy, even its mightiest and noblest chieftains and
            dignities, own submission to Christ, and form a portion of His
            spiritual dominions. Col 1:16. There was some special reason why he
            intimates Christ&#x27;s headship not generally over the church or
            the universe, but specially over the angelic hosts. If we can rely
            on accounts of the teaching ascribed to Simon Magus, we might find
            in them an illustration of the apostle&#x27;s statement. Epiphanius
            relates, that Simon Magus invented names of principalities and
            powers, and insisted that the learning of such names was essential
            to salvation. Similar biza rrerie is ascribed to Cerinthus. See
            Whitby, in loc. Whatever be its source, there is no doubt that the
            apostle alludes to some prevalent error-which interposed angels, in
            some sense, as mediators-and so far derogated from the personal
            glory and saving merit of Christ. That theosophy which was invading
            them seems to have dealt largely in idle and delusive speculation on
            the rank and office of angels-assigning to them provinces of
            operation which belong to the Son of God-looking to them as
            guardians or saviours, and forgetting that they are but His
            servants, executing His commission and doing Him homage. Why rely
            upon the courtiers, when access may be had at once to the King? why
            be taken up with our fellow-servants, who are only stewards of
            limited resources, when the Master has not only the fulness of
            Divinity, but has it in a human shape-has the heart of a brother to
            love you, and the arm of a God to protect and bless you? Alas! that
            saints so called have the usurped place of principalities and powers
            in the Church of Rome.

            If they were complete in Christ, they had no need to go beyond
            Christ, and to resort to any ceremonies imposed upon them by the
            Judaizers. They had everything which it was alleged they wanted, and
            everything already in Christ. The heretical preceptors had enjoined
            upon them the rite of circumcision, but the apostle shows that it
            would be really a superfluous ceremony, since they had already
            experienced a nobler circumcision than that of the knife-for it was
            executed by no material hand.

            ᾿Εν ᾧ καὶ περιετμήθητε περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ—“In whom, too, ye were
            circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands.” There is no
            need to suppose, with Olshausen, that in these words there is
            expressed an ideal unity of all His people in Christ in His death
            and resurrection. Though such an idea may be found in other parts of
            Scripture, it cannot be found here-save in the exercise of a refined
            ingenuity. For, first, the formula ἐν ᾧ has its usual
            significance-union with Him-union created by the Spirit, and
            effected by faith; and, secondly, the blessing described in the
            verse had been already enjoyed, for they were and had been believers
            in Him in whom they are complete. Through their living union with
            Christ, they had enjoyed the privilege, and were enjoying the
            results of a spiritual circumcision. Why then should they suffer the
            incision of a sharp flint or a glittering knife-in itself, at best,
            but a sign-when they had already experienced the blessing of a
            circumcision that drew no blood, and gave no pain-a circumcision
            “not made with hands”? The meaning of the adjective ἀχειροποίητος is
            very apparent. Mk 14:58, and 2 Cor 5:1. The circumcision made
            without hands is plainly opposed to that which is made with
            hands-χειροποίητος. [Eph 2:11.] This idea of a spiritual
            circumcision was no novel one, for it occurs in the Old Testament in
            different forms. When Israel was yet in the wilderness, the Divine
            command was given—“Circumcise the foreskin of your heart,” and at
            the same period the Divine promise was made—“And the Lord thy God
            will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed, to love the
            Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul, that thou
            mayest live.” The prophet Jeremiah repeats the i
            njunction—“Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the
            foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of
            Jerusalem.” He also describes a part of the population thus—“Behold,
            their ear is uncircumcised;” nay, he declares that the whole house
            of Israel are “uncircumcised in the heart.” Ezekiel speaks of men
            “uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh.” Stephen, in his
            address, used this ancient phraseology, and calls his audience
            “uncircumcised in hearts and ears.” The Apostle Paul in other places
            has similar ideas and language. Schoettgen has adduced like
            quotations from the Rabbis, and Philo, as is his wont, spiritualizes
            the ordinance-as ἡδονῶν ἐκτομήν… παθῶν πάντων ἐκτομήν. So that the
            kind of circumcision referred to was easily understood, and could
            not be misinterpreted. It was besides an invaluable blessing, for it
            lay-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν τῇἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός—“In the putting off of the
            body of the flesh.” The noun ἀπέκδυσις occurs only here-the verb is
            found in the 15th verse. The MSS., A, B, C, D1, E1, F, G, etc., omit
            the words τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν, found in the Received Text. Flesh is
            corrupted humanity, Rom 7:23; Gal 5:16. [Eph 2:3.] We cannot take
            σῶμα in any other than its usual signification, though Calvin,
            Grotius, Zanchius, Crocius, Bähr, and Steiger, take it in the sense
            of totality or mass. See under Col 2:9. But the spirit of this
            exegesis is plainly implied. It is in harmony with the idea of
            circumcision, that the peculiar phrase—“body of the flesh,” is used;
            and the contrast seems to be this, that in the manual circumcision
            only a portion of one member of the material body was cut off, but
            in the spiritual circumcision, the whole flesh which is the seat and
            habitation of sin is cast away and laid aside. The entire slough
            which encircles the spirit and enslaves it is rolled off, newness of
            life is felt, and the believer walks no longer after the flesh, is
            no longer carnal, or does its deeds. As Meyer well says, “He who is
            so circumcised is no more ἐν τῇ σαρκί, as heretofore, when
            concupiscence ἐνηργεῖτο ἐν τοῖς μέλεσιν; he is no longer σάρκινος,
            πεπραμένος ὑπὸ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν, and walks no longer κατὰ σάρκα, but in
            newness of spirit.” It is plain that the spiritual circumcision is
            not different from regeneration, or the putting off the old man and
            putting on the new man. The apostle adds a further explanation of
            this marvellous change, when he says-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ—“In the circumcision of Christ.” Some
            have regarded the genitive as that of agent, as if the apostle meant
            - the circumcision which Christ performs. Such is the virtual view
            of Theophylact, when he says of Christ-ὅλον ἄνθρωπον περιτέμνει.
            Schoettgen, again, regards the phrase as an allusion to the personal
            circumcision of Jesus, as if that sufficed for all His people.
            Neither view is in harmony with the language and context. The
            circumcision of Christ is that circumcision which belongs to Him, in
            contradistinction to that which belonged to Moses or to the law. The
            spiritual circumcision is a blessing which specially belongs to
            Christ-is of His providing, and is to be enjoyed only in fellowship
            with Him. That of Moses was made with hands, and was a seal of the
            Abrahamic or national covenant-that of Christ is no chirurgical
            process, but is spiritual and effectual in its nature. The mark in
            the foreskin was the token of being a Jew, but the off-thrown body
            of the flesh was the index of one&#x27;s being a Christian. Though
            the scar of circumcision might attest a nationality, it was no
            certificate of personal character—“all are not Israel who are of
            Israel;” but, wherever “the flesh” was parted with, there was the
            guarantee of individual purity and progress. The charter of Canaan
            was limited to the manual circumcision, but the “true circumcision”
            are thereby infefted in a heavenly inheritance. The Hebrew statute
            was for the man-child eight days old, but the Christian privilege
            has no distinction of age, or sex, or nation; for it belongs to
            every one in Christ. And it was, and is, a chief blessing-the death
            of sinful principle and the infusion of a higher life-the possession
            of a new nature, which has Christ for its source, ay, and Christ for
            its pattern. Thus the flesh is thrown off, and the spirit assumes
            the predominance, wit h its quickened susceptibilities, its
            healthful activities, and its intense aspirations-thinking, feeling,
            and acting, in harmony with its sphere and destiny. And if such a
            collection of spiritual blessings has been received, why be
            subjected to a legal ceremony which could be at best but a faint
            type of them? Surely if they had received the thing signified, they
            need not now degrade themselves by submitting to a sign, which was
            in itself only a painful and bloody symbol of the Hebrew nationality
            and covenant.

          <p>
            Συνταφέντες αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ βαπτίσματι—“Having been buried with Him in
            baptism.” The state described in this past participle precedes or is
            coincident with the action of the verb περιετμήθητε. “Having been
            buried, they were circumcised.” The burial and the circumcision only
            differ in form and circumstance. The circumcision was seen to be
            effected when the burial was completed. Burial implies a previous
            death; and what is that death, but the off-casting of the body of
            the flesh? The reality of death is evinced by burial, for this body
            of sin which once lived with us is slain and sepulchred. This point
            of burial they had reached-when they were baptized-for then they
            personally professed a faith which implied the death of sin within
            them. Why then does the apostle use the figure of a burial? for the
            burial is as really without hands as is the circumcision-since no
            knife was employed at the one, and no bier or shroud was deposited
            in the other. The apostle employs the figure, first, to show the
            reality of the death which the old man had undergone; and, secondly,
            to connect the process by harmony of symbol or parallel with the
            resurrection of Christ, which was at once a sign and pledge of the
            resuscitation. Those two ideas, the excision of the body of the
            flesh, which is equivalent to its death, and the raising of Christ
            as the typal life and the Lifegiver, seem to have suggested to the
            apostle the notion of an intervening process-a burial with Christ.
            When you were baptized, you were so placed as if you had been laid
            with Christ in His tomb—“all old things passed away;” you were in
            respect to the old man what the dead Christ was in respect to His
            first physical life-dead to it and done with it. Only, He died for
            sin, and you die to it; He died for it in His body, while you die to
            it in your souls. But this burial is not a final state, it is simply
            one of trans ition—“In whom also ye are raised by faith.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The reference is plainly to the ordinance of baptism, and to its
            spiritual meaning. We scarcely suppose that there is any reference
            to the mode of it; for whatever may be otherwise said in favour of
            immersion, it is plain that here the burial is wholly ideal-not a
            scenic and visible descent into an earthy or a watery tomb, but of
            such a nature entirely as the circumcision with which it is
            identified, and the resurrection which invariably succeeds it. Thus,
            in the apostolic conception, men may be buried in baptism without
            being submerged in water, in the same way as they may be circumcised
            without the spilling of blood. The entire statement is spiritual in
            its nature-the death, the burial, and the resurrection; the
            circumcision, and the off-putting of the body of the flesh. The
            apostle looks on circumcision and baptism as being closely
            connected-the spiritual blessing symbolized by both being of a
            similar nature; though, probably, it would be straining this
            connection to allege it as a proof that baptism has been in all
            points ordained for the church in room of circumcision.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not within our province to enter on the question whether
            apostolical baptism was by immersion, sprinkling, or affusion. What
            we say is,-granting that immersion had been the early and authorized
            form of baptism, we are not prepared to admit any allusion to that
            form in the clause before us. It does not advance the opposite
            argument to say, that the immersion of a believer resembles a
            burial. This has been a favourite idea from very early times. And
            not only so, but trine immersion was often practised-one reason
            assigned being a reference to the Trinity, but another argument
            being that it was a symbolic allusion to the three days-τὴν
            τριήμερον-of Christ&#x27;s abode in the tomb. Still, to many minds
            there is manifest incongruity in the symbol. Where, in Scripture, is
            water the symbol of the world of death, or of the grave? It is
            always the means of washing-the instrument of purification. At what
            point of baptism is death symbolized-for it precedes burial? Means
            of imitating the death and resurrection of Jesus could be easily
            devised-for they were physical facts that could with no difficulty
            be pictured out. But a believer&#x27;s death and resurrection with
            Christ are spiritual events; and the same process cannot surely be
            the emblem of both classes of truths-cannot be at the same time the
            figure of a fact, and the figure of a figure. Death, burial, and
            resurrection, are truths not portrayed by gesture and position in
            baptism, but only recognized in it-not acted out, or represented in
            visible form, but only experienced and professed. Believers are
            buried in baptism, but even in immersion they do not go through a
            process having any resemblance to the burial and resurr ection of
            Christ. The Colossians did not personate death and burial in baptism
            any more than they imitated the circumcision of Moses. In a similar
            sense, though without reference to any sacramental institute,
            believers are crucified with Christ, though no nail pierce their
            hands; they are enthroned with Him, while they wear no symbol of
            royalty; and they have an unction from the Holy One, but no material
            oil is poured upon their heads.

          <p>
            ᾿Εν ᾧ καὶ συνηγέρθητε—“In whom too ye were raised together.” Beza,
            and after him Calixtus, Suicer, Steiger, Böhmer, De Wette, and
            Baumgarten-Crusius, refer the relative to βαπτίσματι. But the
            language would, in such a case, be inapt, as “out of baptism” would
            appear to be the natural expression. There appears to be no formal
            resemblance between baptism and burial in the apostle&#x27;s mind,
            and so he says not ἐξ οὗ, but simply ἐν ᾧ—“in whom,” that is, in
            Christ. Justinian and Davenant, Meyer and Huther, thus refer the
            pronoun—“With Him” they are buried—“in Him” they rise again; for
            union with Him is the one efficacious principle. The verb is
            explained and its meaning defended under Eph 2:6. It is not an ideal
            or potential spiritual resurrection secured for them, but one now
            and actually enjoyed by believers. The vivification of the soul
            involves in it, as a necessary result, the resurrection of the
            body-a result essential to the development of the new life in its
            highest sphere; but it is wrong in Theophylact to give this aorist
            verb a future meaning, or rather to mix up the two significations.
            While union with Christ is the bond of security, the instrumental
            cause is next described-
          </p>
          <p>
            Διὰ τῆς πίστεως—“By the faith.” A similar use of ἐν and διά is found
            in Eph 1:7, each preposition retaining its distinctive
            signification. It is faith which achieves this spiritual
            resurrection-belief in the Divine testimony is the vehicle which the
            Divine resurrectionary power employs. The apostle, Eph 1:19-20,
            prays that the Ephesians might know “what is the exceeding greatness
            of God&#x27;s power to us-ward who believe,” and the kind of power
            referred to is, as here, that which raised Christ from the dead, and
            which also quickens and raises up believers who had been “dead in
            trespasses and sins.” Thus it is faith-
          </p>
          <p>
            Τῆς ἐνεργείας τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν—“Of the
            operation of God who raised Him from the dead.” Many interpreters
            take the genitive as that of agency—“faith inwrought by God.” Such
            is the view of Flacius, Calixtus, the older interpreters, Luther,
            Melancthon, as also of Storr, Flatt, Bengel, Bähr, Böhmer, De Wette,
            Huther, Olshausen, and Conybeare. Luther renders-den Gott wirket;
            and Melancthon draws the lesson-non igitur potest suis viribus ratio
            fidem in nobis efficere. Whatever truth may be in this doctrine, and
            whatever may be the proof of it in other parts of Scripture, it is
            not the doctrine which the apostle here delivers. For according to
            usage in such a case, the genitive is that of object. So with regard
            to Θεοῦ, Mk 11:22 : ᾿Ονόματος, Acts 3:16; ᾿Ιησοῦ Χ., etc., Rom 3:22;
            Gal 2:16; Gal 2:20; Gal 3:22; Eph 3:12; Php 3:9; Jam_2:1; Rev 2:13 :
            Εὐαγγελίου, Php 1:27 : ᾿Αληθείας, 2 Thes 2:13. The genitive thus
            denotes the object of faith, or the thing believed. Such is the view
            of the mass of interpreters, of the Greek Fathers, of Calvin and
            Beza, of Grotius and Erasmus, of Meyer, Bloomfield, etc. The object
            of this vivifying faith is the Divine power which raised up Christ
            from the dead. The construction which the apostle employs in Eph
            1:19 -εἰς ἡμᾶς τοὺς πιστεύοντας κατὰ τὴν ἐνέργειαν κ-τ-α, is no
            argument against this view, for, as we have there said, κατά does
            not point out the source of faith, but turns attention to the model
            after which the Divine power operates in quickening the spiritually
            dead. A description of the Divine power, as showing itself in the
            resurrection of Christ, more naturally allies itself with the idea
            of spiritual resuscitation, which it resembles, than with that of
            the production of faith.
          </p>

            The sinner is raised out of death. United to Christ by the Spirit,
            and exercising a belief in God, he is justified and obtains legal
            life-exemption from the penalty of law; and he is also sanctified,
            or is endowed with spiritual life-comes to the conscious enjoyment
            of God&#x27;s favour, and the possession of His image. This faith
            has special reference to the Divine power in one of its
            manifestations, the raising of Jesus Christ from the dead. Power is
            evinced most strikingly in a resurrection-the restoration of a dead
            body to life is the work of Omnipotence. Love may pity, but power
            restores-a power which the apostle calls exceeding great and mighty.
            Eph 1:19. Faith lays hold on this phasis of omnipotence, and on this
            act of its achievement, because it feels that spiritual quickening
            is at once the result which springs from the one and is pledged by
            the other. The nature of this power and its relation to believers
            have been fully explained under a similar passage-Eph 1:20. The
            resurrection of Christ proves the acceptance of his atonement on the
            part of the Father, “who raised His Son from the dead, and gave Him
            glory that our faith and hope might be in God.” It therefore showed
            that the way of salvation was open, that the majesty of the law had
            been vindicated, and that the blessings of redemption might
            therefore be conferred in all their fulness and without restraint.
            Blood had been shed, and might now be sprinkled; and the Saviour
            being glorified, the Spirit might now descend. If I believe in that
            power which raised Jesus Christ from the dead, I believe in a power
            which might righteously have crushed me, but is now mercifully
            wielded to save me; which has set its seal on the work of Christ,
            and will now distribute and apply its rich results; and which,
            having exalted the Redeemer, has placed itself under a solemn
            stipulation to reward Him with a numerous seed, so that He shall
            “see of the travail of His soul and s hall be satisfied.” Thus, this
            power working out the purposes of Divine Love and the devices of
            Infinite Wisdom, stands out so employed as the object of saving
            faith.

            Καὶ ὑμᾶς νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς
            σαρκὸς ὑμῶν, συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ—“And you, being dead in
            trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you He quickened
            with Him.” Any differences of reading are too trivial to be noted
            save that which repeats ὑμᾶς on the authority of A, C, J, K. The
            apostle still continues the general thought without any formal and
            specific connection. The connection proposed by Steiger, namely, to
            join the first clause to the participle ἐγείραντος, is utterly
            untenable. It would create tautology, and the repetition of ὑμᾶς
            does not render it necessary. Bernhardy, p. 275. We far prefer
            connecting νεκρούς with the verb συνεζωοποίησεν. Though we admire
            the acuteness and general soundness of Meyer, yet we wonder how
            here, and in Eph 2:1, he comes to the conclusion that νεκρός refers
            to physical death. For the dead condition was one of reality, though
            it be past. It was not a liability to death; they were not, as he
            phrases it-so gut wie todt-certo morituri, they were mortui.
            Besides, the liability to physical death is not removed by faith in
            Christ. And the quickening and upraising are already experienced,
            they are not blessings to be enjoyed uncounted years afterwards. The
            apostle does not surely say-that believers were soon and certainly
            to die, and that when the Saviour came again, they should all be
            summoned out of their graves to the possession of eternal life. But
            he appeals to present enjoyments already conferred-to a death which
            had bound them, and a life which the Divine energy had infused into
            them. Meyer argues for the ideal possession of life now, and its
            full realization at the second coming. But if such ideal possession
            leave the dreadful reality untouched, it brings with it no good. If,
            instead of ideal poss ession, he had said partial possession, he
            would have come nearer the truth. For the life now enjoyed is, alas,
            too often faint and languid in its pulsations, and the fulness of
            its strength is a future bestowment. We therefore take the tenses in
            their simple significance, and not in any proleptic sense, as even
            Chrysostom takes them, and we regard the preposition ἐν before
            παραπτώμασιν, as denoting that condition in which spiritual death
            exists. When Meyer insists that the life to which believers are
            raised is eternal life, and that nothing less can be meant by the
            apostle, he forgets that present spiritual life precedes-that glory
            is only the consummation of grace, and that eternal life is but the
            crown and perfect development of emotions already felt, occupations
            already begun, and pleasures already experienced. The life implanted
            now is brought to maturity in a sphere where all is congenial to its
            tastes and instincts, its susceptibilities and powers. The
            Colossians had been really and spiritually dead, they were now as
            really and spiritually alive. They had been not only exposed to
            death on account of sin, but had been dead in sin. Now they are not
            simply gifted with the charter of a life yet to be reached, but they
            are actually living in faith and holiness. The nature of this death,
            and its connection with sin, along with the meaning of παραπτώμασιν,
            will be found explained in the parallel place, Eph 2:1, etc. There
            is no ground for Olshausen&#x27;s notion, that the prior clause has
            a general meaning, and that this verse begins a practical
            application; for the same appeal runs throughout, only it may be
            more pointed and intense in the verse before us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν—“And in the uncircumcision of your
            flesh.” The apostle here alludes to their Gentile extraction. They
            wanted in their flesh the seal of the Abrahamic covenant. We incline
            to take the words in their literal sense. Uncircumcision had,
            indeed, sometimes a spiritual meaning. Deut 10:16; Jer_4:4.
            Theodoret adopts such a sense here-ἀκροβ. τ. σαρκὸς τὴν πονηρίαν
            ἐκάλεσεν; so also Beza, Grotius, Bähr, Steiger. But such an
            interpretation rather takes up the result than gives the meaning.
            Thus, the Gentiles were uncircumcised, and in consequence were
            “aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the
            covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God.” Their
            degraded, miserable, idolatrous, and dead state was the effect of
            their uncircumcision. Calvin says-sed tamen Paulus hic loqueretur de
            contumacia cordis humani adversus Deum, et natura pravis
            affectionibus inquinata. But there is no occasion to take σάρξ in
            other than its physical meaning. Beza takes the genitive as one of
            apposition-flesh, which is uncircumcision, a thing abominable to
            God; while others render it-praeputium nempe vitiositas. That
            “uncircumcision” and “flesh” are to be taken in their ordinary
            physical sense, is also apparent from the change of person in the
            last clause. Did the term simply signify natural corruption, then
            the apostle himself was once in such a state. But he does not feel
            or say so. On the contrary, he makes the distinction you Gentiles
            were dead in the uncircumcision of your flesh-but we, Jew and
            Gentile alike, are forgiven our trespasses. See under next clause.
            Uncircumcision of the flesh was the physical mark of a heathen
            state, and that heathen state was in consequence of this want, and
            in itself, one of degradation, impurity and death. The flesh which
            had not the seal was truly corrupted and sinful. It is pressing the
            clause too much to bring out of it a proof of original sin, as is
            done by Zanchius and Bengel; the latter calls it-exquisita
            appellatio peccati originalis. The false teachers insisted
            strenuously on the necessity of circumcision-a theory very common in
            those times, for believing Jews were zealous of the law. But the
            apostle naturally says-True, ye were uncircumcised; your flesh had
            not been wounded so as to bear the sign of the Divine covenant, but
            ye have been circumcised, not with a manual operation, but with the
            circumcision of Christ. The apostle admits that they were
            uncircumcised, for they did not belong to Israel, but he has already
            contended that such a circumcision as that which of old disabled the
            Shechemites from self-defence, and kept the Israelites after they
            crossed the Jordan from commencing the conquest, did not become
            them, and was in their case wholly superfluous, for they had been
            spiritually initiated, and had put off the body of flesh. They had
            been dead in sins-this was their real moral state; dead too in the
            uncircumcision of their flesh, and this was their external and
            heathen condition. Looking at them as men, they were dead in
            sins-looking at them as heathen men, they were dead also in the
            uncircumcision of their flesh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ—“You He brought to life together with
            Him.” The nominative is still God-not Christ, as Heinrichs would
            have it. The work of quickening is God&#x27;s prerogative. This
            process of life-giving is not simply redemption, as De Wette gives
            it, but rather one special aspect or blessing of it. It is used with
            perfect propriety, for life is the blessing appropriate to the dead.
            Some wonder why συνηγέρθητε should have occurred before it, since
            the idea of resurrection so naturally follows that of life-giving.
            But in both places the verbs are in harmony with the figure; the
            apostle, in Col 2:12, speaks of burial, and therefore he employs the
            term resurrection, while here he speaks simply of death, and so he
            places life in correspondence and contrast with it. But not only so,
            there is also a difference of allusion and meaning. The burial there
            is a voluntary renunciation of sin, and off-casting of its body-the
            completing point of the process of death to sin; but here it is a
            death in sin which the apostle describes, and out of which the
            Colossians had been raised by the power of God, and through their
            union with Christ. The former is a series of acts in which the
            believer in the enjoyment of vivifying energy dies unto sin-and puts
            off the flesh. Nay, the more he lives, the more he dies; and in
            proportion to the growth and development of life are the extent and
            progress of death. It is a special view of the work of
            sanctification, in which, according to the measure of life to God,
            there is death to sin. But the death described in this verse is very
            different. It is a death which pre-exists life, and does not
            co-exist with it-death in sin-in consequence of its fatal reign and
            power. The one is dying-a conscious state; the other is death-a
            condition of insensibility and danger. In the one, the decay of love
            to sin may be registered; in the other, the mastery of sin is spirit
            ual paralysis and death. The nature of this life, and its connection
            with Christ, are illustrated under Eph 2:5.
          </p>
          <p>
            Χαρισάμενος ἡμῖν πάντα τὰ παραπτώματα—“Having forgiven us all our
            trespasses.” The reading ἡμῖν is on largely preponderant authority
            preferred to the ὑμῖν of the Received Text. It is easy to see how
            ὑμῖν should have been inserted, as ὑμᾶς precedes. Nor is it
            difficult to apprehend why the apostle should say “us” instead of
            “you.” He speaks in one clause of a distinctive feature of their
            past spiritual state—“dead in the uncircumcision of your flesh.”
            That was peculiar to them, but death in sin was common both to him
            and to them, and they were now both partakers of the “common
            salvation.” They both had enjoyed forgiveness, and so he
            says—“having forgiven us our trespasses.” The aorist participle
            points to forgiveness as something past, and yet preceding the act
            of life-giving. Having forgiven your trespasses, He has quickened
            you. The pardoning and life-giving are scarcely synonymous, as some
            would argue. But this dead state is a guilty state, for it is a
            sinful state, and all sin brings down upon itself the Divine
            displeasure and penalty. Having forgiven them these trepasses, which
            were the source and means of death, He brings them out of it. To
            have given them spiritual life, and yet kept them under the penalty
            of sin, which is legal death, would have been a process in which one
            gift neutralized its fellow. The restoration to life is thus the
            token and result of a prior forgiveness. The welcome to the prodigal
            son was a proof that he had been pardoned. The death was one in
            trespasses; and those very trepasses, yea “all” of them, are blotted
            out. The reader is requested to turn to what is said under chap. Col
            1:14, and under Eph 1:7. The life is not, as Böhmer imagines,
            subsequent to this forgiveness, because the pardon is God&#x27;s
            special act, whereas the life originates in man&#x27;s co-operation
            and response. This doctrine is neither stated nor implied. Nor is it
            true. For all life is God&#x27;s immediate gift, from its lowest to
            its highest forms. No human chemistry can produce it beneath us-no
            suasion nor art can create it within us. It is a drop out of the
            Fountain of Life. [Eph 1:20.] The apostle proceeds to describe the
            process through which sin was forgiven-or that work which God had
            done, the result of which had been to them life and forgiveness.

            ᾿Εξαλείψας τὸ καθ᾿ ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον—“Having blotted out the
            handwriting against us.” This verse is so curt and compact, that its
            analysis is not without difficulty. It is to be borne in mind that
            “God” is still the subject, and the alteration for which Heinrichs
            contends cannot for a moment be admitted. It will not do to say,
            with Trollope, that “the apostle, in the ardour of his mind, has not
            attended to the syntax.” What in other places is ascribed to Christ,
            may be here without any impropriety ascribed to God; for
            Christ&#x27;s suffering and death were of His sanction, and with His
            cooperation. What Christ did, God did by Him. Nor is there any
            argument here, as Bähr insinuates, against the satisfactio vicaria.
            For the satisfaction was offered by Christ, and God, having accepted
            it, did the act described in the participle ἐξαλείψας. This verb
            signifies to smear, or plaster over, and then it is used to denote
            the act by which a law or deed of obligation is cancelled. It is
            found with another signification, Rev 7:17; Rev 21:4. It occurs also
            in Rev 3:5; but it is used in a sense not very different from what
            it bears in this verse in Acts 3:19; and in Sept. Ps 50:1; Ps 50:9;
            Ps 108:13; Isa_43:25. In these places it describes the forgiveness
            of sin, where sin as a debt is supposed to be wiped out. The word
            occurs in Demosthenes-σκοπεῖσθε εἰ χρὴ τοῦτον [νόμονb ἐξαλεῖψαι. Its
            technical signification may be gathered from the fact that it stan
            ds opposed to ἀναγράφω, and sometimes to ἐγγράφω. Liddell and Scott,
            sub voce. The word, then, means here, to expunge. That to which the
            process of obliteration is applied is appropriately termed a
            handwriting-χειρόγραφον, a note of hand, a written bond. The term
            occurs only here in the New Testament, but is found in Tob_5:3;
            Tob_9:5; Josephus 17.14, 2; Polybius, Excerpta Legat. 98. Schoettgen
            and Vitringa take it as corresponding to the Hebrew ùÑèøçåá, and as
            denoting tabula debiti. But as it signifies a claim of unpaid debt,
            it is therefore also one of punishment, for it was καθ᾿
            ἡμῶν—“against us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the connection and meaning of τοῖς δόγμασιν have been variously
            taken. That it is to be joined with χειρόγραφον we have no manner of
            doubt.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Some, such as Erasmus, Storr, Flatt, Conybeare, and Olshausen,
            divide the verse thus-τὸ καθ᾿ ἡμῶν χειρόγ. τοῖς δόγμασιν, ὃ ἦν
            ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν—“The handwriting, which, by its ordinances, was
            against us.” Olshausen admits that, with such a construction, the
            position of the dative is not quite natural, and he quotes, along
            with Winer, Acts 1:3, with which this verse has little analogy. The
            admittedly natural reference of the dative is to χειρόγραφον.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Others attach δόγμασιν to the participle ἐξαλείψας, and
            understand it as describing the means by which the blotting has been
            effected. This is the view of the Greek expositors, of Grotius,
            Estius, Bengel, Fritzsche, and Böhmer. The explanation of δόγμασιν,
            by Theodoret, is ἡ εὐαγγελικὴ διδασκαλία; and by
            Theophylact-τουτέστι τῇ πίστει. To this we answer as we have done to
            the similar exegesis of Eph 2:15, that such a sense given to δόγμα
            is wholly unbiblical-that the declaration of Scripture is, that the
            handwriting against man, which we here understand to be the Mosaic
            law, is abrogated, not by any opposing or modifying enactments, but
            by the death of Christ. Besides, and more convincingly still, we
            learn from Col 2:20 that these δόγματα are no longer law, for the
            apostle says-τί δογματίζεσθε; why do ye suffer such δόγματα to be
            published or imposed? That is-these ordinances are abolished, and it
            is now the height of folly for others to re-enact them, or for you
            to observe them. The cognate verb of the 20th verse is used with
            special reference to the noun of this verse. Whatever these
            ordinances are, they belong to an obsolete economy, and are no
            longer of any obligation, for they were on the handwriting which has
            been wiped out.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Steiger joins δόγμασιν with the participle in this verse. He
            understands the phrase as defining one special phase of the
            handwriting—“the handwriting in respect of its ordinances.” Having
            blotted out the handwriting in this aspect of it, viz. its
            enactments-plainly implying that in some other aspect of it it still
            stands unrepealed. See on this view, also, our comment on Eph 2:15.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Bähr, Huther, and De Wette understand δόγμασιν as belonging to
            the whole clause, or rather as explaining how it came that the
            handwriting was against us. It is because of its δόγματα that it is
            against us; De Wette renders-durch die Satzungen. Calovius and
            Gieseler supply the participle ὄν-the handwriting which is, or being
            in its ordinances against us.

            5. But keeping the words in their natural position and connection
            with χειρόγραφον, there is variety of view. Calvin, Beza, Vitringa,
            Wolf, Camerarius, Heinsius, and others, eke out the construction
            from the parallel passage of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and would
            supply at discretion either ἐν or σύν-the handwriting consisting in
            ordinances, or the handwriting along with its ordinances; or taking
            the dative for the genitive, the handwriting of ordinances.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Meyer takes the dative as that of instrument. The δόγματα, in his
            view, as a constituent portion of the law, are that with which the
            handwriting is made out. We prefer calling the simple dative that of
            form, that distinctive and well-known form which the handwriting
            assumed. In this way, the dative is governed by the verbal portion
            of the noun, γραφον-that is γεγραμμένον. The apostle thus describes
            the handwriting as of a special shape, it assumed the form of
            ordinances. Had the apostle said ἐν δόγμασιν, the meaning would have
            been-which consisted of ordinances; a meaning which, however, is not
            materially different from that to which we incline, as the form is
            but the index to the substance. Our view also embraces inferentially
            that given under No. 4. We do not say that the handwriting is
            against us because of its δόγματα, but we say more largely, that the
            handwriting whose form of structure was that of δόγματα, is against
            us. For the meaning of δόγματα, see under Eph 2:15. This handwriting
            was καθ᾿ ἡμῶν—“directed against us.” After verbs, and in phrases
            implying hostility in word or action, κατά denotes against, and
            points out the direction of the hostility. And to explain more fully
            his meaning, the apostle adds-
          </p>
          <p>
            ῝Ο ἦν ὑπεναντιον ἡμῖν—“Which was inimical to us.” It is a needless
            refinement on the part of Beza, Böhmer, and Robinson, to lay stress
            upon the ὑπό, as if a covert or under-hand hostility were implied,
            or as if it had been unnoticed, or as if, as Suicer and Witsius
            think, it is only in some sense contrary to us, because in another
            sense it was a symbol of coming grace. None of these meanings are
            sustained by biblical usage. Sept. Gen 22:17; Lev_26:17; Exo_23:27;
            Num_10:9; Deut 32:27; Jos_5:13; in which places it represents one or
            other of the two Hebrew terms-àÉéÅá, H367, or öÇø, H7639. The word
            is one of those frequent compounds which characterize the later
            Greek, and mark it as a period of decay. Thus we do not, like many
            expositors, take καθ᾿ ἡμῶν and ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν as synonyms, or the
            latter as explanatory of the former, but we regard the two
            statements as giving two distinct ideas. Bengel compares the first
            to a status belli, and the second to ipsa pugna. It has a hostile
            attitude-it has also in it a deep and active antagonism. The
            question then recurs, what is the hostile handwriting?
          </p>
          <p>
            1. A strange exposition is found in ancient times-that the
            handwriting is man&#x27;s corporeal frame. Theodoret expressly
            says-ἡγοῦμαι τοίνυν καὶ τὸ σῶμα ἡμῶν καλεῖσθαι χειρόγραφον. That is,
            probably, our body, as represented by Christ&#x27;s humanity, which
            was nailed to the cross. This is, to some extent, the view of
            Steiger, given both in his Commentary on 1 Pet 2:24, and in this
            place. In the first comment referred to, he says—“Our sin adhered to
            Him until it was legally destroyed in His body, and His body was in
            this respect like a handwriting over our guilt.” Again, he adds,
            “That by the appointment of His Son to be our sacrifice, God set out
            a corporeal document of our guilt.” On the verse before us he
            writes:—“The body of Christ, as a body, is no handwriting; but it is
            that body, destined to be a sin-offering, which is at once a
            document exhibiting our guilt, and representing the law, in so far
            as the latter serves the purpose of an indictment.” The image,
            however, is not very distinct, and the sacrificial body of the Lord
            was rather a witness of our sin, than a handwriting against us. But
            the idea is, that something different from Christ, and yet closely
            associated with Him, was obliterated in His death. Steiger&#x27;s
            notion is evidently based upon a literal interpretation of the last
            clause of the verse, yet it is wholly out of harmony with the entire
            phraseology. And in what sense does a body resemble a handwriting?
            or how could it be hostile to us? or how has it been taken out of
            the way?
          </p>
          <p>
            2. An opinion as ancient as the preceding supposes the handwriting
            to be the broken covenant which God originally made with Adam. This
            opinion is found in Chrysostom, Theophylact and OEcumenius, Ambrose
            and Anselm. Bähr, and others, trace this opinion to Irenaeus.
            Speaking of the handwriting of our debt as affixed to the cross, he
            says-quemadmodum per lignum facti sumus debitores Deo, per lignum
            accipiamus nostri debiti remissionem.The use of this fanciful
            analogy can scarce, perhaps, be taken as a formal exegesis, though
            he regards the handwriting generally as sin. Tertullian is said to
            hold a similar notion, but his opinion will be seen to be more in
            unison with our own. Bähr well objects to this view, that errors on
            this subject are not among those alleged to be held by the false
            teachers, and that this Adamic covenant, containing principally one
            prohibition, could in no appropriate sense have such a descriptive
            plural noun as δόγματα attached to it. The whole paragraph refers to
            a later transaction altogether than the covenant of Eden.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. The reformers Melancthon, Luther, and Zuingli thought the
            reference to be to the accusations of conscience. The guilty
            conscience resembles a guilt-book, or an indictment. Besides
            replying, with Bähr, that this exegesis does not tally with the
            purpose of the paragraph, nor with the idea implied in δόγματα, we
            may add, that the notion of the Reformers is wholly of a subjective
            nature, whereas the verse presents an objective view of the work of
            God in Christ. It tells us what God has done as the means of
            enabling Him to forgive sins, but their interpretation points to a
            blessing which follows only from the forgiveness of sin. The act of
            God is prior to forgiveness-is external in its nature; while pardon,
            with a quieted conscience, is one of the results of the believing
            reception of it. An inner conviction, also, cannot be well figured
            as an outer and written record of many heads against us. These
            critics confound what follows from faith in the cross, with what was
            done upon the cross that faith might secure such a result. It is one
            thing to expunge an indictment, and quite another thing to have the
            blessed consciousness that we actually share in the indemnity.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Not a few understand the apostle to refer to the ceremonial law,
            or the Mosaic law in its ritual part or aspect. Such is the view of
            Calvin, Beza, Crocius, van Till, Gomar, Vorstius, Grotius, Deyling,
            Schoettgen, Wolf, Bähr, and others. This is, no doubt, the common
            view, and it is true so far as it goes. The entire ritual, with its
            lustrations and sacrifices, had a close and constant connection with
            sin—“in them was a remembrance of sin every year.” It is true that
            it was abrogated by the death of Christ on the cross, and it is also
            true that one special error of the false teachers was the
            inculcation of ceremonial distinctions and observances, and that the
            apostle has such mischievous teaching specially in view. But it is
            not the less true that the apostle makes no such distinction between
            one part of the Mosaic law and another. In the parallel passage in
            the twin epistle the apostle speaks of the “enmity” produced by the
            ceremonial law, but that was an enmity of races-between Israel who
            possessed it, and Non-Israel which wanted it. So that, in order to
            their union, the cause of separation and mutual dislike must be
            taken out of the way. But here the apostle speaks not of race and
            race-nor of Jew and Gentile as separated in blood and creed, but of
            both as being in the same condition-having a handwriting against
            them. He does not specify separate parties, he says “us,” whether
            Jew or Gentile. Nay, more, it is to Gentiles, distinguished by the
            uncircumcision of their flesh, and never placed under the ceremonial
            law, that the apostle is speaking. That law spoke, indeed, of sin,
            but it spoke intelligibly only to those who understood its symbols,
            and obeyed its prescriptions. Still the ceremonial law was against
            the Gentiles, as it kept them out of the Divine covenant. Moreover,
            the apostle is writing of a blessing not determined in its
            distribution by race or blood, but enjoyed by all the members of the
            church-the forgiveness of sin. But the forgiveness of sin was not
            secured by the simple abrogation of the Levitical law, for its
            abrogation is only one, though an important one, of the many results
            of the death on Calvary.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Therefore we are inclined, with Meyer, De Wette, Davenant,
            Neander, Böhmer, Huther, and others, to understand the reference of
            the apostle to the entire Mosaic law. That law presents a
            condemnation of the whole human race—“that all the world may become
            guilty before God.” Davenant says—“I accordingly explain the
            handwriting in ordinances to mean the force of the moral law binding
            to perfect obedience, and condemning for any defect in it, laden
            with the ceremonial rites as skirts and appendages.” But lest this
            opinion should imply that the moral law was abolished, he adds—“the
            law as to the power of binding and condemning is abrogated, and its
            rites and ceremonies are at the same time abolished.” But whatever
            the handwriting, with its ordinances, is, it undergoes only one
            process-it is blotted out. The distinction referred to, however true
            in result, cannot therefore be sustained as an interpretation. So
            that we take χειρόγραφον, not as denoting the Mosaic law absolutely
            and in itself, but rather in its indictment. It is against us, at
            once in direction and operation. It is the finding of the law which
            is against us, as well as its dogmatic form. And this, especially,
            is a bond, a writing which pronounces our sentence of death. This is
            Chrysostom&#x27;s view in its result, and also that of Tertullian,
            who writes-chirographum mortis, symbolum mortis.Schoettgen, in loc.,
            adduces a similar rabbinical expression; when one sins, God dooms
            him to die, but when he repents, the handwriting is abolished-
            äëúáîúáèì. It is not, therefore, so much the law with the authority
            of legislation, as the law with its power of punishment. It is not
            the code prescribing duty, but rather as at the sam e time
            authorizing the infliction of merited penalty, which becomes the
            χειρόγραφον. In this view, the δόγματα are a handwriting, or a bond
            which exhibits and warrants our liability to punishment. But the
            liability to penalty is expunged, the handwriting is wiped out. The
            law in itself is not, and cannot be contrary to men, but it has
            become so because they have failed to obey it. Its precepts are not
            hostile to them, for obedience to them would secure our welfare. The
            law has been given, both moral and ceremonial; the first has been
            universally broken, and therefore every man is exposed to its curse;
            the second presents this melancholy truth in its ritual
            bloodshedding and expiation; but what the one charged, and the other
            confessed, has been obliterated. The claim of condemnation exhibited
            by the moral law, and traced in the blood and read by the fires of
            the Levitical law has now been blotted out; not the moral law
            itself, as it must be eternal and immutable-having its origin in the
            Divine nature, and forming an obligation under which every creature
            is placed by the fact of his existence. “Do we make void the law
            through faith?” asks the apostle, and his reply is, “Nay, God
            forbid, we establish the law.” If the death of Christ was necessary
            to cancel the indictment which the law presented, it only
            strengthens and ratifies its preceptive authority. It follows,
            however, that if the special purpose of the ceremonial law was to
            confess the fact of man&#x27;s exposure to the curse, and portrays
            the mode of his deliverance from it, then, surely, the curse being
            borne, and the condemning sentence expunged, the Levitical code has
            served its purpose, and ceases to exist. What it taught in symbol,
            is now enforced in reality; what it foreshadowed in type, has now
            become matter of history. And this it is the special object of the
            apostle to show as a lesson and caution to the Colossians.
          </p>
          <p>
            This handwriting had assumed the form of “ordinances.” In Eph 2:14,
            the apostle uses the term expressly of the ceremonial law and its
            positive institutions. But the two places are not entirely
            analogous. There the apostle describes the ceremonial code as a
            hedge between Jew and Gentile, and shows how, through its abolition
            by Christ in His death, the union of the two races was secured, both
            being, at the same time, and by the same event, reconciled to God.
            Here, however, as the apostle speaks specially of the spiritual
            results of Christ&#x27;s death, and of these as effected by God the
            Father, he seems, as we have said, to refer to the entire Mosaic
            Institute, but especially to the ceremonial law, as it was so
            palpable and prominent a portion of the system, and contained such a
            number of minute and peremptory enactments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου—“And He has taken it out of the way.”
            The use of the perfect tense adds emphasis to the verb-he took it
            out of the way, and still it remains out of the way. The apostle
            says, καὶ αὐτό-this very document, terrible as it is; that is to
            say, He not only blotted out the writing upon it, but He has taken
            out of the way the parchment itself; or, as Theophylact says-ἐποίησε
            μηδὲ φαίνεσθαι. The idiom ἐκ τοῦ μέσου (the contrast being ἐν τῷ
            μέσῳ) is no uncommon one. On the change of construction from
            participle to verb marking emphasis, see under Col 1:6. Winer, § 63,
            I.2, b. How God has taken it so effectually out of the way is next
            told us-
          </p>
          <p>
            Προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ—“Having nailed it to the cross.” The
            participle occurs only here in the New Testament, but is similarly
            found in 3Ma_4:9. The allusion is not to the tablet nailed to the
            cross above the sufferer, as Gieseler assumes, but to the
            crucifixion of the Redeemer Himself. There seems to be no historical
            ground for the illustration of Grotius, that it was customary to
            thrust a nail through papers-declaring them old and obsolete, much
            in the same way as a Bank of England note is punched through the
            centre when declared to be no longer of value, and no longer to be
            put into circulation. The idea of the apostle is, that when Christ
            was nailed to the cross, the condemning power of the law was nailed
            along with Him, and died with Him—“Now we are delivered from the
            law, that being dead in which we were held.” Rom 7:6. In other
            words, God exempts sinners from the sentence which they merit,
            through the sufferings and death of Jesus. The implied doctrine is,
            that the guilt of men was borne by Christ when he died-was laid on
            Him by that God who by this method took the handwriting out of the
            way. Jesus bore the sentence of the handwriting in Himself, and God
            now remits its penalty; having forgiven you all your trespasses,
            inasmuch as He has blotted out the hostile handwriting and taken it
            out of the way, for He nailed it to the cross of His Son. Meyer
            remarks, that ἐξαλείφειν and αἴρειν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου are not two really
            distinct acts, but represent the same thing. We would rather say,
            that the first term characterizes the act, and the second refers to
            the completed result; while the third participle-προσηλώσας-defines
            the external mode of accomplishment.

            connection, nay, the identity of the two acts; or, perhaps, of the
            process in which the two acts were completed. In blotting out the
            handwriting, God at the same time vanquished Satan. If ever there
            was bathos in exegesis, it is in that of Rosenmüller-that when Jesus
            rose again from the dead, it was seen how vain were the efforts of
            the Jewish magistrates against Him. Suicer, Junker, and others, take
            a similar view. The terms have been explained under Col 1:16, and
            under Eph 1:21; Eph 6:12. We cannot agree with Pierce that good
            angels are meant; they needed not to be spoiled or triumphed over
            openly. Hostile spiritual powers are plainly designated. Their reign
            over man had its origin in his sin; and their usurpation lasted till
            sin was atoned for, and its power destroyed. Hence Satan is called
            the “god” and “prince of this world.” [Eph 2:2;] Lk 11:22.

            The verb ἀπεκδύομαι, which means literally to cast off anything,
            such as clothing, has been taken by many as referring to
            Christ&#x27;s own death, as if he had cast off the flesh in dying-an
            idea which seems to have originated the reading τὴν σάρκα, in F, G,
            seen too in the Syriac, and followed by some of the Latin Fathers.
            Augustine has-spolians se carne. So that the figure has been
            supposed to be that of a naked wrestler. But the diction of the

            must have the sense of spoiling; conquering, and then making the
            vanquished a spoil, as is done when a fallen foe is stript of his
            armour. This last is the idea and image of Meyer, which perhaps is
            too minute, for the general figure is, that He stript them of all
            power and authority. The compound form of the verb indicates how
            completely this was done; ἐκδύειν is used in the sense of spoliare,
            and the Vulgate here renders exspolians.
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εδειγμάτισεν ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ—“He made a show of them openly.” The
            allusion is plainly to the triumph which is celebrated after a
            battle. His spiritual foes, on being vanquished, were exhibited as a
            public spectacle. The meaning is not that He exposed their
            weakness-τὴν ἀσθένειαν ἔδειξε, as Theodoret understands it. That is
            certainly implied, but the idea is, He has shown the fact of their
            complete subjugation in His triumph over them. There is no ground to
            give the simple verb the sense of the compound-παραδειγματίζειν, and
            add the idea of shame, as is done by Theophylact, Beza, Röell,
            Storr, and Conybeare. Such an idea, as well as that of weakness, may
            be indeed inferred from the humiliating exposure. And it was no
            private parade, it was done ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ—“openly.” Jn 7:4.
            Theophylact gives it rightly-δημοσίᾳ, πάντων ὁρώντων—“openly, in the
            eyes of all;”-kühnlich, frei und frank, as Meyer paraphrases it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Θριαμβεύσας ἐν αὐτῷ—“Having triumphed over them in it.” The
            participle is used in 2 Cor 2:14, with a hiphil sense, and it here
            occurs with the accusative, like the Latin-triumphare aliquem.
            Adhering to the hiphil sense—“maketh or causeth to triumph,” some
            would supply ἡμᾶς-maketh us to triumph over them. Such an idea only
            encumbers the sense. The three verbs in the verse do not form a
            climax. But the spiritual foes are spoiled, and then they are
            exposed; while the last participle defines the manner and purpose of
            the exposure-it formed a public triumph. The truth expressed is,
            that there has been complete and irretrievable subjugation.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the meaning and reference of the last words ἐν αὐτῷ are
            doubtful. The Syriac and Vulgate, with Theodoret, and the editors
            Griesbach and Scholz, read ἐν αὑτῷ—“in Himself.” If the reference be
            made to Christ, then it is wrong, for God is the nominative; and if
            to God, then the phrase is not very intelligible. Meyer takes the
            reference to be to the principal noun of the preceding
            verse-χειρόγραφον. His meaning is, that the expunged and perforated
            handwriting was a proof of Satan&#x27;s overthrow. This exegesis,
            however, gives a fulness of meaning to ἐν αὐτῷ, which the words will
            not bear. They simply mean “in it,” that is, in the handwriting. Now
            it was not in the handwriting simply that God obtained His victory,
            but in obliterating it, and nailing it to the cross-an idea that
            could not be expressed by the bare ἐν αὐτῷ. “In the cheirograph,”
            and in what he did with the cheirograph, are very different ideas,
            requiring very different forms of diction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Opinions are nearly divided as to whether ἐν αὐτῷ refers to Christ
            or to the cross. Wolf, Musculus, Bengel, Storr, Flatt, Rosenmüller,
            Bähr, Huther, and De Wette, hold the first view. Our objection to
            this view is, that in the two verses no mention is made of Christ.
            The work is wholly ascribed to God-not formally to God in Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            And therefore we incline to the other opinion, that ἐν αὐτῷ carries
            us back to σταυρῷ. Such is the opinion of the Greek Fathers,
            Theophylact and OEcumenius, of Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Crocius,
            Steiger, Böhmer, and Olshausen. Origen has no less than eight times
            for ἐν αὐτῷ the phrase ἐν τῷ ξύλῳ. Epiphanius, Macarius, and
            Athanasius, read either so, or ἐν σταυρῷ. The reading is a gloss,
            but it shows the general opinion. In the cross God achieved His
            victory over the infernal powers—“through death,” he “that had the
            power of death” was destroyed. Through the agency of fallen spirits
            sin was introduced, and it was the sphere of their dominion; they
            could rule in a condemned world, but not in a redeemed one; and when
            that world was released from death by the death of Christ, the
            instrument of His death was the weapon of conquest and symbol of
            victory over them. Most strong is the prevailing opinion of the
            mediaeval Latin church, as seen in Aquinas, Anselm, and others, that
            this spoiling was in the nether world, and over the daemons who held
            the souls of the patriarchs in captivity, and that the triumphal
            procession was the march of the imprisoned spirits out of the limbus
            patrum. [Eph 4:8-9.] The subject throughout the previous context is
            God, not Christ; and the whole notion is an idle chimera.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most glorious is the thought that the church is released from the
            bond that held it, and delivered from the hellish powers that
            tyrannized over humanity-a deliverance achieved for it by Him alone
            “whose right hand and holy arm” could get Him the victory.
            Redemption is a work at once of price and power, of expiation and
            conquest. On the cross was the purchase made; on the cross was the
            victory gained. The blood that wipes out the sentence was there
            shed, and the death which was the death-blow of Satan&#x27;s kingdom
            was there endured. Those nails which killed Christ pierced the
            sentence of doom-gave egress to the blood which cancelled it, and
            inflicted at the same time a mortal wound on the hosts of darkness.
            That power which Satan had exercised was so prostrated, that every
            one believing on Christ is freed from his vassalage. Christ&#x27;s
            death was a battle, and in it God achieved an immortal victory. The
            conflict was a furious one, mighty and mysterious in its struggle.
            The combatant died; but in dying He conquered. Hell might be
            congratulating itself that it had gained the mastery, and might be
            wondering what should be the most fitting commemoration and trophy,
            when He who died arose the victor-no enemy again daring to dispute
            His power or challenge His right, and then God exhibited His foes in
            open triumph. “The prince of this world is cast out.”
          </p>
          <p>
            All this teaching bore upon the Colossian church and its crisis. Let
            not the ritual law-which exhibits the condemning power of the whole
            law-be enacted among you, for it has been fully and formally
            abrogated. Let not your minds be dazzled or overawed by esoteric
            teaching about the spirit-world. All those spirits are beneath the
            Divine Master; if good, they are His servants; if evil, they are
            conquered vassals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now follows the pointed and practical lesson. Already had they been
            warned against one phasis of error—“philosophy and vain deceit,” and
            a sufficient reason is given. Next is rehearsed their privilege of
            circumcision and baptism, their death to sin and their life to God.
            Here their forgiveness is stated along with the means which had been
            taken to secure it; and this process, so decided and characteristic,
            lays the foundation for the warning in the verse which we are now to
            consider.

          <h2>INFANT BAPTISM</h2>
          <p>
            The baptism of unconverted children, and unconscious infants, has
            become common through the Christian world. The Romish Church, the
            Greek Church, and many of the Protestant churches, practice it. Yet
            Baptists condemn it as unscriptural, unreasonable, and injurious.
            They believe that repentance and faith should always precede baptism
            and that whenever one exercises these, whether old or young, then he
            should be admitted to the holy ordinance of baptism, but never till
            he has believed. Infants, incapable of faith, are unfit for baptism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Westminster Confession states: "IV. Not only those that do
            actually profess faith in and obedience unto Christ, (Mar 16:15-16;
            Act 8:37-38); but also the infants of one, or both, believing
            parents, are to be baptized, (Gen 17:7, 9; Gal 3:9, 14; Col 2:11-12;
            Act 2:38-39; Rom 4:11-12; 1Co 7:14; Mat 28:19; Mar 10:13-16; Luk
            18:15)."

            This being one of the texts cited to prove infant baptism, I think
            it would be good to look at some historical points on the matter.

            If the baptism of children was not appointed by Christ, nor
            practiced by his apostles, what was its origin, and when did it come
            into use?
          </p>
          <p>
            Tertullian is the first who mentions something like this custom, and
            he earnestly opposes it. This was at the close of the second
            century, or about A.D. 200:
          </p>
          <p>
            "And so, according to the circumstances and disposition, and even
            age, of each individual, the delay of baptism is preferable;
            principally, however, in the case of little children. For why is it
            necessary — if (baptism itself) is not so necessary — that the
            sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? Who both themselves,
            by reason of mortality, may fail to fulfil their promises, and may
            be disappointed by the development of an evil disposition, in those
            for whom they stood? The Lord does indeed say, Forbid them not to
            come unto me. Let them come, then, while they are growing up; let
            them come while they are learning, while they are learning whither
            to come; let them become Christians when they have become able to
            know Christ. Why does the innocent period of life hasten to the
            remission of sins? More caution will be exercised in worldly
            matters: so that one who is not trusted with earthly substance is
            trusted with divine! Let them know how to ask for salvation, that
            you may seem (at least) to have given to him that asks. For no less
            cause must the unwedded also be deferred — in whom the ground of
            temptation is prepared, alike in such as never were wedded by means
            of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom —
            until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for
            continence. If any understand the weighty import of baptism, they
            will fear its reception more than its delay: sound faith is secure
            of salvation." (<a

            His opposition to it proves two things. First, that it was in
            occasional use at least; and second, that it was of recent origin.
            For it must have been in use to be mentioned at all, and if it had
            long been in use, it would have been earlier alluded to. Also note
            that the word he uses refers to little growing children, from six to
            ten years old. Tertullian, in his opposition to infant baptism, does
            not say one word of newborn infants.

              urged the baptism of infants proper because of the regenerating

              take this ground. (</span

              "It is impossible without baptism to obtain the kingdom. It is
              impossible to be saved without it." And as cited by Wall, he says:
              "If sudden death seize us before we are baptized, though we have a
              thousand good qualities, there is nothing to be expected but
              hell.” (</span

            The Protestant Churches generally have held, and to a degree do
            still hold, the same unscriptural dogma. See the following
            Protestant confessions, which embrace it: the Confession of
            Helvetia, that of Bohemia, of Augsburg, of Saxony, of Wittemburg, of
            Sueveland, of the Church of England, and of the Westminster
            Assembly.

            From Justin Martyr down to St. Austin, this text was understood in
            that way. Calvin was the first man that ever denied this place to
            mean baptism and supported infant baptism with no historical
            justification for doing so because his theology was very different
            than what gave rise to the doctrine in the first place.
