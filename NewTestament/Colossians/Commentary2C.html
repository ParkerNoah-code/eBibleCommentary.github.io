        <div id="Expository" class="commentary">
          <h2>
            Ver 15.
            <em
              >He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
              creation.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>He is the image of the invisible God</em>. Not of deity, though
            the fulness of it dwells in him; nor of himself, though he is the
            true God, and eternal life; nor of the Spirit, who also is God, and
            the Spirit of the Son; but the Father, called "God", not to the
            exclusion of the Son or Spirit, who are with him the one God: "and
            he is invisible"; not to the Son who lay in his bosom, and had
            perfect and infinite knowledge of him; nor, in some sense, to
            angels, who always behold his face, but to men: no man hath seen him
            corporeally with the eyes of his body, though intellectually with
            the eyes of the understanding, when enlightened; not in his essence
            and nature, which is infinite and incomprehensible, but in his works
            of creation, providence, and grace; nor immediately, but mediately,
            in and through Christ, in whom he gives the light of the knowledge
            of the glory of his person and perfections; and this not perfectly
            now, but in the other state, when the saints shall see him face to
            face.
          </p>
          <p>
            But chiefly the Father is said to be invisible, because he did not
            appear to Old Testament saints; as his voice was never heard, so his
            shape was never seen; he never assumed any visible form; but
            whenever any voice was heard, or shape seen, it was the second
            person that appeared, the Son of God, who is here said to be his
            "image", and that, as he is the Son of God; in which sense he is the
            natural, essential, and eternal image of his Father, an eternal one,
            perfect and complete, and in which he takes infinite complacency and
            delight: this designs more than a shadow and representation, or than
            bare similitude and likeness; it includes sameness of nature and
            perfections; ascertains the personality of the Son, his distinction
            from the Father, whose image he is; and yet implies no inferiority,
            as the following verses clearly show, since all that the Father hath
            are his. Philo, the Jew f, often speaks of the λογος, or Word of
            God, as the image of God. Also, this may be understood of him as
            Mediator, in whom, as such, is a most glorious display of the love,
            grace, and mercy of God, of his holiness and righteousness, of his
            truth and faithfulness, and of his power and wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The firstborn of all creation</em>. Not the first of the
            creation, or the first creature God made; for all things in
            Colossians 1:16 are said to be created by him, and therefore he
            himself can never be a creature; nor is he the first in the new
            creation, for the apostle in the context is speaking of the old
            creation, and not the new: but the sense either is, that he was
            begotten of the Father in a manner inconceivable and inexpressible
            by men, before any creatures were in being; or that he is the "first
            Parent", or bringer forth of every creature into being, as the word
            will bear to be rendered, if instead of πρωτ¢tokov, we read
            πρωτοτ¢kov; which is no more than changing the place of the accent,
            and may be very easily ventured upon, as is done by an ancient
            writer g, who observes, that the word is used in this sense by
            Homer, and is the same as πρωτογονος, "first Parent", and
            πρωτοκτιστης, "first Creator"; and the rather this may be done,
            seeing the accents were all added since the apostle's days, and
            especially seeing it makes his reasoning, in the following verses,
            appear with much more beauty, strength, and force: he is the first
            Parent of every creature, "for by him were all things created", c.
            Colossians 1:16, or it may be understood of Christ, as the King,
            Lord, and Governor of all creatures being God's firstborn, he is
            heir of all things, the right of government belongs to him; he is
            higher than the kings of the earth, or the angels in heaven, the
            highest rank of creatures, being the Creator and upholder of all, as
            the following words show; so the Jews make the word "firstborn" to
            be synonymous with the word "king", and explain it by גדול ושר, "a
            great one", and "a prince" h; see Psalms 89:27.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 16.
            <em
              >For by him all things were created in the heavens and on the
              earth, visible things and invisible things, whether thrones or
              dominions or principalities or powers. All things have been
              created through him and for him.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For by him all things were created</em>. This is a reason
            proving Christ to be before all creatures, to be the common Parent
            of them, and to have the government over them, since he is the
            Creator of them. The creation of all things, by him, is not to be
            understood of the new creation, for whenever that is spoken of, the
            word "new" is generally used, or what is equivalent to it, or some
            clause or phrase added, which determines the sense, and is not the
            case here: besides, all things that are in heaven are said to be
            created here: which, to say nothing of the sun, moon, and stars,
            which are not capable subjects of the new creation, to restrain them
            to angels, cannot be true of them; for as for those who were once in
            heaven, but kept not their first estate, and quitted their
            habitation, these find no place there any more; they never were, nor
            will be renewed and restored by Christ; and as for the good angels,
            since they never sinned, they stand in no need of renovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, all things that are on earth are also said to be created
            by him, and are, but not anew: for to confine these only to men, all
            men are not renewed in the spirit of their minds; all have not
            faith, nor a good hope through grace, nor love to God and Christ,
            the greater part of the world lies in open wickedness; and all that
            profess religion are not new creatures, these are a chosen
            generation, and a peculiar people: wherefore these words must be
            understood, not metaphorically, but literally; in which sense all
            things are created by Christ, not by him as an instrument, but as
            the efficient cause; for the preposition "by" does not always
            signify the former; but sometimes the latter; see 1 Corinthians 1:9;
            nor to the exclusion of the Father and Spirit, who, with the Son,
            were jointly concerned in the creating of all things out of nothing:
            and these "all things" can only refer to the things that are made:
            eternal things can never be said to be created; this is a
            contradiction in terms; the Father is not created by him, nor he
            himself as the Son of God, nor the Spirit; but everything that is
            made is created by him: hence it follows, that he himself is no
            creature, otherwise he must create himself, which also is a
            contradiction, since every creature is made by him; and consequently
            he must be God, for he that made and built all things is God. These
            are divided as to the subject of them, or place where they are, into
            things that are in heaven, and that are in earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the heavens and on the earth</em>. The things that are in
            heaven, are the things that are in the airy and starry heavens, and
            in the heaven of heavens. The things in the airy heavens, the fowls
            thereof, were on the fifth day created by him; and the things in the
            starry heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, were on the fourth day
            ordained by him; and the inhabitants of the third heaven, the
            angels, were made by him, Hebrews 1:7; and, as the Jewish writers i
            say, on the second day of the creation, though some say on the
            fifth. The earth comprehends the whole terraqueous globe, consisting
            of land and sea; and the things in it are all that are in the seas,
            the fishes and other things in it; and all that are in the bowels of
            the earth, as well as on the surface of it, all metals and minerals,
            all plants, herbs, and trees, every beast of the forest, the cattle
            on a thousand hills, the fowls on the mountains, and the wild beasts
            of the field, and all human creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Visible things and invisible things</em>. Both in heaven and in
            earth: the visible things in heaven are the fowls that fly in the
            airy heaven, the sun, and moon, and stars in the starry heaven, and
            the bodies of those saints that have been either translated, or
            raised, in the third heaven; the visible things in the earth are all
            creatures, animate and inanimate, rational and irrational, all
            bodies, all corporeal and material beings: the invisible things in
            earth are not only those that are in the innermost parts of it, but
            the spirits or souls of men; and those in heaven are not the
            invisible God, Father, Son, and Spirit, but the angels, who are
            incorporeal and immaterial spirits, and so invisible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers</em>.
            Are all made by him; by these some understand civil magistrates
            among men, and the various degrees and orders of them. By "thrones"
            they think kings, or monarchs, are meant, who sit on thrones; and by
            "dominions", little petty kings, or lords, dukes, and earls; and by
            "principalities", governors of provinces and cities; and by
            "powers", interior magistrates; and indeed, political governors are
            sometimes called dominions, dignities, principalities, and powers;
            and there are different orders of them, the king as supreme, and
            governors under him; see Judges 1:8. But since these seem rather to
            be said of the invisible things in heaven, and to be an explanation
            of them, angels may rather be thought to be intended; and are so
            called, not as denoting different orders and degrees among them,
            which some have rashly ventured to describe, but because of the use
            that God makes of them in the government of the world, and the
            executions of the various affairs of Providence relating to
            particular persons and kingdoms; though these several names are not
            so much such as the apostle chose to call them by, as what they were
            called by others; the three latter are indeed elsewhere used by
            himself, Ephesians 1:21; but not the former, "thrones", which yet
            are used by Jewish writers, and given to angels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the apostle's sense is, that the angels, the invisible
            inhabitants of the upper world, are all created by Christ, let them
            be called by what names they will, that the Jews, or the false
            teachers, or any sort of heretics of those times thought fit to give
            them, whether they called them thrones or dominions, c. And so the
            Arabic version, rather interpreting than translating the words,
            renders them thus, "whether you say thrones, or whether you mention
            dominions, or whether you understand princes, or whether you say
            powers" speak of them under what title or appellation you please,
            they are all the creatures of the Son of God. The apostle seems to
            have in view, and to oppose some notions of some heretics of his
            time, the followers of Simon Magus, who held, that the angels were
            created by his Helena; or, as others, by what they call "Ennea", and
            that these angels created the world, and are to be worshipped.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>All things have been created through him</em>. By Christ, even
            all the angels; and therefore he, and not they, are to be
            worshipped, a notion he afterwards takes notice of in the following
            chapter: and as all things are affirmed to be created by him, which
            demonstrates the dignity and deity of his person.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And for him</em>. That is, for his pleasure, that he may take
            delight and complacency in them, and in his own perfections
            displayed by them; and for his service and use, as the angels, to
            worship him and minister to him and for others, he sends them to:
            elect men are made to serve and glorify him with their bodies and
            spirits, which are his; and even the non-elect are made to subserve
            his mediatorial kingdom and interest; yea, the whole world is built
            and kept in being purely on his account, until he has finished the
            great affair of the salvation of his people, in the application of
            it to each of them, as he has completed the impetration of it; and
            then he will dissolve the heavens, and burn up the earth and all the
            works that are therein: all are made for his glory, and that end is,
            and will be answered by them in one way or another.

            works, and worthy of more honour than all creatures; but he is
            before them in existence, as he must needs be, since they are all
            made by him; he was not only before John the Baptist, his
            forerunner, before Abraham who saw his day and was glad, before the
            first man was made, but before the angels were in being, or the
            heavens and the earth, or any creature were formed; and therefore
            must be God, who is from everlasting to everlasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And in him all things are held together</em>. He upholds all

            and continuance from him; the pillars of the earth are bore up by
            him, otherwise that and the inhabitants of it would be dissolved;
            the angels in heaven are confirmed in their estate by him, and have
            their standing and security in him; the elector God are in his
            hands, and are his peculiar care and charge, and therefore shall
            never perish; yea, all mankind live and move, and have their being
            in him; the whole frame of nature would burst asunder and break in
            pieces, was it not held together by him; every created being has its
            support from him, and its consistence in him; and all the affairs of
            Providence relating to all creatures are governed, directed, and
            managed by him, in conjunction with the Father and the blessed
            Spirit.

            builds on himself the rock, and will, at last, present to himself a
            glorious church without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; this is
            compared to an human body, and therefore called "the body"; which is
            but one, consisting of many members in union with each other, set in
            their proper places in just symmetry and proportion to each other,

            elect men from all eternity, and in time; he is a political head of
            them, or in such sense an head unto them, as a king is to his
            subjects; he reigns in them by his Spirit and grace, and rules them
            by wholesome laws of his own enacting, and which he inscribes on
            their hearts, and he protects and defends them by his power; he is
            an economical head, or in such sense an head of them, as the husband
            is the head of the wife, and parents and masters are the heads of
            their families, he standing in all these relations to them; and he
            is to them what a natural head is to an human body; of all which 1
            Corinthians 12:12- :. The Messiah is called one head, in Hosea 1:11;
            which Jarchi explains by David their king, and Kimchi on the place
            says, this is the King Messiah.

            <em>Who is the beginning</em>. Which either denotes the eternity of
            Christ, who was not only in the beginning, and was set up from the
            beginning, from everlasting, but is also the beginning and the end;
            and who is, indeed, without beginning of days, or end of life: or
            his dominion; he is the principality, as the word may be rendered;
            he is the principality of principalities, the head of all
            principality and power, the angels; he is the Prince of the kings of
            the earth; he is King of saints; the kingdom of nature and
            providence is his, and the government of his people in a special
            manner is on his shoulders: or this may design his being the first
            cause of all things; he is the beginning of the creation of God; the
            efficient cause of all created beings; he is the beginning of the
            church, of which he is the head; as Eve was from Adam, so is the
            church from Christ; it is a body of his preparing, and a temple of
            his building, and where he sits as a priest on his throne, and has
            the government of it: the second number, wisdom, in the cabalistic
            tree of the Jews, is called "the beginning" n, as is the Logos, or
            Word, by Philo the Jewish historian.

            <em>The firstborn from the dead</em>. The first that rose from the
            dead by his own power, and to an immortal life; for, though others
            were raised before him, and by him, yet not to a state of
            immortality; the path of life, to an immortal life, was first shown
            to him as man; and who also is the firstfruits of them that sleep,
            and so the pledge and earnest of the future resurrection of the
            saints; and is both the efficient and exemplary cause of it; the
            resurrection of the dead will be by him as God, and according to his
            own, as man.

          <p>
            <em>That in all things he might have the preeminence</em>. Or might
            be the first and chief over all persons, angels, and men; having a
            superior nature, name, and place, than the former, and being the
            firstborn among many brethren designed by the latter: and in all
            things he is the first, and has the precedence and primacy; in
            sonship, no one is a Son in the sense he is; in election, he was
            chosen first, and his people in him; in the covenant, he is the
            surety, Mediator, and messenger of it, he is that itself; in his
            human nature, he is fairer than the children of men; in redemption,
            he was alone, and wrought it out himself; in life, he exceeded all
            others in purity, in doctrine, and miracles; and in dying he
            conquered death, and rose first from it; in short, he died, revived,
            and rose again, that he might be Lord both of dead and living; and
            he ought to have the pre-eminence and first place in the affections
            of our hearts, in the contemplations of our minds, in the desires of
            our souls, and in the highest praises of our lips.

            <em>For all the fullness</em>. The phrase, "the Father", is not in
            the original text, but is rightly supplied; since he is expressly
            mentioned in the context, as he who makes the saints meet to be
            partakers of the heavenly glory; who deliver, them from the power
            and dominion of sin, and translates them into the kingdom of his
            dear Son; and who, by Christ, reconciles all things to himself,
            Colossians 1:12, and whose sovereign will and pleasure it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Was pleased to dwell in him</em>. By which is meant, not the
            fulness of the deity, though it is read by some the fulness of the
            Godhead: which seems to be transcribed from Colossians 2:9; but
            though all the perfections of God are in Christ, as eternity,
            omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, independence,
            and necessary existence, and every other, or he would not be equal
            with God; nor could all the fulness of the Godhead be said to dwell
            in him, should anyone be wanting; yet this is a fulness possessed by
            him, that does not spring from, nor depend upon the Father's good
            will and pleasure; but what he naturally and necessarily enjoys by a
            participation of the same undivided nature and essence with the
            Father and Spirit: nor is the relative fulness of Christ intended,
            which is his church, so called, Ephesians 1:23; and will be so when
            all the elect are gathered in, and filled with all the gifts and
            graces of his Spirit, and are arrived to the measure of the stature
            of the fulness of Christ; for though every believer dwells in
            Christ, and Christ in him, yet the church is not said to dwell in
            Christ, but Christ in the church; moreover, as yet she is not his
            fulness, at least in the sense she will be, and much less can she be
            said to be all fulness: nor is this to be understood of Christ's
            fulness of fitness and abilities, as God-man and Mediator, to
            perform his work and office as such; though this may be taken into
            the sense of the text as a part, yet is not the whole; but rather
            chiefly that dispensatory communicative fulness, which is, of the
            Father's good will and pleasure, put into the hands of Christ to be
            distributed to others, is here designed.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a fulness of nature in Christ; the light of nature is from
            him, and communicated by him to mankind; the blessings of nature are
            the blessings of his left hand, which he distributes to his people
            as he thinks fit; and all things in nature are subservient to his
            mediatorial kingdom and glory. There is a fulness of grace in him,
            out of which saints receive, and grace for grace, or a large
            abundance of it; the fulness of the spirit of grace, and of all the
            graces and gifts of the Spirit is in him; and of all the blessings
            of grace, as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, adoption,
            sanctification, even of all that grace that is implanted in
            regeneration, that is necessary to carry on and finish the good work
            upon the soul; there is a fulness of all light and life, of wisdom,
            and strength, of peace, joy, and comfort, and of all the promises of
            grace, both with respect to this world and that which is to come;
            and there is also a fulness of glory in him, not only the grace, but
            the glory of the saints, is laid up and hid with him, and is safe
            and secure in him: this is said to dwell in Christ, which implies
            its being in him; it is not barely in intention, design, and
            purpose, but it is really and actually in him, nor is it in any
            other; and hence it comes to be communicated to the saints.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also denotes the continuance of it with him; it is an abiding
            fulness, and yields a continual daily supply to the saints, and will
            endure to the end of time, and be as sufficient for the last as the
            first believer; it is like the subject of it, the same yesterday,
            today, and for ever: and it also intends the safety of it: the
            saints' life both of grace and glory is hid with Christ, and is
            secure, it is out of the reach of men and devils, and can never be
            lost, or they deprived of it; and all this is owing not to any
            merits of men, to their faith and holiness, or good works, which are
            all the fruits of this fulness, but to the good will of God; "it
            pleased the Father" to place it here for them; it was owing to his
            good will to his Son, and therefore he puts all things into his
            hands; and to his elect in him, for, having loved them with an
            everlasting love, he takes everlasting care of them, and makes
            everlasting provision for them; it was his pleasure from all
            eternity to take such a step as this, well knowing it was not proper
            to put it into the hands of Adam, nor into the hands of angels, nor
            into their own at once; he saw none so fit for it as his Son, and
            therefore it pleased him to commit it unto him; and it is his good
            will and sovereign pleasure, that all grace should come through
            Christ, all communion with him here, and all enjoyment of him
            hereafter; which greatly enhances and sets forth the glory of Christ
            as Mediator, one considerable branch of which is, that he is full of
            grace and truth; this qualifies him to be the head of the church,
            and gives a reason, as these words be, why he has, and ought to
            have, the preeminence in all things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And through him to reconcile all things to himself by him</em>.
            This depends upon the preceding verse, and is to be connected with
            that phrase in it, it pleased the Father, Colossians 1:19; and the
            sense is, that it was the good will and pleasure of God from all
            eternity, as to lay up all fulness in Christ for his chosen people,
            so to reconcile them to himself by him; and which is another reason
            why Christ is, and ought to be considered as the head of the church,
            whose reconciliation he has procured, and why he ought to have the
            chief place in all things, and among all persons. Reconciliation
            supposes a former state of amity and friendship, and in such an one
            man was originally with God; and a breach of that friendship, which
            was made and issued in real enmity in the heart of man; and also a
            restoration to friendship again: and it is to be understood not of a
            reconciliation of God to men, which the Scriptures nowhere speak of,
            but of men to God; and is a reconciliation of them, not to the love
            of God, which his elect always shared in, but to the justice of God,
            offended by the transgression of a righteous law; and is indeed
            properly a reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for their
            sins, and so of their persons, and whereby all the perfections of
            God are reconciled to and agree with each other in the salvation of
            such sinners: now this takes its first rise from God the Father; it
            is owing to his sovereign good will and pleasure; he took the first
            step towards it; he knew what a state of enmity and rebellion his
            people would fall into; his thoughts ran upon their peace and
            reconciliation from everlasting;
          </p>
          <p>
            He called a council of peace about it, and in it drew the model of
            it; he entered into a covenant of peace with his Son, and, in
            consequence of it, sent him in the fulness of time to effect it,
            laying on him the chastisement of their peace; it was his pleasure
            that this affair of reconciliation should be brought about, not by
            the means of angels, in whom he could put no such trust and
            confidence, and who, though they rejoice at peace being made on
            earth, could never have effected it; nor that it should be done by
            men, who have no knowledge of the way of it, no inclination to it,
            nor power to make it; but "by him", his Son Jesus Christ, whom he
            appointed and called to this work, and sent to do it who is
            therefore, in prophecy, before this reconciliation was actually
            made, styled "Shiloh", the Prince of peace, and the peace: and this,
            when made, was made "to himself"; meaning either to Christ, in whom
            all the elect were gathered together, as in one head, and were
            reconciled in one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, through him; or
            rather to God the Father, to whom they were enemies, yea, enmity
            itself, and to whom the satisfaction and atonement were made; it
            being his law that was broken, and his justice that was injured, and
            to whom they are always in Scripture said to be reconciled; though
            not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, the one God with the
            Father: moreover, the sense of this phrase may be, that the
            reconciliation of the elect made by Christ, in a way of full
            satisfaction to law and justice, is to the glory of God, the glory
            of all his perfections; as of his grace and mercy, wisdom, power,
            and faithfulness, so of his righteousness and holiness: the means by
            which Christ has enacted it are, his sacrifice, sufferings, and
            death, expressed in the following clause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Whether things on the earth or things in the heavens</em>. By
            which are intended not the whole universe and fabric of the world,
            all creatures and things, animate and inanimate, rational and
            irrational, which have been cursed for the sin of man, and have
            proved unfriendly to him, but, in consequence of redemption and
            reconciliation by Christ, will, as some think, in the time of the
            restitution of all things, be restored to their former state, and to
            their friendly use to mankind; nor elect men and elect angels, and
            their reconciliation together, for the apostle is not speaking of
            the reconciling of these things together, but of the reconciling of
            them to God, which though it is true of elect men, is not of elect
            angels, who never fell, and though they have confirming grace, yet
            not reconciling grace from Christ, which they never needed; nor Jews
            and Gentiles, for though it is true that God was in Christ
            reconciling the world of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews to
            himself, and the chosen of God among both are actually reconciled to
            God by the death of Christ, yet the one are never called things in
            heaven, or the other things on earth, in distinction from, and
            opposition to each other; but rather all the elect of God are here
            meant, the family of God in heaven and in earth; all the saints that
            were then in heaven, when actual reconciliation was made by the
            blood of Christ, and who went thither upon the foot of peace,
            reconciliation, and redemption, to be made by his sacrifice and
            death; and all the chosen ones that were or should be on the face of
            the earth, until the end of time; all these were reconciled to God
            by Christ: and then the apostle proceeds particularly to mention the
            Colossians, as also being instances of this grace, good will, and
            pleasure of God by Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Having made peace through the blood of his cross</em>. This was
            what man could not do, what Christ was appointed and sent to do, and
            what he was every way qualified for as God and man; as man he had
            blood to shed, and could make reconciliation for sin in the nature
            which had sinned, and, as God, could draw nigh to his Father, and
            treat with him about terms of peace, and perform them; and so a fit
            daysman and Mediator between, God and man: this peace he has made by
            his "blood", that is, by the shedding of it, by his death as a
            sacrifice, which he underwent on the cross; partly to denote the
            shame, and chiefly to signify the curse he endured in the room of
            his people: all which shows the malignant nature of sin, the
            strictness of justice, and that peace is made in a way of full
            satisfaction, is upon honourable terms, will be lasting, as it is
            joyful, being attended with a train of blessings.

            <em>You, being in past times alienated</em>. The general blessing of
            grace and reconciliation, which belongs to the whole body of Christ,
            the church universal, all the elect of God, whether in heaven or in
            earth, is here particularly applied to the saints at Colosse, who
            were eminent instances of it; and that the free grace of God towards
            them in it might more illustriously appear, the apostle takes notice
            of what they were before the coming of Christ in the flesh, before
            the Gospel came among them, and while in a state of unregeneracy, as
            that they were "alienated": that is from God, not from his general
            presence, power, and providence, which reach to all his creatures,
            but from the life of God; see Ephesians 4:18; from living agreeably
            to the will of God, being estranged from him who is the fountain of
            moral and spiritual, as well as natural life; from the law, the rule
            of life, and from a principle of life in themselves; and altogether
            disapproving of such a life, as contrary to their carnal affections
            and lusts: and which alienation from God greatly lay in their
            forsaking him, the one only and true God, and following and serving
            strange gods, not attending to the dictates and light of nature; and
            being destitute of a divine revelation, they went further and
            further off from God, and from his people, worship, and ordinances;
            and were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to
            the covenants of promise; the source of all which was sin, and was
            owing to themselves: God did not alienate himself from them first;
            they alienated themselves from him; their sins separated between God
            and them, set them at a distance from him, and at enmity to him, and
            which very early appeared, for they were estranged from the womb.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And enemies in your mind in your evil deeds</em>. They were
            enemies to God, the true God, and were lovers and worshippers of
            idols; they were enemies to the being and perfections of God, as all
            men in a state of nature are; and more or less show it, by either
            denying there is a God, or wishing there was none, or fancying him
            to be such an one as themselves; or they dispute his sovereignty,
            deny his omniscience, arraign his justice and faithfulness, and
            despise the riches of his grace and goodness; they are enemies to
            his purposes, providences, and word; cannot bear that he should
            determine any thing concerning them or others; their eye is evil to
            him because he is good to others; they reply against him, they run
            upon him, and charge his decrees with unrighteousness and cruelty;
            murmur at and quarrel with the dispensations of his providence, as
            unequal and unjust; cast away the law of the Lord, will not be
            subject to it, and condemn the revelation of his will. They are
            enemies to Christ in one shape or another; either to his person,
            denying his proper deity, or real humanity; or to his offices, not
            hearkening to him as a prophet, trampling on his blood and sacrifice
            as a priest, and unwilling to have him to rule over them as a King;
            or to the way of salvation by him, of pardon by his blood, atonement
            by his sacrifice, justification by his righteousness, and acceptance
            with God through his person; or to his doctrines and ordinances,
            which are unsuitable to their vicious tastes, carnal affections, and
            appetites: they are enemies to the Spirit of Christ, by either
            denying his deity and personality, or by ridiculing the operations
            of his grace; or treating with contempt, and as foolish, everything
            of his, the Bible and all the truths contained in it, dictated by
            him.

            They are enemies to the people of God, exceeding mad against them,
            hate them and persecute them, reckon them the faith of the world,
            and the offscouring of all things, living in malice to them, and
            hateful and hating one another: and this enmity to everything divine
            and good is seated "in the mind"; the mind is not the object of this
            enmity, as some read the words, "to the mind": for the mind of a
            carnal man is enmity itself against God; but it is the subject of
            it, where it has its chief place, and from whence it proceeds, and
            shows itself in evil actions; and though the word "your" is not in
            the original text, it is rightly supplied; for the meaning is not
            that they were enemies "of his mind"; of the mind of the Lord, of
            his counsels and will, as some read and explain the words, though
            there is a truth in this, but in their own minds: so that not the
            body but the soul is the seat of this enmity; and not the inferior
            faculties of the soul only, the sensitive appetite and passions, but
            the understanding, the judgment and will, the more noble and
            rational powers of the soul; from hence spring all the malice and
            enmity expressed in word and actions: where then is man's free will
            to that which is good? and hence it is that the mind stands in need
            of being renewed, enlightened, cleansed and sanctified, and
            renovation begins here, which is the effect of almighty power; for
            nothing else can remove the rooted enmity in the heart of men; and
            which, as deep and as secret as it is, sooner or later, in one way
            or another, shows itself "by wicked works"; and that frequently, as
            by loving what God hates, and hating what he loves; by omitting what
            he commands, and committing what he forbids; by maintaining
            friendship with the world, and by harbouring his professed enemies,
            and persecuting his dear friends; and by their wicked words, and
            evil lives and conversations; and by the various works of the flesh,
            which are manifest, some being more directly against God, others by
            which they wrong themselves, and others by which they injure their
            neighbours.

            of the Father's reconciling them to himself by his Son; and so the
            words are a continuation of the account of the Father's grace, as to
            all the elect in general, so to the Colossians in particular,
            notwithstanding the black characters in which they stand described
            in their natural estate: or else of Christ's reconciling them to his
            Father, by the sacrifice of himself, which he voluntarily offered
            for them, though this was their case, and of enemies made them
            friends: and may be meant either of the impetration of
            reconciliation for them by his sufferings and death; or of the
            virtue and efficacy of it in the application of it; in the former
            sense the "now" refers to the coming of Christ into the world, and

            when peace and reconciliation were completely made at once for all
            God's elect; in the latter sense it refers to the time of the
            conversion of these Colossians, when Christ by his Spirit, in
            consequence of reconciliation made in the body of his flesh, through
            death reconciled them to God; to his mind and will, to the way of
            salvation by himself, to the saints the excellent in the earth, to

            death", as the Alexandrian copy and some others, and all the
            Oriental versions, read. These words express the means by which that
            reconciliation was made, which in the virtue and efficacy of it was
            applied particularly to these Colossians at their conversion whereby
            their minds were actually reconciled to God, as "in" or "by the body
            of his flesh"; that is, by the offering up of his body on the
            accursed tree, in which he bore the sins of his people, and made
            reconciliation for them: and it is so called either to distinguish
            it from his mystical and spiritual body the church, of which he is
            the head before spoken of; or from his glorious and immortal body,
            as now raised and exalted at God's right hand; and to denote the
            truth of his human body, that it was a real fleshly body, consisting
            of flesh and blood as ours does, and the same with ours, and not an
            aerial, celestial bony, or a mere phantom; and also to signify the
            infirmity and mortality of it, being, excepting sin, in all points
            like to ours, and subject to death; and that it was in that body his
            Father prepared for him, and he assumed; and as he was clothed with
            it in the days of his flesh, or mortal state, that he made
            reconciliation for the sins of his people, and that "through death"
            in it; even the death of the cross, by which he bore the penalty of
            the law, the curse of it, made satisfaction to justice, obtained
            life, abolished death, and destroyed him that had the power of it,
            and fixed a sure and lasting peace for all his saints.

            in them as clothed with his spotless righteousness, in which they
            are perfectly comely, all fair, and without spot: or in the latter

            to himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such
            thing; or in the ultimate glory, when all the saints shall be for
            ever with him, continually before him, and in his sight; which is
            what his heart was set upon from everlasting, which he had in view
            in his sufferings and death, and still has in his prayers and
            preparations: or else this presentation is what has been or will be
            made before his Father, and in his sight; and which was partly done,
            when he gathered together all the elect in himself, and represented
            them on the cross, in the body of his flesh; and partly is now doing
            in heaven, where he appears in the presence of God for them, bears
            their names on his breastplate, presents their persons and their
            cases; and especially will be done at the last day, when he will
            deliver up the kingdom to the Father, and say, lo, I and the
            children thou hast given me: and who will be presented "holy" by
            him; he being their sanctification, and they having all their sins
            expiated by his sacrifice, and their persons washed and cleansed in
            his blood, and their hearts sanctified by his Spirit; which
            sanctification though it is imperfect in this life, yet will be
            completed by the author of it at death.

          <p>
            Without perfect holiness no man shall see God, or be presented in
            his sight: and this is in consequence of the death of Christ and
            reconciliation by it and a fruit of electing grace, by which persons
            are chosen in Christ, that they should be holy and without blame;
            and as here, "unblamable and unreproveable": as they are, not now in
            themselves, but in Christ, as arrayed with his robe of righteousness
            and garments of salvation, being all glorious within, and their
            clothing of wrought gold, in which they will be introduced and
            presented to himself, and to his Father, faultless, with exceeding
            joy, and stand so before the throne, and that to all eternity.

            the profession of faith which they had made: not that the virtue and

            perseverance in faith and holiness, and is mentioned with this view,
            to put them upon a concern about it, and to make use of all means,
            under divine grace, to enjoy it; and nothing could more strongly

            hell cannot prevail; and so shall never finally and totally fall
            away, being rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith
            of him, in the doctrines of faith, respecting peace by his blood,
            justification by his righteousness, and life by his death; and so

          </p>

            <em>And not moved away from the hope of the Good News</em>. The hope
            of eternal life and happiness, which as set before us in the Gospel;
            which that gives a good and solid ground and foundation of, in the
            person, blood, and righteousness of Christ; and is the instrumental
            means, in the hand of the Spirit, of begetting to it, and of
            encouraging and increasing it: the law gives no hopes of eternal
            life to a poor sinner; it works wrath, and ministers death; there is
            nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment by it; but the Gospel
            encourages to hope in the Lord, from the consideration of rich mercy
            and plenteous redemption in him; and this hope of the Gospel is an
            anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and not to be let go; this
            confidence and rejoicing of the hope is to be kept firm unto the
            end.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Which you heard</em>. That is, which Gospel they had heard from
            Epaphras their faithful minister, and that not only externally, but
            internally; they had heard it and believed it, and it had brought
            forth fruit in them; for it came to them not in word only, but in
            power; which is said in commendation of it, and to engage them to
            continue in it, and abide by it; as is also what follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven</em>. And
            therefore since it was the same which was everywhere preached, they
            might depend upon the truth of it, should have the greater value for
            it, and by no means relinquish it. This must be understood not of
            every individual creature, even human and rational, that was then,
            or had been in, the world; but that it had been, and was preached
            far and near, in all places all over the world, to the Gentiles as
            well as to the Jews; who are sometimes styled "every creature", "the
            creature", "the whole creation", "all men", c. see Mark 16:15 Titus
            2:11 and of this, the first preaching of the Gospel by Peter after
            our Lord's resurrection, was an emblem and pledge, Acts 2:14; and
            some time after that, the sound of all the apostles went into all
            the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Of which I, Paul, was made a servant</em>. By Jesus Christ, who
            appeared unto him, and called, qualified, and sent him forth as
            such; and this is mentioned to encourage the Colossians to abide by
            the truths of the Gospel, since what they had heard and received
            were what were everywhere preached by the faithful ministers of the
            word; and particularly by the apostle, who was ordained to be a
            teacher and preacher of it to the Gentiles. The Alexandrian copy
            reads, "a preacher and an apostle, and a minister"; see 1 Timothy
            2:7.

            withhold it from him. Do you ask, Of whom we speak thus? I answer,
            of the Lord Jesus Christ; of whom the Apostles evidently thought
            that they could never speak enough. Let the Apostle Paul but touch
            upon his name, and he launches forth in his praise, and scarcely
            knows when to stop.

            Mark the passage before us. The Apostle had informed the Colossians
            what prayers and thanksgivings he daily poured forth before God, on
            their behalf. He especially praised God for "delivering them from
            the power of darkness, and translating them into the kingdom of his
            dear Son," and having thus, accidentally as it were, mentioned the
            Lord Jesus, he goes on to expatiate on his transcendent
            excellencies, not only as the Redeemer of his people, but as "the
            image of the invisible God, and the first-born (that is, the Heir
            and Lord) of the whole creation."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And lest it would be thought that he was speaking too highly of the
            despised and persecuted Jesus, he proceeds yet further to establish
            his claim to these high titles, by declaring what he had done for
            the world at large, and for the Church in particular; and that the
            preeminence thus given him was no more than his due.

            had existed four thousand years—was the Creator of all, the

            naked eye, is as much noticed and supplied by him, as if it were the
            only work of his hands. For himself too, as the supreme God, he made

            creature,) still it would be impossible for God to devolve on Jesus
            the honor of being the end of all things: that is incapable of being
            communicated to any creature: it is the prerogative of God alone:
            nor could he divest himself of it, without giving a license to his
            creatures to alienate from him the most essential rights of Godhead.

            such claims. In respect of these things, he is on a level with the
            basest clod of earth; and must unite with all the rest of the

            professedly treats of his work and offices, but oftentimes when he
            only incidentally, as it were, makes mention of his name. We notice
            this particularly in the passage before us, where he puts forth all
            the powers of language to exalt his character to the uttermost.

          <p align="justify">
            Self-righteousness is a practical denial of the assertion in our
            text. It refuses to Christ the honor put upon him by the Father, and
            ascribes to <i>self </i>that which belongs to him alone. And shall
            it be thought a small evil to rob Christ of his glory? Shall it
            appear a light matter to rebel against the eternal counsels of the
            Father, and to set ourselves in direct opposition to his blessed
            will? Let none henceforth suppose, that the trusting in our own
            wisdom, righteousness, or strength, is a trivial offense: for surely
            God will be jealous for his own honor, and the honor of his dear
            Son; and will look with scorn on every proud Pharisee, while he will
            receive with boundless compassion the vilest of repenting harlots.

          <p align="justify">
            Vital godliness, especially under the Christian dispensation,
            consists in a conformity of mind to the revealed will of our
            heavenly Father. Now in no respect is that will more sacred than in
            reference to the glory designed for Christ; nor is there anything
            wherein a conformity to it is more characteristic of true and
            eminent piety.

          <p align="justify">
            In one word then, the true Christian is well pleased that all
            fullness would dwell in Christ: if he might have some fullness in
            himself, he would rather have it in Christ, that he might receive
            all from him. Every part of salvation is the more endeared to him,
            on account of its coming through that channel: and it is his supreme
            felicity in this world, as it will be also in the world to come, to
            owe everything to that adorable Savior, and to glorify him in all,
            and for all.

            This very strongly appears in the passage now before us. Having in
            the beginning of this chapter thanked God for bringing the
            Colossians to the knowledge of his Gospel, and informed them what
            were the peculiar blessings which in his daily prayers he sought for
            in their behalf, and what thanksgivings he constantly offered up,
            especially for that which they had experienced in being "translated
            from the power of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son," he
            launches forth into the praises of the Lord Jesus Christ for all
            that he had done in the creation, preservation, and redemption of
            the world, and particularly for his redeeming love, as manifested
            to, and exercised upon, the Colossian converts. But, as they were
            converts from the Gentile world, we may fitly consider his address
            to them as delivered also to us; and may take occasion from it to
            show,

          <p align="justify">
            "We were <u>alienated</u> from God." This is no less true of us than
            of the idolatrous Gentiles: for though by <i>calling </i> ourselves
            Christians we have professed a regard for God and his Christ, we
            have not really sought our happiness in God: we have not even
            desired his favor, or used any means to obtain it. We have been
            contented to live at a distance from him, to put the very
            remembrance of him far from us, and to seek our happiness in things
            which had no proper tendency to endear either him to us, or us to
            him. However observant we may have been of outward forms, we have
            had no pleasure in communion with him. The exercises of prayer and
            praise have rather been an irksome task, than occupations in which
            we found our chief delight. And if at any time we have had
            opportunities of becoming better acquainted with God and with his
            holy will, we have not been forward to avail ourselves of them: and
            if instruction on the subject of his Gospel has been offered to us,
            we have rather turned away from it, as distasteful to us, than
            listened to it as pleasing to our souls. The very light which would
            have revealed him to us, has been offensive to us; and we have
            turned our eyes from it, as bringing to our view an object whose
            presence was to us a source of pain.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor is this all. We were "<u>enemies</u> to him;" yes, "enemies to
            him in our mind:" we have had a decided aversion to his law: instead
            of contemplating it as "holy, just, and good," we have viewed it as
            imposing a yoke that could not be endured. And this hatred to it has
            been proved by our actual rebellion against it: our "wicked works"
            have shown clearly enough that the service of sin was more congenial
            with our minds than the service of our God. As for all the sublime
            duties which God's law inculcates, we have lived in a willful
            neglect of them: and of innumerable evils which it forbids, we have
            lived in the daily and habitual commission. Such had been the state
            of the Colossians in their time of unregeneracy; and such is the
            state of every child of man, until he is renewed by God in the
            spirit of his mind.

            "He has reconciled us to God in the body of his flesh through
            death." Yes, the Son of God himself has left the bosom of his
            Father, and assumed our flesh, that in the very nature which had
            sinned he might bear the penalty that was due to sin, and expiate
            our guilt by his own blood. The sacrifices under the law were
            substituted in the place of the offender, and they surrendered up
            <i>their </i>life as an atonement for <i> his </i>sins: and through
            the death of the victim in his stead, the sinner was reconciled unto
            his God.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Just so, the Lord Jesus Christ has offered himself a sacrifice for
            the sins of the world; and effected reconciliation for all who
            believe in him. No longer does God look with anger upon his enemies,
            when with penitential sorrow they implore mercy for Christ's sake.
            Not one of their trespasses will he ever impute to them: their
            iniquities, however great or numerous they may have been, are
            "blotted out by him as a morning cloud," and "cast behind his back
            into the very depths of the sea." This we are authorized to declare:
            for "God has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation," and
            commanded us to proclaim to the whole universe, that "God was in
            Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their

            constitute the felicity of the heavenly hosts. To restore man

            for us to redeem us" not from punishment merely, but "from all
            iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of
            good works!

            In another passage the Apostle comes more immediately to the point,
            and says, "Christ has loved his Church, and given himself for it,
            that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
            the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not
            having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it would be holy
            and without blemish,

            to our justification before God, but to the
            <i>sanctification </i> of our souls; to which Christ has had a view
            in all that he has done and suffered for us.

            Those who are addicted to system would alter the translation here,
            and read it, not, "if you continue," but "since you continue." But
            this is only one instance of many, wherein
            <i
              >the advocates for human systems betray their determination to
              make everything bend to their views</i

            unhallowed partiality. They would in no case wrest the Scriptures to
            make them favor a party in the Church. They maintained a child-like
            simplicity; and with scrupulous fidelity labored to transmit to us
            the Scriptures in a perfect agreement with the inspired original.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Of the propriety of the translation in this place I have no doubt:
            it is the very language of the Scriptures, in a thousand other
            places as well as this; and it speaks to us a most important truth,
            namely, that we never can be presented blameless before God at last,
            unless we continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not
            moved away from the hope of the Gospel.

          <p align="justify">
            It would have been to no purpose that Christ had died to reconcile
            us to God, if we had not on our part believed in him as our Mediator
            and Redeemer. The unbelieving world who die in their sins, are
            rather plunged the deeper into perdition, than delivered from it, by
            the intervention of Christ. Their rejection of him has aggravated
            their guilt exceedingly: and the word preached to them in his name,
            will be "a savor of death unto all, to whom it is not a savor of
            life." The receiving of him into our hearts by faith, put us into
            possession of all the blessings which he had purchased for us.

          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            It is a fact that many do make shipwreck of the faith. The
            Scriptures abound with instances of it: and we also shall feel many
            temptations, both from without and from within, to follow their sad
            example. Like the stony-ground hearers, we may through the influence
            of persecution "fall away:" or, as in the case of the thorny-ground
            hearers, the good seed in us may be so choked by the cares and
            pleasures of this life, as to "bring forth no fruit to perfection."
            And from whatever source the defection arises, "if we turn back, we
            turn back unto perdition," and "God's soul shall have no pleasure in
            us." Would we then be "presented faultless before the presence of
            God's glory with exceeding joy? Jude verse 24." We must hold fast
            the profession of our faith without wavering:" we must be more and
            more "grounded" in the faith by a constant exercise of it on every
            occasion: we must be so firmly "settled" in it, that a man may as
            well attempt to pluck the sun from the firmament, as to shake either
            our faith or hope. This is the way to "endure unto the end;" and it
            is in this way only that we can fulfill that beneficial injunction,
            "Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have
            wrought, but that you receive a full reward, 2 John verse 8."

            conception. Do not, I entreat you, let the efforts made for your
            salvation be in vain. Let not "Christ have died in vain;" and
            "receive not the grace of God in vain:" but "today, while it is
            called today, harden not your hearts, lest you provoke God to swear
            in his wrath that you shall never enter into his rest!"

            How can you ever adore him as you ought to do? Can you reflect on
            the means he has used for your redemption. Can you reflect on his
            laying your iniquities on the person of his only dear Son, and not
            bless him? The wonder is, how you can find a moment for any other
            employment; and that you are not, like the lame man whom Peter and
            John healed, leaping, and dancing, and praising God every day and
            all the day long!

          <p align="justify">
            But, if this were the frame of your mind, I would still point you to
            a more excellent way of glorifying your heavenly Benefactor. You
            have seen that the Lord Jesus, in dying for you, sought "to present
            you to God holy, and unblamably and unreprovable in his sight:"
            <i
              >let his object then in redeeming you be the one object at which
              you shall aim through the remainder of your lives</i
            >. And remember, that it is not sufficient that you are unblamably
            and unreprovable before men; you must be so "in the sight of God"
            also, even of that "God who searches the heart, and tries the
            thoughts."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let your secret walk with God be such as he will approve. Let your
            every temper, and disposition, and habit, mark the friendship that
            exists between God and you. And let every day be so spent, as if at
            the close of it you expected your soul to be required of you, and to
            be presented by your Savior to your reconciled God.
