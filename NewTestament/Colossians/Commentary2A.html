            Ver 3.
            <em
              >We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
              praying always for you,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>We give thanks to God</em>. Meaning himself and Timothy. This is
            the beginning of the epistle, which is introduced with a
            thanksgiving to God; to whom praise and thankfulness are always due
            as a Creator and preserver, as the author of all good things, as the
            Father of mercies, temporal and spiritual, and as the covenant God
            and Father of his people through Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>. The sense of which
            either is, that God the Father, who is the object of praise and
            thanksgiving, is both the God of Christ, and the Father of Christ,
            the God of Christ, as Christ is man, and the Father of Christ, as
            Christ is God; or the latter is exegetical of the former, and may be
            rendered thus, "God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ": and
            very properly are thanks given to him under this character, because
            it is as he is the Father of Christ that he blesses his people with
            all spiritual blessings; and because he is their God, as well as his
            God; and their Father, as well as his Father, though in a different
            sense, his by nature, theirs by adoption. Moreover, as all their
            blessings come from God, as the Father of Christ, and through
            Christ, and for his sake, so it is very proper that thanks should be
            returned unto him under that character; and through Christ, by whom
            alone such sacrifices of praise are acceptable to God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Praying always for you</em>. Which, as it is expressive of the
            constant discharge of the duty of prayer, and the continual
            remembrance of these saints in it, and shows the affection the
            apostle had for them; so it points out the time when, and the way
            and manner in which Paul and Timothy gave thanks to God on account
            of them; it was when they were at the throne of grace, and in their
            frequent prayers to God; thankfulness for mercies received, both by
            ourselves and others, being a branch of the duty of prayer.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 4.
            <em
              >having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which
              you have toward all the saints,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus</em>. This expresses
            the matter of their thankfulness, or what it was they gave thanks to
            God for, their faith in Christ; by which is not only meant their
            hearty assent to the whole doctrine of faith, concerning the person,
            offices, and grace of Christ, their soundness and steadfastness in
            it, and their sincere and constant profession of it; but the grace
            of faith in them, the operation of the Spirit of God in their souls,
            which had not Moses, nor any mere man, but Christ for its object; by
            which they looked unto him as a Saviour, went unto him as such,
            ventured on him, committed themselves unto him, leaned and relied
            upon him; that grace which comes from him, has him for its author
            and finisher, and returns unto him, and lives on him.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Paul and Timothy had heard of by their minister Epaphras; and
            it shows that they made no secret of it, did not keep it to
            themselves, but declared, confessed, and published it to others, as
            is the duty of all believers to do; and thanks being given for it to
            God, makes it a clear point that it was not of themselves, but was
            the gift of God, otherwise there would have been no need of
            thankfulness for it; as also, that it is a very eminent grace, and
            of great use and service to such who are possessed of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And of the love which you have toward all the saints</em>. This
            is another thing for which thanks are given to God. The object of
            this grace are "saints"; all men indeed are to be loved, and even
            our very enemies; and good is to be done to all, but especially to
            holy and good men, to the household of faith; and these are "all" to
            be loved and respected; nor is any respect or difference of persons
            to be made on account of country, or natural relation, as Jews or
            Gentiles, or of outward state and condition, as rich or poor, bond
            or free, or of greater or lesser gifts and grace, weak or strong
            believers, or of different sentiments in the lesser matters of
            religion. It denotes both the grace of love itself, which is a fruit
            of the Spirit implanted in regeneration, and is an evidence of the
            new birth, and always is where true faith in Christ is, for faith
            works by it; and also the effects of it, which lies not in bare
            words, in expressions of spiritual affection and friendship, but in
            deeds, by serving one another in love, by relieving in necessity,
            sympathizing in distress, praying with and for one another, and the
            like; all which these saints were famous for.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 5.
            <em
              >because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of
              which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good
              News</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens</em
            >. These words may be considered either in connection with the
            foregoing, and express the reason or motive which encouraged these
            saints to believe in Christ, and to go on believing in him, and hold
            fast the profession of their faith in him, and to love the saints,
            and show it upon all occasions, and in every case; because of the
            rich treasure of glory and happiness in reserve for them in heaven,
            which they were hoping and waiting for; this encouraged their faith
            in Christ, and enlarged their love and beneficence to the saints: or
            else with the thanksgiving of the apostle, and so contains fresh
            matter of it, that as thanks were given for faith and love, so for
            "hope"; by which is meant, not the grace of hope, for that is not in
            heaven, though it enters within the vail, and is conversant with
            heavenly things, but is in the heart; and though it supposes it, and
            which these persons had; they were not without it; they had a good
            hope through grace of eternal glory, for faith, hope, and love,
            always go together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor Christ the foundation of hope; there are many things in him,
            which are a ground of hope of happiness, as his sufferings, and
            death, and redemption thereby; his resurrection from the dead, his
            intercessions and preparations; the promise of life in him, and the
            thing itself being in his gift; his righteousness and grace, which,
            give a title to it, and meetness for it; and he is also in heaven,
            but then he cannot be said to be laid up there: but the thing hoped
            for, everlasting happiness, is intended; see Titus 2:13 Galatians
            5:5; which is so called, because it is the object of hope; is not
            yet possessed; is future; is not seen; is difficult, and yet
            possible to be enjoyed: this is said to be "laid up"; which denotes
            the preciousness and valuableness of it, it is a treasure, an
            inheritance, a kingdom, and riches of glory; and the secrecy and
            hiddenness of it, it consists of things invisible to the bodily eye,
            and which are out of the reach of carnal sense and reason, of which
            faith only has some small glimpse; and also the safety of it, it is
            hid in Christ, it is reserved "in heaven", and cannot be come at,
            and spoiled by men or devils; and likewise the free grace and
            goodness of God in laying up and providing things of such a nature
            for his children and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            The place where it is, in heaven, where moth and rust corrupt not,
            and thieves cannot break through and steal; and so is safe, and must
            be of an heavenly nature, as it is for heavenly persons: "for you";
            the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, for those who were
            chosen in Christ, for whom it was prepared from the foundation of
            the world; for this is not laid up for any, for everyone, but for
            the chosen of God, and precious; whom God has distinguished by his
            grace, Christ has redeemed by his blood, and the Spirit regenerates
            and sanctifies, and who have faith, hope, and love, given unto them;
            and this was not only laid up for them, but they knew of it, they
            were made acquainted with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Of which you heard before</em>. Before the writing of this
            epistle, under the ministry of their faithful teacher Epaphras.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Of the truth of the Good News</em>. Or in the true word of the
            Gospel; which comes from the God of truth, is indited by the Spirit
            of truth, is concerning Christ the truth, and which contains nothing
            but truth, and lies in the Scriptures of truth: or "in the word of
            truth", even the Gospel; which explains what word of truth is meant.
            The law is the word of truth; and many of the words of men, of the
            philosophers, were words of truth; but it was not in either of them
            they had heard of eternal life laid up in heaven; of which there
            were hopes to be entertained by sinful creatures, enjoying it
            through Christ: this is what only the Gospel brings an account of;
            life and immortality are only brought to light by the Gospel; which
            not only speaks of it, but lays that before men, which give them
            ground and encouragement to hope for it.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 6.
            <em
              >which has come to you, even as it is in all the world and is
              bearing fruit and growing, as it does in you also, since the day
              you heard and knew the grace of God in truth,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Which has come to you</em>. That is, the Gospel, which came to
            them from God, from heaven, from Christ, out of Jerusalem, from
            whence the word of the Lord was to come, by the ministers of the
            Gospel, who being sent, came to Colosse, and there preached it; and
            so the Syriac version renders the words הי דאתכרזת, "which is
            preached unto you". And a wonderful instance of the free grace of
            God this was; they did not seek, inquire for, and go after the
            Gospel, but it came to them; and so Christ was found of them by it,
            who sought him not, and made manifest in his person, grace, and
            righteousness to them that asked not after him: for this Gospel came
            not to them in, word only, but with the power of the Holy Spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was come, εις υμας, "into you", as the phrase may be rendered,
            into their very hearts, and wrought effectually there, enlightening,
            convincing, comforting, and instructing them; where it had a place,
            and remained; for the words may be read, as they are by the Arabic
            version, "which is present with you". The Gospel is always in one
            place or another, and will be to the end of the world; but it is not
            always in the same place; but as yet it was not removed from
            Colosse; it was still with them in the external ministry of it, and
            it remained in their hearts in the powerful and comfortable
            experience of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Even as it is in all the world</em>. As it was come into, and
            preached to all the world, and was made useful, and continued in all
            the world at that time. Christ gave his disciples a commission to go
            into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; it was
            no more to be restrained to a particular nation, but was made
            general and common to all the nations of the world, and accordingly
            they preached it to all; and by this time had delivered the joyful
            message to the greater part of the world, which is sometimes meant
            by all the world, and the whole world; or it had been now preached
            in all the known and habitable parts of the world by one apostle and
            another, some being sent into one part, and some into another; so
            that the grace of God appeared to all men, and the doctrine of it
            had been preached to every creature under the heaven, according to
            Christ's commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Gospel of the kingdom was to be preached in all the world, for a
            witness to all nations, before the end of the Jewish state came, or
            before the destruction of Jerusalem, which was not many years after
            the writing of this epistle. Now this shows, that it was the same
            Gospel which had been preached at Colosse by their faithful minister
            there, as had been preached in other areas, and in all parts of the
            world by the apostles; which is said in the commendation of the
            Gospel, it being one, uniform, consistent, and all of a piece in
            every place, and as preached by every faithful minister, and might
            serve greatly to confirm the Colossians in their faith of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And is bearing fruit and growing</em>. By which is meant, either
            the conversion of sinners, the fruit of the Gospel ministry, when
            attended with a divine blessing and power; or the graces of the
            Spirit, as faith, hope, love, repentance, humility, self-denial, c.
            with all the effects thereof, in new obedience, and a godly
            conversation, which come from Christ, the green fir tree, and are
            produced by the Spirit, through the preaching of the Gospel. The
            Vulgate Latin adds, "and increaseth" the Syriac version has the
            same; and it is so read in some Greek copies, as in the Alexandrian
            copy, two of Stephens's, and in the Complutensian edition; and may
            intend the spread of the Gospel among others, besides those who
            first received it, and the growing fruitfulness of the professors of
            it under its influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>As it does in you also, since the day you heard</em>. As soon as
            ever it came among them they hearkened to it, they were inclined to
            hear it externally, and a divine power going along with it, giving
            them hearing ears, and understanding hearts, they heard it, so as to
            know it, love it, and believe it; and from that time it brought
            forth fruit, and increased in them, and they continued in the faith
            and profession of it; so that as the Gospel is commended both from
            the large spread and efficacy of it, as well as its uniformity in
            every place, these Colossians also are commended for their hearing
            of it, both externally and internally, and for their perseverance in
            it: and which is further illustrated in the following clause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And knew the grace of God in truth</em>. By "the grace of God"
            may be meant the love and favour of God, in the mission and gift of
            his Son, to be the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners, displayed
            in the Gospel, of which they had a comfortable experience, it being
            shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit; or the blessings of grace
            revealed in the Gospel, as free justification by the righteousness
            of Christ, full pardon of sin, according to the riches of grace, and
            adoption of children, arising out of the love and free favour of
            God, of which they had had a real application made to them through
            the Gospel, by the Spirit of God; or rather the doctrine of grace
            itself, so called because it is a declaration of the free grace of
            God in the salvation of sinners and the means of implanting grace in
            the heart.
          </p>

            This they knew not merely in a notional and speculative manner, but
            experimentally; for the Gospel was not only come to them, but into
            them; they had a spiritual knowledge of it, and affection for it;
            they felt the power of it in their hearts, and tasted and relished
            the sweetness of it; and owned and "acknowledged" it, as the word
            here used may be rendered; for as with the heart they believed it so
            with the mouth they made public profession of it: and this they did
            "in truth"; they came by the knowledge of the love of God, and the
            blessings of grace, and the doctrines of it, by the Gospel, the word
            of truth; in and through that they became acquainted with these
            things; and having known and embraced the doctrine of the Gospel of
            the grace of God, in the truth of it, without any mixture of error,
            as it had been purely, and without adulteration, truly and
            faithfully preached by their minister, they professed it truly
            heartily, and sincerely, and without hypocrisy; which is another
            part of their commendation, and involves in it the praise of their
            minister also, which is enlarged upon in the following verses.

            <em>Our beloved fellow servant</em>. A "servant" of Christ he was,
            and a "fellow" servant of the apostles, jointly engaged with them in
            preaching the Gospel; which character, as it greatly commends
            Epaphras, and shows him to be a very considerable preacher of the
            word, so it expresses the great humility and condescension of the
            apostle, in putting him upon a level with himself, though he was not
            in that high office of the apostleship he was. And "dear" this
            precious servant of Christ was to him, and his fellow ministers, on
            account of the grace and gifts bestowed on him, because of his
            usefulness in the ministry, and his faithfulness and integrity in
            the discharge of it; and whose company and conversation in the
            prison greatly endeared him to them, for he was a fellow prisoner,
            as well as a fellow servant, Philemon 1:23.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf</em>. One
            whom Christ had made a "minister" and not man, who was qualified,
            and sent forth, and made successful by him in his service; and who
            preached none but Christ, and him crucified, in the business of
            salvation: and he was a "faithful" one; one that sought not his own
            glory, but the glory of him that sent him; nor to please men, but
            his master; who concealed no part of his message, but freely and
            fully declared the whole; he was faithful to Christ, who put him
            into the ministry, and to the souls of men, to whom he ministered:
            and therefore it is said, he was such an one "for you"; for them,
            not for himself; for their spiritual good and advantage; he sought
            not theirs, but them; he had a great zeal for them, dearly loved
            them, and spent his time and strength, and made use of his gifts and
            talents while among them, for their use and benefit.

          <p>
            Not only their love to God, and Christ, and to all the saints, which
            is before mentioned, but their love to the apostle; though they had
            only heard of him, and of his great capacity for, and faithfulness
            and usefulness in preaching of the Gospel, which had greatly
            endeared him to them. This, he says, was in the Spirit; it was
            spiritual love, to distinguish it from a carnal and worldly one;
            they loved him for the spiritual grace that was in him, the
            spiritual gifts bestowed on him, the spiritual service he was
            engaged in, and the spiritual usefulness he was of: or they loved
            him in, and with their spirits, with all their hearts, sincerely,
            and without dissimulation; and though they had never seen him in the
            flesh, yet being, as it were, present with him in spirit, their
            affections were knit unto him: or this their love was "in the Holy
            Spirit", as the Ethiopic version reads it; it was a fruit of the
            Spirit of God, which he had implanted in their hearts in
            regeneration, as is also love to God, and likewise to Christ.

            and of the love you have for all the saints—the faith and love that
            spring from the hope that is stored up for you in Heaven and that
            you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel that
            has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and

            "God's grace in all its truth!" What a beautiful description of the
            Gospel! It is grace: it is all grace, from first to last: it is the
            most stupendous grace that ever God given to any creature, whether
            in Heaven or on earth. It was marvelous grace to confer on
            <i>angels </i> such an exalted nature as they possess, together with
            all the glory and felicity of Heaven. It was most astonishing grace
            also to form <i>man </i>in Paradise; to form him in the very image
            of his God; and to give him a promise, that if he would hold fast
            his integrity, both he and all his posterity would participate with
            the angels in all the blessedness they enjoy.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But what is all this to the gift of God's only dear Son to bear the
            iniquities of fallen man, and, by his own obedience unto death, to
            restore man to his forfeited inheritance? This is emphatically
            called, "The Gospel of the grace of God:" and truly it does exhibit
            the grace of God in such a view as no creature could ever have
            anticipated; and in such a view as must fill the whole creation,
            whether of men or angels, with the profoundest admiration, and
            gratitude, and love. This is the Gospel which you "have heard;"

            </b></font
          >
          <p align="justify">
            There are three effects mentioned, as produced in the converts of
            Colosse:
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">1. "Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ"—</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            This is the first effect which the Gospel produces, wherever it is
            received into the heart. It reveals to us our need of a Savior; and
            it holds forth the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, sent
            into the world to bear our sins, and to expiate our guilt by his
            atoning sacrifice, and thereby to reconcile us to our offended God.
            It reveals to us the fullness and suitableness of this salvation;
            and brings us to this Savior, as our only hope. It leads every one
            to renounce altogether every other hope, and to trust entirely in
            the merits and mediation of this adorable Redeemer.
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">2. Love to all the saints—</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            This is the next effect produced on all. Through faith in the Lord
            Jesus Christ, we are brought into a new family, of which Christ is
            the master: yes, we are incorporated into a new body, of which
            Christ is the head, and all the saints are members. I add further,
            we are all penetrated with one spirit; (for "he who is joined to the
            Lord is one spirit;") and have thus a bond of union, which never
            did, nor could, exist before. The very instant we believe in Christ,
            we feel ourselves brought into this relation to all his believing
            people, whether they be separately known to us or not; and we have,
            from that moment, somewhat of the same sympathy with them, as every
            member of our body has with all the rest, the eye with the hand, and
            the hand with the foot.

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            "The hope laid up for us in Heaven" is that for which the Apostle
            principally gives thanks in the passage before us. The faith and
            love are parenthetically inserted. But this hope, like the two
            foregoing principles, is wrought in the heart by the Gospel: by
            which, as Peter says, "we are begotten again to a living hope of an
            inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fades not away,
            reserved in Heaven for us,

            and kingdoms purchased by the blood of Christ, and promised to all
            who believe in him. An eternity of glory upon the very throne of
            God, the believer expects as his assured portion.

            πατρί on no great authority, and the Received Text inserts καί
            without conclusive evidence. Other MSS. read as if by correction
            εὐχαριστῶ in the singular, and περί, found in A, C, D3, E2, J, K,
            appears to have higher warrant than ὑπέρ, which is preferred by
            Lachmann and Griesbach. The distinctive meaning of ὑπέρ and περί in
            such a connection may be seen under Eph 6:19. We cannot agree with
            Bähr, Steiger, Baumgarten-Crusius, and Conybeare, who imagine that
            Paul simply means himself in the plural εὐχαριστοῦμεν. That he may
            occasionally use this style we do not deny. The apostle in the First
            Epistle to the Corinthians joins Sosthenes with himself in the
            salutation, but formally excludes him from any share in the
            communication, for he immediately subjoins the singular εὐχαριστῶ.
            The same avowed distinction is made with regard to Timothy himself
            in the Epistle to the Php 1:1-3. May we not infer, that if Paul had
            wished to exclude Timothy here, he would have done so by a similar
            use of the singular; and as he does afterwards employ the singular
            in sharp contrast, may not the plural here have been chosen to
            represent the share which Timothy had in those good reports, and the
            consequent prayers? There is no sentiment in the verses in which the
            plural is used, peculiar to inspiration. And we are the more
            confirmed in this view, because Paul formally disconnects himself
            from Timothy in Col 1:23, and by the emphatic words, ἐγὼ Παῦλος; and
            again a similar distinction occurs in Col 1:29, and in Col 4:3. The
            phraseology of these three verses implies, that when he says “we,”
            he means himself and Timothy, but that in cases where he states
            something special to himself, and not common to him and his
            colleague, he says “I,” to prevent mistake. If the plural simply
            represented himself, he did not need to change the idiom.
            [Εὐχαριστοῦμεν, Eph 1:16.] Under Eph 1:3 we have shown that the
            genitive κυρίου ᾿Ι. is governed as well by θεός as by πατήρ. And if
            we read τῷ θεῷ καὶ πατρί, as in the Textus Receptus, the same
            construction would be vindicated here. But as the reading is either
            τῷ θεῷ τῷ πατρί, or rather τῷ θεῷ πατρί, it would seem that πατρί
            alone governs the following genitive. We thank God, the Father of
            our Lord Jesus Christ. [Πατρὶ τοῦ κ. Eph 1:3.] Beza well says, neque
            vero aliter a nobis considerari potest Deus in salutem nisi quatenus
            est Pater Christi. It is God, in the character of the Father of
            Christ, that we thank, for He is in this relation our Father-God.
            The grateful heart pours itself forth in praises. Paul and Timothy,
            on hearing of the spiritual progress of the Colossians, did not
            congratulate one another, but both gave the glory to God. So much
            had Timothy of Paul&#x27;s own spirit, that the apostle had no
            hesitation in saying, “We thank God.”

            It is a matter of dispute whether πάντοτε should be joined to
            εὐχαριστοῦμεν, or to προσευχόμενοι. Chrysostom, Theophylact,
            Grotius, Piscator, Beza, Luther, Calvin, Bengel, Suicer, Grotius,
            Böhmer, and Olshausen, hold the second view, and render with the
            English version, “praying always for you.” But if we follow the
            analogy of 1 Cor 1:4, 1 Thes 1:2, 2 Thes 1:3, Phm 1:4, Eph 1:16, we
            shall join πάντοτε to the first verb. So think Bähr, Pierce, Meyer,
            De Wette, and Baumgarten-Crusius. The Syriac version follows the
            same exegesis-for it reads, “We give thanks for you always, and pray
            for you;” and Cranmer&#x27;s Bible of 1539—“We give thanks to God
            alwayes for you in oure prayers.” Besides, the declaration is, that
            the intelligence which he had received filled his heart with
            gratitude, and impelled him to give thanks. The Colossians did not
            need to be told that he prayed for them, but it was some comfort to
            be assured by him, that when he did pray for them such was his
            opinion of them, based on reports which he had received about them,
            that he gave thanks to God for them. He would have prayed for them,
            whatever their spiritual state, and the worse it was, the more
            importunate would have been his supplications, but he would not have
            given thanks for them unless he had been persuaded of their
            spiritual purity and progress. Therefore he adduces these reports as
            the grounds of his thanksgivings; and the spirit of his language
            is—“Whenever we pray about you, we always give thanks for you.” So
            cheering was the intelligence communicated by Epaphras, that
            thanksgiving was uniformly mingled with his prayers for them, and
            the special contents of those prayers are mentioned for the first
            time in Col 1:9. This exegesis is far more natural than that of
            Olshausen, who says that the thanksgiving is offered at the moment,
            but the intercession is su pposed to be going on, and to be based on
            the tidings which he had received. Now, those tidings did not create
            the prayer, but being so good, they naturally induced the
            thanksgiving. “We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord
            Jesus Christ, as often as we pray for you, because we have heard of
            your faith in Christ Jesus, and love to all the saints.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Περὶ ὑμῶν προσευχόμενοι - “praying for you.” The apostle prayed for
            them-such was his interest in them, and sympathy with them, that he
            bore their names on his heart at the throne of grace. Nor could such
            an “effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man” be without its rich
            results. The suppliant in his far-off prison was like the prophet on
            Carmel, and as he prayed, the “little cloud” might be descried,
            which, as it gradually filled and darkened the horizon, brought with
            it the “sound of abundance of rain.”

            ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχετε εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους. The words ἣν ἔχετε are
            introduced into the text on the concurrent authority of A, C, D, E1,
            F, G, the Vulgate, and other versions, with many of the Fathers. The
            apostle now expresses the reason why he gave thanks, the participle
            having a causal sense, Kühner, § 667; Stuart, § 169. Similar
            phraseology occurs in Eph 1:15. The article is omitted before the
            proper names Χ. ᾿Ι. Winer, § 19, 2. In Ephesians, the apostle adds
            κύριος, and prefixes the article to the official epithet; but here
            the simple name Χ. ᾿Ι. from common usage, occurs without it. Gal
            3:26. A different form of construction, inserting the article before
            the preposition-πίστει τῇ ἐν Χ. ᾿Ι.-occurs 1 Tim 3:13, and similarly
            2 Tim 1:13. That faith reposed in Christ Jesus-fixed and
            immoveable-for it felt satisfied in Him as a Divine Saviour. [Eph
            1:1.] Paul&#x27;s heart had been gladdened by the news of their
            consistency and spiritual advancement, and in the fulness of his joy
            he offered thanks to God. It is not necessary, with Locke and
            Pierce, to take πίστις in the sense of fidelity, “sticking to the
            grace of God.” And their love was universal in its sweep, not toward
            all men, but toward all the saints. [ἅγιος, Eph 1:1.] In itself,
            this love is really only a form, or manifestation of love to the
            Divine object of their faith, for it is affection to Christ&#x27;s
            image in the saints. As, though a mirror is broken, each fragment
            will still throw out the same reflection in miniature, and that
            perfectly, so the saints, as a body and individually, exhibit the
            same blessed and divine image of Christ enshrined with them, and are
            therefore the objects of Christian love. Who is not acquainted with
            the language of Tertullian?&amp;- -;Sed ejusmodi vel maxime

            account of the hope laid up for you in heaven.” It is not easy to
            fix precisely on the connection between this clause and the
            preceding statement. It is a lame and superficial exegesis simply to
            say that the apostle merely alludes to his three favourite graces,
            faith, love, and hope.
          </p>
          <p>
            But 1. Grotius, Wolf, Davenant, Estius, Pierce, Olshausen, De Wette,
            Bähr, Heinrichs, and the Socinian expositors, Crellius and
            Slichting, connect it with the two preceding clauses, as if it told
            the reason why faith and love were formed and cherished within
            them-your faith in Christ, and love to all the saints-graces
            possessed and nurtured “in consequence of the hope laid up for you
            in heaven.” With such a view, the connection appears to be
            elliptical, and not very clearly expressed in the language before
            us. Nor do we think it a Pauline sentiment. The apostle&#x27;s
            references to future glory are not of this nature, and we cannot
            regard him as placing faith and love on so selfish a basis as the
            mere hope of a coming recompense; for Christ is worthy of that
            faith, and saints, from their very character, elicit that love. The
            evangelical expositors who hold this view have to maintain a stout
            protest against the idea that they favour the Popish doctrine of
            merit. Davenant formally proposes the question, “whether it be
            lawful to do good works with a view to, or for the reward laid up in
            heaven?”
          </p>
          <p>
            2. A modified and more tenable view is held by Chrysostom, and some
            of the Greek Fathers, as well as Estius, Calvin, Macknight, Meyer,
            and Steiger, who refer διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα solely to ἀγάπην, as if the
            meaning were, This love is not cherished under the expectation of
            any immediate return, but in the hope of ultimate remuneration.
            Still, under this hypothesis, the connection appears strained. If
            the apostle had said that they loved one another on account of the
            common hope which they had in heaven, or that the prospect of a
            joint inheritance deepened their attachments on their journey
            towards it, then the meaning might have been easily apprehended. But
            why the hope in itself should be selected as the prop of such love,
            we know not. Was their love to all the saints so selfish, that it
            could live only in expectation of a future reward? We do not deny
            the Christian doctrine of rewards, but we cannot put so selfish a
            valuation on Christian love as this exegesis implies; for of all the
            graces, it has the least of self in its nature, and its instinctive
            gratification is its own disinterested reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. We incline, then, to take the words διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα with the
            initial verb εὐχαριστοῦμεν. “Having heard of your faith in Christ
            Jesus, and the love which ye have to all the saints, as often as we
            pray for you, we thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, on
            account of the hope laid up for you in heaven.” That is to say, the
            report of their faith and love prompted him to give thanks; but as
            he gave thanks, the final issue and crown of those graces rose into
            prominence before him, and he adds, “on account of the hope laid up
            for you in heaven.” Their faith and love, viewed not merely in
            present exercise, but also in their ultimate consummation and bliss,
            were the grounds of his thanksgiving. The hope, as Bengel suggests,
            shows quanta sit causa gratias agendi pro dono fidei et amoris. The
            fourth verse can scarcely be called a parenthesis. This view is,
            generally, that of Athanasius, Bullinger, Calixtus, Elsner,
            Cocceius, Storr, Zanchius, Bengel, Schrader, Peile, and Conybeare.
            Meyer objects that in the other epistles the foundations of
            thanksgiving are subjective in their nature. Nor is this
            phraseology, when properly viewed, any exception. For faith and love
            are not excluded from the grounds of thanksgiving, and hope laid up
            is not wholly objective, as it signifies a blessing so sure and
            attainable that it creates hope. Had the apostle said, “for the
            happiness laid up,” the objection of Meyer might have applied, but
            he calls it “hope laid up”-a reality which excites and sustains the
            emotion of hope in the present state. It is further argued that
            εὐχαριστεῖν is never used in the New Testament with διά to express
            the ground of thanksgiving. It is so; but unless the objector can
            produce a parallel place to this, there is really no difficulty. If
            a writer means to express a different shade of idea, he will use a
            different preposition. N either ὑπέρ nor ἐπί conveyed the precise
            idea of the clause before us. These prepositions would have denoted
            that the hope was in itself the great ground of gratitude; but the
            apostle, in using διά, says that the hope, while it is so noble and
            promising, has a special and ultimate connection with the faith and
            love, the report of which so cheered his heart. The hope was present
            to his mind when he said εὐχαριστοῦμεν, but other and subordinate
            thoughts intervene, and his idea is so far modified, that when he
            came to write ἐλπίδα, he prefixes διά.
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Ελπίς is the object hoped for-τὸ ἐλπιζόμενον. [Eph 1:18.] In τὴν
            ἀποκειμένην is the idea of reservation and security. (Lk 19:20; 2
            Tim 4:8; 1Pe_1:4.) It is not enjoyed now-but it exists now; it is
            kept in store, and will certainly be possessed. And it is laid up ἐν
            τοῖς οὐρανοῖς, “in the heavens”-in that high region of felicity and
            splendour-at God&#x27;s right hand, which guards it, and in the
            presence of Christ, who won it, and will bestow it. And this
            heavenly glory is an object of hope to them who possess this faith
            and love for these good reasons:-1. It is future-as it is not yet
            enjoyed, but it is lying over; “hope that is seen is not hope.” 2.
            It is future good, for it is in heaven, the scene of all that is
            fair and satisfying. Coming evil excites terror, but distant good
            creates hopeful desire and anticipation. For it is the unimagined
            glory of spiritual perfection, of living in the unshaded radiance of
            God&#x27;s face, and in uninterrupted fellowship with Him, and the
            thronging myriads round about Him-the signet of eternity stamped on
            every enjoyment. 3. Such future good is attainable. Were it
            completely beyond reach, it might excite a romantic wish in one
            heart, and cover another with despair. But the apostle says it is
            laid up for you. It will therefore be enjoyed, for Christ has given
            His pledge. This faith, too, will elevate the spirit to heaven, and
            that love will prepare it for those supreme enjoyments,
          </p>
          <p>“For love is heaven, and heaven is love.”</p>
          <p>
            ῝Ην προηκούσατε ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας τοῦ εὐαγγελίου—“Of which ye
            have already heard in the word of the truth of the gospel.” The verb
            occurs only in this place of the New Testament, but it is found in
            Herodotus, Xenophon, and Josephus. In the προ compounded with the
            verb, De Wette and Olshausen think that the meaning is-they had
            heard of the hope in promise before the enjoyment of it. Such an
            exegesis is a species of truism, since they must have heard before
            they could cherish it. Therefore the interpretation of Meyer is
            equally objectionable-before ye had this hope, it was made known to
            you, it was communicated to you as a novelty. Nor can we say,
            generally, that the sense is-ye have heard of it before I now write
            it. But the meaning seems to be-that the hope laid up in heaven was,
            and had been, a prominent topic of preaching, and therefore an
            invariable topic of hearing in the Christian church. That προ has
            the sense of “already” we have shown fully under Eph 1:12. It is as
            if he meant to say-I need not expatiate on this hope, bright and
            glorious though it be; you are not unacquainted with it, for in the
            earliest teachings of the gospel when it came to you, ye heard of
            it-heard of it-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας. We cannot agree with Chrysostom, Erasmus,
            Heinrichs, Baumgarten-Crusius, Storr, and others, in giving the
            genitive an adjectival sense, as if the meaning were “the true and
            genuine gospel.” The noun ἀληθείας is made prominent by the article
            prefixed to it, and the idiom denotes that “the truth” was the sum
            and substance of the λόγος, or oral communication made to them by
            the first teachers of Christianity. Λόγος refers to the fact that
            their first teaching was oral, and not epistolary, or by inspired
            manuscript; and this “word,” or verbal tuition, had the truth for
            its pith and marrow. But the form of truth which had been presented
            to their minds was no common aspect of it. It belonged, not to
            philosophy or human speculation-it was the truth τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, “of
            the gospel.” This genitive is not in apposition with τῆς ἀληθείας,
            as Calvin, Beza, Olshausen, De Wette, Böhmer, and Huther suppose,
            but it has its distinctive meaning-the truth which belongs to the
            gospel, or is its peculiar and characteristic message. [ἀληθεία,
            εὐαγγέλιον, Eph 1:13.] “The word of the truth of the gospel” could
            alone reveal the nature and the certainty of future and celestial
            blessedness. The idea and expectation of spiritual felicity and
            glory in heaven are not connected with the sciences of earth, which
            deal so subtly with the properties and relations of mind and matter.
            These forms of knowledge and discovery lead but to the lip of the
            grave, and desert us amidst the dreary wail of dust to dust and
            ashes to ashes, but the truth contained in the gospel throws its
            radiance beyond the sepulchre, unvails the portals of eternity, and
            discloses the reality, magnitude, and character of “the hope laid up
            in heaven.” And, therefore, every blessing which the gospel makes
            known has futurity in its eye-an eye that pierces beyond the present
            horizon; and the Christian life, in the meantime, is one as much of
            expectation as of positive enjoyment.

            (Col 1:6.) Τοῦ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς καθὼς καὶ ἐν παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ—“Which
            has come to you, as it has come in all the world.” The verb is used
            with πρός in Acts 12:20; 2 Cor 11:9; Gal 4:18; Gal 4:20, in which
            instances the presence of persons is referred to, both in subject
            and object. Here it is followed by εἰς in the first clause, and ἐν
            in the second clause. In the one, by εἰς, the idea of travel prior
            to advent is implied; in the other, by ἐν, the notion of simple
            presence is affirmed, Kühner, § 622. The gospel had come to them,
            was brought to them, and was now with them, or in their possession.
            (2Pe_1:9.) Or, as Theophylact says, οὐ παρεγένετό, φησιν, πρὸς ὑμᾶς,
            καὶ ἀπέστη, ἀλλὰ πάρεστι καὶ κρατεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν. This idea suggested the
            Coptic rendering (Phai etshop)—“which abideth or dwelleth.” And
            surely such a gift they would keep as their own, prize highly, love
            dearly, and never suffer it to be contaminated with popular errors,
            or exchange it for those mystical reveries which were broached among
            them. For while the errors which the apostle is about to reprobate
            were limited in their origin and popularity, this gospel was “in all
            the world.” We see no necessity for choosing a new verb, and
            supplying the simple ἔστιν, while πάρεστι is suggested at once by
            the preceding clause. It was in all the world, because it had come
            to it. It was not indigenous in any country, but was there merely
            because it had been carried there. This expression is not to be
            scanned with narrow minuteness. We cannot, with Olshausen and
            Baumgarten -Crusius, look upon it as a prophetic or ideal statement;
            nor can we, with Michaelis, limit it to the Roman empire. The phrase
            is similarly used by Paul in Rom 1:8. That world which lay all round
            about them-those countries which to them were the world, and were by
            them so named, had been brought into contact with the gospel. It
            arose in Judaea, but burst its narrow barriers, and came forth with
            world-wide adaptation, offers, and enterprise. The labours of the
            other apostles in so many countries of the east and west warranted
            the phraseology.
          </p>
          <p>Καὶ ἔστιν καρποφορούμενον καὶ αὐξανόμενον.</p>
          <p>
            Καί is omitted by Lachmann, and Griesbach is virtually of the same
            opinion. It is wanting in A, B, C, D1, E1, in several Minuscules,
            and in the Coptic and Sahidic versions; but it is found in D3, E2,
            F, G, J, K, the Vulgate, and Syriac, and in the Greek Fathers. The
            authority of Codices against it is almost balanced by that of
            Codices in its favour. The words καὶ αὐξαν. are added to the
            Stephanic text on the evidence of A, B, C, D1, E1, F, G, J, and many
            other concurrent witnesses, such as almost all the Versions. Were
            the first καί not genuine, there would be a vital change of syntax.
            But with it there is only a common change. Kühner, § 863; Winer, §
            64. The reading we adopt frees the text from m uch entanglement of
            thought and diction. That gospel in all the world was no idle and
            barren speculation-a tinted cloud without rain, or a polished
            cistern without water. Or rather, it was as a tree-yielding his
            fruit in his season: whose leaf never fadeth. The gospel bore choice
            and noble clusters of fruit. It is not a ceremonial to be gazed at,
            or a congeries of opinions to be discussed. It is essentially a
            practical system, for its ethics are involved in its creed and
            worship. It makes the heart its home, and diffuses its control and
            its impulses over thought and action, over motive and life. That
            fruit is the assemblage of graces which adorn the Christian
            character.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reference in καὶ αὐξαν. is variously understood. Grotius,
            Olshausen, and Steiger refer it to internal growth, or the growing
            and ripening of the fruits themselves. We prefer the idea of the
            Greek Fathers, for Theodoret explains it thus-αὔξησιν δὲ τῶν
            πιστευόντων τὸ πλῆθος, that is, the growth is the external diffusion
            of the gospel. That fruit-bearing gospel was extending itself. To
            keep the figure of the apostle, it was like a tree, whose fruit,
            falling to the earth, germinated, so that there sprang up a youthful
            and healthy forest on all sides of it, or like the Eastern banyan,
            whose tall boughs, as they bend themselves in a graceful curve to
            the ground, enter it, and fastening into it a new root, rise up
            again in verdure, and on reaching the requisite height, stoop as
            before and repeat the same process of self-plantation till field
            upon field is covered with the progeny of its arches and alcoves.
            Thus did the gospel make progress-the disciples preached it around
            them, and their converts becoming preachers in turn, widened the
            circle of its influence and conquests. Acts 12:24; Acts 19:20. Καθὼς
            καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν—“as indeed among you.” What the gospel produced and
            achieved in the world, it produces and achieves among you. It
            exhibited the same vitality, fruitfulness, and power of
            self-diffusion in Colosse, as in the regions round about it. And
            those elements of the gospel had not been of slow production, or
            periodical manifestation-it, says Paul, had been so among you-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Αφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἠκούσατε καὶ ἐπέγνωτε τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν
            ἀληθείᾳ—“From the day ye heard it, and knew the grace of God in
            truth.” This peculiar form of elliptical construction by the
            incorporation of the noun into the relative clause is not uncommon;
            Winer, § 24; Bernhardy, p. 302. The accusative to the first verb
            ἠκούσατε is εὐαγγέλιον. It was the gospel which they had heard. This
            was the external and audible form of that grace which they had been
            privileged to know. It was by hearing it, or by verbal instruction
            about it, that they had become acquainted with it. The preposition
            ἐπί, with γινώσκω, has an intensive sense, as has been proved by us
            under Eph 1:17. By hearing the gospel they had come to know fully
            the grace of God-for the grace of God is the essence of the gospel,
            or the glorious fact which it communicates. It is the good news that
            God has in His sovereign favour pitied and blessed the world, and
            conferred upon it an unmerited and unexpected salvation-that while
            He have might punished, He resolved to pardon-that when He might
            have permitted the law to take its course, He has founded an economy
            of grace which man had no right to anticipate, and Himself was under
            no obligation to introduce. In every element of the gospel, in its
            pardon and purity, in its hope and life, in its means as well as in
            its offers of deliverance, in its application no less than its
            provision of saving blessings, in its precepts as much as in its
            privileges, there is felt and known in its peculiar ascendancy and
            fulness, “the grace of God.” [χάρις, Eph 2:8.]
          </p>
          <p>
            The last words, ἐν ἀληθ., are connected in various ways. 1. Some
            give the phrase the force of an adjectival epithet, and join it to
            χάρις—“the true grace” of God. Such is the view of Storr, Homberg,
            Pierce, Barnes, and Baumgarten-Crusius. This interpretation is
            without point. 2. Grotius and Musculus depart still farther from the
            true syntax by their paraphrase—“the grace of God revealed in the
            word of truth.” 3. Beza, Crocius, Olshausen, Steiger, Huther, De
            Wette, Meyer, and Winer, join the phrase to the verb, “and truly or
            really” knew the grace of God. The knowledge possessed by the
            Colossians is thus supposed to be distinguished from a false or
            fictitious knowledge of the Divine grace. 4. We prefer, with Bähr
            and Calvin, a different shade of the same exegesis, giving to the
            phrase an objective meaning, as if the apostle meant to say-the
            grace which they knew had been presented to them “in its truth,” for
            they had learned it from Epaphras. The preceding forms of exegesis
            are inferences from this. It was a correct interpretation of the
            scheme of grace which they had learned, or they possessed a true
            knowledge of the plan of mercy, because, as the next verse shows,
            Epaphras had taught them the gospel in its fulness and purity. This
            is also the idea of OEcumenius, though Theophylact and Chrysostom
            erroneously include the notion of miracles as confirming the truth.
            We understand the apostle to write thus-since the day ye heard it,
            and fully knew the grace of God in truth, as indeed in that true and
            complete form ye learned it from Epaphras; or, as Calvin explains,
            testatus est sincere illis fuisse traditum. The words ἐν ἀληθ.
            describe the teaching of Epaphras, or represent that genuine form,
            in which, by his preaching, the grace of God had been exhibited at
            Colosse. It is probable that in this statement there are various
            points of implied co ntrast with those corrupt representations which
            are mentioned and refuted in the subsequent chapter. Thus-the grace
            of God had been taught them without mutilation or admixture, but
            false philosophy shaded or curtailed its doctrines. The gospel was
            oecumenical, but the error which menaced them was only provincial in
            its sphere. The truth exhibited the basis and objects of a blessed
            hope, but falsehood darkened the horizon, and while the gospel
            yielded great abundance, such fictitious dogmas were barren and
            empty-a tree with leaves, but without fruit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The apostle says—“since ye knew the grace of God in truth,” or in
            its true form, “just as ye learned it from Epaphras”-

          </h2>
          <p>
            (Col 1:7.) Καθὼς ἐμάθετε ἀπὸ ᾿Επαφρᾶ. The καί found in the Received
            Text after καθώς, is justly excluded on the authority of A, B, C,
            D1, F, G, 17, 23, etc. It may have come into the text from its
            frequent employment in such an idiom by the apostle. It might be
            replied, however, that as, from an old tradition, Epaphras was
            supposed to be the only founder of the church, the καί was omitted,
            as seeming to militate against such a belief. Wiggers, indeed, has
            formally raised such an argument. But even were καί genuine, might
            it not mean “really,” or “indeed”—“as ye indeed learned of
            Epaphras”? The teaching of Epaphras is thus sealed and sanctioned by
            inspired authority. The apostle had no mean jealousy of a colleague
            who is further characterized as “our beloved fellow-servant”-
          </p>
          <p>
            Τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ συνδούλου ἡμῶν. The noun occurs again in Col 4:7. Like
            ὁμόδουλος, the old Attic form, it signifies “fellow-servant.”
            Conybeare and Macknight are found at opposite extremes about the
            term; the former rendering it “fellow-bondsman,” with unnecessary
            emphasis, and the latter uttering the sentimental conjecture that
            Paul used the word because he did not wish to grieve the Colossian
            church by telling them that their Epaphras was in prison with him.
            Timothy, Paul, and Epaphras not only served a common master, but
            were engaged in the same service; and therefore this community of
            labour begat a special attachment. The heart of the apostle was knit
            in cordial affection to all his fellow-labourers. He had none of
            that ignoble rivalry which just “hints a fault and hesitates
            dislike.” He felt no envy at their success, but was so identified
            with their work, that whatever gladdened them gladdened him; he
            shared in their triumphs and was saddened at their reverses. Still
            more, it is testified of Epaphras-
          </p>
          <p>
            ῞Ος ἐστι πιστὸς ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν διάκονος τοῦ Χριστοῦ—“who is for you a
            faithful minister of Christ.” The noun διάκονος is used in a general
            sense, as may be seen under Eph 3:7. [πιστὸς διάκονος, Eph 6:21.]
            The reading ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν has been called in question, and ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν is
            adopted by Lachmann, Bengel, Olshausen, and Steiger. In favour of
            this last reading are A, B1, D, G; and in favour of the former are
            C, D3, E, F, G, K, and others, with almost all the versions and
            Fathers. Where external testimony is so decided, we cannot accede to
            Olshausen&#x27;s pleading of any internal evidence. And the meaning
            attached to ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν-vice apostoli, in our stead-can scarcely be
            correct, since Epaphras was not simply an apostolical
            representative, for in ἡμῶν Timothy is included along with Paul. Nor
            is it necessary to give ὑπέρ the sense of “in room of,” in Lk 9:50,
            for there the phrase means “on our side.” The phrase then ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν
            means “on your behalf.” 2 Cor 4:5. The faithful labours of Epaphras
            were directed to the spiritual benefit of the Colossian church. For
            them he served, and served faithfully, in the gospel of Christ. A
            brief but noble eulogy. As he had devoted to them every energy, kept
            among them, and prayed with and for them, as he had presented to
            them a complete and symmetrical view of the gospel, and as their
            correct knowledge of Divine grace was based upon his teaching, and
            their spiritual eminence and fertility were the result of his
            patient and painstaking efforts, therefore were they to love him in
            his absence, and surely they would allow no false teacher to
            supplant him in their affection. Probably the encomium was a virtual
            warning, for, as Theodoret says, πολλοῖς δὲ αὐτὸν ἐκόμισεν
            ἐγκωμίοιςÑ--…ἵνα αὐτοῖς πλείονος αἰδοῦς ἀξιώτερος γένηται. It is a
            faint view of Chrysostom to imagine that the faithful service here
            referred to, is but the truthful report of the spiritual condition
            of the Colossians, which Epaphras had brought to Rome. Such a slight
            message could scarce be called a service, and it is therefore to
            fidelity of ministerial labour at Colosse that the apostle refers.
            It is wholly a caricature of the words to suppose, with Calixtus,
            Michaelis, and Böhmer, that as Epaphras was the apostle&#x27;s
            fellow-prisoner, he alludes to personal services done by the
            Colossian pastor to himself, as if he had said—“who is, in your
            room, a faithful servant of Christ to me.”
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 8.
            <em>who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</em>.
          </h2>
          <p>
            (Col 1:8.) ῾Ο καὶ δηλώσας ἡμῖν τὴν ὑμῶν ἀγάπην ἐν πνεύματι—“Who has
            besides made known to us your love in the Spirit.” It narrows the
            meaning too much to restrict this love to the apostle himself and
            Timothy—“your love to us.” Yet this is the view of the great
            majority of expositors, from Chrysostom in early times, and Erasmus
            and Grotius in later days, down to Bähr, Böhmer, Steiger, Huther,
            and Baumgarten-Crusius. But the language of the apostle does not
            warrant such a sense except by inference. Nor may the phrase be
            applied solely to brother-love, but, with Meyer, Theodoret,
            Heinrichs, and De Wette, we take it in a general sense as denoting
            the Christian grace of love. And the reason why this grace is
            selected and eulogized is evident from the concluding words-it was
            love “in the Spirit”-
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν πνεύματι. To give this phrase, as in the opinion of Rosenmüller,
            a-Lapide, Trollope, and others, the mere sense of true Christian
            love, is a weak dilution. Nor can we with Wolf and others regard it
            as in tacit contrast to ἐν σαρκί, a love based on domestic or
            national ties; or as if the meaning were-a love to the absent
            apostle which must be spiritual, as they had never seen his face in
            the flesh. The words, as in Pauline usage, refer to the Holy Spirit,
            and point out the source and sphere of this gracious affection.
            Thus, Rom 14:17, χαρὰ ἐν πνεύματι. Gal 5:22; Rom 15:13. ᾿Εν will not
            stand for διά, as Grotius renders it. Not as if Epaphras had spoken
            only of their love, and had made no mention of their other spiritual
            attainments. But love is regarded as the crown and consequence of
            all the other graces, and the mention of it presupposed their lively
            and effective exercise. For this love is no affection based on
            common relations-such as human friendship or social instincts. It is
            the offspring of spiritual influence in a heart so full of
            antagonism by nature to what is good and pure. The Spirit of Him who
            is Love takes possession of the believing bosom, and exerts upon it
            His own assimilating power. And as love is at the same time the
            combined product or resulting fervour of the other graces, as it
            gives man his closest resemblance to God, as it is the life and
            glory of heaven; and as it is the great object of the gospel to
            create and perfect it in the church, it may be safely taken as the
            index of spiritual advancement. The more it is seen in its vivid
            sympathies with all that is fair and God-like, the more its genial
            harmonies pervade the churches, the more its chivalrous impulses are
            felt, the more token is there that the Spirit of God has been in
            powerful and characteristic operation, and therefore as the true
            summation or totality of its various spiritual gifts , a Christian
            community may be congratulated on its love. When Epaphras declared
            their “love in the Spirit,” he spoke of the result, and from such a
            result it was at once inferred what a Divine change had been
            wrought, and how the elements of that change had been surely and
            successively developed and matured. “He that dwelleth in love,
            dwelleth in God, and God in him.”
          </p>

            The reader will easily mark the course of thought. In Col 1:3, the
            apostle intimates that as he prayed, he gave thanks for them. Then
            naturally he tells the reason, but the telling of the reason in full
            prevents him from recording at once what formed the theme of his
            prayer. Now, however, in Col 1:9, he reverts to the contents of his
            supplications, and he says that he asked from God, for the
            Colossians, blessings fitted for mind, heart, and conduct,-a higher
            degree of knowledge, holiness, usefulness, persistence, and
            strength-all of them at once gifts of present possession, and
            elements of preparation too for future blessedness-all of them
            provided by the Father, and enjoyed by those who have been
            translated into the kingdom of His Son.
