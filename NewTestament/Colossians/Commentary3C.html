          <p>
            In union with Him we have once and forever put away the sins of the
            flesh, have lain in His grave, have passed to the heavenside of
            death, and are living under the blue sky of acceptance with God. Our
            Master’s victory is ours through faith. He won it, but we may share
            its fruits. By faith we apprehend and affirm these blessings. The
            land of Canaan is ours by right, but every inch has to be claimed by
            faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must not allow our religious life to become a piece of outward
            ritual, Col 2:16-17; nor permit the supposed mediation of angels to
            obscure the supreme majesty of our Lord, Col 2:18-19.
