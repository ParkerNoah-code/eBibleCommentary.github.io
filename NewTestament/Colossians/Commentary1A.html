              >Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and
              Timothy our brother,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus</em>. The apostle puts his name
            to this epistle, by which he was known in the Gentile world, as he
            usually does in all his epistles; and styles himself "an apostle",
            as he was, having seen Christ in person, and received his
            commission, doctrine, and qualifications immediately from him, with
            a power of doing miracles to confirm the truth of his mission. This
            he chose to make mention of, partly because the false teachers
            everywhere insinuated that he was not an apostle; and partly to give
            the greater sanction and authority, and command the greater regard
            and credit to what he should say; as well as to excuse his freedom
            in writing to them whom he had never seen, since he was an apostle
            of the Gentiles, and so to them; see Romans 11:13; he calls himself
            an apostle "of Jesus Christ"; not of men, he was not sent out by
            men, but by Christ, who appeared to him, made him a minister of his,
            gave him his Gospel by revelation, abundantly qualified him for the
            work, sent him forth unto the Gentiles, in whose name he went as an
            ambassador and messenger of his, and whom he preached, and by whom
            he was greatly succeeded, to the conversion of many souls, who were
            seals of his apostleship in every place (1 Cor 9:2).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through the will of God</em>. Not by the will of men, for he
            derived no authority and power, nor received any doctrine from men;
            nor by his own will, of his own head, by any usurpation of his; he
            did not take this office upon him of himself, but was invested with
            it, according to the secret will and purpose of God, from
            everlasting, who had ordained and appointed him to this service, and
            according to his will of command made known to him in time, when he
            told him what he should do, and openly separated, and sent him forth
            to do the work he had called him to; and which arose not from any
            merits or worthiness of the apostle, but from the sovereign good
            will and pleasure, free grace and favour, of God, to which the
            apostle continually ascribes it in all his epistles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And Timothy our brother</em>. Who joined with the apostle in
            this epistle, and whom he calls a "brother"; partly because of the
            Christian relation he stood in to him, and them, they being all
            brethren, children of the same Father, partakers of the same grace
            of regeneration, belonging to the same family, and so should own and
            love one another as brethren; and partly and chiefly because of his
            being a brother, companion, fellow soldier, and a fellow labourer in
            the Gospel. He mentions him, either because he was known unto them,
            or that he might be so; and to show the agreement there was between
            them in the doctrine of Christ, which might have the greater weight
            with them to abide in it.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>To the saints and faithful brothers</em>. This is the
            inscription of the epistle, in which the persons wrote unto are
            described as "saints", or holy men; not by birth, for all are unholy
            and unclean by nature; nor by baptism, for that neither takes away
            sin, nor gives grace; nor merely externally, by an outward
            reformation; but by separation, being by an act of eternal election
            set apart for God, for holiness, and happiness; and by imputation,
            Christ being made sanctification to them; and by the sanctifying
            grace of the Spirit of God in regeneration, being called with an
            holy calling, and having principles of grace and holiness wrought in
            them, and they formed as new men in righteousness and true holiness:
          </p>
          <p>
            And as "brethren"; being born of God, having him for their Father,
            and being of his household, and a part of the family in heaven and
            earth named of Christ, and heirs together of the grace of life, and
            of the heavenly glory: and as "faithful" ones; true and sincere
            believers in Christ, constant and persevering in the faith of him;
            faithful to the Gospel, and their profession of it, and to Christ,
            whose name they bore, and to one another, to whom they stood in the
            relation of brethren: and all this "in Christ"; and by, and through
            him; they were saints in him; they were chosen in him, and
            sanctified in him their head, and received all their holiness from
            him; they were brethren in him the firstborn of them; his God being
            their God, and his Father their Father; and had their faith and
            faithfulness from him, as well as it was exercised towards, and on
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grace to you and peace from God our Father</em>. The only
            instance in which the name of the Father stands in the opening
            benediction of an epistle without the addition
            <em>and the Lord Jesus Christ</em>. The omission of these familiar
            words which occur so uniformly in the similar introductory
            salutations of Paul’s other Epistles, is especially noticeable here,
            where the main subject of the letter is the office of Christ as
            channel of all blessings, and cannot surely be accidental. The name
            of the Father stands out with a peculiar prominence and dignity as
            we give glory to Christ.
          </p>

            "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also
            glorify you;" (Jn 17:1).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Philip said to him, 'Lord, show us the Father, and that will be
            enough for us.' Jesus said to him, 'Have I been with you such a long
            time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen
            the Father. How do you say, <em>Show us the Father</em>? Don’t you
            believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?" (Jn
            14:8-10).

            (Eph 1:1; 2 Cor 1:1). The apostle designates himself by his office,
            as always, except in the Macedonian Epistles (1-2 Thes and Phil) and
            the letter of private friendship to Philemon. Timothy shares also in
            the greeting of the Epistle to Philemon, probably a leading member
            of the Colossian Church (comp. Col 4:9, 4:17 with Phm 1:2, 1:10-12).
            During St. Paul’s long residence at Ephesus Timothy was with him
            (Acts 19:22), and there, probably, Philemon had come under his
            influence, and made Timothy’s acquaintance. There was, therefore, at
            least one link of acquaintance between "Timothy the brother" and
            "the saints in Colossae" (comp. Phil 1:1; 2 Cor 1:1; 1:1-24 and 2
            Thes 1:1, where his name appears in the same way). The honourable
            prominence thus given to Timothy marked him out for future
            leadership in the Church (1 Tim 1:3, 1:18; 2 Tim 2:2; 4:2, 4:5,
            4:6).

            <em>Colossae</em>. The form of the name appears to have been both
            <em>Kolossai</em> and <em>Kolassai</em>, the former being probably
            the earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city was in Phrygia, in the valley of the Lycus, about ten or
            twelve miles beyond Laodicaea and Hierapolis. The region is
            volcanic, and the earthquakes common to large portions of Asia Minor
            are here peculiarly severe. The tributaries of the Lycus carried
            calcareous matter which formed everywhere deposits of travertine,
            said to be among the most remarkable formations of this character in
            the world. “Ancient monuments are buried, fertile lands overlaid,
            river-beds choked up, and streams diverted, fantastic grottos and
            cascades and arches of stone formed by this strange, capricious
            power, at once destructive and creative, working silently and
            relentlessly through long ages. Fatal to vegetation, these
            incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground. Gleaming
            like glaciers on the hillside, they attract the eye of the traveler
            at a distance of twenty miles, and form a singularly striking
            feature in scenery of more than common beauty and impressiveness”
            (Lightfoot).
          </p>
          <p>
            The fertility of the region was nevertheless great. The fine sheep,
            and the chemical qualities of the streams which made the waters
            valuable for dyeing purposes, fostered a lively trade in dyed woolen
            goods. All the three cities were renowned for the brilliancy of
            their dyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colossae stood at the junction of the Lycus with two other streams,
            on a highway between eastern and western Asia, and commanding the
            approaches to a pass in the Cadmus mountains. Both Herodotus and
            Xenophon speak of it as a prosperous and great city; but in Paul's
            time its glory had waned. Its site was at last completely lost, and
            was not identified until the present century. Its ruins are
            insignificant. Paul never visited either of the three cities. The
            church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's
            epistles were addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Saints and faithful brothers.</em> (Eph 1:1; Phil 1:1; Rom 1:7;
            1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 1:1). "Saints" in respect of their Divine calling
            and character (Col 3:12; 1 Cor 1:1-31, 1 2:1-16, where this title is
            formally introduced); "faithful brethren in Christ" (Eph 1:1) in
            view of the errors and consequent divisions threatening them as a
            Church (Col 1:23; 2:5, 2:18, 2:19; 3:15; Eph 4:14-16; 6:10-18; Phil
            1:27; 2 Tim 2:19).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Grace to you and peace</em>. This Pauline formula of greeting
            combines the Greek and Hebrew, Western and Eastern, forms of
            salutation (comp. "Abba, Father," Rom 8:15). Χάρις is a modification
            of the everyday χαίρειν, hail! (Acts 15:23; Jam 1:1; 2 Jn 1:10); and
            εἰρήνη reproduces the Hebrew shalom (salam). Grace is the source of
            all blessing as bestowed by God (Col 1:6; Eph 1:3-6; 2:5; Rom 5:2,
            5:17, 5:21; Titus 2:11); and peace, in the large sense of its Hebrew
            original, of all blessing as experienced by man (Eph 2:16, Eph 2:17;
            Lk 2:14; Acts 10:36; Rom 5:1; 8:6; 2 Thes 3:16).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From God our Father</em>. Among the apostle’s salutations this
            alone fails to add "and from our Lord Jesus Christ"—which copyists
            were tempted to remedy. The omission is well established (see
            Revised Text, and critical editors generally), and cannot surely be
            accidental. In this and the twin Ephesian letter, devoted as they
            are to the glory of Christ, the name of the Father stands out with a
            peculiar prominence and dignity, much as in St. John’s Gospel:
            "honouring the Son," they must needs "honour the Father" also
            (verses 12; 13; 3:17; Eph 1:17; 2:18; 3:14; 4:6; 5:20).
