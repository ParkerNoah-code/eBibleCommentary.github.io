            "We have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with
            the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and
            understanding. And we pray this in order that you may live a life
            worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in
            every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened
            with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have
            great endurance and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the
            Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the
            saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the
            dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he
            loves!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Benevolence will begin to show itself wherever Christianity gains a
            just ascendency. This is particularly observable in the prayers
            which the Apostle offered for others; the fervor and fullness of
            which clearly proved, that they proceeded from a heart fraught with
            love, and deeply impressed with the excellency of those blessings
            which are provided for us in the Gospel. He confined not his
            attention to the welfare of a few with whom he might happen to
            sojourn; but extended it to the whole Church, as well to those whom
            he had never seen, as to those among whom he had ministered. He
            needed only to be informed that a work of grace was begun in any
            persons, and he instantly felt a union of heart with them, and took
            a lively interest in all that concerned them. This remark is
            strongly exemplified in the prayer before us.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            He had heard of the blessed state of the Colossian Church; and, from
            the instant he had received the glad tidings, he remembered that
            people in all his stated prayers: and, in the passage before us, he
            tells them what he prayed for on their behalf. He desired that they
            might advance:
          </p>
          <font color="#0000ff"
            ><b>
              <p align="justify">I. In the knowledge of God's will—</p>
            </b></font
          >
          <p align="justify">
            The "knowledge of God's revealed will" is the foundation of all
            acceptable obedience: and every Christian must of necessity be in
            some degree endued with it. But he will not be satisfied with a
            scanty measure of it: he wishes to be "<i>filled </i>with it," so
            that it may engage all the faculties of his mind. Not that he can
            rest in a <i> speculative </i>view of Divine truth, however clear or
            comprehensive it may be: the knowledge which he covets, is a
            <i>practical </i>and <i>experimental </i>knowledge; a knowledge that
            diffuses "a spiritual savor" over his soul, and enables him to
            conduct himself, "with all wisdom," as well in his secret conflicts
            with sin, as in the public exercises of his duty to God and man.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Such then was the Apostle's first request for the converts at
            Colosse: he desired, that, as they already had some knowledge of
            God's will, so they might be "filled" with it, enjoying at the same
            time its sweet savor, and its <i>practical influence</i>, "in all
            wisdom and spiritual understanding."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And would not such be our prayer also for ourselves? Let us not
            forget, that, while we aspire after divine knowledge, we must
            chiefly seek that which brings a feast to the <i>soul</i>, and
            endues it with an accurate discernment of good and evil.
          </p>
          <font color="#0000ff"
            ><b>
              <p align="justify">II. In obedience to his commands—</p>
            </b></font
          >
          <p align="justify">
            The more enlarged views the Christian has of divine truth, the more
            studious will he be to fulfill the will of God. And in his endeavors
            after holiness he will propose to himself the highest measure of
            obedience, and the noblest end. He will not limit himself to the
            rules prescribed by men; nor will he aim merely at obtaining eternal
            happiness: but he will consider the relation he bears to God, and
            the obligations he has received from him, and the expectations which
            he has of future benefits; and will endeavor to "walk worthy of"
            such a Father, such a Redeemer, such an unspeakable Benefactor.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            He will resemble a dutiful and affectionate servant, who does not
            merely consider what he must do in order to escape censure, and
            receive his wages, but what will please his Master. He inquires with
            himself, What will please my God? That is the great object of his
            ambition: that is the spring of his activity: and with that view he
            endeavors to be "fruitful," not in some good works only, but "in
            every good work," however difficult or self-denying.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Suited to these dispositions was the Apostle's prayer: he desired
            for the Colossians what he knew they desired for themselves, even
            "that they might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
            fruitful in every good work." And it is certain, that in proportion
            as we have attained a just knowledge of God's will, we shall desire,
            both for ourselves and others, an increase of righteousness and true
            holiness.

          <p align="justify">
            "The knowledge of God" seems to be different from "the knowledge of
            his will," that has been before mentioned: the former relates to a
            view of his truth, and the latter to the enjoyment of his presence.
            In this sense the latter is not a mere repetition, but a blessing
            intimately connected with a holy life. Whom will God meet, and unto
            whom will he reveal himself, but "him who rejoices in working
            righteousness,

            unto the day of redemption. How desirable is this for every saint!

            But under all his trials he must be "patient:" to whatever length of
            time they be protracted, he must be "long-suffering." Nor must he
            merely possess his soul in patience; he must have it blended "with
            joyfulness," regarding it as his honor and his happiness that he is
            counted worthy to suffer shame for his Redeemer's sake,

            feeble man to maintain such a conduct, unless he is "strengthened
            with all might" by the Holy Spirit: yes, there must be such an

            alternative remains, but either to abandon our profession, or to

            dwell in the immediate presence of their God! For this they are
            rendered "fit;" (for it is impossible that they can enjoy it, if
            they possess not a fitness for it:) their heavenly Father has
            "delivered them from the power of darkness," even as he did Lot from
            Sodom, and the Israelites from Egypt, with a mighty hand and a
            stretched-out arm: he has moreover "translated them into the kingdom
            of his dear Son," and brought them into a cheerful and unreserved

              1. How glorious are the Christian's privileges!
            </p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            Did the Apostle incessantly ask of God what God was not willing to
            bestow? No, "if we opened our mouth wide, he would fill it;" and all
            these graces would abound in us, to the praise and glory of our God.
            What then must the Christian be, in whom these things are found! O
            believer, do not aim at low things; but aspire after the highest
            measures of wisdom, purity, and joy.
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">2. How dependent are we upon our God!</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            It is not at our first commencement only of a religious course that
            we depend on God, but to the last hour of our lives. We can have no
            knowledge, holiness, or joy, but as we receive it from him. Let us
            then make our requests known to him, and depend on him for all
            seasonable supplies of grace and strength.
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">3. How great is the benefit of intercession!</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            We certainly are not sufficiently apprised of this. But when we
            recollect the intercessions of Abraham for Sodom, of Lot for Zoar,
            of Moses for Israel, how can we be so remiss in this duty! Let us
            incessantly plead for each other, knowing that the effectual fervent
            prayer of a righteous man avails much.
