          <h2>
            Ver 9.
            <em
              >For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don’t cease
              praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with
              the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and
              understanding,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For this cause, we also</em>. Not merely for their love to the
            apostle, and the rest that were with him; which sense is too much
            contracted, and carries some appearance of meanness and selfishness;
            but because of their faith in Christ, their love to all the saints,
            and the good hope they had of eternal happiness; and because they
            had heard the Gospel, and truly knew it, and sincerely professed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Since the day we heard this, don’t cease praying and making
              requests for you</em
            >. Which shows that the apostles prayed without ceasing; not that
            they were every moment praying, without intermission, but that they
            were frequent and constant every day at the throne of grace; and as
            often as they were there, they were mindful of these Colossians,
            even ever since they heard of their reception of the Gospel, of
            their profession of it, and of the fruit it brought forth in them;
            and in their petitions "prayed" and "desired", earnestly and
            importunately entreated God on their behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That you may be filled with the knowledge of his will</em>. The
            will "of God", as the Syriac version reads it, by which is meant,
            not the secret will of God, according to the counsel of which he
            does all things in nature, providence, and grace, but his revealed
            will; and that either as it is signified in the law, which declares
            the good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God, relating to what
            he would have done, or avoided by his creatures; or rather, as it is
            exhibited in the Gospel, which contains the will of God respecting
            the salvation of his chosen ones; as that it is his will that Christ
            should obtain eternal redemption for them, to do which he
            voluntarily substituted himself in their room, came into this world,
            and has accomplished it; and that all those that are redeemed by
            Christ should be regenerated by the Spirit; and that whoever sees
            the Son, and believes in him, should not perish, but have
            everlasting life; as also, that all those whom he has chosen in
            Christ, and given to him, and he has redeemed by his blood, and who
            are sanctified by his Spirit, none of them should be lost, but that
            they should be all saved with an everlasting salvation. Now the
            apostle does, not pray that they might have a "knowledge" of this
            will of God, for some knowledge of it they had already; they had
            heard of the hope laid up in heaven, in the truth of the word of the
            Gospel; they had not only had the external, revelation, and had
            heard the Gospel outwardly preached, but they had known truly the
            grace of God; and therefore what he asks for is, that they might be
            "filled" with the knowledge of it; which supposes that they had
            knowledge, but it was not full and complete; it was imperfect, as is
            the knowledge of the best of saints in this life; and that they
            might have a larger measure of it, and such a fulness of it as they
            were capable of in the present state, and not such an one as the
            saints will have in heaven, when they shall know even as they are
            known.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In all spiritual wisdom and understanding</em>. His meaning is,
            that they might be led into all the wisdom of God, which is so
            largely displayed in the revelation of his will concerning the
            salvation of his people, which is made in the Gospel; which is the
            manifold wisdom of God, wherein he has abounded in all wisdom and
            prudence; and contains such a scheme of things, so wisely contrived
            and formed, that angels desire to look into it; and that they might
            have a "spiritual understanding" of the mysteries of grace, without
            which they cannot be discerned to spiritual advantage, nor indeed
            without the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
            them: and the Ethiopic version renders it, by "the prudence of the
            Holy Ghost": who searches the deep things of God, and reveals them
            to the saints, and improves and increases their spiritual and
            experimental knowledge of them, which is what is here intended.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 10.
            <em
              >that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all
              respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the
              knowledge of God,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>That you may walk worthily of the Lord</em>. The Vulgate Latin
            version reads, "of God"; to which the Ethiopic version agrees; but
            rather the Lord Jesus Christ seems to be designed: and to "walk
            worthy" of him, is to walk by faith in him; to walk after his
            Spirit, and according to his word, and in his ordinances; to have
            the conversation as becomes his Gospel, and worthy of that calling
            wherewith the saints are called by grace to the obtaining of his
            kingdom and glory. The apostle prays that their knowledge might
            issue in practice; for knowledge, without practice, is of no avail:
            he first asks for knowledge, and then practice, for how should men
            act according to the will of God, or Christ, unless they know it?
            and when they know it, they should not rest in their knowledge, but
            put it in practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To please him in all respects</em>. The Syriac reads it, "that
            ye may please God in all good works": an unregenerate man cannot
            please God in anything; without faith in Christ it is impossible to
            please him by anything man can do; Christ only could, and did always
            the things that pleased his Father; there are many things done by
            believers which are displeasing to God; nor is there anything they
            can do that is pleasing to God but through Christ, in whom their
            persons and, services are accepted; good works being done in faith,
            and from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God,
            are acceptable unto him through Christ; and therefore are to be
            carefully maintained, and studiously performed by all those that
            have a spiritual understanding of the will of God, and believe in
            Christ their Lord and Redeemer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Bearing fruit in every good work</em>. Saints are trees of
            righteousness, the planting of the Lord; good works are the fruit,
            which, under the influence of divine grace, they bring forth; and
            this is not of one sort only, as trees usually do, but of every
            kind; being ingrafted into Christ the true vine, and deriving life,
            sap, and nourishment from him, they are filled with the fruits of
            righteousness by him, which they bring forth and bear, to the glory
            of his heavenly Father; and being such, they are pleasant plants to
            him, as fruit bearing trees are to the owner of them: wherefore, in
            order to the saints walking in their lives and conversations unto
            all pleasing, or pleasing in all things, the apostle prays they
            might be fruitful in good works, and that in everyone, in every kind
            of good works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And increasing in the knowledge of God</em>. Not barely of his
            nature and perfections, as they are displayed in the works of
            creation; but of his mind, and will, and the mysteries of his grace,
            as they are revealed in the Gospel; of the knowledge of him in
            Christ, as the God of all grace, and as a covenant God and Father.
            The apostle had before prayed for an increase of the knowledge of
            the will of God, previous to his request, for the putting of it in
            practice; and now suggests, that an increase of the knowledge of God
            himself may be expected in a practical use of means, an attendance
            on the ordinances of Christ, and a diligent performance of good
            works: from the whole of these petitions, it may be observed by the
            apostle's asking for them, that all our knowledge, and the increase
            of it, and all our fruitfulness in good works, are all from the
            Lord; and therefore we have no reason to boast of our knowledge, nor
            depend upon our works, but frankly to own, that notwithstanding all
            we know, and do, we are but unprofitable servants.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 11.
            <em
              >strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory,
              for all endurance and perseverance with joy,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Strengthened with all power</em>. This is still a continuation
            of the apostle's prayer for these believers; for having prayed for
            an increase of spiritual knowledge, and that this might be put into
            practice, he proceeds to pray for strength for them, that they might
            be enabled to practise what they had knowledge of; to walk worthily,
            to please God in all things, to bring forth fruit with patience, to
            persevere in knowledge, practice, fruitfulness, and in an increase
            thereof. It implies, that believers are weak in themselves, and
            insufficient to do or bear anything of themselves, but stand in need
            of strength from above, even of "all might"; of all kind of
            spiritual might and strength, proportionate to the various kinds of
            services, temptations, and trials they are called unto, and
            exercised with: they have need of every kind, degree, and supply of
            strength, to enable them to resist the temptations of Satan, to
            stand against them, and bear up under them; to oppose the
            corruptions of their own nature, that great company which comes upon
            them, wars against them, threatens to carry them captive, and
            destroy them, and against which they have no power of their own; to
            bear the cross, which, without the presence and grace of Christ, is
            very heavy, and all afflictions and adversities of every sort, which
            are grievous to the flesh, and at which it recoils; to perform the
            various duties of religion, and the whole of the work of their
            generation; which though they have a will unto, yet often know not
            how to perform, they want renewed strength their souls; and also to
            persevere in faith and holiness, and hold on and out to the end: and
            which strength they cannot expect to have from themselves, or from
            any creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>According to the might of his glory</em>. The glorious power of
            God. Power belongs to God, is a perfection of his nature, and has
            been, and is gloriously displayed in many things; as in the creation
            of the heavens and the earth; in the upholding of all things in
            their being; in the redemption and salvation of sinners; in their
            faith and conversion; in supporting the saints under various trials
            and exercises; and in the safe keeping them through faith unto
            salvation: from this glorious power of God saints may hope to be
            supplied with all might, or a sufficient supply of strength for
            every service, and for every difficulty; as also from the grace that
            is in Christ, who has strength as well as righteousness for his
            people, who is the glorious power and arm of the Lord, without whom
            they can neither do, nor bear anything, but through him
            strengthening them, they can do, and bear all things; as likewise
            from the Spirit of the Lord, who is the finger of God, by whom
            Christ wrought his miracles; and is that glorious power from on
            high, with which the apostles being endued, did the wondrous things
            they did; and it is by the same Spirit that believers are
            strengthened with might in the inner man.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For all endurance</em>. To bring forth fruit with patience; to
            run with patience the race set before them; to bear patiently all
            afflictions and tribulations; to wait patiently for the things
            promised by God, and for the coming and appearance of the Lord Jesus
            Christ, and the heavenly glory or hope laid up for them in heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And perseverance</em>. To be slow to anger, and not easily
            provoked to wrath; to be ready to forgive injuries; and to bear
            long, and with patience, all reproaches and persecutions for the
            sake of Christ, and his Gospel; all which require daily fresh
            supplies of grace and strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>With joy</em>. As well as with patience and longsuffering, with
            a cheerful spirit, or with joy in the Holy Ghost; to esteem reproach
            for Christ's sake above the riches and honours of this world; to
            rejoice when counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. This
            requires strength above that of nature, and a renewed supply of that
            of grace.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Giving thanks to the Father</em>. To God the Father, as the
            Vulgate Latin and the Syriac versions read the clause; and the
            Complutensian edition, and some copies, "God and the Father"; who is
            both the Father of Christ by nature, and of all his people by
            adoption. The Ethiopic version renders it, as an exhortation or
            advice, "give ye thanks to the Father"; and so the Syriac version:
            but the words rather seem to be spoken in the first, than in the
            second person, and are to be considered in connection with
            Colossians 1:9. So when the apostle had made an end of his
            petitions, he enters upon thanksgiving to God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
              in light</em
            >. By the "inheritance", or "lot", is meant not the common lot of
            the children of God to suffer persecution for the sake of Christ,
            and through much tribulation to enter into the kingdom, which they
            are by God the Father counted and made worthy of, with the rest of
            saints called out of darkness into light; nor their present state
            and condition, having a power to become the children of God, and to
            be fellow citizens with the saints, to enjoy communion with them,
            under the Gospel dispensation, called "light", in opposition to
            Jewish and Gentile darkness, to be brought into which state is an
            high favour of God; but the heavenly glory, so called, in allusion
            to the land of Canaan, which was divided by lot to the children of
            Israel, according to the will and purpose of God; and because it is
            not acquired by the works of men, but is a pure free grace gift of
            God, and which he, as the Father of his people, has bequeathed unto
            them; and which they enjoy through the death of the testator Christ;
            and of which the Spirit is the earnest; and because this glory is
            peculiar to such as are the children of God by adopting grace.

            It is no other than that inheritance which is incorruptible and
            undefiled, and which fades not away, reserved in the heavens; and
            designs that substance, or those solid and substantial things they
            shall possess hereafter; that kingdom, salvation, and glory, they
            are heirs of; and includes all things they shall inherit, and even
            God himself, who is their portion, their inheritance, their
            exceeding great reward, and of whom they are said to be heirs. This
            is the inheritance "of the saints", and of none else; who are
            sanctified or set apart by God the Father in eternal election; who
            are sanctified by the blood of Christ, or whose sins are expiated by
            his atoning sacrifice; who are sanctified in Christ, or to whom he
            is made sanctification; and who are sanctified by the Spirit of
            Christ, or have the work of sanctification begun upon their souls by
            him; in consequence of which they live soberly, righteously, and
            godly in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this inheritance of theirs is "in light"; unless this clause
            should be read in connection with the word "saints", and be
            descriptive of them; they being called and brought out of darkness
            into light, and made light in the Lord, light being infused into
            them; in which light they see light, sin to be exceeding sinful, and
            Christ to be exceeding precious: or this phrase should be thought to
            design the means by which the Father makes meet to partake of the
            inheritance; namely, in or by the light of the Gospel, showing the
            way of salvation by Christ, and by the light of grace put into their
            hearts, and by following Christ the light of the world, which is the
            way to the light of life: though it rather seems to point out the
            situation and nature of the heavenly inheritance; it is where God
            dwells, in light inaccessible to mortal creatures, and who is light
            itself; and where Christ is, who is the light of the new Jerusalem;
            and where is the light of endless joy, and uninterrupted happiness;
            and where the saints are blessed with the clear, full, and beatific
            vision of God in Christ, and of Christ as he is, seeing him, not
            through a glass darkly, but face to face. This may be said in
            reference to a notion of the Jews, that the "light" which God
            created on the first day is that goodness which he has laid up for
            them that fear him, and is what he has treasured up for the
            righteous in the world to come d. Now the saints meetness for this
            is not of themselves; by nature they are very unfit for it, being
            deserving of the wrath of God, and not of an inheritance; and are
            impure and unholy, and so not fit to partake of the inheritance of
            saints, or Holy Ones, and much less to dwell and converse with an
            holy God; and being darkness itself, cannot bear such light, or have
            communion with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But God the Father makes them meet, which includes all the acts of
            his grace towards them, upon them, and in them; such as his choosing
            them in Christ, and their inheritance for them; in preparing that
            for them, and them for that; blessing them with all grace, and all
            spiritual blessings in Christ; putting them among the children by an
            act of adoption, of his own sovereign will and free grace, and
            thereby giving them a goodly heritage, and a title to it; justifying
            them by the righteousness of his Son, and so making them heirs
            according to the hope of eternal life, and forgiving all their
            trespasses for Christ's sake; cleansing them from all in his blood,
            so that being the undefiled in the way, without spot or wrinkle, or
            any such thing, they are fit for the undefiled inheritance;
            regenerating them by his Spirit, and implanting principles of light
            and life, grace and holiness, in them, without which no man shall
            see the Lord, or enter into the kingdom of heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            One copy, as Beza observes, reads it, "which hath called us to be
            partakers", c. and so does the Ethiopic version. And all such as the
            Father has thus called, and made meet, shall certainly be partakers
            of the inheritance they partake of it already in Christ their head,
            and in faith and hope, having the Spirit as an earnest and pledge of
            it, and will wholly and perfectly enjoy it hereafter: for though,
            like Canaan's land, it is disposed of by lot, by the will, counsel,
            and free grace of God, yet will it not be divided into parts as that
            was; there is but one undivided inheritance, but one part and
            portion, which all the saints shall jointly and equally partake of,
            having all and each the same right and title, claim and meetness.
            For which they have abundant reason to give thanks to the Father,
            when they consider what they were, beggars on the dunghill, and now
            advanced to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory;
            were bankrupts, over their head in debt, owed ten thousand talents,
            and had nothing to pay, and now all is frankly, forgiven; and
            besides, a title to, and meetness for, the heavenly inheritance, are
            freely bestowed on them; and particularly when they consider they
            are no more worthy of this favour than others that have no share in
            it, and also how great the inheritance is.

          <p>
            <em>Who delivered us out of the power of darkness</em>. That is,
            from the power of Satan; see Acts 26:18, who, though once an angel
            of light, is now darkness itself, and is reserved in chains of
            darkness; he is a ruler of the darkness of this world; his kingdom
            is a kingdom of darkness; and he blinds the minds of them that
            believe not, keeps them in darkness, and increases the natural
            darkness of their minds; he delights in works of darkness, and
            tempts men to them; and his everlasting state and portion will be
            blackness of darkness: his power over men, in a state of
            unregeneracy, which he usurps, and is suffered to exercise, is very
            great; he works effectually in them, and leads them captive at his
            will; and nothing less than the power of God, who is stronger than
            the strong man armed, can deliver out of his hands; and which is at
            least one part of the mercy for which thanks are here given; Acts
            26:18- :; with the Jews, one of the names of Satan is חשך,
            "darkness" e. Moreover, the darkness of sin, ignorance, and
            unbelief, with which God's elect, while in a state of nature, are
            surrounded, and, as it were shut up and imprisoned, so that they
            have not the least spark of true spiritual light and knowledge, may
            be also meant;
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the power of which they are to such a degree, that they know
            nothing of God in Christ, of the way of salvation by him, or of the
            work of the Spirit on their souls, or of the doctrines of the Gospel
            in an experimental manner; and so they continue, till, by an
            almighty power, they are turned from darkness to light; when, by
            powerful grace, they are plucked as brands out of the burning, and
            delivered from wrath to come, and from that utter darkness of misery
            and destruction their ways of sin and darkness led and exposed them
            to. This deliverance is wrought out for them in the effectual
            calling, when they are internally called, and powerfully brought out
            of this darkness, by introducing light into them, revealing Christ
            in them, causing the prince of darkness to flee from them, and the
            scales of darkness and blindness to fall from their eyes; and which
            is both an instance or the wonderful grace of God, and of his
            almighty power, and in which lies in part the saints' meetness for
            the inheritance; for these words are, in some sort, explanative of
            the former; for so long as a person is under the power of darkness,
            he cannot be meet for an inheritance which is in light: it follows,
            as another branch of this mercy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love</em>.
            Not into the kingdom of glory; for though the saints are heirs of
            it, and rejoice in hope of it, they have not yet an entrance into
            it; which they will have abundantly when Christ shall introduce them
            into it, not only as his Father's, but as his own kingdom and glory:
            but the kingdom of grace is here meant, or that state of grace,
            light, and life, which such are brought into, when rescued out of
            Satan's hands, and recovered out of their former state of ignorance
            and infidelity; when they are by the drawings of the Father, by his
            powerful and efficacious grace, brought to Christ, and, in the day
            his power on their souls, are made willing to submit to his
            righteousness, and to embrace him as the alone Saviour and Redeemer,
            and be subject to him as King of saints, observing his commands,
            keeping his ordinances, and walking in his statutes and judgments
            with other saints, in a Gospel church state; which is Christ's
            kingdom here on earth, where he reigns as King over God's holy hill
            of Zion, being set there by his Father, from whom he has received
            this kingdom, and will deliver it to him, when it is complete and
            perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now those whom Jehovah the Father snatches out of Satan's hands, and
            breaks in upon their souls with divine light and knowledge, he
            brings into such a state, and into this kingdom of Christ, who is
            called "his dear Son": or "the Son of his love"; or "his Son of
            love"; who being his Son by nature, of the same nature with him, and
            equal to him, always was, is, and will be, the object of his love,
            complacency, and delight; as he cannot be otherwise, since he is the
            brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person; and
            even as this Son of his is in an office capacity, as the Mediator
            between God and man, he is his elect, in whom his soul delights; and
            he is always well pleased with all the chosen ones in him, who are
            the sons of God through him, and always beloved in him. This clause
            is added, partly to distinguish the kingdom of Christ, into which
            the saints are brought in this life, from the kingdom of the Father,
            or the ultimate glory they shall possess hereafter; and partly to
            express the security of the saints, and their continuance in the
            love of God, being in the kingdom, and under the care and government
            of the Son of his love; and also to make way for what the apostle
            has further to discourse concerning the person, office, and grace of
            Christ, in the following verses.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 14.
            <em
              >in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>In whom we have our redemption</em>. Which is an excellent and
            wonderful blessing of grace saints have in and by Christ; and lies
            in a deliverance from sin, all sin, original and actual, under which
            they are held captive, in a state of nature, and by which they are
            made subject to the punishment of death; but through the sacrifice
            of Christ it is taken, and put away, finished, and made an end of;
            and they are freed from the damning power of it, or any obligation
            to punishment for it; and in consequence of this are delivered from
            the enslaving governing power of it by his grace and Spirit, and
            will hereafter be entirely rid of the very being of it: it consists
            also of a deliverance from the law, the curse and bondage of it,
            under which they are held on account of sin, the transgression of
            it; but being delivered from sin, they are also from the law, its
            accusations, charges, menaces, curses, and condemnation; as likewise
            out of the hands of Satan, by whom they are led captive; for through
            the ransom price paid by Christ they are ransomed out of the hands
            of him that was stronger than they, the prey is taken from the
            mighty, and the lawful captive delivered by him that has led
            captivity captive: in short, this redemption is a deliverance out of
            the hands of all their enemies, and from all evils and misery, the
            effects of sin, from death, and hell, and wrath to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            The author of it is Christ, the Son of God, the Son of his love, his
            dear Son: he was called to this work in the council of peace, in
            which the affair of redemption was consulted; and he agreed to
            undertake it in the covenant of grace, of which this is a principal
            article; and being in his constitution, as Mediator, every way fit
            and proper for it: as man, the right of redemption belonged to him,
            being the near kinsman of his people, and, as God, he was mighty and
            able to perform it; as man he had something to offer, and, as God,
            could make that sacrifice valuable and effectual to all saving
            purposes; as man, he had compassion on human nature, and, as God,
            was concerned for things pertaining to his honour and glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            And thus being every way qualified, he was sent, and came on this
            errand, and has obtained a redemption, which is precious, plenteous,
            complete and eternal: it is now with him, and "in him"; and he is
            made this, and everything else to his people, that they want. The
            subjects of this blessing are, not angels, but men; and not all men,
            but some that are redeemed from among men, out of every kindred,
            tongue, people, and nation; who are called by the name of Jacob, the
            people of Christ, a peculiar people, and the church of God; and
            evidentially are such, who have faith in Christ, love to the saints,
            and good hope of eternal life; who know the grace of God in truth,
            are made meet to be partakers of the eternal inheritance, being
            delivered from the power of darkness, and translated into the
            kingdom of Christ, and are designed by the we in this text: the
            means by which this blessing is procured, is through his blood. This
            phrase is left out indeed in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, and
            in the Complutensian edition, and in some copies; but rightly stands
            here, as it does in Ephesians 1:7, where there is another clause
            added, which is here omitted, at the end of the verse, "according to
            the riches of his grace".
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the blood of Christ, his own blood, and not the blood of
            bulls and goats, and the same with that of the persons he redeems,
            but untainted with sin; the blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
            spot and blemish, of original or actual sin, otherwise it would not
            have been a sufficient redemption price for his people; nor even
            then, were it not as it was the blood of the Son of God, of one that
            was God as well as man, whereby it came to have a proper value and
            efficacy in it to obtain this blessing: Christ's shedding his blood
            freely on this account is a proof of his great love to his redeemed
            ones; the efficacy that was in it to answer this purpose shows the
            dignity and greatness of his person; and it not being to be effected
            without it, demonstrates the strictness of divine justice, and that
            the redemption of men is brought about in a way entirely consistent
            with the righteousness and holiness of God. A particular branch of
            this blessing follows, and which serves, in some sense, to
            illustrate and explain it
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The forgiveness of our sins</em>. Of all sin, original and
            actual; of heart, lip, and life, secret and open, past, present, and
            to come; which lies in a non-imputation of sin, a remembrance of it
            no more, a removing of it entirely out of the way, a covering and
            blotting it out of sight, so as to be no more visible and legible:
            this is in Christ, where all spiritual blessings are; nor is it to
            be had or expected from an absolute God, but from God in Christ, and
            through him, through his propitiatory sacrifice; for as redemption,
            so forgiveness of sin is through his blood, which was shed for it;
            so that it proceeds upon the foot of satisfaction made to the
            justice of God by a price paid, and is an act of justice as well as
            grace, and belongs to the same persons as redemption does; hence
            those that are redeemed are represented as without fault before the
            throne; and indeed, the reason why their iniquities are blotted out,
            and will be remembered no more against them, is, because they are
            redeemed.

            Benevolence will begin to show itself wherever Christianity gains a
            just ascendency. This is particularly observable in the prayers
            which the Apostle offered for others; the fervor and fullness of
            which clearly proved, that they proceeded from a heart fraught with
            love, and deeply impressed with the excellency of those blessings
            which are provided for us in the Gospel. He confined not his
            attention to the welfare of a few with whom he might happen to
            sojourn; but extended it to the whole Church, as well to those whom
            he had never seen, as to those among whom he had ministered. He
            needed only to be informed that a work of grace was begun in any
            persons, and he instantly felt a union of heart with them, and took
            a lively interest in all that concerned them. This remark is
            strongly exemplified in the prayer before us.

            He had heard of the blessed state of the Colossian Church; and, from
            the instant he had received the glad tidings, he remembered that

            tells them what he prayed for on their behalf. He desired that they

            The "knowledge of God's revealed will" is the foundation of all
            acceptable obedience: and every Christian must of necessity be in
            some degree endued with it. But he will not be satisfied with a
            scanty measure of it: he wishes to be "<i>filled </i>with it," so
            that it may engage all the faculties of his mind. Not that he can
            rest in a <i> speculative </i>view of Divine truth, however clear or
            comprehensive it may be: the knowledge which he covets, is a
            <i>practical </i>and <i>experimental </i>knowledge; a knowledge that
            diffuses "a spiritual savor" over his soul, and enables him to
            conduct himself, "with all wisdom," as well in his secret conflicts
            with sin, as in the public exercises of his duty to God and man.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Such then was the Apostle's first request for the converts at
            Colosse: he desired, that, as they already had some knowledge of
            God's will, so they might be "filled" with it, enjoying at the same
            time its sweet savor, and its <i>practical influence</i>, "in all
            wisdom and spiritual understanding."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And would not such be our prayer also for ourselves? Let us not
            forget, that, while we aspire after divine knowledge, we must
            chiefly seek that which brings a feast to the <i>soul</i>, and
            endues it with an accurate discernment of good and evil.

          <p align="justify">
            The more enlarged views the Christian has of divine truth, the more
            studious will he be to fulfill the will of God. And in his endeavors
            after holiness he will propose to himself the highest measure of
            obedience, and the noblest end. He will not limit himself to the
            rules prescribed by men; nor will he aim merely at obtaining eternal
            happiness: but he will consider the relation he bears to God, and
            the obligations he has received from him, and the expectations which
            he has of future benefits; and will endeavor to "walk worthy of"
            such a Father, such a Redeemer, such an unspeakable Benefactor.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            He will resemble a dutiful and affectionate servant, who does not
            merely consider what he must do in order to escape censure, and
            receive his wages, but what will please his Master. He inquires with
            himself, What will please my God? That is the great object of his
            ambition: that is the spring of his activity: and with that view he
            endeavors to be "fruitful," not in some good works only, but "in
            every good work," however difficult or self-denying.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Suited to these dispositions was the Apostle's prayer: he desired
            for the Colossians what he knew they desired for themselves, even
            "that they might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
            fruitful in every good work." And it is certain, that in proportion
            as we have attained a just knowledge of God's will, we shall desire,
            both for ourselves and others, an increase of righteousness and true
            holiness.

            "The knowledge of God" seems to be different from "the knowledge of
            his will," that has been before mentioned: the former relates to a
            view of his truth, and the latter to the enjoyment of his presence.
            In this sense the latter is not a mere repetition, but a blessing
            intimately connected with a holy life. Whom will God meet, and unto
            whom will he reveal himself, but "him who rejoices in working
            righteousness,

            alternative remains, but either to abandon our profession, or to
            implore such help from God as shall make us more than conquerors

            dwell in the immediate presence of their God! For this they are
            rendered "fit;" (for it is impossible that they can enjoy it, if
            they possess not a fitness for it:) their heavenly Father has
            "delivered them from the power of darkness," even as he did Lot from
            Sodom, and the Israelites from Egypt, with a mighty hand and a
            stretched-out arm: he has moreover "translated them into the kingdom
            of his dear Son," and brought them into a cheerful and unreserved
            obedience to his will. Must not they then give glory to their God?
