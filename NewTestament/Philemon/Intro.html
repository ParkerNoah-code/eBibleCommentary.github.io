        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>CONTENTS</h2>
        <p>We can distinguish three parts in this brief letter:</p>
        <p>
          I. The Introduction, Phm 1:1-7. This contains the address, the
          customary blessing, and a thanksgiving of the apostle for the charity
          of Philemon, for the increase of which Paul hopes, because it greatly
          refreshes the saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Request, Phm 1:8-21. Rather than command Philemon the apostle
          comes to him with a request, viz, that he receive back the converted
          slave Onesimus and forgive him his wrong-doing. Paul enforces his
          request by pointing to the conversion of Onesimus, and to his own
          willingness to repay Philemon what he lost, though he might ask
          retribution of him; and trusts that Philemon will do more than he
          asks.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Conclusion, Phm 1:22-25. Trusting that he will be set free, the
          apostle requests Philemon to prepare for him lodging. With greetings
          of his fellow-laborers and a final salutation he ends his letter.
        </p>
        <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>
          1. This letter is closely related to the Epistle that was sent to the
          Colossian church. They were composed at the same time, were sent to
          the same city and, with a single exception (that of Justus), contain
          identical greetings. At the same time it is distinguished from
          Colossians in that it is a private letter. Yet it is not addressed to
          a single individual, but to a family and to the believers at their
          house.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The letter is further characterized by its great delicacy and
          tactfulness. It bears strong evidence to Christian courtesy, and has
          therefore been called “the polite epistle.” In it we see Paul, the
          gentleman, handling a delicate question with consummate skill. Though
          he might command, he prefers to request that Philemon forgive and
          receive again his former slave. Tactfully he refers to the spiritual
          benefit that accrued from what might be called material loss. In a
          delicate manner he reminds Philemon of the debt the latter owed him,
          and expresses his confidence that this brother in Christ would even do
          more than he requested.
        </p>
        <h2>AUTHORSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          Marcion included this letter in his Pauline collection, and the
          Muratorian Fragment also ascribes it to Paul. Tertullian and Origen
          quote it by name, and Eusebius reckons it among the Pauline letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover the Epistle has all the marks of a genuine Pauline
          production. It is self-attested, contains the usual Pauline blessing,
          thanksgiving and salutation, reveals the character of the great
          apostle and clearly exhibits his style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet even this short and admirable Epistle has not enjoyed universal
          recognition. Baur rejected it because of its close relation to
          Colossians and Ephesians, which he regarded as spurious. He called it
          “the embryo of a Christian romance,” like that of the Clementine
          Recognitions, its tendency being to show that what is lost on earth is
          gained in heaven. He also objects to it that it contains seven words
          which Paul uses nowhere else. Weizsacker and Pfleiderer are somewhat
          inclined to follow Baur. They find proof for the allegorical character
          of the letter in the name Onesimus =profitable, helpful. The latter
          thinks that this note may have accompanied the Epistle to the
          Colossians, to illustrate by a fictitious example the social precepts
          contained in that letter. Such criticism need not be taken seriously.
          Hilgenfelds dictum is that Baur has not succeeded in raising his
          explanation to the level of probability. And Renan says: “Paul alone
          can have written this little masterpiece.”
        </p>
        <h2>THE PERSON TO WHOM THE LETTER IS WRITTEN</h2>
        <p>
          The letter is addressed to “Philemon our dearly beloved and
          fellow-laborer, and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus, our
          fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house,” Phm 1:1-2. Little is
          known of this Philemon. He was evidently an inhabitant of Colossae,
          Col 4:9, and apparently belonged to the wealthy class. He had slaves,
          received a circle of friends in his house, and was able to prepare a
          lodging for Paul, Phm 1:22. His munificence was generally known, Phm
          1:5-7, and he made himself useful in Christian service. He was
          converted by Paul, Phm 1:19, most likely during the apostles three
          years residence at Ephesus. Apphia is generally regarded as the wife
          of Philemon, while many consider Archippus as their son. We notice
          from Col 4:17 that the latter had an office in the church. Probably he
          was temporarily taking the place of Epaphras. The expression “the
          church in thy house” undoubtedly refers to the Christians of Colossae
          that gathered in the dwelling of Philemon for worship.
        </p>
        <h2>COMPOSITION</h2>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. The occasion for writing this Epistle is
          clearly indicated in the letter itself. Onesimus, the slave of
          Philemon absconded and, so it seems, defrauded his master, Phm
          1:18-19. He fled to Rome, where in some way—it is useless to guess
          just how—he fell in with Paul, whom he may have known from the time of
          his Ephesian residence. The apostle was instrumental in converting him
          and in showing him the evil of his way, 10, and although he would
          gladly have retained him for the work, sent him back to Colossae in
          deference to the claims of Philemon. He did not send him empty-handed,
          however, but gave him a letter of recommendation, in which he informs
          Philemon of the change wrought in Onesimus by which the former slave
          became a brother, bespeaks for him a favorable reception in the family
          of his master and in the circle that gathered at their house for
          worship, and even hints at the desirability of emancipating him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and place. For the discussion of the time and place of
          composition cf. what was said respecting the Epistle to the Ephesians.
        </p>
        <h2>CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <p>
          This Epistle is rarely quoted by the early church fathers, which is
          undoubtedly due to its brevity and to its lack of doctrinal contents.
          The letter is recognized by Marcion and the Muratorian Fragment, and
          is contained in the old Latin and Syriac Versions. Tertullian quotes
          it more than once, but no trace of it is found in Irenaeus and Clement
          of Alexandria. Eusebius classes it with the Homologoumena and Jerome
          argues at length against those who refused to accept it as Pauline.
          The Church never doubted its canonicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The permanent value of this little letter is both psychological and
          ethical. It shows us Paul as he corresponds in a friendly way with a
          brother in Christ, and thus gives us a new glimpse of his character,
          the character of a perfect gentleman, unobtrusive, refined, skillful
          and withal firm,—a character worthy of imitation. Moreover it reveals
          to us how Paul, in view of the unity of bond and free in Jesus Christ,
          deals with the perplexing question of slavery. He does not demand the
          abolishment of the institution, since the time for such a drastic
          measure had not yet come; but he does clearly hint at emancipation as
          the natural result of the redemptive work of Christ.
