        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          The author of John's Gospel is clearly the apostle John, however there
          has been some confusion on the authorship of the letters of John and
          John's Book of Revelation since the time of Eusebius, an early church
          bishop and historian. The confusion came early on from what appears to
          be a misinterpretation of Papias' words by Eusebius. Papias calls John
          the "disciple of the Lord" and an "elder" which Eusebius takes as
          meaning two seperate Johns (Eusebius,

          >. Instead, it appears that he used the terms interchangably, and
          since the setting, name, writing style, and apostolic testimony all
          strongly suggest the same author, it is most likely that the apostle
          John wrote the Gospel, Epistles, and Book of Revelation.

        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          This Epistle is altogether worthy of the spirit of that disciple who,
          above others, was loved by Christ, that he might exhibit him as a
          friend to us. It contains doctrines mixed with exhortations; for he
          speaks of the eternal Deity of Christ, and at the same time of the
          incomparable grace which he brought with him when he appeared in the
          world, and generally of all his blessings; and he especially commends
          and extols the inestimable grace of divine adoption. On these truths
          he grounds his exhortations; and at one time he admonishes us in
          general to lead a pious and holy life, and at another time he
          expressly enjoins love. He particularly urges brotherly love: he also
          touches on other things, such as to beware of impostors.
