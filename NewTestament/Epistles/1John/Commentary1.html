        <h2>I. Introduction: The Word of Life (1:1-4)</h2>

            <em
              >That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that
              which we have seen with our eyes, that which we saw, and our hands

            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That which was from the beginning</em>. By which is meant not the
          Gospel, as if the apostle's design was to assert the antiquity of
          that, and clear it from the charge of novelty; for though that is
          called the word, and the word of life, and is the Spirit which gives
          life, and is the means of quickening dead sinners, and brings the
          report of eternal life and salvation by Christ, yet the seeing of it
          with bodily eyes, and handling it with corporeal hands, do not agree
          with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ is here intended, who in his divine nature was, really
          existed as a divine person, as the everlasting Jehovah, the eternal I
          AM, which is, and was, and is to come, and existed "from the
          beginning"; not from the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel by
          John only, for he was before the Gospel was preached, being the first
          preacher of it himself, and before John was; yea, before the prophets,
          before Abraham, and before Adam, and before all creatures, from the
          beginning of time, and of the creation of the world, being the Maker
          of all things, even from everlasting; for otherwise he could not have
          been set up in an office capacity so early, or God's elect be chosen
          in him before the foundation of the world, and they have grace and
          blessings given them in him before the world began, or an everlasting
          covenant be made with him (see Jn 1:1).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That which we have heard</em>. This, with what follows, proves him
          to be truly and really man; for when the Word was made flesh, and
          dwelt among men, the apostles heard, and saw, and handled him; they
          not only heard a voice from heaven, declaring him to be the Son of
          God, but they often heard him speak himself, both in private
          conversation with them, and in his public ministry; they heard his
          many excellent discourses on the mount, and elsewhere, and those that
          were particularly delivered to them a little before his death; and
          blessed were they on this account, Matthew 13:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That which we have seen with our eyes</em>. With the eyes of the
          body, with their own, and not another's; and they saw him in human
          nature, and the common actions of life he did, as eating, drinking,
          walking, c. and his many miracles they saw him raise the dead, cleanse
          the lepers, restore sight to the blind, cause the lame to walk, the
          dumb to speak, and the deaf to hear; and they saw him transfigured on
          the mount. John was one that was present at that time, and saw his
          glory, as he also was when he hung upon the cross, and saw him
          bleeding, gasping, and dying there; they saw him after his
          resurrection from the dead, he showed himself to them alive, and was
          seen of them forty days; they saw him go up to heaven, and a cloud
          receiving him out of their sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That which we saw</em>. Wistly and intently, once and again, and a
          thousand times, and with the utmost pleasure and delight; and knew him
          perfectly well, and were able to describe exactly his person, stature,
          features, and the lineaments of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And our hands touched, concerning the Word of life</em>. As Peter
          did when Jesus caught him by the hand on the water, when he was just
          ready to sink; and as this apostle did, when he leaned on his bosom;
          and as Thomas did, even after his resurrection, when he thrust his
          hand into his side; and as all the apostles were called upon to see
          and handle him, that it was he himself, and not a spirit, which has
          not flesh and bones as he had. Now as this is said of Christ, the Word
          of life, who is so called, because he has life in himself, as God, as
          the Mediator, and as man, and is the author of life, natural,
          spiritual, and eternal, it must be understood as he, the Word, is made
          manifest in the flesh; for he, as the Word, or as a divine person, or
          as considered in his divine nature, is not to be seen nor handled:
          this therefore is spoken of the Word, or of the person of Christ,
          God-man, with respect to his human nature, as united to the Logos, or
          Word of God; and so is a proof of the truth and reality of his human
          nature, by several of the senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 2.
            <em
              >(and the life was revealed, and we have seen, and testify, and
              declare to you the life, the eternal life, which was with the
              Father, and was revealed to us);</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The life was manifested</em>. As though he had said, "We testify
          of the vivifying Word, as life has been manifested." The sense may at
          the same time be twofold, that Christ, who is life and the fountain of
          life, has been manifested, or, that life has been openly offered to us
          in Christ. The latter, indeed, necessarily follows from the former.
          Yet as to the meaning, the two things differ, as cause and effect.
          When he repeats, We show, or announce eternal life, he speaks, I have
          no doubt, of the effect, even that he announces that life is obtained
          for us in Christ. We hence learn, that when Christ is preached to us,
          the kingdom of heaven is opened to us, so that being raised from death
          we may live the life of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>We have seen, and testify</em>. For they were both eye and ear
          witnesses of the Word, and of the truth of his incarnation, and bore a
          faithful record to his proper deity, and real humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Declare to you the life, the eternal life</em>. Jesus Christ, the
          true God, and eternal life, as in 1 John 5:20; so called, because he
          has everlasting life in himself; as he is the living God, and because
          he has eternal life for all his people; not only the purpose and
          promise of it are in him, but the thing itself; and it is in his power
          and gift to bestow it on all the Father hath given to him, and to them
          he does give it. The beginning of it lies in the knowledge of him, and
          the consummation of it will be in the lasting vision and enjoyment of
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Which was with the Father</em>. This is true, not only from the
          time when the world was formed, but also from eternity, for he was
          always God, the fountain of life; and the power and the faculty of
          vivifying was possessed by his eternal wisdom: but he did not actually
          exercise it before the creation of the world, and from the time when
          God began to exhibit the Word, that power which before was hid,
          diffused itself over all created things. Some manifestation had
          already been made; the Apostle had another thing in view, that is,
          that life was then at length manifested in Christ, when he in our
          flesh completed the work of redemption. For though the fathers were
          even under the law associates and partakers of the same life, yet we
          know that they were shut up under the hope that was to be revealed. It
          was necessary for them to seek life from the death and resurrection of
          Christ; but the event was not only far remote from their eyes, but
          also hid from their minds. They depended, then, on the hope of
          revelation, which at length in due time followed. They could not,
          indeed, have obtained life, except it was in some way manifested to
          them; but the difference between us and them is, that we hold him
          already revealed as it were in our hands, whom they sought obscurely
          promised to them in types.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the object of the Apostle is, to remove the idea of novelty, which
          might have lessened the dignity of the Gospel; he therefore says, that
          life had not now at length began to be, though it had but lately
          appeared, for it was always with the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And was revealed to us</em>. In human nature, as before observed,
          and that to the apostles, as he was not to the patriarchs and
          prophets; for though they saw him in promise, in prophecy, in type,
          and figure, and he sometimes appeared in an human form for a short
          time to them, yet they did not see him incarnate, in actual union with
          human nature; nor had they him dwelling among them, and conversing
          with them, as the apostles had; this was an happiness peculiar to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 3.
            <em
              >that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you
              also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our fellowship is with
              the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That which we have seen and heard</em>. He now repeats the third
          time the words, seen and heard, that nothing might be wanting as to
          the real certainty of his doctrine. And it ought to be carefully
          noticed, that the heralds of the Gospel chosen by Christ were those
          who were fit and faithful witnesses of all those things which they
          were to declare. He also testifies of the feeling of their heart, for
          he says that he was moved by no other reason to write except to invite
          those to whom he was writing to the participation of an inestimable
          good. It hence appears how much care he had for their salvation; which
          served not a little to induce them to believe; for extremely
          ungrateful we must be, if we refuse to hear him who wishes to
          communicate to us a part of that happiness which he has obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also sets forth the fruit received from the Gospel, even that we
          are united thereby to God, and to his Son Christ in whom is found the
          chief good. It was necessary for him to add this second clause, not
          only that he might represent the doctrine of the Gospel as precious
          and lovely, but that he might also show that he wished them to be his
          associates for no other end but to lead them to God, so that they
          might be all one in him. For the ungodly have also a mutual union
          between themselves, but it is without God, nay, in order to alienate
          themselves more and more from God, which is the extreme of all evils.
          It is, indeed, as it has been stated, our only true happiness, to be
          received into God's favor, so that we may be really united to him in
          Christ; of which John speaks in the seventeenth chapter of his gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, John declares, that as the apostles were adopted by Christ
          as brethren, that being gathered into one body, they might together be
          united to God, so he does the same with other colleagues; though many,
          they are yet made partakers of this holy and blessed union.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>We declare to you</em>. In the ministry of the word; the person
          and offices of Christ being the sum and substance of the Gospel
          ministration, that declares him to be the true God and eternal life,
          God over all, blessed for ever; and truly man, made of a woman, and
          made under the law; and to be the only Mediator between God and man,
          to be prophet, priest; and King, and to be the alone Saviour and
          Redeemer: this declares the greatness and excellency of his salvation,
          what an able, proper, and suitable Saviour he is; and what precious
          promises and spiritual blessings are in him, even all grace and
          eternal glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That you also may have fellowship with us</em>. In hearing,
          seeing, and handling of Christ in a spiritual sense; and by enjoying
          the same privileges in God's house and family, the same ordinances and
          spiritual provisions; joining and partaking with them in all the
          immunities and advantages of a Gospel church state here; and by being
          with them to all eternity hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And our fellowship is with the Father</em>. The Father of Christ,
          the covenant God and Father of his people; and which they have with
          him, when under the influence and witnessings of the spirit of
          adoption, and can in the strength of faith call him their Father, draw
          nigh to him through Christ as such, and are indulged with his
          presence, and the discoveries of his love.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And with his Son, Jesus Christ</em>. Being in union to him, they
          become partakers of him, and of his blessings; they receive out of his
          fulness, and grace for grace; they are admitted to an intimacy and
          familiarity with him; they are had into his chambers of secret
          retirement; they are brought into his banqueting house, where his
          banner over them is love, and where he sups with them, and they with
          him; and into this fellowship are they called by the grace of God,
          through the Gospel; as also they have fellowship with the blessed
          Spirit, though not here mentioned; see 2 Corinthians 13:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Ver 4.
            <em
              >And we write these things to you, that our joy may be
              fulfilled.</em
            ></b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And we write these things to you</em>. Concerning the deity and
          eternity of Christ, the Word and concerning the truth of his humanity,
          and the manifestation of him in the flesh; and concerning that eternal
          life and salvation which is declared in the Gospel to be in him; and
          concerning the saints' fellowship one with another, and with God the
          Father, and with Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That our joy may be fulfilled</em>. By full joy, he expresses more
          clearly the complete and perfect happiness which we obtain through the
          Gospel; at the same time he reminds the faithful where they ought to
          fix all their affections. True is that saying, "Where your treasure
          is, there will be your heart also" (Mat 6:21). Whosoever, then, really
          perceives what fellowship with God is, will be satisfied with it
          alone, and will no more burn with desires for other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Lord is my cup," says David, "and my heritage; the lines have
          fallen for me on an excellent lot" (Ps 16:5-6).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same manner does Paul declare that all things were deemed by
          him as dung, in comparison with Christ alone (Phil 3:8). He,
          therefore, has at length made a proficiency in the Gospel, who esteems
          himself happy in having communion with God, and acquiesces in that
          alone; and thus he prefers it to the whole world, so that he is ready
          for its sake to relinquish all other things.
