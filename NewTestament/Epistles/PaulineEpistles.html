        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Paul Before Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          There is no apostle of whose life we have such full information as we
          have regarding that of Paul. He was born of Hebrew parents in the
          intellectual atmosphere of Tarsus in Cilicia, where besides receiving
          the regular Jewish education, he may have visited one of the many
          Greek schools found there. Being exceptionally bright, he was sent to
          Jerusalem to complete the study of the law and to be introduced into
          rabbinic lore. In that center of Jewish learning he received
          instruction at the feet of the greatest Jewish teacher of his age,
          Gamaliel I, and a bright future was opening up before him, since he
          was zealous for the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We first meet him in Scripture as a youth in connection with the
          violent death of Stephen, and soon find in him the most active
          persecutor of the Church of Christ. After he has finished his
          destructive work at Jerusalem, he repairs to Damascus with authority
          from the high priest to persecute the Church in that city. On the way
          thither his course is checked by the Lord of the Church, he becomes a
          penitent, and turns into a zealous advocate of the principles that
          were formerly obnoxious to him.
        </p>
        <h2>Paul After Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          Leaving Damascus, he spent three years in Arabia, where he received
          further instruction from God himself, and he learnt to adjust himself
          to the new conditions of life; after which he again returned to
          Damascus. Being threatened with death at the hands of the Jews, he
          fled from Damascus to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem to his native city
          in Cilicia. After laboring there for some years, he accompanied
          Barnabas to Antioch in Syria, where he aided in establishing the
          youthful church in that city. He ministered to the needs of that
          congregation for a whole year, during which time he and Barnabas also
          went to Jerusalem to bring the contributions for the poor. Soon after
          they were directed by the Holy Spirit to preach the Gospel among the
          Gentiles. On this first journey they labored on the island of Cyprus
          and in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe, preaching the
          Gospel and working miracles. Notwithstanding fierce opposition from
          the Jews, they succeeded in founding several churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having finished their work, they returned to Antioch in Syria, and
          during their stay there were delegated to the council of Jerusalem to
          consult the mother church regarding the debated question, whether
          circumcision was binding on the Gentiles. Next Paul sets out on his
          second missionary journey with Silas, revisiting the churches founded
          on the first tour and by the direction of the Holy Spirit crossing
          over to Europe, where he labored with varying success at Philippi,
          Thessalonica, Berea, Athens and Corinth, founding churches in most of
          these places. From Corinth he returned to Antioch, after first
          visiting Jerusalem. His third missionary journey followed shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passing through Asia Minor, he finds a fruitful field of labor in
          Ephesus, where he remains three years, bringing all Asia to the
          knowledge of the truth and contending with idolatry and superstition.
          From there he again passes through Macedonia to Corinth, spending the
          winter in that city, and then returning by way of Troas, Ephesus and
          Caesarea to Jerusalem. Here he takes the necessary precautions to
          avoid all possible provocation of the Jews, but notwithstanding this
          they seek to kill him. Having been rescued by the chief captain, he
          defends his course before the Jews. This only increases their rage,
          however; wherefore he is taken into the castle and is brought before
          the Sanhedrin on the following day, where his defense leads to
          dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. In the following
          night he receives encouragement from the Lord and is told that he must
          also bear witness in Rome. On account of a plot laid by the Jews he is
          transferred to Caesarea, where he again defends his course before
          Felix, Festus and Agrippa. The wavering attitude of the governors, who
          are convinced of his innocence and yet desire to favor the Jews,
          induces him to appeal to Caesar. As a result he is taken to Rome,
          arriving there after suffering shipwreck, and remaining a prisoner in
          his own dwelling for two years.
        </p>
        <h2>Paul's Death</h2>
        <p>
          From the pastoral epistles and tradition we may infer that his first
          trial ended in acquittal. His movements after this are uncertain,
          though there are hints of visits to Philippi, Colossae, Ephesus,
          Crete, Nicopolis and even Spain. After being imprisoned again he was
          condemned and died as a martyr in A.D. 68.
        </p>
        <h2>Paul's Appearance</h2>
        <p>
          Little can be said regarding the personal appearance of the great
          apostle. In the Acts of Paul and Thecla he is represented as “short,
          bald, bow-legged, with meeting eyebrows, hooked nose, full of grace.”
          John of Antioch preserves a similar tradition, which adds, however,
          that he was “round-shouldered and had a mixture of pale and red in his
          complexion and an ample beard.” His opponents at Corinth said of him:
          “His letters are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak
          and his speech contemptible,” 2 Cor 10:10 ff. He himself refers once
          and again to his physical weaknesses. In all probability he was not a
          man of magnificent physique.
        </p>
        <h2>Paul's Personality</h2>
        <p>
          His personal life was full of contrasts, as Deissmann correctly
          observes. He was encumbered with an ailing body, and yet was a man of
          great endurance and of almost unlimited capacity for work in the
          Kingdom of God. The secret of his strength lay in his God, who spoke
          to him: “My grace is sufficient for thee, and my strength is made
          perfect in weakness.” He was a man of great humility, but was at the
          same time capable of uttering words of the greatest self-confidence,
          “before God a worm, before men an eagle” (Deissmann). It is Paul that
          says: “I am the least of the apostles,” 1 Cor 15:9; “I am less than
          the least of all the saints,” Eph 3:8; and: “of whom (sinners) I am
          chief,” 1 Tim 1:16. But it is the same Paul that speaks: “I labored
          more abundantly than they all,” 1 Cor 15:10; and: “For I suppose I was
          not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles,” 2 Cor 11:5. But he
          realizes that all that is commendable in him and that is praiseworthy
          in his work, is fruit of the grace of God. Hence he follows up the
          statement in 1 Cor 15:10 by saying: “yet not I, but the grace of God
          which was with me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul was a tenderhearted man, and was yet on certain occasions very
          severe. He was capable of the most affectionate feeling, always
          solicitous for the welfare of the churches; but just on that account
          inexorable over against all those that were enemies to the truth.
          Compare in this respect the epistle to the Philippians with that to
          the Galatians. He placed himself entirely at God’s disposal, following
          where He led, and was willing to be the unworthy instrument in the
          hand of his Lord in spreading the glad tidings of salvation. Hence he
          was great in the Kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>
          The chronology of the life of Paul is a subject of great difficulty.
          Aside from the date of the first Pentecost there is but a single date
          in the Acts of the Apostles of which we are sure, viz., that of the
          death of Herod in A. D. 44, and this has little value in determining
          the chronological order of the events in Paul’s life. A question of
          great importance is, in what year Felix was succeeded by Festus. We
          cannot enter into the dispute about this date, but assume that Schurer
          is correct, when he fixes it at A. D. 60. Geschichte des fiidischen
          Volkes I p. 577. In the same year Paul was sent to Rome, arriving
          there in the spring of the following year, A. D. 61. He remained a
          prisoner at Rome for two years, i. e., until A. D. 63, when he was
          probably released; and lived until the fall of A. D. 67 (Eusebius), or
          until the spring of A. D. 68 (Jerome), when he was martyred at Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figuring back from the same date, we find that Paul was imprisoned at
          Caesarea in A. D. 58, Acts 24:27. Since he had spent the previous
          winter in Corinth and the fall in Macedonia, Acts 20:2-3, and had
          labored in Ephesus for a period of three years, Acts 20:31, he must
          have begun his third missionary journey in the spring of A. D. 54. His
          second missionary tour was concluded shortly before, probably in the
          fall of A. D. 53, Acts 16:23. This journey undoubtedly lasted about
          two years and a half, since the apostle would naturally set out in the
          spring of the year and his stay of a year and a half at Corinth
          together with all the work done in other places makes it impossible
          that he started on his journey in A. D. 52, cf. Acts 15:36-41, Acts
          16:1-40, Acts 17:1-34. Hence the second journey began in A. D. 51.
          This second journey was preceded by the council of Jerusalem that most
          likely convened in A. D. 50, Acts 15:1-41. The first missionary
          journey must be placed somewhere between the date just named and the
          year of Herod’s death, A. D. 44.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is probable that we must identify the visit of Paul to
          Jerusalem mentioned in Gal 2:1 with that of Acts 15:1-41. What is the
          apostles point of departure there, when he says: “Then fourteen years
          after, etc.”? Exegetically it may be the visit spoken of in Gal 1:18;
          more likely, however, it is the time of his conversion, cf. Ellicott
          on Gal., so that the year 37 was probably the year in which that
          momentous change was wrought in his life. Then he spent the years
          37-40 in Arabia, at the end of which period he again visited
          Jerusalem, Acts 9:26; Gal 1:18. In the same year he went to Tarsus,
          where he labored until about the year of Herod’s death, Acts 11:25 to
          Acts 12:1.
        </p>
        <p>Thus we obtain the following result:</p>

          Captivity at Jerusalem and Caesarea A. D. 58—60<br />
          Arrives at Rome A. D. 61<br />
          First Captivity at Rome A. D. 61—63<br />
          Period between first and second Captivity A. D. 63—67<br />
