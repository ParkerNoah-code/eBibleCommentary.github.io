        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in
            truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John refers to himself as <b>the elder</b>.
          The word elder can refer more generally to either an older person or a
          person of authority such as when Jesus says, “<em
            >Now his elder son was in the field</em
          >” (Lk 15:25) and when Jesus must "<em
            >suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes</em
          >" (Mat 16:21). It is also used for Christian leadership such as when
          Paul told Titus to “<em>appoint elders</em>” (Titus 1:5-9) or when
          Peter says, “<em>I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder</em
          >” (1 Pet 5:1). John’s use of the term, like Peter's, affirms his
          pastoral role and in no way denies his apostleship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> The <b>chosen lady and her children</b> to
          whom this letter is addressed may refer to a local congregation and
          its members,<a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1"
            ><span><sup>1</sup></span></a
          >
          or it may refer to a particular lady and her children.<a
            id="fnref-2"
            href="#fn-2"
            ><span><sup>2</sup></span></a
          >
          No evidence finally decides the matter one way or another, however
          one's interpretation of the letter as a whole may persuade them
          towards one of these views.<a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3"
            ><span><sup>3</sup></span></a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John writes to this community of believers
          with a sincere and genuine <b>love</b> that accords with the gospel of
          Jesus Christ because Jesus is "<em
            >the way, the truth, and the life</em
          >" (Jn 14:6). This Christian love is directed towards them from
          <b>all those who know the truth</b>, believers, which demonstrates the
          importance of being part of a community that is grounded in the
          <b>love</b> and <b>truth</b> of Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us
            forever:</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John speaks of <b>the truth</b> in the same
          way he speaks of the Spirit because "<em>the Spirit is the truth</em>"
          (1 Jn 5:7), who "<em>lives with you and will be in you</em>" (Jn
          14:17), and was given "<em>that he may be with you forever</em>" (Jn
          14:16). The Holy Spirit convicts "<em
            >the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment</em
          >" (Jn 16:8) and "<em
            >when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and
            believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit</em
          >" (Eph 1:13). Real unity is not an ethnicity, or a building, or
          anything else external and does not compromise on truth, but is by
          <b>the truth</b> and <b>for the truth's sake</b>. It is the truth of
          Jesus, the Gospel, which unites John, his readers, and believers
          everywhere that share the conviction of sin, faith in Jesus, and the
          sealing of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and
            from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and
            love.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John concludes the salutation with a
          statement comparable to the salutations in many of the other New
          Testament letters: "<em>Grace to you and peace</em>" (Rom 1:7), "<em
            >Grace, mercy, and peace</em
          >" (Titus 1:4), "<em>Grace be with you all</em>" (Heb 13:25), "<em
            >Grace to you and peace be multiplied</em
          >" (1 Pet 1:2), and "<em
            >May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you</em
          >" (Jude 2).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>Grace, mercy, and peace</b>: "<em
            >But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and
            abundant in loving kindness and truth</em
          >" (Ps 86:15), "<em
            >It is because of Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not
            consumed, because his mercies don't fail</em
          >" (Lam 3:22), "<em
            >For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and
            through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or
            in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross</em
          >" (Col 1:19-20 ESV). Notice the close relationship between God the
          Father and Jesus Christ who together are the source of
          <b>grace, mercy, and peace</b>. We know that "<em
            >Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down
            from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation nor turning
            shadow</em
          >" (James 1:17). That Jesus bestows
          <b>grace, mercy, and peace</b> along with the Father can mean nothing
          else but that Jesus is one with the Father. Jesus explicity cofirms
          this: "<em>I and the Father are one</em>" (Jn 10:30).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <b>Truth and love</b>: John writes, "<em
            >let's not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed
            and truth</em
          >" (1 Jn 3:18), and Paul writes that "<em
            >grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift... until
            we attain to the unity of faith... mature... no longer to be
            children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every
            wind of doctrine... but speaking truth in love, we are to grow up in
            all aspects into Him who is the head, that is, Christ</em
          >" (Eph 4:7-15 NASB). This demonstrates the full meaning of the
          <em>agape</em> love<a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4"
            ><span><sup>4</sup></span></a
          >
          which John ascribes to both the Father and the Son and exhorts his
          readers to walk in.

        <h2>
          Ver 4.
          <em
            >I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking
            in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John references what has
          <b>been commanded by the Father</b>: “<em
            >This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his
            Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded</em
          >” (1 Jn 3:23). The Bible is "<em>breathed out by God</em>" (2 Tim
          3:16). Therefore it contains the words and commands of the Father.
          Just as a father tells his son, "<em
            >be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. Let them
            not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart</em
          >" (Prov 40:20-21), so the word of our Heavenly Father "<em
            >shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day
            and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is
            written in it</em
          >" (Josh 1:8). We should accept it "<em
            >not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of
            God</em
          >" (1 Thes 2:13). We are commanded to be hearers and doers of the
          word: "<em
            >Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were
            heard, lest perhaps we drift away</em
          >" (Heb 2:1), "<em
            >be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
            yourselves</em
          >" (James 1:22).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> We see John’s pastoral heart and great joy
          at seeing members of the congregation <b>walking in truth</b>.
          Similarly, Paul prays for the saints at Colossae that they "<em
            >may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual
            wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in a manner worthy
            of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every
            good work and increasing in the knowledge of God</em
          >” (Col 1:9-10 NASB). This shows how gospel-centered walking in the
          truth is and that we must lean on the Lord who “<em
            >is my strength and my shield</em
          >” (Ps 28:7) and who's word "<em
            >is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path</em
          >" (Ps 119:105).
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 5-6.
          <em
            >Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new
            commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love
            one another. This is love, that we should walk according to his
            commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the
            beginning, that you should walk in it.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John urges them to
          <b>walk according to his commandments</b> which they
          <b>heard from the beginning</b>. Walking refers to every aspect of our
          lives, so that "<em
            >whether therefore you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to
            the glory of God</em
          >" (1 Cor 10:31). It is an immensely practical command in that it
          entails that everything we do should be done in truth and love unto
          the glory of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> This repeated appeal from John may suggest
          that there was some dissent, discord, or disunity among the members of
          the church that needed to be addressed, or else John, like Peter,
          thought it necessary "<em
            >to stir up your sincere understanding by way of reminder, so that
            you recall the words previously spoken by the holy prophets and the
            command of our Lord and Savior given through your apostles</em
          >" (2 Pet 3:1-2 CSB) because of the risk of compromising both "<em
            >in deed and in truth</em
          >" (1 Jn 3:18).

          Ver 7.
          <em
            >For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John warns of
          <b>the deceiver and the Antichrist</b> because "<em
            >many false prophets have gone out</em
          >" (1 Jn 4:1) and <b>many deceivers</b>. He also says that "<em
            >these are the end times, and... many antichrists have arisen. By
            this we know that it is the final hour</em
          >" (1 Jn 2:18).<a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5"
            ><span><sup>5</sup></span></a
          >
          Therefore we should heed the warning of Paul who says, "<em
            >I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in
            the grace of Christ to a different 'good news,' but there isn't
            another 'good news.' Only there are some who trouble you and want to
            pervert the Good News of Christ</em
          >" (Gal 1:6-7). The Gospel, the good news that Jesus "<em
            >gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this
            present evil age</em
          >" (Gal 1:4), is the only hope in a world "<em
            >passing away with its lusts</em
          >" (1 Jn 2:17). The Gospel is "<em
            >the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes</em
          >" (Rom 1:16). Therefore, since we are "<em>saved through faith</em>"
          (Eph 2:8) and "<em
            >faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</em
          >" (Rom 10:17), we ought to study the scriptures and "<em
            >proclaim on the housetops</em
          >" (Mat 10:27) to the world all that Jesus has done, "<em
            >teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you</em
          >" (Mat 28:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John writes in the beginning of his Gospel
          as a matter of utmost importance that "<em>the Word was God</em>" (Jn
          1:1) and that "<em>the Word became flesh and lived among us</em>" (Jn
          1:14). Again he says, "<em
            >By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit who confesses that
            Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit who
            doesn't confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of
            God; and this is the spirit of the Antichrist</em
          >" (1 Jn 4:2-3). So then, there is a stark contrast between those who
          believe and teach that Jesus is fully God, "<em
            >our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ</em
          >" (Titus 2:13), and fully man, who <b>came in the flesh</b>, and
          those who teach anything else. Those who teach contrary to the
          incarnation (literally meaning "in flesh" or "taking on flesh") of
          Jesus are here called <b>the deceiver and the Antichrist</b>. Those
          who teach against the deity of "<em
            >our God and Savior Jesus Christ</em
          >" (2 Pet 1:1) can equally be called
          <b>the deceiver and the Antichrist</b> because they reject the clear
          and basic teaching of scripture and the God revealed therein.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 8-9.
          <em
            >Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have
            accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. Whoever
            transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t
            have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the
            Son.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John encourages his readers to be watchful.
          Those who remain <b>in the teaching of Christ</b> have
          <b>both the Father and the Son</b>, but
          <b
            >whoever transgresses and doesn't remain in teaching of Christ
            doesn't have God</b
          >. We all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ one day, so
          nothing is more important than the <b>teaching of Christ</b>. Jesus
          says, "<em
            >Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes in which all who are in
            the tombs will hear his voice and will come out; those who have done
            good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to
            the resurrection of judgment.</em
          >" (Jn 5:28-29). Therefore "<em
            >don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which
            remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For
            God the Father has sealed him</em
          >" (Jn 6:27).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> Note that <b>Christ</b> is not a last name,
          but a title meaning "anointed one" or "chosen one" which is the
          equivalent of "Messiah." This title signifies the fulfillment of OT
          prophecies, with Jesus being the Savior who came into the world to
          save sinners (See 1 Tim 1:15; Isa 61:1; Micah 5:2; Zec 9:9; Deut
          18:15).

            >whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal
            life</em
          >" (Jn 3:16) or placing faith in anything or anyone else for salvation
          is rejecting <b>the teaching of Christ</b>. It is "<em
            >by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
            yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, that no one would
            boast</em
          >" (Eph 2:8-9). The hope we should have is to "<em
            >be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which
            is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the
            righteousness which is from God by faith</em
          >" (Phil 3:9) because Jesus is the Messiah who saves "<em
            >to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him</em
          >" (Heb 7:25). He is altogether sufficient and perfect, and "<em
            >all our righteousness is like a polluted garment</em
          >" (Is 64:6). Therefore we must rely soley on Christ to have God
          because "<em
            >there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under
            heaven that is given among men, by which we must be saved!</em
          >" (Acts 4:12).

            <b>IV. Instruction to Reject False Teachers (10-11)</b></a
          >
        </p>
        <h2>
          Ver 10-11.
          <em
            >If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t
            receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him, for he who
            welcomes him participates in his evil deeds.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> The context of,
          <b>if anyone comes to you</b>, is referring specifically to traveling
          teachers, but its application extends to all teachers. He makes it
          clear that <b>anyone</b> who brings other teachings is a deceiver
          working against Christ and against sound doctrine, and should not be
          welcomed. Anyone who welcomes such a person
          <b>participates in his evil deeds</b>. All teaching should be
          God-centered and subject to the scriptures: "<em
            >Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for
            reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that
            each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
            for every good work</em
          >" (2 Tim 3:16-17).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> Jesus was known for his hospitality towards
          sinners; however, he was much stricter with the leaders and teachers.
          All those aspiring to become teachers, or those who already are,
          should consider James' words soberly when he says, "<em
            >Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will
            receive heavier judgment</em
          >" (James 3:1). A pastor or teacher in the church must be someone who
          is "<em
            >holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching,
            that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict
            those who contradict him</em
          >" (Titus 1:9).

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> John explains that he has
          <b>many things to write</b> to them and that this letter is
          preparation for a visit he hopes to make. This again expresses John's
          pastoral, heartfelt love towards them. He gives one more reason for
          his desire to visit them in person:
          <b>that our joy may be made full</b>. The
          <b>teaching of Christ</b> brings true unity, and living a faithful
          life allows us to joyfully say with Paul, "<em
            >I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have
            kept the faith. From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up
            for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that
            day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his
            appearing</em

          <span class="tab"></span> John, in closing, leaves his readers with
          the hope of him visiting them soon, and he gives a greeting to his
          readers from the <b>children of your chosen sister</b>, the believers
          in the congregation from which he writes.

          <span class="tab"></span><a href="#fnref-3"><sup>3</sup></a> Arguments
          for the metaphorical interpretation include: it seems unlikely that
          John would have addressed a woman in the church directly in this way,
          the letter lacks the personal statements that would be expected if it
          was addressed to a literal <b>lady and her children</b> (cf. 3 John),
          the use of the modifier <b>chosen</b> along with the fact that she is
          loved by <b>all those who know the truth</b> suggests a congregation,
          the instructions seem directed to a larger group, most of the letter
          is written in the second-person plural, similar comparisons or
          personifications of God's people as a female include "<em
            >like a woman faithless to her lover</em
          >" (Jer 3:20; See also Jer 6:2, 23; 14:17; Isa 1:8), Christ "<em
            >gave himself up for her</em
          >" (Eph 5:25; See also Gal 4:26-27; 1 Pet 5:13), and "<em
            >the bride, the Lamb's wife</em
          >" (Rev 21:9; See also Rev 21:2; 22:17; 12), and finally the reason
          why John would use such a device may be explained easily by the
          precedent in earlier biblical writings, John's frequent use of
          metaphor, even for the church specifically, and the need for a general
          reference if the letter was to go to multiple churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> However, it may simply refer to a particular
          <b>lady and her children</b>. Arguments for the literal interpretation
          include: it is the plain meaning of the text, he might have not
          identified names due to persecution, if she was a widow, it would
          explain why no husband was mentioned, John not only could have written
          this letter to a lady in the church, but the message of the letter
          would harmonize well with Paul who says, "<em
            >Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen
            into disobedience</em
          >" (1 Tim 2:13-14) and "<em
            >For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive
            gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
            always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the
            truth</em
