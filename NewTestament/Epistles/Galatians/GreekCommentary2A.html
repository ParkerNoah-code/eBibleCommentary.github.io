          <h2>A. Setup: Man's Gospel, Paul's Past (1:10-14)</h2>
          <h2>Ver 10. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἄρτι γὰρ ἀνθρώπους πείθω
              ἢ τὸν θεόν; Ἢ ζητῶ ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκειν; Εἰ
              γὰρ ἔτι ἀνθρώποις ἤρεσκον, χριστοῦ δοῦλος οὐκ ἂν ἤμην.</span></h2>
          <p>
            Ἄρτι - now [presently]. The Greek text throws the emphasis on this
            word, and its subtle irony is brought out by
            the ἔτι which follows. “Am I doing this now? Do you charge me now
            (he says in effect to these partisans of
            Judaism) with regarding men more than God? There was a time, before
            I knew Christ, when I did study to please
            men: if that were still my desire, I should not have been a servant
            of Christ.”
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 11. <span style="font-weight:normal">Γνωρίζω δὲ ὑμῖν, ἀδελφοί,
              τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν ὑπ' ἐμοῦ, ὅτι
              οὐκ ἔστιν κατὰ ἄνθρωπον.</span></h2>
          <p>
            γνωρίζω - reminding [making known]. Here, as in 1 Corinthians 12:3;
            1 Corinthians 15:1, this verb has the force
            of reminding rather than of making known. In all three passages the
            author calls attention to forgotten truths,
            which had once been well known.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 12. <span style="font-weight:normal">Οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐγὼ παρὰ
              ἀνθρώπου παρέλαβον αὐτό, οὔτε ἐδιδάχθην, ἀλλὰ δι'
              ἀποκαλύψεως Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ.</span></h2>
          <p>
            ἐγὼ - I. The personal pronoun is inserted, because the author is
            here laying stress on the special education he
            had received for his ministry of the Gospel He had not learnt it,
            like his converts, from human teaching, but by
            direct communion with God in spirit, as the Twelve had learnt it
            from Christ's own teaching. This independence
            of older Christians is a marked feature in the history of his life.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 13. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἠκούσατε γὰρ τὴν ἐμὴν
              ἀναστροφήν ποτε ἐν τῷ Ἰουδαϊσμῷ, ὅτι καθ'
              ὑπερβολὴν ἐδίωκον τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπόρθουν αὐτήν·</span></h2>
          <p>
            Ἠκούσατε - you have heard of. The Galatians had no doubt heard from
            Paul himself of his former persecution of
            the Church. How frequently it formed the topic of his addresses to
            Jewish hearers may be gathered from his
            defence of himself at Jerusalem in Acts 22, and before Agrippa in
            Acts 26.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ἰουδαϊσμῷ - Judaism. The rendering of this word in our versions,
            Jewish religion, is unfortunate: it implies a
            definite separation between the two religions which did not then
            exist, for Christians were still habitual
            worshippers in the synagogue; and it puts this view into the mouth
            of Paul, who steadfastly persisted in
            identifying the faith of Christ with the national religion. The word
            Ἰουδαϊζειν denotes the adoption of Jewish
            habits, language, or policy (cf. Galatians 2:14). So here Ἰουδαϊσμός
            denotes Jewish partisanship, and accurately
            describes the bitter party spirit which prompted Saul to take the
            lead in the martyrdom of Stephen and the
            persecution of the Church. Incidentally the partisanship was based
            on a false view of religion, for the narrow
            intolerance of the Scribes and Pharisees was a prevailing curse of
            Jewish society at the time; but Ἰουδαϊσμός
            expresses the party spirit, not the religion.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἐδίωκον... καὶ ἐπόρθουν αὐτήν - I persecuted... and destroyed
            [ravaged] it. ἐδίωκον describes the course of
            action continuously pursued by Saul down to his conversion. ἐπόρθουν
            is likewise applied in Acts 9:21 to the
            havoc wrought by Saul in the Church.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 14. <span style="font-weight:normal">καὶ προέκοπτον ἐν τῷ
              Ἰουδαϊσμῷ ὑπὲρ πολλοὺς συνηλικιώτας ἐν τῷ γένει
              μου, περισσοτέρως ζηλωτὴς ὑπάρχων τῶν πατρικῶν μου παραδόσεων.</span></h2>
          <p>
            συνηλικιώτας - contemporaries. Saul had been educated at Jerusalem,
            and this word points to his contemporaries
            in the schools of the Pharisees.
          </p>

          <p>
            γένει - countrymen. This term sometimes denotes family, but here
            race and nation, as in Acts 18:2; Acts 18:24.
            So also συγγενής in Romans 9:3; Romans 16:7; Romans 16:21.
          </p>

          <p>
            ζηλωτὴς - zealous. This is not here the proper name of a sect, being
            coupled with a genitive, as in Acts 21:20.
            Saul had no sympathy with the anarchical sect of Zealots who
            preached the sacred duty of revolt from Rome,
            though he had the persecuting zeal of an orthodox Pharisee.
          </p>

          <p>
            πατρικῶν - fathers. This differs in sense from πατρῷος. The latter
            denotes the national law and customs of
            Israel (Acts 22:3; Acts 28:17), the former the hereditary traditions
            of the family, as the addition of μου
            further signifies. In Acts 23:6 Paul describes himself as a son of
            Pharisees.
