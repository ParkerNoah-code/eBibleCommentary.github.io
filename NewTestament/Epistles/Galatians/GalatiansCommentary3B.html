      <h2>B. The Law Falls Short (3:10-14)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 10. <em>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Chrsostom writes, "Everywhere he puts the Gentiles upon a thorough equality.'And put no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.' [ Acts 15:9 ] From faith alone, he says, they obtained the same gifts. This is also meant as a lesson to those (objectors); this is able to teach even them that faith only is needed, not works nor circumcision. For indeed they do not say all this only by way of apology for the Gentiles, but to teach (the Jewish believers) also to abandon the Law. However, at present this is not said.'Now therefore why do you tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples?' [ Acts 15:10 ] What means,'Tempt ye God?' As if He had not power to save by faith. Consequently, it proceeds from a want of faith, this bringing in the Law." (<a href="http://d3pi8hptl0qhh4.cloudfront.net/documents/tschreiner/JETS_27.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Homilies on Acts</span></a>, 32).
        </p>
      
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Thomas Schreiner comments, "Paul’s claim that the OT itself curses those who do not abide by the law in its entirety is an effective statement only if one cannot obey it perfectly. The idea that Paul assumed that no one could obey the law perfectly explains why he believed that only Christ could remove the curse from humanity (Gal 3:13). Indeed, in Gal 2:21 Paul remarks that if justification were attainable by law-obedience, then Christ died for nothing." (<a href="http://d3pi8hptl0qhh4.cloudfront.net/documents/tschreiner/JETS_27.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Is Perfect Obedience To the Law Possible? A Re-Examination of Galatians 3:10</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 11. <em>Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Chrysostom writes, "And if any were to cast in prison a person who owed ten mites, and not the man himself only, but wife and children and servants for his sake; and another were to come and not to pay down the ten mites only, but to give also ten thousand talents of gold, and to lead the prisoner into the kings courts, and to the throne of the highest power, and were to make him partaker of the highest honour and every kind of magnificence, the creditor would not be able to remember the ten mites; so hath our case been. For Christ hath paid down far more than we owe, yea as much more as the illimitable ocean is than a little drop." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210210.htm" target="_blank"><span>Epislte to the Romans</span></a>, Homily X, Romans 5:17).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 12. <em>The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 13. <em>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,” </em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrosiaster, commenting on Romans 3:25, writes, "They are justified freely, because they have not done anything nor given anything in return, but by faith alone they have been made holy by the gift of God. Paul testifies that the grace of God is in Christ, because we have been redeemed by Christ according to the will of God, so that once set free we may be justified, as he says to the Galatians: <em>Christ redeemed us by offering himself for us</em>." (Commentaries on Romans and 1-2 Corinthians: Ancient Christian Texts, IVP, 2009). 
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 14. <em>that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</em></h2>
