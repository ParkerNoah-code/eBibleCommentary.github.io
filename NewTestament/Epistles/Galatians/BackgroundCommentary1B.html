        <h2>B. No Other Gospel (1:6-9)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 6.
          <em
            >I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in
            the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Him who called you</em>. That which inclines some to think that
          Paul meant himself, was his instrumentality in the conversion of these
          Galatians; and his complaints of them in this Epistle, for their
          deserting his doctrine, and alienation from him; but then the
          substantive to the participle must be understood, and the call must be
          understood of the external call only, by the ministry of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          It therefore seems rather to be understood of God; the apostles
          generally ascribe calling to God, Galatians 5:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:24;
          2 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Peter 1:2, 15; 2 Peter 1:3. Nor does it seem
          proper to refer the action to Christ, because the apostles ordinarily
          ascribe calling to the First Person in the Trinity, calling us by
          Christ, as Romans 8:30; 2 Thessalonians 2:13, 14, 16; 2 Timothy 1:9; 1
          Peter 5:10; besides, the grace of Christ is here made the term to
          which they are called.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though this would supply the participle with a substantive in the
          text, yet it seems both too remote, and also to alter the sense of the
          text; making it to run thus, from "Christ that called you unto grace,"
          instead of "him that called you into the grace of Christ." By which
          grace the apostle doubtless means not the doctrine of the gospel only,
          though that be sometimes called grace, but all the benefits of the
          gospel, justification, reconciliation, adoption; which are all
          properly called the grace of Christ, as being the purchase of his
          blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To a different “good news.”</em> Their objection to Paul's Gospel
          is identical to that recorded in Acts 15 to the effect that it was not
          enough for the Galatians to believe in Christ, or to be baptized, but
          that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep
          the law of Moses, for "except ye be circumcised after the manner of
          Moses, ye cannot be saved" (Acts 15:1). As though Christ were a
          workman who had begun a building and left it for Moses to finish.

          Ver 7.
          <em
            >but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who
            trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>There isn’t another good news</em>. From the Book from Genesis to
          Revelation there is only one gospel-that first preached in the Garden
          of Eden when the message went forth that the Seed of the woman should
          bruise Satan’s head (Genesis 3:15). That was the gospel, salvation
          through the coming Christ, the Son of God born of a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abraham was given the same gospel. When God had given the word, “In
          thy seed [which is Christ] shall all the nations of the earth be
          blessed.” That was the gospel, that all nations were to be blessed
          through Christ, the Seed of Abraham. And “Abraham believed God, and it
          was counted unto him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3). He was justified
          by faith because he believed the gospel.
        </p>

          David, stained with sin, the twin sins of adultery and murder, cries,
          “Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest
          not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a
          broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise” (Psalms
          51:16-17). “Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
          shall be whiter than snow” (Psalms 51:7). And there is only one way a
          poor sinner can be purged, and that is by the precious blood of the
          Lord Jesus Christ. David looked on in faith to the Christ, the Son of
          God, and his hope was in this one gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaiah proclaimed the gospel when he looked down through the ages and
          cried, “He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
          iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
          stripes we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). Jeremiah preached the gospel
          when he said, “This is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD
          OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS” (Jeremiah 23:6). Zechariah gospel's, “Awake, O
          sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow,
          saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be
          scattered” (Zechariah 13:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          John the Baptist came preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and as he
          pointed to Jesus he said, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
          the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Jesus Himself proclaimed this
          gospel when He said, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his
          only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
          but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter’s gospel when he spoke of Jesus, saying, “To him give all the
          prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him
          shall receive remission of sins” (Acts 10:43). John the apostle's
          gospel who said, “If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we
          have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
          Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7). James the apostle's
          gospel who said, “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth”
          (James 1:18). Paul’s gospel when he declared, “Through this man is
          preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe
          are justified from all things” (Acts 13:38-39).
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the gospel that they will celebrate through all the ages to
          come as millions and millions of redeemed sing their song of praise,
          “Unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from our sins in his own
          blood” (Revelation 1:5).
        </p>
        <p>One gospel! And there is no other!</p>
