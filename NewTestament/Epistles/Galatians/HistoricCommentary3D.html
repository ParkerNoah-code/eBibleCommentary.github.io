          <h2>D. Bondage and Freedom (3:23-29)</h2>
          <h2>Ver 23. <em>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under
              the law, confined for the faith which should
              afterwards be revealed.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Theodore of Mopsuestia comments, "We need to keep this in mind: Paul
            is giving a description of conditions under
            the Messiah King based on what they're most likely to be. The
            complete revelation of the renewal authored by
            Jesus is manifested to us only upon the dawn of that reality. Paul
            calls it the "Faith" because we've not yet
            experienced that reality, though in the meantime we have faith in
            it. And he calls it the "Promise" as if we've
            already gotten God's pledge regarding that reality. Finally, his use
            of the term "Grace" (or "Favor") is
            especially suitable to describe those benefits, since they're given
            as God's gift, free and clear — not arising
            from any merit of ours, but from His own munificence. Paul compares
            the Torah to all those benefits, and he's
            right to do so!" (Commentary on Galatians, <a
              href="https://sites.google.com/site/aquinasstudybible/home/galatians/cramers-catena-on-galations"
              target="_blank"><span>Paul's Letter to the Galatians: A
                Fourth-Century View</span></a>, Bill Berg, 2015).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 24. <em>So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to
              Christ, that we might be justified by
              faith.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Theodoret comments, "Now it was necessary that the law be given, as
            it fulfilled our need of a custodian. And it
            freed us from our previous impiety, taught us knowledge of God and
            then brought us to Christ the Lord as though
            to some wise teacher, so that we might be instructed by him in
            perfect learning and acquire the righteousness
            that is through faith" (Epistle to the Galatians, <a
              href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FctcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=pseudo+augustine+questions+on+the+new+testament+appendix&source=bl&ots=ZRDIRgHghK&sig=ACfU3U2P40MfdhbROItlT-8mIyfzTXVc5g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic9fiMhbX_AhUVnWoFHVnhCwMQ6AF6BAgsEAM#v=onepage&q&f=false"

          </p>

          <h2>Ver 25. <em>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a
              tutor.</em></h2>
          <p>
            John of Damascus writes, "Hail! O Christ, the Word and Wisdom and
            Power of God, and God omnipotent! What can we
            helpless ones give You in return for all these good gifts? For all
            are Yours, and Thou ask naught from us save
            our salvation, You Who Yourself art the Giver of this, and yet art
            grateful to those who receive it, through
            Your unspeakable goodness. Thanks be to You Who gave us life, and
            granted us the grace of a happy life, and
            restored us to that, when we had gone astray, through Your
            unspeakable condescension." (<a

            Book 4, ch 4).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 26. <em>For you are all children of God, through faith in
              Christ Jesus.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Gregory of Nazianzus writes, "[these are] our brothers in God,
            whether you like it or not; whose share in nature
            is the same as ours; who are formed of the same clay from the time
            of our first creation... more importantly,
            who have the same portion as the image of God just as we do and who
            keep it perhaps better, wasted though their
            bodies may be; whose inner nature has put on the same Christ and who
            have been entrusted with same <em>guarantee
              of the Spirit</em> as we... who are <em>fellow heirs</em> of the
            life in heaven... who are buried with Christ
            and raised with him, <em>provided</em> they <em>suffer with him in
              order that</em> they <em>may also be
              glorified with him</em>." (Select Orations, Oration 14, The
            Fathers of the Church: A New Translation, Vol 107,
            pg 49).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 27. <em>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have
              put on Christ.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Tertullian writes, "And so, according to the circumstances and
            disposition, and even age, of each individual,
            the delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in the
            case of little children. For why is it
            necessary — if (baptism itself) is not so necessary — that the
            sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger?
            Who both themselves, by reason of mortality, may fail to fulfil
            their promises, and may be disappointed by the
            development of an evil disposition, in those for whom they stood?
            The Lord does indeed say, Forbid them not to
            come unto me. Let them come, then, while they are growing up; let
            them come while they are learning, while they
            are learning whither to come; let them become Christians when they
            have become able to know Christ. Why does the
            innocent period of life hasten to the remission of sins? More
            caution will be exercised in worldly matters: so
            that one who is not trusted with earthly substance is trusted with
            divine! Let them know how to ask for
            salvation, that you may seem (at least) to have given to him that
            asks. For no less cause must the unwedded also
            be deferred — in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in
            such as never were wedded by means of their
            maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom — until they
            either marry, or else be more fully
            strengthened for continence. If any understand the weighty import of
            baptism, they will fear its reception more
            than its delay: sound faith is secure of salvation." (<a
              href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0321.htm"
              target="_blank"><span>On Baptism</span></a>, ch 18).
          </p>

          <p>
            Ambrose writes, "Although we are baptized with water and the Spirit,
            the latter is much superior to the former,
            and is not therefore to be separated from the Father and-the Son.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are, however, many who, because we are baptized with water and
            the Spirit, think that there is no
            difference in the offices of water and the Spirit, and therefore
            think that they do not differ in nature. Nor do
            they observe that we are buried in the element of water that we may
            rise again renewed by the Spirit. For in the
            water is the representation of death, in the Spirit is the pledge of
            life, that the body of sin may die through
            the water, which encloses the body as it were in a kind of tomb,
            that we, by the power of the Spirit, may be
            renewed from the death of sin, being born again in God.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so these three witnesses are one, as John said:
            'The water, the blood, and the Spirit.' One in the mystery,
            not in nature. The water, then, is a witness of burial, the blood is
            a witness of death, the Spirit is a witness
            of life. If, then, there be any grace in the water, it is not from
            the nature of water, but from the presence of
            the Holy Spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do we live in the water or in the Spirit? Are we sealed in the water
            or in the Spirit. For in Him we live and He
            Himself is the earnest of our inheritance, as the Apostle says,
            writing to the Ephesians 'In Whom believing ye
            were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, Who is an earnest of
            our inheritance.' So we were sealed by the
            Holy Spirit, not by nature, but by God, for it is written: 'He Who
            anointed us is God, Who also sealed us, and
            gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.'
          </p>
          <p>
            We were then sealed with the Spirit by God. For as we die in Christ,
            in order to be born again, so, too, we are
            sealed with the Spirit, that we may possess His brightness and image
            and grace, which is undoubtedly our
            spiritual seal. For although we were visibly sealed in our bodies,
            we are in truth sealed in our hearts, that
            the Holy Spirit may portray in us the likeness of the heavenly
            image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who, then, can dare to say that the Holy Spirit is separated from
            the Father and the Son, since through Him we
            attain to the image and likeness of God, and through Him, as the
            Apostle Peter says, are partakers of the divine
            nature? In which there is certainly not the inheritance of carnal
            succession, but the spiritual connection of
            the grace of adoption. And in order that we may know that this seal
            is rather on our hearts than on our bodies,
            the prophet says: 'The light of Thy countenance has been impressed
            upon us, O Lord, Thou hast put gladness in my
            heart.' " (<a

              nor free man, there is neither male nor
              female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</em></h2>
          <p>
            John Chrysostom comments, "See what an ardent soul! for having said,
            We are all made children of God through
            Faith, he does not stop there, but tries to find something more
            exact, which may serve to convey a still closer
            oneness with Christ. Having said, ye have put on Christ, even this
            does not suffice Him, but by way of
            penetrating more deeply into this union, he comments on it thus: Ye
            are all One in Christ Jesus, that is, ye
            have all one form and one mould, even Christ's." (<a

            John Jefferson Davis comments, "Authentic self-realization for both
            men and women is found in the willing
            submission to the diviniely-appointed structures grounded in
            creation and redeemed in Christ. This is the
            liberating dynamic of the trinitarian life and the truth of the
            Christian gospel." (<a

          <h2>Ver 29. <em>If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring
              and heirs according to promise.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Ambrose writes, "Now the former part of his discourse declares that
            no man shall be justified by the works of
            the Law, but by faith, <em>For as many as are of the works of the
              Law are under the curse</em>; but <em>Christ
              hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for
              us</em>. The inheritance therefore is not
            given by the Law but by promise. <em>Now to Abraham were the
              promises made, and to his seed which is
              Christ</em>. Thus the <em>Law was added because of transgressions,
              till the seed should come to whom the
              promise was made</em>; and therefore <em>all are concluded under
              sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus
              Christ might be given to them that believe. But after that faith
              is come, we are no longer under the Law, that
              is, under a schoolmaster</em>; and this because we are <em>all the
              sons of God</em>, and are all in Christ
            Jesus. Now if we are all in Christ Jesus, then are we <em>Abraham's
              seed, and heirs according to the
              promise</em>. And this is the conclusion at which the Apostle
            arrives." (<a
