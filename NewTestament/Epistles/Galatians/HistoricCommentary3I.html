      <h1>I. Faith Working through Love (5:1-12)</h1>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Kim Riddlebarger comments, "Following up the analogy between Hagar and Sarah in Galatians 4:21-4:31, here in Galatians 5:1-6, Paul sets out a contrast between faith and works, showing how completely antithetical they are when it comes to the matter of justification. To seek to be justified by good works and human merit is theological slavery. This is an especially serious error since Jesus Christ came for the purpose of setting us free. For Paul, it is this great truth that begins his discussion of the Christian life. 'It is for freedom that Christ set us free' " (<a href="http://kimriddlebarger.squarespace.com/an-exposition-of-galatians/" target="_blank"><span>Sermons on Galatians</span></a>, 9). 
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Binford Hole comments, "It doubtless appeared to many to be a small and unimportant point, but it was quite sufficient to establish the principle. The law is one whole. If taken up in one detail it must be maintained in all details. This is quite in keeping with what James writes “whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.” (Jam 2:10). This enforces the fact that if the law be broken in one detail, it is broken altogether. Both statements correspond and show us that the law cannot be taken up piecemeal. It is one whole and must be considered as such. If but a very small stone be thrown through a large pane of glass it is a broken pane, as really as if it were shivered to atoms by a large chunk of rock. Or, to change the figure, the law is like a chain of many links. It is as really a broken chain if one link be fractured as if a dozen were snapped." (<a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/fbh/galatians-5.html#verse-1-99" target="_blank"><span>Hole's Old and New Testament Commentary</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <em>You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Douglas Moo comments, "Grace in Paul reflects his conviction that God is free and unconstrained and that all that he does for his created beings is therefore given freely and without conditions (see esp. Rom. 4:4-5)." (Galatians, BECNT, 2013).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <em>For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Augustine writes, "I have written a book on this subject, entitled Of Faith and Works, in which, to the best of my ability, God assisting me, I have shown from Scripture, that the faith which saves us is that which the Apostle Paul clearly enough describes when he says:'For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by love.' But if it works evil, and not good, then without doubt, as the Apostle James says,'it is dead, being alone.' The same apostle says again,'What does it profit, my brethren, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?' And further, if a wicked man shall be saved by fire on account of his faith alone, and if this is what the blessed Apostle Paul means when he says,'But he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire;' then faith without works can save a man, and what his fellow-apostle James says must be false. And that must be false which Paul himself says in another place:'Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners; shall inherit the kingdom of God.' For if those who persevere in these wicked courses shall nevertheless be saved on account of their faith in Christ, how can it be true that they shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" (<a href="http://www.saintsbooks.net/books/St.%20Augustine%20-%20Enchiridion%20on%20Faith,%20Hope,%20and%20Love.pdf" target="_blank"><span>The Enchiridion</span></a>ch 67).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Origen writes, "Many a time do we accept untutored simpler entertainment, accompanied by good conscience, as guests at the table of those who are unable to furnish us with more, with greater satisfaction than any elevation of words upreared against the knowledge of God and proclaiming with ample plausibility a sentiment alien to the Father of our Lord Jesus who has given the law and the prophets. In order, therefore, that we may neither fall sick of soul for lack of nourishment nor die to God because of famine of the Lord's word, let us in obedience to the teaching of our Savior, with righter faith and life, ask the Father for the living bread which is the same as the needful bread." (<a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/origen_on_prayer_02_text.htm" target="_blank"><span>On Prayer</span></a>, XVII).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Marius Victorinus comments, "For faith liberates, and anyone, as we have said, who hopes for help in any way besides Christ, even if it be along with Christ, does not have faith." (<a href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment(BookFi.org).pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>, translated by Stephen Andrew Cooper, pg. 332).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 10. <em>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Paul Kretzmann comments, "Faith in Jesus Christ is wrought by the Holy Spirit, by whom it is also nourished and maintained, who gives the pledge of its fulfillment, 2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 1:14; Romans 3:11-23. By this faith we not only possess the righteousness of Jesus Christ here in time, but we also have the certain hope of being justified on the great Day of Judgment. All those that remain in faith by the power of the Spirit are sure of their gracious acceptance by God at the final judgment." (<a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/kpc/galatians-5.html" target="_blank"><span>Kretzmann's Popular Commentary</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 11. <em>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, "With regard to those who say that more would have believed if circumcision had not been instituted, let them receive this answer, that more would have believed if there had been no martyrdom, but the constancy of a few is to be preferred to the remissness of a larger number. For as many kinds of washings preceded, because that one true Sacrament of Baptism with water and the Spirit, whereby the whole man is redeemed, was to follow, so also the circumcision of many was to precede, because the circumcision of the Lord's Passion, which Jesus suffered as the Lamb of God, that He might <em>take away the sins of the world</em>, was to follow." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_08_letters71_80.htm" target="_blank"><span>Ambrose to Constantius</span></a>, Letter LXXII, 18).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 12. <em>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</em></h2>
