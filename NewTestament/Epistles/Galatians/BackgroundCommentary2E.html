        <h2>E. Justification by Faith Alone (2:15-21)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 15. <em>“We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 16.
          <em>yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law
            but
            through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus,
            that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works
            of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the
            law.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 17.
          <em>But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves
            also
            were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 18.
          <em>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove
            myself a law-breaker.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 19.
          <em>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to
            God.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>This passage will be better understood by
          comparing it with the Romans 7.
          There Paul describes beautifully, that no man lives to the law, but he
          to whom the law is dead, that is, has lost all power and efficacy;
          for, as soon as the law begins to live in us, it inflicts a fatal
          wound by which we die, and at the same time breathes life into the man
          who is already dead to sin. Those who live to the law, therefore, have
          never felt the power of the law, or properly understood what the law
          means; for the law, when truly perceived, makes us die to itself, and
          it is from this source, and not from Christ, that sin proceeds.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>This form of speech is frequently
          met with in the Scriptures, particularly in the writings of St. Paul,
          when the Law is set against the Law, and sin is made to oppose sin,
          and death is arrayed against death, and hell is turned loose against
          hell, as in the following quotations:
          "Thou hast led captivity captive," Psalm 68:18.
          "O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction,"
          Hosea 13:14. "And for sin, condemned sin in the flesh," Romans 8:3.
          Here Paul plays the Law against the Law, as if to say:
          "The Law of Moses condemns me; but I have another law, the law of grace and liberty which condemns the accusing Law of Moses."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Paul does not only refer to the Ceremonial
          Law, but to the whole Law. We are not to think that the Law is wiped
          out. It stays. It continues to operate in the wicked. But a Christian
          is dead to the Law. For example, Christ by His resurrection became
          free from the grave, and yet the grave remains. Peter was delivered
          from prison, yet the prison remains. The Law is abolished as far as I
          am concerned, when it has driven me into the arms of Christ. Yet the
          Law continues to exist and to function. But it no longer exists for
          me.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 20.
          <em>I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live,
            but Christ lives in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I
            live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up
            for me.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Whenever remission of sins is freely
          proclaimed, people misinterpret it according to Romans 3:8,
          "Let us do evil, that good may come." As soon as people hear that we
          are not justified by the Law, they reason:
          "Why, then let us reject the Law. If grace abounds, where sin abounds, let us abound in sin, that grace may all the more abound."
          People who reason thus are reckless. They make sport of the Scriptures
          and slander the sayings of the Holy Ghost. These must be instructed as
          to why good works do not justify, and from what motives good works
          must be done. Good works are not the cause, but the fruit of
          righteousness. When we have become righteous, then first are we able
          and willing to do good. The tree makes the apple; the apple does not
          make the tree.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 21.
          <em>I don’t reject the grace of God. For if righteousness is through
            the law, then Christ died for nothing!”</em>
        </h2>
