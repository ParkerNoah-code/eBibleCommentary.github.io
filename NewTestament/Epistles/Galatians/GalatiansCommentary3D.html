      <h2>D. Bondage and Freedom (3:23-29)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 23. <em>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 24. <em>So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "For the God of the two Testaments is One, Who in the Old Testament foretold the Christ Who appeared in the New; Who by the Law and the Prophets led us to Christ's school. For before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, and, the law has been our tutor to bring us unto Christ. And if ever thou hear any of the heretics speaking evil of the Law or the Prophets, answer in the sound of the Saviour's voice, saying, Jesus came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it. Learn also diligently, and from the Church, what are the books of the Old Testament, and what those of the New. And, pray, read none of the apocryphal writings: for why do you, who know not those which are acknowledged among all, trouble yourself in vain about those which are disputed?" (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310104.htm" target="_blank"><span>Catechetical Lecture 4</span></a>, 33).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 25. <em>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John of Damascus writes, "Hail! O Christ, the Word and Wisdom and Power of God, and God omnipotent! What can we helpless ones give You in return for all these good gifts? For all are Yours, and Thou ask naught from us save our salvation, You Who Yourself art the Giver of this, and yet art grateful to those who receive it, through Your unspeakable goodness. Thanks be to You Who gave us life, and granted us the grace of a happy life, and restored us to that, when we had gone astray, through Your unspeakable condescension." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/33044.htm" target="_blank"><span>An Exposition of the Orthodox Faith</span></a>, Book 4, ch 4).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 26. <em>For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Gregory of Nazianzus writes, "[these are] our brothers in God, whether you like it or not; whose share in nature is the same as ours; who are formed of the same clay from the time of our first creation... more importantly, who have the same portion as the image of God just as we do and who keep it perhaps better, wasted though their bodies may be; whose inner nature has put on the same Christ and who have been entrusted with same <em>guarantee of the Spirit</em> as we... who are <em>fellow heirs</em> of the life in heaven... who are buried with Christ and raised with him, <em>provided</em> they <em>suffer with him in order that</em> they <em>may also be glorified with him</em>." (Select Orations, Oration 14, The Fathers of the Church: A New Translation, Vol 107, pg 49).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 27. <em>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Tertullian writes, "And so, according to the circumstances and disposition, and even age, of each individual, the delay of baptism is preferable; principally, however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary — if (baptism itself) is not so necessary — that the sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? Who both themselves, by reason of mortality, may fail to fulfil their promises, and may be disappointed by the development of an evil disposition, in those for whom they stood? The Lord does indeed say, Forbid them not to come unto me. Let them come, then, while they are growing up; let them come while they are learning, while they are learning whither to come; let them become Christians when they have become able to know Christ. Why does the innocent period of life hasten to the remission of sins? More caution will be exercised in worldly matters: so that one who is not trusted with earthly substance is trusted with divine! Let them know how to ask for salvation, that you may seem (at least) to have given to him that asks. For no less cause must the unwedded also be deferred — in whom the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in such as never were wedded by means of their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom — until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for continence. If any understand the weighty import of baptism, they will fear its reception more than its delay: sound faith is secure of salvation." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0321.htm" target="_blank"><span>On Baptism</span></a>, ch 18).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 28. <em>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 29. <em>If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise.</em></h2>
