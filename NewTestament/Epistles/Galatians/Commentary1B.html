        <h2>B. No Other Gospel (1:6-9)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 6.
          <em>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in
            the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>I wonder</em>. He commences by
          administering a rebuke, though a somewhat milder one than they
          deserved; but his greatest severity of language is directed, as we
          shall see, against the false apostles. He charges them with turning
          aside, not only from his gospel, but from Christ; for it was
          impossible for them to retain their attachment to Christ, without
          acknowledging that he has graciously delivered us from the bondage of
          the law. But such a belief cannot be reconciled with those notions
          respecting the obligation of ceremonial observance which the false
          apostles inculcated. They were <em>removed from</em> Christ; not that
          they entirely rejected Christianity, but that the corruption of their
          doctrines was such as to leave them nothing more than an imaginary
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>Thus, in our own times, the Papists, choosing
          to have a divided and mangled Christ, have none, and are therefore
          "removed from Christ." They are full of superstitions, which are
          directly at variance with the nature of Christ. Let it be carefully
          observed, that we are <em>removed from</em> Christ, when we fall into
          those views which are inconsistent with his mediatorial office; for
          light can have no fellowship with darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>On the same principle, he calls it
          <em>another gospel</em>, that is, a gospel different from the true
          one. And yet the false apostles professed that they preached the
          gospel of Christ; but, mingling with it their own inventions, by which
          its principal efficacy was destroyed, they held a false, corrupt, and
          spurious gospel. By using the present tense, ("ye are removed") he
          appears to say that they were only in the act of failing. As if he had
          said, "I do not yet say that ye have been removed; for then it would
          be more difficult to return to the right path. But now, at the
          critical moment, do not advance a single step, but instantly retreat."
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>From Christ, who called you by grace</em>.
          Others read it, "from
          him who called you by the grace of Christ," understanding it to refer
          to the Father; but the reading which we have followed is more simple.
          When he says that they were called by Christ through grace, this tends
          to heighten the criminality of their ingratitude. To revolt from the
          Son of God under any circumstances, is unworthy and disgraceful; but
          to revolt from him, after being invited to partake salvation by grace,
          is more eminently base. His goodness to us renders our ingratitude to
          him more dreadfully heinous.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>So soon</em>. When it is considered how
          <em>soon</em> they had discovered a want of steadfastness, their guilt
          is still further heightened. A proper season, indeed, for departing
          from Christ cannot be imagined. But the fact, that no sooner had Paul
          left them than the Galatians were led away from the truth, inferred
          still deeper blame. As the consideration of the grace by which they
          had been called was adduced to aggravate their ingratitude, so the
          circumstance of the time when they were removed is now adduced to
          aggravate their levity.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 7.
          <em>but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who
            trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>Which is not another thing</em>. Some
          explain it thus, "though there is not another gospel;" as if it were a
          sort of correction of the Apostle's language, to guard against the
          supposition that there were more gospels than one. So far as the
          explanation of the words is concerned, I take a more simple view of
          them; for he speaks contemptuously of the doctrine of the false
          apostles, as being nothing else than a mass of confusion and
          destruction. As if he had said, "What do those persons allege? On what
          grounds do they attack the doctrine which I have delivered? They
          merely trouble you, and subvert the gospel. They do nothing more." But
          it amounts to the same meaning; for this, too, I acknowledge, is a
          correction of the language he had used about <em>another gospel</em>.
          He declares that it is not a gospel, but a mere disturbance. All I
          intended to say was, that, in my opinion, the word
          <em>another</em> means another thing. It resembles strongly the
          expression in common use, "this amounts to nothing, but that you wish
          to deceive."
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>And wish to pervert</em>. He charges them
          with the additional crime of doing an injury to Christ, by endeavoring
          to subvert his gospel. Subversion is an enormous crime. It is worse
          than corruption. And with good reason does he fasten on them this
          charge. When the glow of justification is ascribed to another, and a
          snare is laid for the consciences of men, the Savior no longer
          occupies his place, and the doctrine of the gospel is utterly ruined.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>The gospel of Christ</em>. To know what
          are the leading points of the gospel, is a matter of unceasing
          importance. When these are attacked, the gospel is destroyed. When he
          adds the words, of Christ, this may be explained in two ways; either
          that it has come from Christ as its author, or that it purely exhibits
          Christ. The apostle's reason for employing that expression
          unquestionably was to describe the true and genuine gospel, which
          alone is worthy of the name.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 8.
          <em>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
            any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be
            cursed.</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>But though we</em>. As he proceeds in
          defending the authority of his doctrine, his confidence swells. First
          of all, he declares that the doctrine which he had preached is the
          only gospel, and that the attempt to set it aside is highly criminal.
          But then he was aware, the false apostles might object: "We will not
          yield to you in our desire to maintain the gospel, or in those
          feelings of respect for it which we are accustomed to cherish." Just
          as, at the present day, the Papists describe in the strongest terms
          the sacredness with which they regard the gospel, and kiss the very
          name with the deepest reverence, and yet, when brought to the trial,
          are found to persecute fiercely the pure and simple doctrine of the
          gospel. Accordingly, Paul does not rest satisfied with this general
          declaration, but proceeds to define what the gospel is, and what it
          contains, and declares boldly that his doctrine is the true gospel; so
          as to resist all further inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>Of what avail was it to profess respect for
          the gospel, and not to know what it meant? With Papists, who hold
          themselves bound to render implicit faith, that might be perfectly
          sufficient; but with Christians, where there is no knowledge, there is
          no faith. That the Galatians, who were otherwise disposed to obey the
          gospel, might not wander hither and thither, and "find no rest for the
          sole of their foot" (Genesis 8:9), Paul enjoins them to stand
          steadfastly by his doctrine. He demands such unhesitating belief of
          his preaching, that he pronounces a curse on all who dared to
          contradict it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>And here it is not a little remarkable, that
          he begins with himself; for thus he anticipates a slander with which
          his enemies would have loaded him. "You wish to have everything which
          comes from you received without hesitation, because it is your own."
          To show that there is no foundation for such a statement, he instantly
          surrenders the right of advancing anything against his own doctrine.
          He claims no superiority, in this respect, over other men, but justly
          demands from all, equally with himself, subjection to the word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>Or an angel from heaven</em>. In order to
          destroy more completely the pretensions of the false apostles, he
          rises so high as to speak of angels; and, on the supposition that they
          taught a different doctrine, he does not satisfy himself with saying
          that they were not entitled to be heard, but declares that they ought
          to be held accursed. Some may think, that it was absurd to engage in a
          controversy with angels about his doctrine; but a just view of the
          whole matter will enable any one to perceive, that this part of the
          apostle's proceedings was proper and necessary. It is impossible, no
          doubt, for angels from heaven to teach anything else than the certain
          truth of God. But when the credit due to doctrines which God had
          revealed concerning the salvation of men was the subject of
          controversy, he did not reckon it enough to disclaim the judgment of
          men, without declining, at the same time, the authority of angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>And thus, when he pronounces a curse on
          angels who should teach any other doctrine though his argument is
          derived from an impossibility, it is not superfluous. This exaggerated
          language must, have contributed greatly to strengthen the confidence
          in Paul's preaching. His opponents, by employing the lofty titles of
          men, attempted to press hard on him and on his doctrine. He meets them
          by the bold assertion, that even angels are unable to shake his
          authority. This is no disparagement to angels. To promote the glory of
          God by every possible means was the design of their creation. He who
          endeavors, in a pious manner, to accomplish this object, by an
          apparently desrespectful mention of their name, detracts nothing from
          their high rank. This language not only exhibits, in an impressive
          manner, the majesty of the word of God, but yields, also, a powerful
          confirmation to our faith while, in reliance on that word, we feel
          ourselves at liberty to treat even angels with defiance and scorn.
          When he says, "let him be accursed," the meaning must be, "let him be
          held by you as accursed." In expounding 1 Corinthians 12:3, we had
          occasion to speak of the word accursed. Here it denotes cursing.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 9.
          <em>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to
            you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be
            cursed.</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>Let him be cursed.</em> Paul repeats the
          curse, directing it now upon other persons. Before, he cursed himself,
          his brethren, and an angel from heaven. "Now," he says, "if there are
          any others who preach a gospel different from that you have received
          from us, let them also be accursed." Paul herewith curses and
          excommunicates all false teachers including his opponents. He is so
          worked up that he dares to curse all who pervert his Gospel. Would to
          God that this terrible pronouncement of the Apostle might strike fear
          into the hearts of all who pervert the Gospel of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>The Galatians might say: "Paul, we do not
          pervert the Gospel you have brought unto us. We did not quite
          understand it. That is all. Now these teachers who came after you have
          explained everything so beautifully." This explanation the Apostle
          refuses to accept. They must add nothing; they must correct nothing.
          "What you received from me is the genuine Gospel of God. Let it stand.
          If any man brings any other gospel than the one I brought you, or
          promises to deliver better things than you have received from me, let
          him be accursed."
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>In spite of this emphatic denunciation so
          many accept the pope as the supreme judge of the Scriptures. "The
          Church," they say, "chose only four gospels. The Church might have
          chosen more. Therefore the Church is above the Gospel." With equal
          force one might argue: "I approve the Scriptures. Therefore I am above
          the Scriptures. John the Baptist confessed Christ. Hence he is above
          Christ." Paul subordinates himself, all preachers, all the angels of
          heaven, everybody to the Sacred Scriptures. We are not the masters,
          judges, or arbiters, but witnesses, disciples, and confessors of the
          Scriptures, whether we be pope, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Paul, or
          an angel from heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>As we said before</em>. Observe the
          expression -- ye have received; for he uniformly insists, that they
          must not regard the gospel as something unknown, existing in the air,
          or in their own imaginations. He exhorts them to entertain a firm and
          serious conviction, that the doctrine which they had received and
          embraced is the true gospel of Christ. Nothing can be more
          inconsistent with the nature of faith than a feeble, wavering assent.
          What, then, must be the consequence, if ignorance of the nature and
          character of the gospel shall lead to hesitation? Accordingly he
          enjoins them to regard as devils those who shall dare to bring forward
          a gospel different from his, -- meaning by <em>another gospel</em>,
          one to which the inventions of other men are added; for the doctrine
          of the false apostles was not entirely contrary, or even different,
          from that of Paul, but corrupted by false additions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>To what poor subterfuges do the Papists
          resort, in order to escape from the Apostle's declaration! First, they
          tell us, that we have not in our possession the whole of Paul's
          preaching, and cannot know what it contained, unless the Galatians who
          heard it shall be raised from the dead, in order to appear as
          witnesses. Next, they assert, that it is not every kind of addition
          which is forbidden, but that other gospels only are condemned. What
          Paul's doctrine was, so far as it concerns us to know, may be learned
          with sufficient clearness from his writings. Of this gospel, it is
          plain, the whole of Popery is a dreadful perversion. And from the
          nature of the case, we remark in conclusion, it is manifest that any
          spurious doctrine whatever is at variance with Paul's preaching; so
          that these cavils will avail them nothing.
