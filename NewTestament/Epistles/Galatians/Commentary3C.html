      <h2>C. Law and Promise (3:15-22)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 15. <em>Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19a. <em>Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19b. <em>It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 20. <em>Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 21. <em>Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 22. <em>But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</em></h2>
