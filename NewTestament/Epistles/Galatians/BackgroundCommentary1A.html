        <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus
            Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. Elsewhere Paul draws a sharp distinction
          between an apostleship and lesser functions, as in I Corinthians
          12:28: "And God hath set some in the church; first, apostles;
          secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers." He mentions the apostles
          first because they were appointed directly by God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Not from men</em>. "As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted,
          the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
          whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and
          laid their hands on them, they sent them away." (Acts 13:2-3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthias was called in this manner. The apostles chose two candidates
          and then cast lots, praying that God would indicate which one He would
          have. To be an apostle he had to have his appointment from God. In the
          same manner Paul was called as the apostle of the Gentiles (Acts
          1:21-26).
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of
            Galatia:</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
            Christ,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 4.
          <em
            >who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this
            present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Who gave himself for our sins</em>. Hence we are not delivered by
          our own will, or shrewdness, or wisdom, but by the mercy and love of
          God, as it is written, I John 4:10, "Herein is love, not that we loved
          God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for
          our sins." Paul, like John, emphasizes the Father's will is Christ's
          habit of directing attention to the Father. For Christ came into the
          world to reconcile God with us and to draw us to the Father.
        </p>
