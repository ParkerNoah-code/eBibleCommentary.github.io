          <h1>A. Setup: Man's Gospel, Paul's Past (1:10-14)</h1>
          <h2>Ver 10. <em>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or
              am I striving to please men? For if I were
              still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "Vice mimics virtue, and the tares strive
            to be thought wheat, growing like the wheat
            in appearance, but being detected by good judges from the taste...
            We have need therefore of divine grace, and
            of a sober mind, and of eyes that see, lest from eating tares as
            wheat we suffer harm from ignorance, and lest
            from taking the wolf to be a sheep we become his prey... for, as the
            Scripture says, <em>he goes about as a
              roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour</em>... The Greeks on the
            one hand draw men away by their smooth
            tongue, <em>for honey drops from a harlot's lips</em> whereas they
            of the Circumcision deceive those who come to
            them by means of the Divine Scriptures, which they miserably
            misinterpret though studying them from childhood to
            old age, and growing old in ignorance. But the children of heretics,
            by their good words and smooth tongue,
            deceive the hearts of the innocent, disguising with the name of
            Christ as it were with honey the poisoned arrows
            of their impious doctrines: concerning all of whom together the Lord
            says, <em>Take heed lest any man mislead
              you</em>." (<a

          </p>

          <h2>Ver 11. <em>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good
              News which was preached by me, that it is
              not according to man.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Hippolytus writes, "There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of
            whom we gain from the Holy Scriptures, and
            from no other source. For just as a man, if he wishes to be skilled
            in the wisdom of this world, will find
            himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the
            dogmas of philosophers, so all of us who wish
            to practise piety will be unable to learn its practice from any
            other quarter than the oracles of God. Whatever
            things, then, the Holy Scriptures declare, at these let us took; and
            whatsoever things they teach, these let us
            learn; and as the Father wills our belief to be, let us believe; and
            as He wills the Son to be glorified, let us
            glorify Him; and as He wills the Holy Spirit to be bestowed, let us
            receive Him. Not according to our own will,
            nor according to our own mind, nor yet as using violently those
            things which are given by God, but even as He
            has chosen to teach them by the Holy Scriptures, so let us discern
            them." (<a

                Noetus</span></a>, 9)
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 12. <em>For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it,
              but it came to me through revelation of
              Jesus Christ.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Gregory of Nyssa writes, "Now they charge us with innovation, and
            frame their complaint against us in this way:—
            They allege that while we confess three Persons we say that there is
            one goodness, and one power, and one
            Godhead... But the ground of their complaint is that their custom
            does not admit this, and Scripture does not
            support it. What then is our reply? We do not think that it is right
            to make their prevailing custom the law and
            rule of sound doctrine. For if custom is to avail for proof of
            soundness, we too, surely, may advance our
            prevailing custom; and if they reject this, we are surely not bound
            to follow theirs. Let the inspired
            Scripture, then, be our umpire, and the vote of truth will surely be
            given to those whose dogmas are found to
            agree with the Divine words." (<a

            Thomas Aquinas, answering whether it must be said that the three
            persons are of one essence, raises and responds
            to an objection:
            "Objection 2. Further, nothing is to be affirmed of God except what
            can be confirmed by the authority of Holy
            Writ, as appears from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i). Now Holy Writ never
            says that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are
            of one essence. Therefore this should not be asserted.
            <br><span class="tab"></span>
            Reply to Objection 2. Although we may not find it declared in Holy
            Writ in so many words that the three persons
            are of one essence, nevertheless we find it so stated as regards the
            meaning; for instance, 'I and the Father
            are one (John 10:30),' and
            'I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 10:38)'; and there
            are many other
            texts of the same import." (<a

            John Calvin writes, "Paul testifies that the Church is
            'built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,'
            (Eph. 2:20). If the doctrine of the apostles and prophets is the
            foundation of the Church, the former must have
            had its certainty before the latter began to exist... How shall we
            be persuaded that it came from God without
            recurring to a decree of the Church? it is just the same as if it
            were asked, How shall we learn to distinguish
            light from darkness, white from black, sweet from bitter? Scripture
            bears upon the face of it as clear evidence
            of its truth, as white and black do of their colour, sweet and
            bitter of their taste." (<a

            Thomas Schreiner comments, "In seeing Jesus Christ he was also
            called to be an apostle (1 Cor 9:1-2; cf. also
            Acts 9:17, 27; 22:18)—an authoritative messenger of the crucified
            and risen Lord." (Galatians, ZECNT: Zondervan,
            2010).

          <h2>Ver 13. <em>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in
              the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure
              I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Theodoret writes, "Even the great teacher of the world who is wont
            to style himself last of saints and first of
            sinners, that he might stop the mouths of liars was compelled to set
            forth a list of his own labours; and in
            showing that this account of his sufferings was of necessity, not of
            free will, he added I have become a fool in
            glorying; you have compelled me. I own myself wretched — aye thrice
            wretched. I am guilty of many errors.
            Through faith alone I look for finding some mercy in the day of the
            Lord's appearing." (<a

          </p>

          <h2>Ver 14. <em>I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own
              age among my countrymen, being more
              exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Dionysius of Alexandria writes, "And we abstained from defending in
            every manner and contentiously the opinions
            which we had once held, unless they appeared to be correct. Nor did
            we evade objections, but we endeavored as
            far as possible to hold to and confirm the things which lay before
            us, and if the reason given satisfied us, we
            were not ashamed to change our opinions and agree with others; but
            on the contrary, conscientiously and
            sincerely, and with hearts laid open before God, we accepted
            whatever was established by the proofs and
            teachings of the Holy Scriptures." (cited from Eusebius, <a
              href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xii.xxv.html"
              target="_blank"><span>Church

          </p>

          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Anselm of Canterbury writes, "For if at times we assert by a process
            of reasoning a conclusion which we cannot
            explicitly cite from the sayings of Scripture or demonstrate from
            the bare wording, still it is by using
            Scripture that we know in the following way whether the affirmation
            should be accepted or rejected. If the
            conclusion is reached by straightforward reasoning and Scripture in
            no way contradicts it, then by the very fact
            that it does not deny what is inferred on the basis of reason, that
            conclusion is accepted as authorized by
            Scripture. But if Scripture indubitably opposes our understanding,
            even though our reasoning appears to us to be
            impregnable, still it ought not to be believed to be substantiated
            by any truth at all. It is when Sacred
            Scripture either clearly affirms or in no wise denies it, that it
            gives support to the authority of any reasoned
            conclusion." (<a href="https://jasper-hopkins.info/DeConcordia.pdf"
