      <h2>B. Keep Watch and do Good (6:1-10)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, "And Isaac 'smelled the fragrance of his garments' [Gen. 27:27]. And perhaps that means that we are not justified by works but by faith, because the weakness of the flesh is a hindrance to works but the brightness of faith puts the error that is in man’s deeds in the shadow and merits for him the forgiveness of his sins." (Jacob and the Happy Life, II:9, pp. 150-51).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <em>But let each man examine his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone else.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Bernard writes, " 'Our glory,' says the great Apostle, 'is this, the testimony of our conscience' (2 Cor. ii. I2). Not such testimony as the proud Pharisee obtained, for although his deceived and deceiving conscience gave testimony to him, we know that testimony was not true (Luke xviii, II, I2, John xix. 35); but the testimony which 'the Spirit Himself giveth to our spirit' (Rom viii. I6)—it is in this testimony we place our glory. Now it seems to me that this divine testimony consists in three convictions. For we ought to believe, in the first place, that we cannot obtain the pardon of our sins otherwise than through the mercy of God; secondly, that we are powerless to do any good work whatever except by His grace; thirdly, that by no works of ours can we merit eternal life, unless it is His good pleasure to bestow upon us this also as a free gift." (First Sermon for the Feast of the Annunciation, para 1).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <em>For each man will bear his own burden.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Bernard writes, "Sorrow for sin is indeed necessary, but it should not be an endless preoccupation. You must dwell also on the glad remembrance of God's loving- kindness, otherwise sadness will harden the heart and lead it more deeply into despair. Let us mix honey with our absinthe, it is more easily drunk when sweetened, and what bitterness it may still retain will be wholesome. You must fix your attention on the ways of God, see how he mitigates the bitterness of the heart that is crushed, how he wins back the pusillanimous soul from the abyss of despair, how he consoles the grief-stricken and strengthens the wavering with the sweet caress of his faithful promise." (On the Song of Songs, 11.2).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 10. <em>So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</em></h2>
