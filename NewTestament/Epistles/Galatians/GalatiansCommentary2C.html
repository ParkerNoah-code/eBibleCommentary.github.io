      <h2>C. Gospel: Apostolically Affirmed (2:1-10)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Calvin comments, "Fourteen years after. This cannot with certainty be affirmed to be the same journey mentioned by Luke. (Acts 15:2.) The connection of the history leads us rather to an opposite conclusion. We find that Paul performed four journeys to Jerusalem. Of the first we have already spoken. The second took place when, in company with Barnabas, he brought the charitable contributions of the Greek and Asiatic Churches. (Acts 15:25.) My belief that this second journey is referred to in the present passage rests on various grounds. On any other supposition, the statements of Paul and Luke cannot be reconciled. Besides, there is ground for conjecturing that the rebuke was administered to Peter at Antioch while Paul was residing there. Now, this happened before he was sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle the dispute which had arisen about ceremonial observances. (Acts 15:2.) It is not reasonable to suppose that Peter would have used such dissimulation, if that controversy had been settled and the decree of the Apostles published. But Paul writes that he came to Jerusalem, and afterwards adds that he had rebuked Peter for an act of dissimulation, an act which Peter certainly would not have committed except in matters that were doubtful." (<a href="http://www.biblestudyguide.org/ebooks/comment/calcom41.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        James Coffman comments, "Some scholars dogmatically assert that Paul's account of the 'council' here cannot be harmonized with Acts 15:1ff; but that is only because they fail to see that there were private discussions which took place before the public and more formal meeting later on." (<a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/bcc/galatians-2.html#verse-1" target="_blank"><span>Coffman's Commentaries on the Bible</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Johann Lange comments, "Had the idea been merely, that the circumcision was not even demanded, so strong a word would not have been used. There is some force in the suggestion of Lightfoot, that the Apostles recommended Paul to yield as a charitable concession, but convinced at length that he was right, they gave him their support. Still we have not sufficient knowledge of the circumstances to decide whether Paul cites this as an evidence of the Apostles’ agreement with him or of his firmness—in all probability it is both. Not even Titus, of whom as a Greek the false brethren made the demand, was required to submit—or whom as a Greek I would not allow to be circumcised, since this would have been a giving up of the whole matter. The preceding context suggests the former, the subsequent context the latter side of the occurrence. On the reasons for the non-circumcision of Titus, and the circumcision of Timothy (Acts 16:2)" (<a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/bcc/galatians-2.html#verse-1" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4-5. <em>This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage, to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Augustine writes, "Let us treat scripture like scripture, like God speaking; don't let's look there for man going wrong. It is not for nothing, you see, that the canon has been established for the Church. This is the function of the Holy Spirit. So if anybody reads my book, let him pass judgment on me. If I have said something reasonable, let him follow, not me, but reason itself; if I've proved it by the clearest divine testimony, let him follow, not me, but the divine scripture." (The Works of Saint Augustine, Newly Discovered Sermons, part 3, vol 11, Edmund Hill, Sermon 162C.15, Hyde Park: New City Press, 1997, pg 176).

        Martin Luther comments, "Now the true Gospel has it that we are justified by faith alone, without the deeds of the Law. The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but not without the deeds of the Law. The false apostles preached a conditional gospel. So do the papists. They admit that faith is the foundation of salvation. But they add the conditional clause that faith can save only when it is furnished with good works. This is wrong. The true Gospel declares that good works are the embellishment of faith, but that faith itself is the gift and work of God in our hearts. Faith is able to justify, because it apprehends Christ, the Redeemer." (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1549/1549-h/1549-h.htm#link2HCH0001" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>But from those who were reputed to be important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Martin Luther comments, "There must be people in high office, of course. But we are not to deify them. The governor, the mayor, the preacher, the teacher, the scholar, father, mother, are persons whom we are to love and revere, but not to the extent that we forget God. Least we attach too much importance to the person, God leaves with important persons offenses and sins, sometimes astounding shortcomings, to show us that there is a lot of difference between any person and God. David was a good king. But when the people began to think too well of him, down he fell into horrible sins, adultery and murder. Peter, excellent apostle that he was, denied Christ. Such examples of which the Scriptures are full, ought to warn us not to repose our trust in men. In the papacy appearance counts for everything. Indeed, the whole papacy amounts to nothing more than a mere kowtowing of persons and outward mummery. But God alone is to be feared and honored.
      <br><span class="tab"></span>
        I would honor the Pope, I would love his person, if he would leave my conscience alone, and not compel me to sin against God. But the Pope wants to be adored himself, and that cannot be done without offending God. Since we must choose between one or the other, let us choose God. The truth is we are commissioned by God to resist the Pope, for it is written, "We ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29). We have seen how Paul refutes the argument of the false apostles concerning the authority of the apostles. In order that the truth of the Gospel may continue; in order that the Word of God and the righteousness of faith may be kept pure and undefiled, let the apostles, let an angel from heaven, let Peter, let Paul, let them all perish." (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1549/1549-h/1549-h.htm#link2HCH0001" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcised—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Chrysostom comments, "Which is in effect to say, I accuse not, nor traduce those holy men; they know what it is they have done; to God must they render their account. What I am desirous to prove is, that they neither reversed nor corrected my procedure, nor added to it as in their opinion defective, but gave it their approbation and assent; and to this Titus and Barnabas bear witness. Then he adds, The Circumcision and Uncircumcision; meaning, not the things themselves, but the nations known by these distinctions;" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentary00newmuoft/page/n49/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with the circumcised also worked through me with the Gentiles—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Irenaeus writes, "With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege that Paul alone knew the truth, and that to him the mystery was manifested by revelation, let Paul himself convict them, when he says, that one and the same God wrought in Peter for the apostolate of the circumcision, and in himself for the Gentiles. [Galatians 2:8] Peter, therefore, was an apostle of that very God whose was also Paul; and Him whom Peter preached as God among those of the circumcision, and likewise the Son of God, did Paul [declare] also among the Gentiles." (<a href="https://archive.org/details/SaintIrenaeusAgainstHeresiesComplete/page/n167/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Against Heresies</span></a>, 3.13.1).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those who were reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 10. <em>They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I was also zealous to do.</em></h2>
