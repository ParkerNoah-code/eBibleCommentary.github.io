      <h2>C. Gospel: Apostolically Affirmed (2:1-10)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4-5. <em>This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage, to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Martin Luther comments, "Now the true Gospel has it that we are justified by faith alone, without the deeds of the Law. The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but not without the deeds of the Law. The false apostles preached a conditional gospel.
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        So do the papists. They admit that faith is the foundation of salvation. But they add the conditional clause that faith can save only when it is furnished with good works. This is wrong. The true Gospel declares that good works are the embellishment of faith, but that faith itself is the gift and work of God in our hearts. Faith is able to justify, because it apprehends Christ, the Redeemer." Martin Luther, Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians.

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>But from those who were reputed to be important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcised—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with the circumcised also worked through me with the Gentiles—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those who were reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 10. <em>They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I was also zealous to do.</em></h2>
