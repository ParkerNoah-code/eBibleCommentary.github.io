      <h2>C. Final Warning and Benediction (6:11-18)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 11. <em>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 12. <em>As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 13. <em>For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 14. <em>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Augustine writes, "This, the catholic faith has known of the one and only mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who condescended to undergo death — that is, the penalty of sin— without sin, for us. As He alone became the Son of man, in order that we might become through Him sons of God, so He alone, on our behalf, undertook punishment without ill deservings, that we through Him might obtain grace without good deservings. Because as to us nothing good was due so to Him nothing bad was due. Therefore, commending His love to them to whom He was about to give undeserved life, He was willing to suffer for them an undeserved death." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15094.htm" target="_blank"><span>Against Two Letters of the Pelagians</span></a>, Book IV. 6).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 15. <em>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, "Not that any man has been thought worthy of the privilege of sitting in that seat of God, for to the Son alone hath the Father said, <em>Sit thou on my right hand</em>; but because in that Flesh of Christ the flesh of the whole human race has been honoured, because it partakes of the same nature. For as He was subjected in our flesh by His unity therewith, and by the obedience of the body, wherein He was made obedient even unto death, so we, in His Flesh, are <em>sat down together with Him in heavenly places</em>. We therefore are not set down by ourselves but in the Person of Christ, Who alone, as the Son of man, sitteth at the right Hand of God; as He said Himself, <em>Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of God</em>. To this end has His Grace and Goodness been formed upon us in Christ Jesus, that being dead according to works, redeemed through faith and saved by grace, we might receive the gift of this great deliverance. Our very nature, raised, as it were, in Him, has been made partaker of the Grace of a new creation, that being new created in Christ, we, who had before fallen away through the corruption of our guilty lineage, might walk in good works." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_08_letters71_80.htm" target="_blank"><span>Ambrose to Irenaeus</span></a>, Letter LXXVI, 8).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</em></h2>
