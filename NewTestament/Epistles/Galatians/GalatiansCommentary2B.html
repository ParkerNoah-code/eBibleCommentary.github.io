      <h2>B. Calling: Proved by Independence (1:15-24)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 15. <em>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Polycarp writes, "the strong root of your faith, spoken of in days long gone by, endures even until now, and brings forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] 'whom God raised from the dead, having loosed the bands of the grave'. 'In whom, though now you see Him not, you believe, and believing, rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory'; into which joy many desire to enter, knowing that 'by grace you are saved, not of works', but by the will of God through Jesus Christ." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0136.htm" target="_blank"><span>Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians</span></a>, Ch 1).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Adam Clarke comments, "The aim of the apostle is to show that he had his call so immediately and pointedly from God himself, that he had no need of the concurrence even of the apostles, being appointed by the same authority, and fitted to the work by the same grace and Spirit, as they were." (<a href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/acc/galatians-1.html#verse-1" target="_blank"><span>The Adam Clarke Commentary</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Tertullian writes, "But the fact is, having been converted from a persecutor to a preacher, he is introduced as one of the brethren to brethren, by brethren — to them, indeed, by men who had put on faith from the apostles' hands. Afterwards, as he himself narrates, he 'went up to Jerusalem for the purpose of seeing Peter,' [Galatians 1:18] because of his office, no doubt, and by right of a common belief and preaching." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm" target="_blank"><span>Prescription Against Heretics</span></a>, 23).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19. <em>But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 20. <em>Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I’m not lying.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 21. <em>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 22-23. <em>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 24. <em>So they glorified God in me.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Cyprian of Carthage writes, "Do you entreat for your sins, although it be in the very end of life, and at the setting of the sun of time; and implore God, who is the one and true God, in confession and faith of acknowledgment of Him, and pardon is granted to the man who confesses, and saving mercy is given from the divine goodness to the believer, and a passage is opened to immortality even in death itself. This grace Christ bestows; this gift of His mercy He confers upon us, by overcoming death in the trophy of the cross, by redeeming the believer with the price of His blood, by reconciling man to God the Father, by quickening our mortal nature with a heavenly regeneration." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050705.htm" target="_blank"><span>Treatise</span></a>, 5.25).
