        <h2>E. Justification by Faith Alone (2:15-21)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 15. <em>“We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>He is
          now proceeding to the second part of his speech, which commences with
          an anticipation. The Gentiles differed from them in this respect, that
          they were "unholy and profane," (1 Tim 1:9); while the Jews, being
          holy, so far as God had chosen them for his people, might contend for
          this superiority. Skillfully anticipating the objection, Paul turns it
          to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves, with all their
          advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ,
          how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for
          salvation through faith? Paul's meaning therefore is:
          "We, who appear to excel others, -- we, who, by means of the covenant, have always enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God, (Deut 4:7), have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles? For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those who observed its enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous to us to whom it was given; but if we relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less ought compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>We who are Jews by nature</em>. The
          first
          thing to be noticed is, that we must seek justification by the faith
          of Christ, because we cannot be justified by works. Now, the question
          is, what is meant by <em>the works of the law</em>? The Papists,
          misled by
          Origen and Jerome, are of opinion, and lay it down as certain, that
          the dispute relates to shadows; and accordingly assert, that by
          "the works of the law" are meant ceremonies. As if Paul were not
          reasoning about the free justification which is bestowed on us by
          Christ. For they see no absurdity in maintaining that
          "no man is justified by the works of the law," and yet that, by the
          merit of works, we are accounted righteous in the sight of God. In
          short, they hold that no mention is here made of the works of the
          moral law. But the context clearly proves that the moral law is also
          comprehended in these words; for almost everything which Paul
          afterwards advances belongs more properly to the moral than to the
          ceremonial law; and he is continually employed in contrasting the
          righteousness of the law with the free acceptance which God is pleased
          to bestow.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>The word <em>sinner</em>, signifies here, as
          in many
          other places, a "profane person" (Heb 12:16), or one who is lost
          and alienated from God. Such were the Gentiles, who had no intercourse
          with God; while the Jews were, by adoption, the children of God, and
          therefore set apart to holiness. By nature, does not mean that they
          were naturally free from the corruption of the human race; for David,
          who was a descendant of Abraham, acknowledges,
          "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me"
          (Ps 51:5), but the corruption of nature, to which they were liable,
          had been met by the remedy of sanctifying grace. Now, as the promise
          made the blessing hereditary, so this benefit is called natural; just
          as, in the Epistle to the Romans, he says, that they were sprung from
          a "holy root" (Rom 11:16).</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 16.
          <em>yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law
            but
            through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus,
            that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works
            of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the
            law.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>The works of the law</em>. It is
          objected by our opponents, that the
          term "works" must have been employed without any addition, if Paul had
          not intended to limit it to a particular class. But I reply, there is
          the best of all reasons for this mode of expression; for, though a man
          were to excel all the angels in holiness, no reward is due to works,
          but on the footing of a Divine promise. Perfect obedience to the law
          is righteousness, and has a promise of eternal life annexed to it; but
          it derives this character from God, who declares that
          "they who have fulfilled them shall live." (Lev 18:5). On this point
          we shall afterwards treat more fully in its own place. Besides, the
          controversy with the Jews was about the law. Paul, therefore, chose
          rather to bring the matter to an issue, by meeting them at once on
          their own ground, than to adopt a more circuitous route, which might
          wear the aspect of evading the subject, or distrusting his cause.
          Accordingly he resolves to have a close debate about the law.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Their second objection is, that the whole
          question raised was about ceremonies, which we readily allow. Why
          then, say they, would the apostle pass suddenly from a particular
          department to the whole subject? This was the sole cause of the
          mistake into which Origen and Jerome were betrayed; for they did not
          think it natural that, while the false apostles were contending about
          ceremonies alone, Paul should take in a larger field. But they did not
          consider that the very reason for disputing so keenly was, that the
          doctrine led to more serious consequences than at first view appeared.
          It would not have given so much uneasiness to Paul that ceremonies
          should be observed, as that the confident hope and the glory of
          salvation should be made to rest on works; just as, in the dispute
          about forbidding flesh on certain days, we do not look so much to the
          importance of the prohibition itself, as to the snare which is laid
          for the consciences of men. Paul, therefore, does not wander from the
          subject, when he enters into a controversy about the whole law,
          although the arguments of the false apostles were confined wholly to
          ceremonies. Their object in pressing ceremonies was, that men might
          seek salvation by obedience to the law, which, they falsely
          maintained, was meritorious; and accordingly, Paul meets them, not
          with the moral law, but with the grace of Christ alone. And yet this
          extended discussion does not occupy the whole of the Epistle; he comes
          at length to the specific question of ceremonies: but as the most
          serious difficulty was, whether justification is to be obtained by
          works or by faith, it was proper that this should be first settled. As
          the Papists of the present day are uneasy when we extort from them the
          acknowledgment that men are justified by faith alone, they reluctantly
          admit that "the works of the law" include those of a moral nature.
          Many of them, however, by quoting Jerome's gloss, imagine that they
          have made a good defense; but the context will show that the words
          relate also to the moral law.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>But
            through faith in Jesus Christ</em>. He does not merely state that
          ceremonies, or works of any kind, are insufficient without the
          assistance of faith, but meets their denial by a statement admitting
          of no exception, as if he had said,
          "Not by works, but by the Gift of Christ alone." In any other point of
          view, the sentiment would have been trivial and foreign to the
          purpose; for the false apostles did not reject Christ nor faith, but
          demanded that ceremonies should be joined with them. If Paul had
          admitted this claim, they would have been perfectly at one, and he
          would have been under no necessity to agitate the church by this
          unpleasant debate. Let it therefore remain settled, that the
          proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception,
          "that we are justified in no other way than by faith," or,
          "that we are not justified but by faith," or, which amounts to the
          same thing, "that we are justified by faith alone."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Hence it appears with what silly trifling
          the Papists of our day dispute with us about the word, as if it had
          been a word of our contrivance. But Paul was unacquainted with the
          theology of the Papists, who declare that a man is justified by faith,
          and yet make a part of justification to consist in works. Of such
          half-justification Paul knew nothing. For, when he instructs us that
          we are justified by faith, because we cannot be justified by works, he
          takes for granted what is true, that we cannot be justified through
          the righteousness of Christ, unless we are poor and destitute of a
          righteousness of our own. Consequently, either nothing or all must be
          ascribed to faith or to works. As to the word justification, and the
          manner in which faith is the cause of it, we shall afterwards see.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>No flesh will be justified by the works
            of the law</em>. He had already appealed to the consciences of Peter
          and
          others, and now confirms it more fully by affirming that such is the
          actual truth, that by the works of the law no mortal will obtain
          justification. This is the foundation of a freely bestowed
          righteousness, when we are stripped of a righteousness of our own.
          Besides, when he asserts that no mortal is justified by the
          righteousness of the law, the assertion amounts to this, that from
          such a mode of justification all mortals are excluded, and that none
          can possibly reach it.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 17.
          <em>But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves
            also
            were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>"What are these false apostles doing?" Paul
          cries.
          "They are turning Law into grace, and grace into Law. They are changing Moses into Christ, and Christ into Moses. By teaching that besides Christ and His righteousness the performance of the Law is necessary unto salvation, they put the Law in the place of Christ, they attribute to the Law the power to save, a power that belongs to Christ only."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>The papists quote the words of Christ:
          "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (Mat 19:17).
          With His own words they deny Christ and abolish faith in Him. Christ
          is made to lose His good name, His office, and His glory, and is
          demoted to the status of a law enforcer, reproving, terrifying, and
          chasing poor sinners around. The proper office of Christ is to raise
          the sinner, and extricate him from his sins.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>Is Christ a servant of sin</em>? Either
          we are not justified by Christ, or we are not justified by the Law.
          The fact is, we are justified by Christ. Hence, we are not justified
          by the Law. If we observe the Law in order to be justified, or after
          having been justified by Christ, we think we must further be justified
          by the Law, we convert Christ into a legislator and a minister of sin.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>The purpose of the Law is to reveal sin.
          The Law requires perfect obedience. It condemns all who do not
          accomplish the will of God. But show me a person who is able to render
          perfect obedience. The Law cannot justify. It can only condemn
          according to the passage:
          "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
          If the Law is the minister of
          sin, it is at the same time the minister of wrath and death. As the
          Law reveals sin it fills a person with the fear of death and
          condemnation. Eventually the conscience wakes up to the fact that God
          is angry. If God is angry with you, He will destroy and condemn you
          forever.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>All who say that faith alone in Christ does
          not justify a person, convert Christ into a minister of sin, a teacher
          of the Law, and a cruel tyrant who requires the impossible. All
          merit-seekers take Christ for a new lawgiver.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>Far from it</em>. He properly rejects
          that inference. Christ, who discovers the sin which lay concealed, is
          not therefore the minister of sin; as if, by depriving us of
          righteousness, he opened the gate to sin, or strengthened its
          dominion. The Jews were mistaken in claiming any holiness for
          themselves apart from Christ, while they had none. Hence arose the
          complaint:
          "Did Christ come to take from us the righteousness of the law, to change saints into polluted men, to subject us to sin and guilt?"
          Paul denies it, and repels the blasphemy with abhorrence. Christ did
          not bring sin, but unveiled it; he did not take away righteousness,
          but stripped the Jews of a false disguise.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 18.
          <em>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove
            myself a law-breaker.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>For if I build up again.</em>
          "By the ministry of the Gospel I have destroyed sin, heaviness of heart, wrath, and death. I have abolished the Law, so that it should not bother your conscience any more. Should I now once again establish the Law, and set up the rule of Moses? This is exactly what I should be doing, if I would urge circumcision and the performance of the Law as necessary unto salvation. Instead of righteousness and life, I would restore sin and death."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>By the grace of God we know that we are
          justified through faith in Christ alone. We do not mingle law and
          grace, faith and works. We keep them far apart. Let every true
          Christian mark the distinction between law and grace, and mark it
          well.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>We conclude with Paul, that we are justified
          by faith in Christ, without the Law. Once a person has been justified
          by Christ, he will not be unproductive of good, but as a good tree he
          will bring forth good fruit. A believer has the Holy Spirit, and the
          Holy Spirit will not permit a person to remain idle, but will put him
          to work and stir him up to the love of God, to patient suffering in
          affliction, to prayer, thanksgiving, to the habit of charity towards
          all men.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 19.
          <em>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to
            God.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>For I through the law</em>. Now follows
          the direct reply, that we must not ascribe to Christ that work which
          properly belongs to the law. It was not necessary that Christ should
          destroy the righteousness of the law, for the law itself slays its
          disciples. As if he had said,
          "You deceive wretched men by the false notion, that they must live by the law; and, under that pretext, you keep them in the law. And yet you bring it as a charge against the Gospel, that it annihilates the righteousness which we have by the law. But it is the law which forces us to die to itself; for it threatens our destruction, leaves us nothing but despair, and thus drives us away from trusting to the law."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>Died to the law</em>. To be dead to the
          Law means to be free of the Law. The law allures us
          all to destruction, and we find in it no life. It is not to Christ, he
          tells us, that it is owing that the law is more hurtful than
          beneficial; but the law carries within itself the curse which slays
          us. Hence it follows, that the death which is brought on by the law is
          truly deadly. With this is contrasted another kind of death, in the
          life-giving fellowship of the cross of Christ. He says, that he is
          crucified together with Christ, that he might live unto God.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Blessed is the person who knows how to use
          this truth in times of distress. He can talk. He can say:
          "Mr. Law, go ahead and accuse me as much as you like. I know I have committed many sins, and I continue to sin daily. But that does not bother me. You have got to shout louder, Mr. Law. I am deaf, you know. Talk as much as you like, I am dead to you. If you want to talk to me about my sins, go and talk to my flesh. Belabor that, but don't talk to my conscience. My conscience is a lady and a queen, and has nothing to do with the likes of you, because my conscience lives to Christ under another law, a new and better law, the law of grace."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>That I might live to God</em>. He
          declares that we are
          dead to the law, not by any means that we may live to sin, but that we
          may live to God. To live to God, sometimes means to regulate our life
          according to his will, so as to study nothing else in our whole life
          but to gain his approbation; but here it means to live, if we may be
          allowed the expression, the life of God. In this way the various
          points of the contrast are preserved; for in whatever sense we are
          said to die to sin, in the same sense do we live to God. In short,
          Paul informs us that this death is not mortal, but is the cause of a
          better life; because God snatches us from the shipwreck of the law,
          and by his grace raises us up to another life.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 20.
          <em>I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live,
            but Christ lives in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I
            live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up
            for me.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>I have been crucified with Christ</em>.
          Paul does not here speak of crucifying the flesh, but he speaks of
          that higher crucifying wherein sin, devil, and death are crucified in
          Christ and in me. By my faith in Christ I am crucified with Christ.
          Hence these evils are crucified and dead unto me. We are delivered
          from the yoke of the law, only by becoming one with Christ, as the
          twig draws its sap from the root, only by growing into one nature.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>It is no longer I who live</em>. True
          Christian righteousness is the righteousness of Christ who lives in
          us. We must look away from our own person, so that we can see nothing
          else but Christ crucified
          and raised from the dead to save us. If I keep on looking at myself, I
          am
          gone. Being crucified
          with Christ and dead unto
          the Law, I may now rise unto a new and better life.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>Christ lives in me</em>.
          This explains what he meant by "living to God." He does not live by
          his own life, but is animated by the power of Christ; so that
          Christ may be said to live in him; for, as the soul enlivens
          the body, so Christ imparts life to his members. It is a remarkable
          sentiment, that believers live out of themselves, that is, they live
          in Christ; which can only be accomplished by holding real and actual
          communication with him. Christ lives in us, making us partakers of his
          righteousness; so that, while
          we can do nothing of ourselves, we are accepted in the sight of God.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>That life which I now live in the flesh,
            I live by faith in the Son of God</em>.
          "I live by the faith of the Son of God," he says.
          "My speech is no longer directed by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. My sight is no longer governed by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. My hearing is no longer determined by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. I cannot teach, write, pray, or give thanks without the instrumentality of the flesh; yet these activities do not proceed from the flesh, but from God."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>A Christian uses earthly means like any
          unbeliever. Outwardly they look alike. Nevertheless there is a great
          difference between them. I may live in the flesh, but I do not live
          after the flesh. I do my living now "by faith in the Son of God."
          Paul had the same voice, the same tongue, before and after his
          conversion. Before his conversion his tongue uttered blasphemies. But
          after his conversion his tongue spoke a spiritual, heavenly language.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>We may now understand how spiritual life
          originates. It enters the heart by faith. Christ reigns in the heart
          with His Holy Spirit, who sees, hears, speaks, works, suffers, and
          does all things in and through us over the protest and the resistance
          of the flesh.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>Who loved me</em>. This is added to
          express the power of faith. But where does faith derive such power as
          to convey into our souls the life of Christ? He accordingly informs
          us, that the love of Christ, and his death, are the objects on which
          faith rests; for it is in this manner that the effect of faith must be
          judged. How comes it that we live by the faith of Christ? Because
          "he loved us, and gave himself for us." The love of Christ led him to
          unite himself to us, and he completed the union by his death. By
          giving himself for us, he suffered in our own person; as, on the other
          hand, faith makes us partakers of every thing which it finds in
          Christ.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins"
          (1 Jn 4:1). For if any merit of ours had moved him to redeem us, this
          reason would have been stated; but now Paul ascribes the whole to
          love: it is therefore of free grace. Let us observe the order:
          "He loved us, and gave himself for us." As if he had said,
          "He had no other reason for dying, but because he loved us," and that
          "while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son"
          (Rom 5:10).</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>And gave himself for me</em>. Let us
          count the price. When you hear that such an enormous price was paid
          for you, will you still come along with your cowl, your shaven pate,
          your chastity, your obedience, your poverty, your works, your merits?
          What do you want with all these trappings? What good are the works of
          all men, and all the pains of the martyrs, in comparison with the
          pains of the Son of God dying on the Cross, so that there was not a
          drop of His precious blood, but it was all shed for your sins. If you
          could properly evaluate this incomparable price, you would throw all
          your ceremonies, vows, works, and merits into the ash can. What awful
          presumption to imagine that there is any work good enough to pacify
          God, when to pacify God required the invaluable price of the death and
          blood of His own and only Son?</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 21.
          <em>I don’t reject the grace of God. For if righteousness is through
            the law, then Christ died for nothing!”</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>I don't reject the grace of God</em>.
          Paul is now getting ready for the second argument of his Epistle, to
          the effect that to seek justification by works of the Law, is to
          reject the grace of God. I ask you, what sin can be more horrible than
          to reject the grace of God, and to refuse the righteousness of Christ?
          It is bad enough that we are wicked sinners and transgressors of all
          the commandments of God; on top of that to refuse the grace of God and
          the remission of sins offered unto us by Christ, is the worst sin of
          all, the sin of sins. That is the limit. There is no sin which Paul
          and the other apostles detested more than when a person despises the
          grace of God in Christ Jesus. Still there is no sin more common. That
          is why Paul can get so angry, because it snubs
          Christ, rebuffs the grace of God, and refuses the merit of Christ.
          What else would you call it but spitting in Christ's face, pushing
          Christ to the side, usurping Christ's throne. By this abominable
          doctrine many have spoiled, darkened, and buried the benefit of
          Christ, and in place of the grace of Christ and His Kingdom, have
          established a doctrine of works and a kingdom of ceremonies.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>For if righteousness is through
            the law, then Christ died for nothing</em>! We will always affirm
          with Paul that either Christ died in vain, or else the Law cannot
          justify us. But Christ did not suffer and die in vain. Hence, the Law
          does not justify.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>If my salvation was so difficult to
          accomplish that it necessitated the death of Christ, then all my
          works, all the righteousness of the Law, are good for nothing. How can
          I buy for a penny what cost a million dollars? The Law is a penny's
          worth when you compare it with Christ. Should I be so stupid as to
          reject the righteousness of Christ which cost me nothing, and slave
          like a fool to achieve the righteousness of the Law which God
          disdains?</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>If we could produce a righteousness of our
          own, then Christ has suffered in vain; for the intention of his
          sufferings was to procure it for us, and what need was there that a
          work which we could accomplish for ourselves should be obtained from
          another? If the death of Christ be our redemption, then we were
          captives; if it be satisfaction, we were debtors; if it be atonement,
          we were guilty; if it be cleansing, we were unclean. On the contrary,
          he who ascribes to works his sanctification, pardon, atonement,
          righteousness, or deliverance, makes void the death of Christ.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Man's own righteousness is in the last
          analysis a despising and rejecting of the grace of God. No combination
          of words can do justice to such an outrage. It is an insult to say
          that any man died in vain. But to say that Christ died in vain is a
          deadly insult. To say that Christ died in vain is to make His
          resurrection, His victory, His glory, His kingdom, heaven, earth, God
          Himself, of no purpose and benefit whatever.</p>
