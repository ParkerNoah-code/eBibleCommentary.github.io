        <h2>E. Justification by Faith Alone (2:15-21)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 15. <em>“We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>He is
          now proceeding to the second part of his speech, which commences with
          an anticipation. The Gentiles differed from them in this respect, that
          they were "unholy and profane," (1 Tim 1:9); while the Jews, being
          holy, so far as God had chosen them for his people, might contend for
          this superiority. Skillfully anticipating the objection, Paul turns it
          to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves, with all their
          advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ,
          how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for
          salvation through faith? Paul's meaning therefore is:
          "We, who appear to excel others, -- we, who, by means of the covenant, have always enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God, (Deut 4:7), have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles? For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those who observed its enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous to us to whom it was given; but if we relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less ought compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>We who are Jews by nature</em>. The
          first
          thing to be noticed is, that we must seek justification by the faith
          of Christ, because we cannot be justified by works. Now, the question
          is, what is meant by <em>the works of the law</em>? The Papists,
          misled by
          Origen and Jerome, are of opinion, and lay it down as certain, that
          the dispute relates to shadows; and accordingly assert, that by
          "the works of the law" are meant ceremonies. As if Paul were not
          reasoning about the free justification which is bestowed on us by
          Christ. For they see no absurdity in maintaining that
          "no man is justified by the works of the law," and yet that, by the
          merit of works, we are accounted righteous in the sight of God. In
          short, they hold that no mention is here made of the works of the
          moral law. But the context clearly proves that the moral law is also
          comprehended in these words; for almost everything which Paul
          afterwards advances belongs more properly to the moral than to the
          ceremonial law; and he is continually employed in contrasting the
          righteousness of the law with the free acceptance which God is pleased
          to bestow.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>The word <em>sinner</em>, signifies here, as
          in many
          other places, a "profane person" (Heb 12:16), or one who is lost
          and alienated from God. Such were the Gentiles, who had no intercourse
          with God; while the Jews were, by adoption, the children of God, and
          therefore set apart to holiness. By nature, does not mean that they
          were naturally free from the corruption of the human race; for David,
          who was a descendant of Abraham, acknowledges,
          "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me"
          (Ps 51:5), but the corruption of nature, to which they were liable,
          had been met by the remedy of sanctifying grace. Now, as the promise
          made the blessing hereditary, so this benefit is called natural; just
          as, in the Epistle to the Romans, he says, that they were sprung from
          a "holy root" (Rom 11:16).</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 16.
          <em>yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law
            but
            through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus,
            that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works
            of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the
            law.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>The works of the law</em>. It is
          objected by our opponents, that the
          term "works" must have been employed without any addition, if Paul had
          not intended to limit it to a particular class. But I reply, there is
          the best of all reasons for this mode of expression; for, though a man
          were to excel all the angels in holiness, no reward is due to works,
          but on the footing of a Divine promise. Perfect obedience to the law
          is righteousness, and has a promise of eternal life annexed to it; but
          it derives this character from God, who declares that
          "they who have fulfilled them shall live." (Lev 18:5). On this point
          we shall afterwards treat more fully in its own place. Besides, the
          controversy with the Jews was about the law. Paul, therefore, chose
          rather to bring the matter to an issue, by meeting them at once on
          their own ground, than to adopt a more circuitous route, which might
          wear the aspect of evading the subject, or distrusting his cause.
          Accordingly he resolves to have a close debate about the law.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Their second objection is, that the whole
          question raised was about ceremonies, which we readily allow. Why
          then, say they, would the apostle pass suddenly from a particular
          department to the whole subject? This was the sole cause of the
          mistake into which Origen and Jerome were betrayed; for they did not
          think it natural that, while the false apostles were contending about
          ceremonies alone, Paul should take in a larger field. But they did not
          consider that the very reason for disputing so keenly was, that the
          doctrine led to more serious consequences than at first view appeared.
          It would not have given so much uneasiness to Paul that ceremonies
          should be observed, as that the confident hope and the glory of
          salvation should be made to rest on works; just as, in the dispute
          about forbidding flesh on certain days, we do not look so much to the
          importance of the prohibition itself, as to the snare which is laid
          for the consciences of men. Paul, therefore, does not wander from the
          subject, when he enters into a controversy about the whole law,
          although the arguments of the false apostles were confined wholly to
          ceremonies. Their object in pressing ceremonies was, that men might
          seek salvation by obedience to the law, which, they falsely
          maintained, was meritorious; and accordingly, Paul meets them, not
          with the moral law, but with the grace of Christ alone. And yet this
          extended discussion does not occupy the whole of the Epistle; he comes
          at length to the specific question of ceremonies: but as the most
          serious difficulty was, whether justification is to be obtained by
          works or by faith, it was proper that this should be first settled. As
          the Papists of the present day are uneasy when we extort from them the
          acknowledgment that men are justified by faith alone, they reluctantly
          admit that "the works of the law" include those of a moral nature.
          Many of them, however, by quoting Jerome's gloss, imagine that they
          have made a good defense; but the context will show that the words
          relate also to the moral law.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>But
            through faith in Jesus Christ</em>. He does not merely state that
          ceremonies, or works of any kind, are insufficient without the
          assistance of faith, but meets their denial by a statement admitting
          of no exception, as if he had said,
          "Not by works, but by the Gift of Christ alone." In any other point of
          view, the sentiment would have been trivial and foreign to the
          purpose; for the false apostles did not reject Christ nor faith, but
          demanded that ceremonies should be joined with them. If Paul had
          admitted this claim, they would have been perfectly at one, and he
          would have been under no necessity to agitate the church by this
          unpleasant debate. Let it therefore remain settled, that the
          proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception,
          "that we are justified in no other way than by faith," or,
          "that we are not justified but by faith," or, which amounts to the
          same thing, "that we are justified by faith alone."</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Hence it appears with what silly trifling
          the Papists of our day dispute with us about the word, as if it had
          been a word of our contrivance. But Paul was unacquainted with the
          theology of the Papists, who declare that a man is justified by faith,
          and yet make a part of justification to consist in works. Of such
          half-justification Paul knew nothing. For, when he instructs us that
          we are justified by faith, because we cannot be justified by works, he
          takes for granted what is true, that we cannot be justified through
          the righteousness of Christ, unless we are poor and destitute of a
          righteousness of our own. Consequently, either nothing or all must be
          ascribed to faith or to works. As to the word justification, and the
          manner in which faith is the cause of it, we shall afterwards see.</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span><em>No flesh will be justified by the works
            of the law</em>. He had already appealed to the consciences of Peter
          and
          others, and now confirms it more fully by affirming that such is the
          actual truth, that by the works of the law no mortal will obtain
          justification. This is the foundation of a freely bestowed
          righteousness, when we are stripped of a righteousness of our own.
          Besides, when he asserts that no mortal is justified by the
          righteousness of the law, the assertion amounts to this, that from
          such a mode of justification all mortals are excluded, and that none
          can possibly reach it.</p>

        <h2>
          Ver 17.
          <em>But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves
            also
            were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!</em>

        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 18.
          <em>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove
            myself a law-breaker.</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 19.

          <em>I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live,
            but Christ lives in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I
            live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up
            for me.</em>

        <h2>
          Ver 21.

            the law, then Christ died for nothing!”</em>
