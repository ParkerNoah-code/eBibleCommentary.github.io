        <h2>The Location of the Churches of Galatia</h2>
        <p>
          Among the Epistles of Paul this is the only one that is expressly
          addressed, not to an individual nor to a single church, but a group of
          churches, ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῆς Γαλατίας, Gal_1:2. When did the apostle
          found these Galatian churches? The answer to that question will
          necessarily depend on our interpretation of the term Galatia, as it is
          used by the apostle. There is a twofold use of this appellative, viz,
          the geographical and the political. Geographically the term Galatia
          denotes one of the Northern districts of Asia Minor, a district that
          was bounded on the North by Bithynia and Paplagonia, on the East by
          the last named province and Pontus, on the West by Phrygia, and on the
          South by Lycaonia and Cappadocia. The same name is employed in an
          official, political sense, however, to designate the Roman province
          which included Galatia proper, a part of Phrygia, Pisidia and
          Lycaonia. This twofold significance of the name Galatia has led to two
          theories respecting the location of the Galatian churches, viz, the
          North and the South Galatian theory. The former still represents the
          prevailing view; but the latter is accepted by an ever increasing
          number of scholars.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the North Galatian theory the churches of Galatia were
          situated in the geographical district indicated by that name. Since
          about 280 B. C. this territory was inhabited by a Celtic people,
          consisting of three separate tribes, that had migrated thither from
          Western Europe, and who constituted shortly before Christ the kingdom
          of Galatia. They were given to the worship of Cybele “with its wild
          ceremonial and hideous mutilations;” and were characterized by
          fickleness and great instability of character. “Inconstant and
          quarrelsome,” says Lightfoot, Corn. p. 14, “treacherous in their
          dealings, incapable of sustained effort, easily disheartened by
          failures, such they appear, when viewed on their darker side.” The
          adherents of this theory are generally agreed that Paul, in all
          probability, founded the Galatian churches in the most important
          cities of this district, i. e. in the capital Ancyra, in Pessinus, the
          principal seat of the hideous service of Cybele, and at Tavium. at
          once a strong fortress and a great commercial center. The South
          Galatian theory, on the other hand, identifies the Galatian churches
          with those founded by Paul on his first missionary journey at Pisidian
          Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe, not excluding any other churches
          that may have been founded in the province.
        </p>
        <p>
          The North Galatian theory is supported by the following
          considerations: (1) It is unlikely that Paul would address the
          inhabitants of Phrygia, Pisidia and Lycaonia as Galatians. That name
          could properly be given only to the Celts, the Gauls that lived in
          Galatia proper. (2) It is improbable that Paul would have referred to
          the churches founded by him and Barnabas jointly, as if they had been
          established by him alone. (3) The character of the Galatians, as it is
          reflected in this letter, is in remarkable agreement with that of the
          Celts whose changeableness was a subject of common comment. (4) Since
          in the Acts of the Apostles Mysia, Phrygia and Pisidia are all
          geographical terms, without any political significance, the inference
          seems perfectly warranted that the name Galatia, when it is found
          alongside of these, is employed in a similar sense. (5) “The
          expression used in the Acts of Pauls visit to these parts, ‘the
          Phrygian and Galatian country, shows that the district intended was
          not Lycaonia and Pisidia, but some region which might be said to
          belong either to Phrygia or Galatia, or the parts of each contiguous
          to the other.” (Lightfoot).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we are not inclined to underrate the value of these arguments, but
          yet it seems to us that they are not altogether conclusive. The first
          one impresses us as a rather gratuitous assumption. Taking in
          consideration that the Roman province of Galatia was organized as
          early as 25 B. C. (Cf. Ramsay, Historical Comm. on the Galatians, p.
          103 ff. and J. Weiss, Real-Enc. Art. Kleinasien), and had therefore
          existed at least 75 years, when Paul wrote this letter, it is hard to
          see, why he could not address its inhabitants as Galatians. This is
          true especially in view of the fact that the apostle shows a decided
          preference for the imperial nomenclature, probably since it was the
          most honorable. Moreover in writing to the congregations in South
          Galatia he could not very well use any other name, if he did not wish
          to address them in a very cumbrous way.—In connection with the second
          argument we must bear in mind that this Epistle was written after the
          rupture between Barnabas and Paul, when, so it seems; the labor was
          divided so that Paul received charge of the South Galatian churches.
          It was but natural therefore that he should feel the sole
          responsibility for them.—On the third argument Salmon, who also
          advocates the North Galatian theory, would wisely place little
          reliance, because “it may be doubted whether Celts formed the
          predominating element in the churches of Galatia,” and since “men of
          different nationalities show a common nature.” Introd. p. 412.—We do
          not feel the cogency of the fourth argument for, granted that Luke
          does use the term Galatia in its geographical sense, this does not
          prove anything as to Paul’s usage. In fact the presumption is that the
          apostle did not so use it.—And the last argument is of rather dubious
          value, since it rests on an uncertain interpretation of the
          expressions τὴν Φρυγίαν καὶ Γαλατικὴν, Act_16:1-40 :, and τὴν
          Γαλατικὴν Χώραν καὶ Φρυγίαν, Act_18:23. The expression in Act_16:6 can
          probably also be translated “the Phrygo-Galatic region,” referring to
          that part of the province Galatia that included Antioch and Iconium,
          and that originally belonged to Phrygia. In Act_18:23, however, where
          the names are reversed, we must translate, “the Galatic territory and
          Phrygia,” the last name then, according to Ramsay, referring to either
          Phrygia Galatica or Phrygia Magna. In any event it seems peculiar that
          Paul, if in these places he has reference to Galatia proper, should
          speak of the Galatian territory rather than of Galatia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The North Galatian theory is defended by Weiss, Davidson, Julicher,
          Godet and especially by Lightfoot. But the South Galatian theory also
          has able defenders, such as Renan, Hausrath, Zahn, Baljon and above
          all Ramsay, whose extended travels and research in Asia Minor,
          combined with great learning, enable him to speak with authority on
          questions pertaining to that district. This theory assumes that Paul
          used the name Galatia in its official political sense, and that the
          Galatian churches were those of Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Derbe,
          e. a. Although we do not feel inclined to speak dogmatically on the
          subject, it seems to us that this theory deserves preference for the
          following reasons: (1) It was evidently Paul’s uniform custom to
          denote the location of the churches which he founded, not by the
          popular but by the official nomenclature. Thus he speaks of the
          churches of Asia, 1Co_16:19; the churches of Macedonia, 2Co_8:1; and
          the churches of Achaia, 2Co_1:1. And that this was not something
          peculiar to Paul, is proved by the fact that Peter does the same in
          1Pe_1:1, where the term Galatia is obviously used in its political
          sense, since all the other names refer to Roman provinces. Even
          Light-foot admits that this is probably the case. (2) That Paul
          founded churches in the Roman province of Galatia is a well attested
          fact, of which we have a detailed narrative in Act_13:1-52,
          Act_14:1-28; on the other hand, we have no record whatever of his
          establishing churches in the district of that name. It is certainly
          not very obvious that Luke in Act_16:6 wants to convey the idea that
          the apostle established churches in North Galatia. The most that can
          be said, is that Act_18:23 implies such previous activity on the part
          of Paul; but even this depends on the correct interpretation of the
          phrase, “the country of Galatia and Phrygia.” Lightfoot himself
          regards it as “strange that, while we have more or less acquaintance
          with all the other important churches of St. Paul’s founding, not a
          single name of a person or place, scarcely a single incident of any
          kind, connected with the apostles preaching in Galatia, should be
          preserved either in the history or in the epistle.” Comm. p. 20. (3)
          The Epistle refers to the collection for the Judean saints, 2Co_2:10
          and in 1Co_16:1 Paul says that he commanded the churches in Galatia to
          take part in thIsa. What is the meaning of the term Galatia here? From
          the Epistles of Paul we gather that the churches of Galatia, 1Co_16:1,
          Macedonia, 2Co_8:1; 2Co_9:2; and Achaia, Rom_15:26, contributed for
          this cause; while from Act_20:4 we learn that representatives from
          Asia also accompanied Paul to Jerusalem, according to the principle
          laid down in 1Co_16:3-4. Now if we take the name Galatia in its
          official sense here, then all the churches founded by Paul are seen to
          participate in this work of charity; while if we interpret it as
          referring to North Galatia, the churches of Antioch, Iconium, Lystra
          and Derbe are not mentioned, and the impression is created that they
          did not take part. But this is exceedingly improbable, and the
          improbability is heightened by the fact that among the representatives
          accompanying Paul we also find Secundus and Gaius of Derbe and
          Timotheus of Lystra, while there are none to represent North Galatia.
          (4) From Gal_4:13 we learn that Paul first preached the gospel to the
          Galatians through infirmity of the flesh. This may mean that Paul,
          traveling through Galatia, was detained there by sickness, or that he
          repaired to this district, in order to recuperate from some disease.
          But the road through North Galatia did not lead to any place, where
          Paul was likely to go, and its climate was very undesirable for an
          invalid. On the other hand the supposition is altogether natural that
          the apostle contracted some disease in the marshy lowlands of
          Pamphylia, and therefore sought restoration in the bracing atmosphere
          of Pisidian Antioch. (5) In this Epistle Paul repeatedly mentions
          Barnabas as a person well known to the Gal_2:1; Gal_2:9; Gal_2:13. Now
          he was Pauls co-laborer in establishing the South Galatian churches,
          but did not accompany the apostle on his second missionary journey,
          when the churches of North Galatia are supposed to have been founded.
          It is true that this argument is somewhat neutralized by the fact that
          Barnabas is mentioned also in 1Co_9:6; yet this is not altogether the
          case, since the references in Galatians are more specific. In Gal_2:9,
          where Paul seeks to establish his apostleship, he also seems to
          consider it desirable to vindicate the legitimacy of Barnabas mission;
          while in Gal_2:13 he presupposes that his readers have knowledge of
          the stand taken by Barnabas with reference to the doctrine of free
          grace. We conclude, therefore, that the Galatian churches were in all
          probability those founded by Paul on his first missionary journey in
          South Galatia. Cf. especially Ramsay, The Church in the Roman Empire
          pp. 3-112; St. Paul the Traveler and the Roman Citizen pp. 89-151; and
          Zahns Einleitung II pp. 124-139.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galatian churches were mainly composed of Gentile-Christians, but
          also contained an important Jewish element. This can be inferred from
          the narrative in Act_13:52, Act_14:1-28. The Gentiles were eager to
          receive the truth, Act_13:42, Act_13:46-48; Act_14:1, while the Jews
          were very much divided, some believingly accepting the word of the
          apostles, Act_13:43; Act_14:1, and others rejecting it with scorn and
          maltreating the messengers of the cross, Act_13:45, Act_13:50;
          Act_14:2, Act_14:5, Act_14:19. The impression received from the
          narrative is corroborated by the Epistle, which in the main addresses
          itself to the Greeks who had not yet accepted circumcision, but had of
          late been urged to submit to this rite, if not to all the Jewish
          ceremonies, that they might share in the covenant blessings of
          Abraham. The apostle describes the whole congregation according to the
          majority of its members, when he says in Gal_4:8, “Howbeit then, when
          ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no
          gods.” Yet it is evident from Gal_3:23-25, Gal_3:28 that he also bears
          the Jewish element in mind. We need not doubt, however, that the
          majority of the Greeks that constituted the Galatian churches had
          already for some time attended the synagogue of the Jews before they
          were converted to Christianity, and therefore belonged to the
          proselytes, the so-called devout persons of whom Acts repeatedly
          speaks. This may be inferred from Act_13:43; Act_14:1, and from the
          fact that the apostle presupposes a certain familiarity in his readers
          with the patriarchal history, the Law, the Psalms and the Prophets.
