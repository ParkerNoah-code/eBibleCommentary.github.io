      <h2>F. How Can you Turn Back? (4:8-11)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 8. <em>However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, "Therefore if they dare not say He is God by appellation, and it is a mark of deep impiety to say He is a false god, it remains that He is true God, not unlike to the true Father, but equal to Him. And as He sanctifies and justifies whom He will, [Romans 9:18] not by assuming that power from without Himself, but having within Himself the power of sanctification, how is He not true God? For the Apostle called Him indeed true God, Who according to His nature was God, as it is written: 'Howbeit then, when you knew not God, you serviced unto them, who by nature were not gods;'[Galatians 4:8] that is, who could not be true gods, for this title by no means belonged to them by nature." (<a href="https://christiantruth.com/articles/apocrypha3/" target="_blank"><span>Exposition of the Christian Faith</span></a>, 5.1.26).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 10. <em>You observe days, months, seasons, and years.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 11. <em>I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Archelaus writes, "And, indeed, I do not make this statement on the bare authority of my own words, but I confirm it by the authority of that Scripture which has been our instructor. For the apostle addresses the following words to us: 'That you may be lights in this world, holding the word of life for my glory against the day of Christ, seeing that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain' [Phil 2:15-16]. For the meaning of this saying is, that our Lord Jesus Christ, when He comes, will see that his doctrine has proved profitable in us, and that, finding that he, the apostle, has not run in vain, neither laboured in vain, He will bestow on him the crown of recompense. And again, in the same epistle, he also warns us not to mind earthly things, and tells us that we ought to have our conversation in heaven; from which also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ." (<a href="https://christiantruth.com/articles/apocrypha3/" target="_blank"><span>Acts of the Disputation with Manes</span></a>, 38).
