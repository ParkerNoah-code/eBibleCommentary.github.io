          <h2>D. Authority: Properly Resists Peter (2:11-14)</h2>
          <h2>Ver 11. <em>But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his
              face, because he stood condemned.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Marius Victorinus comments, "Not only was my gospel approved, says
            Paul, on the part of the apostles who were in
            Jerusalem; not only was I charged to be mindful of the poor... but
            also I did not keep quiet about Peter's sin,
            he says... And if there were some sin in me, the congregation would
            in an equal manner be reprimanding me just
            as they did him." (<a
              href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment%28BookFi.org%29.pdf"
              target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>,
            translated by Stephen Cooper).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 12. <em>For before some people came from James, he ate with
              the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back
              and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</em></h2>
          <p>
            David DeSilva comments, "This is the 'truth of the gospel' that
            Peter will himself shortly violate as he draws
            back from this practice to honor, once again, the lines of purity
            that place gentiles on the outside rather than
            honoring the new lines of purity drawn by the Holy Spirit poured out
            on gentile Christian alongside Jewish
            Christians." (The Letter to the Galatians, NICNT: Eerdmans, 2018).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 13. <em>And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy,
              so that even Barnabas was carried away with
              their hypocrisy.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Siricius writes, "O miserable boldness, O craft of a desperate mind!
            Already was this unknown language of heresy
            spreading through the Church like a cancer, seeking to fill the
            breast, and plunge the whole man in destruction:
            and unless the Lord of Sabaoth had broken through the snare which
            they had laid, the public exhibition of so
            much evil and hypocrisy would have led to ruin the hearts of many
            simple ones, for the human mind is easily
            drawn aside towards evil, choosing rather to fly through open space,
            than to travel with pain along the narrow
            way...
            <p>
              And indeed from the times of the Apostles up to now we have heard
              and known by experience of many malignant
              heresies, but the sacred truth of the Church has never been
              assailed by the barking of such dogs as those who
              have now suddenly broken in upon us, with the doctrines of
              unbelief fully sprouted, enemies of the faith; who by
              the fruit of their works have betrayed whose disciples they are.
              For while other heretics misunderstanding
              single points have proposed to bear away and abstract from the
              Divine system of teaching, these men, <em>not
                having on a wedding garment</em>, wound the Catholics,
              perverting, as I have said, the continuity of the New
              and Old Testament, and interpreting it in a diabolical spirit,
              have by their alluring and false arguments
              already begun to ruin some Christians, and to make them associates
              of their madness, not keeping within
              themselves the poison of their iniquity: but some of their chosen
              ones have betrayed their blasphemies by
              writing a rash discourse, which the rage of a desperate mind has
              led them openly to publish, favouring, as it
              does, the cause of the Heathens." (<a
                href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm"
                target="_blank"><span>Siricius

            </p>

            <h2>Ver 14. <em>But when I saw that they didn’t walk uprightly
                according to the truth of the Good News, I said to
                Peter before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live as the
                Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you
                compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?</em></h2>
            <p>
              Jerome comments, "By specifying 'the traditions of my forefathers'
              rather than 'the commandments of the Lord,'
              he indicates that he was a Pharisee of Pharisees and that his zeal
              for God was not according to understanding.
              Down to the present day, those who interpret Scripture according
              to a Jewish mentality persecute the church of
              Christ and devastate it not out of zeal for the Law of God but
              because they have been corrupted by the
              traditions of men." (<a

              Richard Longnecker comments, "In attempting to be considerate of
              the Jerusalem church in its existence under
              zealot-nationalistic pressures, and so to preserve the integrity
              of the Jewish Christian mission, Cephas had
              acutally, even though inadvertently, destroyed the integrity of
              Gentile Christians." (Galatians, WEB: Zondervan,
              vol 41, 1990).
