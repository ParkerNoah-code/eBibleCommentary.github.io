      <h2>A. Spirit and Flesh (5:13-26)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 13. <em>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 14. <em>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Irenaeus writes, "And that not by the much-speaking of the law, but by the brevity of faith and love, men were to be saved, Isaiah says thus: <em>A word brief and short in righteousness: for a short word will God make in the whole world</em>. And therefore the apostle Paul says: <em>Love is the fulfilling of the law:</em> for he who loves God has fulfilled the law. Moreover the Lord, when He was asked which is the first commandment, said: <em>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy strength. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments</em>, He says, <em>all the law hangeth and the prophets</em>. So then by our faith in Him He has made our love to God and our neighbour to grow, making us godly and righteous and good. And therefore a <em>short word</em> has God made on the earth <em>in the world</em>." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/irenaeus_02_proof.htm#240" target="_blank"><span>The Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching</span></a>, 87).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 15. <em>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Fox writes, "Thus far our history of persecution has been confined principally to the pagan world. We come now to a period when persecution, under the guise of Christianity, committed more enormities than ever disgraced the annals of paganism. Disregarding the maxims and the spirit of the Gospel, the papal Church, arming herself with the power of the sword, vexed the Church of God and wasted it for several centuries, a period most appropriately termed in history, the 'dark ages'...
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Popery having brought various innovations into the Church, and overspread the Christian world with darkness and superstition, some few, who plainly perceived the pernicious tendency of such errors, determined to show the light of the Gospel in its real purity, and to disperse those clouds which artful priests had raised about it, in order to blind the people, and obscure its real brightness...
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Many persons of the reformed persuasion were, about this time, beaten, racked, scourged, and burnt to death, in several parts of France, but more particularly at Paris, Malda, and Limosin..." (<a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/f/foxe/martyrs/files/fox104.htm" target="_blank"><span>Fox's Book of Martyrs</span></a>, ch IV).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Augustine writes, "...if in the passage where it is asked, '<em>What do you have that you did not receive?</em>' the very will by which we believe is reckoned as a gift of God, because it arises out of the free will which we received at our creation. Let the objector, however, attentively observe that this will is to be ascribed to the divine gift, not merely because it arises from our free will, which was created naturally with us; but also because God acts upon us by the incentives of our perceptions, to will and to believe, either externally by evangelical exhortations, where even the commands of the law also do something, if they so far admonish a man of his infirmity that he betakes himself to the grace that justifies by believing; or internally, where no man has in his own control what shall enter into his thoughts, although it appertains to his own will to consent or to dissent." (<a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/f/foxe/martyrs/files/fox104.htm" target="_blank"><span>On the Spirit and the Letter</span></a>, ch 60).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19-21. <em>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 22-23. <em>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 24. <em>Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 25. <em>If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Anselm writes, "As all things were created through the supreme Being, so all live through it.
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        IT is certain, then, that through the supreme Nature whatever is not identical with it has been created. But no rational mind can doubt that all creatures live and continue to exist, so long as they do exist, by the sustenance afforded by that very Being through whose creative act they are endowed with the existence that they have. For, by a like course of reasoning to that by which it has been gathered that all existing beings exist through some one being, hence that being alone exists through itself, and others through another than themselves -- by a like course of reasoning, I say, it can be proved that whatever things live, live through some one being; hence that being alone lives through itself, and others through another than themselves.
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        But, since it cannot but be that those things which have been created live through another, and that by which they have been created lives through itself, necessarily, just as nothing has been created except through the creative, present Being, so nothing lives except through its preserving presence." (<a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/anselm-monologium.asp#CHAPTER%20XII" target="_blank"><span>Monologium</span></a>, ch XIII). 
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 26. <em>Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</em></h2>
