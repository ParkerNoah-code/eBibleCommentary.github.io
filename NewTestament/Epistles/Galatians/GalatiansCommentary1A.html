      <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "But He who descended into the regions beneath the earth came up again; and Jesus, who was buried, truly rose again the third day. And if the Jews ever worry thee, meet them at once by asking thus: Did Jonah come forth from the whale on the third day, and hath not Christ then risen from the earth on the third day? Is a dead man raised to life on touching the bones of Elisha, and is it not much easier for the Maker of mankind to be raised by the power of the Father? Well then, He truly rose, and after He had risen was seen again of the disciples; and twelve disciples were witnesses of His Resurrection, who bare witness not in pleasing words, but contended even unto torture and death for the truth of the Resurrection. What then, <em>shall every word be established at the mouth of two of three witnesses</em>, according to the Scripture, and, though twelve bear witness to the Resurrection of Christ, art thou still incredulous in regard to His Resurrection?" (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310104.htm" target="_blank"><span>Catechetical Lecture 4</span></a>, 12).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, "Not that any man has been thought worthy of the privilege of sitting in that seat of God, for to the Son alone hath the Father said, <em>Sit thou on my right hand</em>; but because in that Flesh of Christ the flesh of the whole human race has been honoured, because it partakes of the same nature. For as He was subjected in our flesh by His unity therewith, and by the obedience of the body, wherein He was made obedient even unto death, so we, in His Flesh, are <em>sat down together with Him in heavenly places</em>. We therefore are not set down by ourselves but in the Person of Christ, Who alone, as the Son of man, sitteth at the right Hand of God; as He said Himself, <em>Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of God</em>. To this end has His Grace and Goodness been formed upon us in Christ Jesus, that being dead according to works, redeemed through faith and saved by grace, we might receive the gift of this great deliverance. Our very nature, raised, as it were, in Him, has been made partaker of the Grace of a new creation, that being new created in Christ, we, who had before fallen away through the corruption of our guilty lineage, might walk in good works." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_08_letters71_80.htm" target="_blank"><span>Ambrose to Irenaeus, Greeting</span></a>, Letter LXXVI, 8).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, “Thus I do not have the wherewithal to enable me to glory in my own works, I do not have the wherewithal to boast of myself, and so I will glory in Christ. I will not glory because I have been redeemed. I will not glory because I am free of sins, but because sins have been forgiven me. I will not glory because I am profitable or because anyone is profitable to me, but because Christ is an advocate in my behalf with the Father, because the blood of Christ has been poured out in my behalf.” (<a href="https://www.angelfire.com/ny4/djw/ambrose.lawandgospel.html" target="_blank"><span>Jacob and the Happy Life</span></a>, I:17-18, The Fathers of the Church, Vol. 65, Washington: The Catholic University of America Press, 1972, pg. 131-32).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <em>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Chrysostom comments, "Thus it appears, that the ministry which He undertook was free and uncompelled; that He was delivered up by Himself, not by another. Let not therefore the words of John, that the Father gave His only-begotten Son for us, lead you to derogate from the dignity of the Only-begotten, or conceive any thing of earth in Him... He says not 'by the command,' but 'according to the will,' for inasmuch as there is an unity of will in the Father and the Son, that which the Son wills, the Father wills also" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentary00newmuoft/page/n23/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <em>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        James Fergusson comments, "Here is the close of the salutation; in which, by holding forth his own practice for an example, he comprehendeth the duty of the redeemed: they are to ascribe lasting glory and praise to God the Father, for his good-will to this work of our redemption by Jesus Christ." (<a href="https://archive.org/details/briefexpositiono00ferg/page/n17/mode/1up?view=theater" target="_blank"><span>A Brief Exposition of the Epistles of Paul</span></a>).
