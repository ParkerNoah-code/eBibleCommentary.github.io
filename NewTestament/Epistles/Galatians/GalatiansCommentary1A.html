      <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, “Thus I do not have the wherewithal to enable me to glory in my own works, I do not have the wherewithal to boast of myself, and so I will glory in Christ. I will not glory because I have been redeemed. I will not glory because I am free of sins, but because sins have been forgiven me. I will not glory because I am profitable or because anyone is profitable to me, but because Christ is an advocate in my behalf with the Father, because the blood of Christ has been poured out in my behalf.” (Jacob and the Happy Life, I:17-18, The Fathers of the Church, Vol. 65 [Washington: The Catholic University of America Press, 1972], pp. 131-32).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Chrysostom comments, "Thus it appears, that the ministry which He undertook was free and uncompelled; that He was delivered up by Himself, not by another. Let not therefore the words of John, that the Father gave His only-begotten Son for us, lead you to derogate from the dignity of the Only-begotten, or conceive any thing of earth in Him... He says not "by the command," but "according to the will," for inasmuch as there is an unity of will in the Father and the Son, that which the Son wills, the Father wills also" (Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        James Fergusson comments, "Here is the close of the salutation; in which, by holding forth his own practice for an example, he comprehendeth the duty of the redeemed: they are to ascribe lasting glory and praise to God the Father, for his good-will to this work of our redemption by Jesus Christ." (A Brief Exposition of the Epistles of Paul). 
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <em>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <em>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></h2>
