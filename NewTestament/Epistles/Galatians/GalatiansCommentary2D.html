      <h2>D. Authority: Properly Resists Peter (2:11-14)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 11. <em>But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 12. <em>For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        David DeSilva comments, "This is the 'truth of the gospel' that Peter will himself shortly violate as he draws back from this practice to honor, once again, the lines of purity that place gentiles on the outside rather than honoring the new lines of purity drawn by the Holy Spirit poured out on gentile Christian alongside Jewish Christians." (The Letter to the Galatians, NICNT: Eerdmans, 2018).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 13. <em>And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Siricius writes, "O miserable boldness, O craft of a desperate mind! Already was this unknown language of heresy spreading through the Church like a cancer, seeking to fill the breast, and plunge the whole man in destruction: and unless the Lord of Sabaoth had broken through the snare which they had laid, the public exhibition of so much evil and hypocrisy would have led to ruin the hearts of many simple ones, for the human mind is easily drawn aside towards evil, choosing rather to fly through open space, than to travel with pain along the narrow way...
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        And indeed from the times of the Apostles up to now we have heard and known by experience of many malignant heresies, but the sacred truth of the Church has never been assailed by the barking of such dogs as those who have now suddenly broken in upon us, with the doctrines of unbelief fully sprouted, enemies of the faith; who by the fruit of their works have betrayed whose disciples they are. For while other heretics misunderstanding single points have proposed to bear away and abstract from the Divine system of teaching, these men, <em>not having on a wedding garment</em>, wound the Catholics, perverting, as I have said, the continuity of the New and Old Testament, and interpreting it in a diabolical spirit, have by their alluring and false arguments already begun to ruin some Christians, and to make them associates of their madness, not keeping within themselves the poison of their iniquity: but some of their chosen ones have betrayed their blasphemies by writing a rash discourse, which the rage of a desperate mind has led them openly to publish, favouring, as it does, the cause of the Heathens." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm" target="_blank"><span>Siricius to the Church of Milan</span></a>, 2 and 4).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 14. <em>But when I saw that they didn’t walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Jerome comments, "By specifying 'the traditions of my forefathers' rather than 'the commandments of the Lord,' he indicates that he was a Pharisee of Pharisees and that his zeal for God was not according to understanding. Down to the present day, those who interpret Scripture according to a Jewish mentality persecute the church of Christ and devastate it not out of zeal for the Law of God but because they have been corrupted by the traditions of men." (<a href="https://archive.org/details/st.-jerome-commentary-on-galatians/page/82/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Richard Longnecker comments, "In attempting to be considerate of the Jerusalem church in its existence under zealot-nationalistic pressures, and so to preserve the integrity of the Jewish Christian mission, Cephas had acutally, even though inadvertently, destroyed the integrity of Gentile Christians." (Galatians, WEB: Zondervan, vol 41, 1990).
