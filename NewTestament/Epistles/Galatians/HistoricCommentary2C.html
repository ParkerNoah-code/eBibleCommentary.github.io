          <h1>C. Gospel: Apostolically Affirmed (2:1-10)</h1>
          <h2>Ver 1. <em>Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again
              to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also
              with me.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            John Calvin comments, "Fourteen years after. This cannot with
            certainty be affirmed to be the same journey
            mentioned by Luke. (Acts 15:2.) The connection of the history leads
            us rather to an opposite conclusion. We find
            that Paul performed four journeys to Jerusalem. Of the first we have
            already spoken. The second took place when,
            in company with Barnabas, he brought the charitable contributions of
            the Greek and Asiatic Churches. (Acts
            15:25.) My belief that this second journey is referred to in the
            present passage rests on various grounds. On
            any other supposition, the statements of Paul and Luke cannot be
            reconciled. Besides, there is ground for
            conjecturing that the rebuke was administered to Peter at Antioch
            while Paul was residing there. Now, this
            happened before he was sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle
            the dispute which had arisen about ceremonial
            observances. (Acts 15:2.) It is not reasonable to suppose that Peter
            would have used such dissimulation, if that
            controversy had been settled and the decree of the Apostles
            published. But Paul writes that he came to
            Jerusalem, and afterwards adds that he had rebuked Peter for an act
            of dissimulation, an act which Peter
            certainly would not have committed except in matters that were
            doubtful." (<a

                Galatians</span></a>).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 2. <em>I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the
              Good News which I preach among the Gentiles,
              but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I
              might be running, or had run, in vain.</em>
          </h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            James Coffman comments, "Some scholars dogmatically assert that Paul's
            account of the 'council' here cannot be
            harmonized with Acts 15:1ff; but that is only because they fail to
            see that there were private discussions which
            took place before the public and more formal meeting later on." (<a
              href="https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/bcc/galatians-2.html#verse-1"
              target="_blank"><span>Coffman's Commentaries on the Bible</span></a>).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 3. <em>But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
              compelled to be circumcised.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Johann Lange comments, "Had the idea been merely, that the
            circumcision was not even demanded, so strong a word
            would not have been used. There is some force in the suggestion of
            Lightfoot, that the Apostles recommended Paul
            to yield as a charitable concession, but convinced at length that he
            was right, they gave him their support.
            Still we have not sufficient knowledge of the circumstances to
            decide whether Paul cites this as an evidence of
            the Apostles’ agreement with him or of his firmness—in all
            probability it is both. Not even Titus, of whom as a
            Greek the false brethren made the demand, was required to submit—or
            whom as a Greek I would not allow to be
            circumcised, since this would have been a giving up of the whole
            matter. The preceding context suggests the
            former, the subsequent context the latter side of the occurrence. On
            the reasons for the non-circumcision of
            Titus, and the circumcision of Timothy (Acts 16:2)" (<a

              target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 4-5. <em>This was because of the false brothers secretly
              brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty
              which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into
              bondage, to whom we gave no place in the way of
              subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might
              continue with you.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Augustine writes, "Let us treat scripture like scripture, like God
            speaking; don't let's look there for man
            going wrong. It is not for nothing, you see, that the canon has been
            established for the Church. This is the
            function of the Holy Spirit. So if anybody reads my book, let him
            pass judgment on me. If I have said something
            reasonable, let him follow, not me, but reason itself; if I've
            proved it by the clearest divine testimony, let
            him follow, not me, but the divine scripture." (The Works of Saint
            Augustine, Newly Discovered Sermons, part 3,
            vol 11, Edmund Hill, Sermon 162C.15, Hyde Park: New City Press,
            1997, pg 176).

            Martin Luther comments, "Now the true Gospel has it that we are
            justified by faith alone, without the deeds of
            the Law. The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but
            not without the deeds of the Law. The false
            apostles preached a conditional gospel. So do the papists. They
            admit that faith is the foundation of salvation.
            But they add the conditional clause that faith can save only when it
            is furnished with good works. This is
            wrong. The true Gospel declares that good works are the
            embellishment of faith, but that faith itself is the
            gift and work of God in our hearts. Faith is able to justify,
            because it apprehends Christ, the Redeemer." (<a

          </p>

          <h2>Ver 6. <em>But from those who were reputed to be
              important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me;
              God doesn’t show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected
              imparted nothing to me,</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Martin Luther comments, "There must be people in high office, of
            course. But we are not to deify them. The
            governor, the mayor, the preacher, the teacher, the scholar, father,
            mother, are persons whom we are to love and
            revere, but not to the extent that we forget God. Least we attach
            too much importance to the person, God leaves
            with important persons offenses and sins, sometimes astounding
            shortcomings, to show us that there is a lot of
            difference between any person and God. David was a good king. But
            when the people began to think too well of
            him, down he fell into horrible sins, adultery and murder. Peter,
            excellent apostle that he was, denied Christ.
            Such examples of which the Scriptures are full, ought to warn us not
            to repose our trust in men. In the papacy
            appearance counts for everything. Indeed, the whole papacy amounts
            to nothing more than a mere kowtowing of
            persons and outward mummery. But God alone is to be feared and
            honored.
            <br><span class="tab"></span>
            I would honor the Pope, I would love his person, if he would leave
            my conscience alone, and not compel me to sin
            against God. But the Pope wants to be adored himself, and that
            cannot be done without offending God. Since we
            must choose between one or the other, let us choose God. The truth
            is we are commissioned by God to resist the
            Pope, for it is written, "We ought to obey God rather than men"
            (Acts 5:29). We have seen how Paul refutes the
            argument of the false apostles concerning the authority of the
            apostles. In order that the truth of the Gospel
            may continue; in order that the Word of God and the righteousness of
            faith may be kept pure and undefiled, let
            the apostles, let an angel from heaven, let Peter, let Paul, let
            them all perish." (<a

          <h2>Ver 7. <em>but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been
              entrusted with the Good News for the
              uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the
              circumcised—</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            John Chrysostom comments, "Which is in effect to say, I accuse not,
            nor traduce those holy men; they know what
            it is they have done; to God must they render their account. What I
            am desirous to prove is, that they neither
            reversed nor corrected my procedure, nor added to it as in their
            opinion defective, but gave it their
            approbation and assent; and to this Titus and Barnabas bear witness.
            Then he adds, The Circumcision and
            Uncircumcision; meaning, not the things themselves, but the nations
            known by these distinctions;" (<a

            Joseph Benson comments, "The charge of preaching the Glad Tidings to
            the Judaites; was committed to Petrus — 'By
            saying that he was intrusted with the Glad Tidings of the
            uncircumcision, even as Petrus was with that of the
            circumcision, Paulus Apostolus put himself on a level with Petrus.
            In like manner, his withstanding Petrus
            publicly for withdrawing himself from the converted Gentiles, is a
            fact utterly inconsistent with the pretended
            superiority of Petrus above the other apostles, vainly imagined by
            the Roman pontiffs, for the purpose of
            aggrandizing themselves as his successors, above all other Christian
            bishops.' For he that wrought effectually
            in, or by, Petrus — To qualify him for the apostleship of the
            circumcision, to support him in the discharge of
            that office, and to render his exercise of it successful; the same
            was mighty in me — Wrought also effectually
            in and by me, for and in the discharge of my office toward the
            Gentiles." (<a

          <h2>Ver 8. <em>for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with

            Irenaeus writes, "With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege
            that Paul alone knew the truth, and that to
            him the mystery was manifested by revelation, let Paul himself
            convict them, when he says, that one and the same
            God wrought in Peter for the apostolate of the circumcision, and in
            himself for the Gentiles. [Galatians 2:8]
            Peter, therefore, was an apostle of that very God whose was also
            Paul; and Him whom Peter preached as God among
            those of the circumcision, and likewise the Son of God, did Paul
            [declare] also among the Gentiles." (<a

          <h2>Ver 9. <em>and when they perceived the grace that was given to me,
              James and Cephas and John, those who were
              reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of
              fellowship, that we should go to the
              Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Scot McKnight comments, "In chapter 2, however, he argues that while
            his gospel was independent in source, it
            was also <em>endorsed</em> by the Jerusalem pillars. That
            endorsement, for Paul, was not necessary, but as long
            as it worked out that way, he decides to use that endorsement as
            part of his case against the Judaizers."
            (Galatians, NIV Application Commentary: Zondervan, 1995).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 10. <em>They only asked us to remember the poor—which very
              thing I was also zealous to do.</em></h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            Jerome comments, "For the man who is poor in grace or faith is
            unable to hear the warning about the punishment
            that is to come because he does not have spiritual riches or a
            knowledge of Scripture, which is compared to
            gold, silver, and a precious gem. Therefore, because it is the sick
            and not the healthy that need a doctor, the
            apostles agreed by the clasping of right hands not to look down on
            the poor or be contemptuous of sinners but
            always to remember them, just as Paul remembered the man whom in his
            first letter to the Corinthian church he
            had chastised momentarily in the hope that he would put his body
            through rigorous repentance and thereby save
            his spirit.2 He wrote to this man in his second letter [to the same
            church] to summon him back to the fold so
            that he would not be swallowed up by more sorrow, and he asked all
            the members of the congregation to forgive
            their brother and reaffirm their love for him, just as Paul himself
            forgave each of them before Christ, thus
            fulfilling the promise he had made at Jerusalem always to remember
            the poor." (<a
