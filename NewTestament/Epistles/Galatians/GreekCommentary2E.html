        <h2>E. Justification by Faith Alone (2:15-21)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 15.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Ἡμεῖς φύσει Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί,</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί - This clause expresses pointedly the insolent
          contempt of the Pharisaic party for Gentiles, who did not belong to
          the holy nation nor inherit the Law and the Covenants. Yet in spite of
          these arrogant pretensions to superior sanctity (it is added) they
          were driven by the verdict of their own conscience to embrace the
          faith of Christ because they knew that no flesh could possibly be so
          perfect in obedience to Law as to be thereby justified.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 16.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >εἰδότες ὅτι οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ἔργων νόμου, ἐὰν μὴ διὰ
            πίστεως Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ, καὶ ἡμεῖς εἰς χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐπιστεύσαμεν,
            ἵνα δικαιωθῶμεν ἐκ πίστεως χριστοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων νόμου· διότι οὐ
            δικαιωθήσεται ἐξ ἔργων νόμου πᾶσα σάρξ.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος - Two methods of seeking justification in the
          sight of God are here distinguished. The former took account of
          nothing but stedfast obedience to the law of God. Before his
          conversion Paul knew no other: he had been taught by his legal
          training to base his standard of right and wrong entirely on the
          revealed law, to find in it the sole guide of conscience, and to
          measure righteousness by conformity to its commandments alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But his view of God’s judgment had been profoundly modified by his
          conversion. He had learnt on the one hand from the teaching of Christ
          how impossible it was for man to attain to perfect righteousness,
          seeing that God claims not only obedience to the letter of the law,
          but an allegiance of the heart too thorough to be attainable by human
          infirmity. But on the other hand he knew now that God is a loving
          Father in Christ, ever seeking out His erring children that He may win
          them back, ever ready to temper strict justice with infinite mercy,
          and waiting only for the first response of imperfect faith and
          imperfect repentance, so they be at all sincere, to blot out a guilty
          past, and pronounce a favourable judgment on the sinner. He perceived
          that there is room in the judgment of God for another element beside
          strict justice, viz. , the mercy of the judge, and that a prisoner,
          however clear may be his guilt on the evidence of his life, may
          nevertheless be assured of pardon and acceptance by throwing himself
          in humble trust on that mercy. In the Epistles of Paul accordingly
          justification acquired a new meaning, becoming equivalent to
          acceptance before God, and the term righteousness was applied to the
          merciful acquittal of the guilty but penitent offender.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἐξ ἔργων νόμου - The clause ἐξ ἔργων νόμου defines an acquittal on the
          merits of the case alone, based on a life of holy obedience, while διὰ
          πίστεως Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ points to faith in Christ as the appointed
          channel of God’s mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἐπιστεύσαμεν - Here, as in Romans 13:11 , this verb denotes the act of
          embracing the faith. Jewish Christians had by their conversion
          declared the hopelessness of their position under the Law without
          Christ. Faith in him was (they saw) the only means of obtaining
          justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          διότι - This clause corroborates the verdict of conscience and
          experience by the authority of Scripture, for it adopts the language
          of Psalms 143:2, οὐ δικαιωθήσεται ἐνώπιόν σου πᾶς ζῶν , with only some
          verbal alterations suggested by the context of the Epistle. As two
          kinds of justification have been mentioned, the clause ἐξ ἔργων νόμου
          is required here to make it clear that the justification to which the
          Psalm refers was legal, the words ἐνώπιόν σου are dropped as needless
          in this context, and πᾶσα σάρξ is substituted for πᾶς ζῶν in order to
          show that the Psalm referred to earthly life. The passage is quoted
          with corresponding verbal changes in Romans 3:20.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 17.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Εἰ δέ, ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν χριστῷ, εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ
            ἁμαρτωλοί, ἆρα χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος; Μὴ γένοιτο.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Εἰ δέ, ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν χριστῷ, εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἁμαρτωλοί
          - The last verse arrived at the conclusion that Jewish converts by
          their own act condemned themselves to be guilty of a broken law. The
          argument now proceeds on this assumption “ If it be true (as has been
          shown) that we by seeking to be justified in Christ were found to be
          ourselves also sinners as well as the Gentiles if our sin was then
          discovered, and it be admitted that confession of sin lies at the root
          of all Christian life, what then is the attitude of Christ toward
          sin?”
        </p>
        <p>
          ἆρα χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος - This clause is clearly interrogative,
          and the true reading is ἆρα, not ἄρα (inferential). For here, as
          always elsewhere in Pauline language, μὴ γένοιτο repudiates a
          monstrous suggestion, put forward in the form of a question, the mere
          statement of which is repugnant to the moral sense. It was objected to
          this doctrine of God’s free grace in Christ to guilty sinners that it
          held out a license to sin by doing away the wholesome restraints of
          the Law, and so encouraged men to continue in sin by its assurance of
          pardon. The fallacy is here dismissed with scorn on the strength of
          the very nature of Christ, but is more fully exposed in the sixth
          chapter to the Romans.
