      <h2>B. No Other Gospel (1:6-9)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 6. <em>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Marius Victorinus comments, "The gospel Paul announces is sure: that Christ is the Son of God, the power of God for salvation to all that believe, to the Greeks and to the Jews—and nothing besides! In fact, all hope for salvation and for the grace of God pertaining to us lies in faith pertaining to Christ, to the effect that we would believe he is the Son of God, that he suffered for our sake and rose again, from which we too might arise with the forgiveness of sins. This is the true gospel that Paul announces. Therefore, if anyone adds on something else—like Judaism, circumcision, sabbath observance, and other things of this sort—he is sinning and is a stranger to the truth." (<a href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment(BookFi.org).pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>, translated by Stephen Andrew Cooper, pg. 253).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Cyril of Alexandria writes, "We must try therefore and that most straitly, writings on the Divine doctrines, and if any should go along with the sacred Scriptures and speed its clear and most unerring way therein, let it be acclaimed by us too with testimonies to its orthodoxy: but if it form its language cold and astray and amiss, yea rather giver of destruction to the readers, let it hear from every mouth, <em>But ye are uttering and telling us another error</em>." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_against_nestorius_01_book1.htm" target="_blank"><span>Five Tomes Against Nestorius</span></a>, Book 1, para 3).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Thomas Aquinas comments, "Now, a teaching passed on by a man can be changed and revoked by another man who knows better, as one philosopher refutes the sayings of another, or by an angel who has a more penetrating knowledge of the truth. Even a teaching handed down by one angel could be supplanted by that of a higher angel or by God. But a teaching that comes directly from God can be nullified neither by man nor angel. Hence if a man or an angel were to state anything contrary to what has been taught by God, such a statement would not contradict God’s teaching, so as to void or destroy it; rather, God’s teaching would be against him, because one who speaks thus should be expelled and prevented from sharing his teaching. Hence the Apostle says that the dignity of the Gospel teaching, which has come directly from God, is so great that if a man or even an angel preached another Gospel besides that which he has preached among them, he is anathema, i.e., must be rejected and expelled.

        A second question arises from the words, a gospel besides that which we have preached to you. Therefore no one may teach or preach anything but what is written in the epistles and Gospels. But this is false, because it is said in 1 Thessalonians (3:10): “Praying that we may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith.” I answer that nothing is to be taught except what is contained, either implicitly or explicitly, in the Gospels and epistles and Sacred Scripture. For Sacred Scripture and the Gospels announce that Christ must be believed explicitly. Hence whatever is contained therein implicitly and fosters its teaching and faith in Christ can be preached and taught. Therefore, when he says, besides that which you have received, he means by adding something completely alien: 'If any, man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book' (Rev 22:18). And 'Neither add anything,' i.e., contrary or alien, 'nor diminish' (Deut 12:32)." (<a href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/SSGalatians.htm#11" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Saint Paul's Epistle to the Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Calvin comments, "Accordingly he enjoins them to regard as devils those who shall dare to bring forward a gospel different from his, — meaning by another gospel, one to which the inventions of other men are added; for the doctrine of the false apostles was not entirely contrary, or even different, from that of Paul, but corrupted by false additions." (<a href="https://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom41/calcom41.iii.iii.ii.html" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
