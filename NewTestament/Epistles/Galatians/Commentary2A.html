        <h2>A. Setup: Man's Gospel, Paul's Past (1:10-14)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 10.
          <em
            >For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving
            to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a
            servant of Christ.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>For do I now persuade men, or God?</em>
          With the same vehemence Paul continues: "You Galatians ought to be
          able to tell from my preaching and from the many afflictions which I
          have endured, whether I serve men or God. Everybody can see that my
          preaching has stirred up persecution against me everywhere, and has
          earned for me the cruel hatred of my own people, in fact the hatred of
          all men. This should convince you that by my preaching I do not seek
          the favor and praise of men, but the glory of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can't you see that I seek no man's favor by
          my doctrine?" asks Paul. "If I were anxious for the favor of men I
          would flatter them. But what do I do? I condemn their works. I teach
          things only that I have been commanded to teach from above. For that I
          bring down upon my head the wrath of Jews and Gentiles. My doctrine
          must be right. It must be divine. Any other doctrine cannot be better
          than mine. Any other doctrine must be false and wicked."
        </p>
        <p>
          With Paul we boldly pronounce a curse upon
          every doctrine that does not agree with ours. We do not preach for the
          praise of men, or the favor of princes. We preach for the favor of God
          alone whose grace and mercy we proclaim. Whosoever teaches a gospel
          contrary to ours, or different from ours, let us be bold to say that
          he is sent of the devil.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Or do I seek to please men?</em> "Do I
          serve men or God?" Paul keeps an eye on the false apostles, those
          flatterers of men. They taught circumcision to avoid the hatred and
          persecution of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this day you will find many who seek to
          please men in order that they may live in peace and security. They
          teach whatever is agreeable to men, no matter whether it is contrary
          to God's Word or their own conscience. But we who endeavor to please
          God and not men, stir up hell itself. We must suffer reproach,
          slanders, death.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who go about to please men we have
          a word from Christ recorded in the fifth chapter of St. John: "How can
          ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor
          that cometh from God alone?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span
          ><em
            >For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
            Christ.</em
          >
          Observe the consummate cleverness with which the false apostles went
          about to bring Paul into disrepute. They combed Paul's writings for
          contradictions (our opponents do the same) to accuse him of teaching
          contradictory things. They found that Paul had circumcised Timothy
          according to the Law, that Paul had purified himself with four other
          men in the Temple at Jerusalem, that Paul had shaven his head at
          Cenchrea. The false apostles slyly suggested that Paul had been
          constrained by the other apostles to observe these ceremonial laws. We
          know that Paul observed these decora out of charitable regard for the
          weak brethren. He did not want to offend them. But the false apostles
          turned Paul's charitable regard to his disadvantage. If Paul had
          preached the Law and circumcision, if he had commended the strength
          and free will of man, he would not have been so obnoxious to the Jews.
          On the contrary they would have praised his every action.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 11.
          <em
            >But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which
            was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          This passage constitutes Paul's chief defense
          against the accusations of his opponents. He maintains under oath that
          he received his Gospel not from men, but by the revelation of Jesus
          Christ. In declaring that his Gospel is not after man, Paul does not
          merely wish to state that his Gospel is not mundane. The false
          apostles made the same claim for their gospel. Paul means to say that
          he learned his Gospel not in the usual and accepted manner through the
          agency of men by hearing, reading, or writing. He received the Gospel
          by special revelation directly from Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul received his Gospel on the way to
          Damascus when Christ appeared to him. St. Luke furnishes an account of
          the incident in the ninth chapter of the Book of Acts. "Arise," said
          Christ to Paul, "and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what
          thou must do." Christ did not send Paul into the city to learn the
          Gospel from Ananias. Ananias was only to baptize Paul, to lay his
          hands on Paul, to commit the ministry of the Word unto Paul, and to
          recommend him to the Church. Ananias recognized his limited assignment
          when he said to Paul: "Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that
          appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou
          mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost." Paul
          did not receive instruction from Ananias. Paul had already been
          called, enlightened, and taught by Christ in the road. His contact
          with Ananias was merely a testimonial to the fact that Paul had been
          called by Christ to preach the Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul was forced to speak of his conversion to
          combat the slanderous contention of the false apostles to the effect
          that this apostleship was inferior to that of the other apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it were not for the example of the
          Galatian churches I would never have thought it possible that anybody
          who had received the Word of God with such eagerness as they had,
          could so quickly let go of it. Good Lord, what terrible mischief one
          single false statement can create.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article of justification is fragile. Not
          in itself, of course, but in us. I know how quickly a person can
          forfeit the joy of the Gospel. I know in what slippery places even
          those stand who seem to have a good footing in the matters of faith.
          In the midst of the conflict when we should be consoling ourselves
          with the Gospel, the Law rears up and begins to rage all over our
          conscience. I say the Gospel is frail because we are frail.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes matters worse is that one-half of
          ourselves, our own reason, stands against us. The flesh resists the
          spirit, or as Paul puts it, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit."
          Therefore we teach that to know Christ and to believe in Him is no
          achievement of man, but the gift of God. God alone can create and
          preserve faith in us. God creates faith in us through the Word. He
          increases, strengthens and confirms faith in us through His word.
          Hence the best service that anybody can render God is diligently to
          hear and read God's Word. On the other hand, nothing is more perilous
          than to be weary of the Word of God. Thinking he knows enough, a
          person begins little by little to despise the Word until he has lost
          Christ and the Gospel altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let every believer carefully learn the
          Gospel. Let him continue in humble prayer. We are molested not by puny
          foes, but by mighty ones, foes who never grow tired of warring against
          us. These, our enemies, are many: Our own flesh, the world, the Law,
          sin, death, the wrath and judgment of God, and the devil himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arguments which the false apostles
          advanced impress people to this day. "Who are you to dissent from the
          fathers and the entire Church, and to bring a contradictory doctrine?
          Are you wiser than so many holy men, wiser than the whole Church?"
          When Satan, abetted by our own reason, advances these arguments
          against us, we lose heart, unless we keep on saying to ourselves: "I
          don't care if Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Peter, Paul, John, or an
          angel from heaven, teaches so and so. I know that I teach the truth of
          God in Christ Jesus." You may argue that the Church and the fathers
          are holy. Yet the Church is compelled to pray: "Forgive us our
          trespasses," I am not to be believed, nor is the Church to be
          believed, or the fathers, or the apostles, or an angel from heaven, if
          they teach anything contrary to the Word of God. Let the Word of God
          abide forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter erred in life and in doctrine. Paul
          might have dismissed Peter's error as a matter of no consequence. But
          Paul saw that Peter's error would lead to the damage of the whole
          Church unless it were corrected. Therefore he withstood Peter to his
          face. The Church, Peter, the apostles, angels from heaven, are not to
          be heard unless they teach the genuine Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This argument is not always to our advantage.
          People ask: "Whom then shall we believe?" Our opponents maintain that
          they teach the pure Word of God. We do not believe them. They in turn
          hate and persecute us for vile heretics. What can we do about it? With
          Paul we glory in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What to do? Let everybody
          become sure of his calling and doctrine, that he may boldly say with
          Paul: "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
          unto you than ye have received, let him be accursed."
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 12.
          <em
            >For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came
            to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          You observe how sedulously he affirms that he
          was taught of Christ, who Himself, without human intervention,
          condescended to reveal to him all knowledge. And if he were asked for
          his proof that Christ Himself thus immediately revealed to him these
          ineffable mysteries, he would instance his former conversation,
          arguing that his conversion would not have been so sudden, had it not
          been by Divine revelation. For when men have been vehement and eager
          on the contrary side, their conviction, if it is effected by human
          means, requires much time and ingenuity. It is clear therefore that
          he, whose conversion is sudden, and has been sobered in the very
          height of his madness, must have been vouchsafed a Divine revelation
          and teaching, and so have at once arrived at complete sanity. On this
          account he is obliged to relate his former life, and to call the
          Galatians as witnesses of past events. That the Only-begotten Son of
          God had Himself from heaven vouchsafed to call him, they who were not
          present could not know, but that he had been a persecutor they well
          knew. For his violence had even reached their ears, and the distance
          between Palestine and Galatia was so great, that the report would not
          have extended thither, had not his acts exceeded all bounds and
          endurance.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 13-14.
          <em
            >For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’
            religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God
            and ravaged it. I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my
            own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the
            traditions of my fathers.</em

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span
          ><em>For you have heard of my way of living in time past.</em> Observe
          how he shrinks not from aggravating each point; not saying simply that
          he <em>persecuted</em> but <em>beyond measure</em>, and not only
          <em>persecuted</em> but <em>ravaged</em>, which signifies an attempt
          to extinguish, to pull down, to destroy, to annihilate, the Church.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Traditions of my fathers.</em> Speaking
          now of the Mosaic Law, Paul declares that he was wrapped up in it. To
          the Philippians he wrote: "As touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning
          zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in
          the law, blameless." He means to say, "I can compare myself with the
          best and holiest of all those who are of the circumcision. Let them
          show me if they can, a more earnest defender of the Mosaic Law than I
          was at one time. This fact, O Galatians, should have put you on your
          guard against these deceivers who make so much of the Law. If anybody
          ever had reason to glory in the righteousness of the Law, it was I."
