      <h2>A. Works of Law or Faith? (3:1-9)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Basil of Caesarea writes, "This is complete and perfect glorying in God, when a man is uplifted, not because of his own justice, but because he knows he is empty of true glory, and made just only through his faith in Christ.  In this Paul gloried, that he thought nothing of his own justice; that he sought that justice alone which comes through Christ, which is from God, justice in faith (Phil. iii. 9); and that he might know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the sharing of His sufferings, and be made like Him in His death, if by any means he might himself attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.  It is here that the whole top-loftiness of arrogance falls down.  Nothing is left to you to glory in, O man; whose true glorying and whose hope is in mortifying yourself in all things, and in seeking for that future life in Christ..." (<a href="http://www.lectionarycentral.com/trinity11/Basil.html" target="_blank"><span>On Humility</span></a>, 3).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <em>Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <em>He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Abrose writes, " He has not heard what was read to-day: “That a man is not justified by the works of the law,” or “I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live unto God,” that is, by the spiritual law he is dead to the carnal interpretation of the law. And we, by the law of our Lord Jesus Christ, are dead to this law, which sanctions such perfidious decrees. The law did not gather the Church together, but the faith of Christ. For the law is not by faith, but “the just man lives by faith.” Therefore, faith, not the law, makes a man just, for justice is not through the law, but through the faith of Christ. But he who casts aside his faith and pleads for that the claims of the law, bears witness that he is himself unjust; for the just man lives by faith." (<a href="https://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/1819-1893,_Schaff._Philip,_3_Vol_10_Ambrose,_EN.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Sermon Against Auxentius on the Giving up of the Basilicas</span></a>, 24).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>Even so, Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>Know therefore that those who are of faith are children of Abraham.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Jerome comments, "Moreover, what deeds did the Lord expect from his contemporaries other than belief in the Son of God whom the Father had sent and who said, 'He who believes in me does not believe in me only, but in him who sent me'? In another place he replied to Jews who applauded themselves for the antiquity and nobility of their ethnicity, 'Do not say, We have Abraham as our father, for God is capable of raising up children for Abraham out of these stones.' There is no question that the stones here symbolize the Gentiles’ hardened hearts, which were later softened and received the seal of faith." (<a href="https://archive.org/details/st.-jerome-commentary-on-galatians/page/126/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Chrysostom comments, "They said that he who kept not the Law was cursed, but he proves that he who kept it was cursed, and he who kept it not, blessed. Again, they said that he who adhered to Faith alone was cursed, but he shows that he who adhered to Faith alone, is blessed. And how does he prove all this? For it is no common thing which we have promised; wherefore it is necessary to give close attention to what follows. He had already shown this, by referring to the words spoken to the Patriarch, ​'In you shall all nations be blessed, '​ [ Genesis 12:4 ] at a time, that is, when Faith existed, not the Law;" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentary00newmuoft/page/n68/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</em></h2>
