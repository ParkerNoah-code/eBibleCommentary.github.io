      <h2>E. Justification by Faith Alone (2:15-21)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 15. <em>“We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Chrysostom comments, "Observe how he represses the high thoughts of the Jews; each argument lays the ground for the next, and his language is authoritative. <em>We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles</em>. The phrase, <em>Jews by nature</em>, implies that we, who are not proselytes, but educated from early youth in the Law, have relinquished our habitual mode of life, and betaken ourselves to the faith which is in Christ." (<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentary00newmuoft/page/n56/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>
      
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John Calvin comments, "Skilfully anticipating the objection, Paul turns it to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves, with all their advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ, how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for salvation through faith?" (<a href="https://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom41/calcom41.iii.iv.iii.html" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Clement of Rome writes, "And the other tribes are in no slight honor, since, as God promised: 'Thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven.' They were all glorified and magnified not through themselves or their own works or the good deeds which they did, but through His will. And we also, having been called through His will in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, or by our own wisdom or understanding or piety or the works we have done in holiness of heart, but through the faith, by which the Almighty God has justified all men from the beginning; to whom be glory for all ages. Amen." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1010.htm" target="_blank"><span>Letter to the Corinthians</span></a>, ch 32, The Fathers of the Church: The Apostolic Fathers, Cima, 1947).
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Martin Luther comments, "After we have taught faith in Christ, we teach good works. "Since you have found Christ by faith," we say, "begin now to work and do well. Love God and your neighbor. Call upon God, give thanks unto Him, praise Him, confess Him. These are good works. Let them flow from a cheerful heart, because you have remission of sin in Christ." (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1549/1549-h/1549-h.htm#link2HCH0001" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>). 
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John of Damascus comments, "Look at the absurd direction into which he leads those who are attached to the Law. If the faith in Christ, he says, is not sufficient to justify, but, once again there is a need to uphold the Law, and if those, having left the Law for Christ, are not justified in doing so, but rather are condemned, then Christ will be found to be the cause of our condemnation, since we left the law on his account in order to run towards the faith. 'God forbid,' he says. Seeing the absurdity, which this doctrine leads to, he immediately turns away from it by using this aphorism." (<a href="http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/patrology/johndamascus_galatians.html" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on St. Paul's Letter to the Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ignatius writes, "Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to live according to the principles of Christianity. For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the sour leaven, and be changed into the new leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be salted in Him, lest any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour you shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not embrace Judaism, but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue which believes might be gathered together to God." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0105.htm" target="_blank"><span>Epistle to the Magnesians</span></a>, ch 10).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19. <em>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Justin Martyr writes, "For Isaiah did not send you to a bath, there to wash away murder and other sins, which not even all the water of the sea were sufficient to purge; but, as might have been expected, this was that saving bath of the olden time which followed those who repented, and who no longer were purified by the blood of goats and of sheep, or by the ashes of an heifer, or by the offerings of fine flour, but by faith through the blood of Christ, and through His death, who died for this very reason" (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/01282.htm" target="_blank"><span>Dialogue with Trypho</span></a>, Ch 13).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 20. <em>I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Mathetes writes, "But when our wickedness had reached its height, and it had been clearly shown that its reward, punishment and death, was impending over us; and when the time had come which God had before appointed for manifesting His own kindness and power, how the one love of God, through exceeding regard for men, did not regard us with hatred, nor thrust us away, nor remember our iniquity against us, but showed great long-suffering, and bore with us, He Himself took on Him the burden of our iniquities, He gave His own Son as a ransom for us, the holy One for transgressors, the blameless One for the wicked, the righteous One for the unrighteous, the incorruptible One for the corruptible, the immortal One for those who are mortal. For what other thing was capable of covering our sins than His righteousness? By what other one was it possible that we, the wicked and ungodly, could be justified, than by the only Son of God? O sweet exchange!" (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0101.htm" target="_blank"><span>The Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus</span></a>, Ch 9).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 21. <em>I don’t reject the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Marius Victorinus comments, "<em>I am not ungrateful to God’s grace</em> (2: 21), so that, God having redeemed me through Christ and Christ having handed himself over for my sake, I would return to the hope of the Law—all the hope I have in Christ being disregarded—and would believe myself to be justified based on the works of the Law. That would be ungrateful to the one who did so much for me, who for my sake would put himself in the line of fire in order to liberate me from my sins by taking their penalties upon himself." (<a href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment(BookFi.org).pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>, translated by Stephen Andrew Cooper, pg. 285).
        </p>
      
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Charles Spurgeon comments, "They who say that the death of Christ goes only part of the way, but that man must do something in order to merit eternal life,— these, I say, make this death of Christ to be only partially effective, and, in yet clearer terms, ineffectual in and of itself. If it be even hinted that the blood of Jesus is not price enough till man adds his silver or his gold, then his blood is not our redemption at all, and Christ is no Redeemer! If it be taught that our Lord’s bearing of sin for us did not make a perfect atonement, and that it is ineffectual till we either do or suffer something to complete it, then in the supplemental work lies the real virtue, and Christ’s work is in itself insufficient. His death cry of 'It is finished,' must have been all a mistake, if still it is not finished; and if a believer in Christ is not completely saved by what Christ has done, but must do something himself to complete it, then salvation was not finished, and the Saviour’s work remains imperfect till we, poor sinners, lend a hand to make up for his deficiencies. What blasphemy lies in such a supposition!" (<a href="https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs1534.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Salvation by Works, a Criminal Doctrine</span></a>, Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit Vol 26).
