      <h2>E. Slaves and Sons (4:1-7)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1-2. <em>But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all, but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Jerome comments, "Others interpret the basic elements of this world as the Law of Moses and the utterances of the prophets.' For it is through the Law and the prophets, which are analogous to the first lessons in writing, that we come to acquire a fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom. In his letter to the Hebrews, the Apostle addresses those who were already supposed to be [spiritually] mature but who cast aside the truth and still clung to the rudimentary principles of learning. 'In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again' [Heb 5:12]." (<a href="https://archive.org/details/st.-jerome-commentary-on-galatians/page/155/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>
      
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        J. B. Lightfoot comments, "On the other hand, a few of the fathers (Jerome, Gennadius, Primasius) adopt the other sense, 'elementary teaching.' This is probably the correct interpretation, both as simpler in itself and as suiting the context better. St. Paul seems to be dwelling still on the rudimentary character of the law, as fitted for an earlier stage in the world's history. The expression occurs again in reference to formal ordinances, Col. ii. 8 [Be careful that you don’t let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elemental spirits of the world, and not after Christ.]" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/stpaulsepistleto00ligh/page/266/mode/1up?view=theater" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>).
        </p>
      
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        David R. Bundrick comments, "The interpretation most consistent with the evidence and that is enunciated in slightly various ways by Lightfoot, Meyer, Black, Burton, Mickelson and Delling (among others) is the principle view: the elementary or rudimentary religious teachings, possessed by the whole human race, to which both Jew and Gentile were enslaved prior to experiencing freedom by faith in Christ." (<a href="https://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/34/34-3/34-3-pp353-364_JETS.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Ta Stoicheia Tou Kosmou: Gal 4:3</span></a>, JETS 34/3, Sept 1991, 353-364).

      <h2>Ver 4-5. <em>But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law, that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as children.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Irenaeus writes, "For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, [Romans 5:19] and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation. Thus, then, was the Word of God made man, as also Moses says: 'God, true are His works.' [Deuteronomy 32:4] But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh, His work was not a true one. But what He did appear, that He also was: God recapitulated in Himself the ancient formation of man, that He might kill sin, deprive death of its power, and vivify man; and therefore His works are true." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103318.htm" target="_blank"><span>Against Heresies</span></a>, 3.18.7).
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Gordon D. Fee comments, "Although Paul's emphases in what follows are thus primarily soteriological, there also emerges a variety of 'Son of God' affirmations (Jewish messianism, preexistence, incarnation, knowledge of the historical Jesus), which are crucial to Paul's special interests and therefore cause for close scrutiny." (Pauline Christology, Baker, 2007, pg 212).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</em></h2>
