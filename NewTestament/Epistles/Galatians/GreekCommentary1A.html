      <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <span style="font-weight:normal">Παῦλος ἀπόστολος οὐκ ἀπ' ἀνθρώπων, οὐδὲ δι' ἀνθρώπου, ἀλλὰ διὰ Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ, καὶ θεοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν,</span></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <span style="font-weight:normal">καὶ οἱ σὺν ἐμοὶ πάντες ἀδελφοί, ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῆς Γαλατίας·</span></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        οἱ σὺν ἐμοὶ - seems, from its use in Php 4:21, to describe a small group of brethren immediately surrounding the Apostle; for the salutation from them is there followed by a separate salutation from the Roman Church in general.
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <span style="font-weight:normal">χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρός, καὶ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ,</span></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <span style="font-weight:normal">τοῦ δόντος ἑαυτὸν περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν, ὅπως ἐξέληται ἡμᾶς ἐκ τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος αἰῶνος πονηροῦ, κατὰ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ πατρὸς ἡμῶν·</span></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν - for the sins. The sin offerings of the Law were designated περὶ ἁμαρτίας (cf. Hebrews 10:6; Hebrews 10:8), but περί and ὑπέρ were equally applicable with reference to Christ's offering of Himself for our sins; the former fixing attention on the effect of His sacrifice in doing away sin, the latter on the motive which prompted Him, viz., love for sinners. The two prepositions are combined in 1 Peter 3:18. It is often difficult to decide which is the genuine reading owing to the variation of MSS.: but here they are greatly in favour of περί, which is also more appropriate to the context: for in this clause a comparison is intended between the sin-offerings of Christ and the typical sin-offerings of the Law;
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        αἰῶνος - In this place αἰῶνος denotes the world which Jesus found existing at the time of His coming, out of which He chose His disciples. World is the nearest English equivalent to αἰών in this sense, if only it be understood to mean a particular phase of human society, as in the phrases religious world, scientific world, etc., and not the material universe.
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        ἐνεστῶτος - existing. This participle is twice elsewhere applied to things existing by way of contrast to things future (μέλλοντα), in Romans 8:38 and 1 Corinthians 3:22. A similar contrast is here suggested between ὁ ἐνεστώς and ὁ μέλλων αἰών, i.e., between the world which Christ found existing on earth and the Messianic world whose coming Hebrew prophets had foretold.
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        πονηροῦ - This sweeping condemnation of the existing world corresponds to the language of the Baptist and to Christ's own denunciations of the evil generation to which He came. In spite of all that revelation and conscience had done to leaven it, He found the faithful few in number, and evil predominant in the mass.
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        ἐξέληται - Here, as in Acts 26:17, this verb coupled with ἐκ can only denote choice out of the world, not deliverance from it, which would require the addition of ἐκ χειρός, as in Acts 12:11, or some equivalent. The clause describes the process of selection begun by Christ on earth, and still continued by the risen Christ as He calls fresh disciples into His Church continually.
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <span style="font-weight:normal">ᾧ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων. Ἀμήν.</span></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        ᾧ ἡ δόξα - Our versions supply ἔστω and turn the clause accordingly into an invocation of praise. But the insertion of the article points rather to an affirmation, whose is the glory. The verb is usually omitted in the doxology, but ἐστιν is added in 1 Peter 4:11. The glory consists in the manifestation of the Father's character throughout all the ages in the continual redemption of mankind according to His will. Hereby is revealed His union of perfect wisdom, holiness, and love.
