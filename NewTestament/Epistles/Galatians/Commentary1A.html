        <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus
            Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Paul, an apostle...</em> In the
          salutations with which he commenced his Epistles, Paul was accustomed
          to claim the title of "an Apostle." His object in doing so, as we have
          remarked on former occasions, was to employ the authority of his
          station, for the purpose of enforcing his doctrine. This authority
          depends not on the judgment or opinion of men, but exclusively on the
          calling of God; and therefore he demands a hearing on the ground of
          his being "an Apostle." Let us always bear this in mind, that in the
          church we ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he
          has appointed to be our teacher. Whoever assumes a right to instruct
          us, must speak in the name of God or of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as the calling of Paul was more
          vehemently disputed among the Galatians, he asserts it more strongly
          in his address to that church, than in his other Epistles; for he does
          not simply affirm that he was called by God, but states expressly that
          it was not either from men or by men. This statement, be it observed,
          applies not to the office which he held in common with other pastors,
          but to the apostleship. The authors of the calumnies which he has in
          his eye did not venture to deprive him altogether of the honor of the
          Christian ministry. They merely refused to allow him the name and rank
          of an apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now speaking of the apostleship in the
          strictest sense; for the word is employed in two different ways.
          Sometimes, it denotes preachers of the Gospel, to whatever class they
          might belong; but here it bears a distinct reference to the highest
          rank in the church; so that Paul is equal to Peter and to the other
          twelve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first clause, that he was called not from
          men, he had in common with all the true ministers of Christ. As no man
          ought to "take this honor unto himself," (Hebrews 5:4), so it is not
          in the power of men to bestow it on whomsoever they choose. It belongs
          to God alone to govern his church; and therefore the calling cannot be
          lawful, unless it proceed from Him. So far as the church is concerned,
          a man who has been led to the ministry, not by a good conscience, but
          by ungodly motives, may happen to be regularly called. But Paul is
          here speaking of a call ascertained in so perfect, a manner, that
          nothing farther can be desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second clause, that he was called not by
          man, belonged in a peculiar manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary
          pastor, this would have implied nothing wrong. Paul himself, when
          travelling through various cities in company with Barnabas, "ordained
          elders in every church," by the votes of the people, (Acts 14:23); and
          he enjoins Titus and Timothy to proceed in the same work. (1 Timothy
          5:17 Titus 1:5). Such is the ordinary method of electing pastors; for
          we are not entitled to wait until God shall reveal from heaven the
          names of the persons whom he has chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if human agency was not improper, if it
          was even commendable, why does Paul disclaim it in reference to
          himself? I have already mentioned that something more was necessary to
          be proved than that Paul was a pastor, or that he belonged to the
          number of the ministers of the Gospel; for the point in dispute was
          the apostleship. It was necessary that the apostles should be elected,
          not in the same manner as other pastors, but by the direct agency of
          the Lord himself. Thus, Christ himself (Matthew 10:1) called the
          Twelve; and when a successor was to be appointed in the room of Judas,
          the church does not venture to choose one by votes, but has recourse
          to lot. (Acts 1:26). We are certain that the lot was not employed in
          electing pastors. Why was it resorted to in the election of Matthias?
          To mark the express agency of God for it was proper that the apostles
          should be distinguished from other ministers. And thus Paul, in order
          to shew that he does not belong to the ordinary rank of ministers,
          contends that his calling proceeded immediately from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how does Paul affirm that he was not
          called by men, while Luke records that Paul and Barnabas were called
          by the church at Antioch? Some have replied, that he had previously
          discharged the duties of an apostle, and that, consequently, his
          apostleship was not founded on his appointment by that church. But
          here, again, it may be objected, that this was his first designation
          to be the apostle of the Gentiles, to which class the Galatians
          belonged. The more correct, and obvious reply is, that he did not
          intend here to set aside entirely the calling of that church, but
          merely to shew that his apostleship rests on a higher title. This is
          true; for even those who laid their hands on Paul at Antioch did so,
          not of their own accord, but in obedience to express revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted,
          the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
          whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and
          laid their hands on them, they sent them away." (Acts 13:2-3).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since, therefore, he was called by Divine
          revelation, and was also appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to
          be the apostle of the Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought
          forward by men, although the customary rite of ordination was
          afterwards added.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect
          contrast between Paul and the false apostles is here intended. I have
          no objection to that view; for they were in the habit of glorying in
          the name of men. His meaning will therefore stand thus: "Whoever may
          be the persons by whom others boast that they have been sent, I shall
          be superior to them; for I hold my commission from God and Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Jesus Christ and God the Father</em>.
          He asserts that God the Father and Christ had bestowed on him his
          apostleship. Christ is first named, because it is his prerogative to
          send, and because we are his ambassadors. But to make the statement
          more complete, the Father is also mentioned; as if he had said, "If
          there be any one whom the name of Christ is not sufficient to inspire
          with reverence, let him know that I have also received my office from
          God the Father."
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Who raised him from the dead</em>. The
          resurrection of Christ is the commencement of his reign, and is
          therefore closely connected with the present subject. It was a
          reproach brought by them against Paul that he had held no
          communication with Christ, while he was on the earth. He argues, on
          the other hand, that, as Christ was glorified by his resurrection, so
          he has actually exercised his authority in the government of his
          church. The calling of Paul is therefore more illustrious than it
          would have been, if Christ, while still a mortal, had ordained him to
          the office. And this circumstance deserves attention; for Paul
          intimates that the attempt to set aside his authority, involved a
          malignant opposition to the astonishing power of God, which was
          displayed in the resurrection of Christ; because the same heavenly
          Father, who raised Christ from the dead, commanded Paul to make known
          that exertion of his power.

            Galatia:</em

        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span
          ><em>And all the brethren who are with me</em>. -- He appears to have
          usually written in the name of many persons, judging that, if those to
          whom he wrote should attach less weight to a solitary individual, they
          might listen to a greater number, and would not despise a whole
          congregation. His general practice is, to insert the salutations from
          brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the
          commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never
          mentions more than two names, and those very well known. But here he
          includes all the brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good
          reason, an opposite method. The concurrence of so many godly persons
          must have had some degree of influence in softening the minds of the
          Galatians, and preparing them to receive instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To the churches of Galatia</em>. It was
          an extensive country, and therefore contained many churches scattered
          through it. But is it not wonderful that the term "Church", which
          always implies unity of faith, should have been applied to the
          Galatians, who had almost entirely revolted from Christ? I reply, so
          long as they professed Christianity, worshipped one God, observed the
          sacraments, and enjoyed some kind of Gospel ministry, they retained
          the external marks of a church. We do not always find in churches such
          a measure of purity as might be desired. The purest have their
          blemishes; and some are marked, not by a few spots, but by general
          deformity. Though the doctrines and practices of any society may not,
          in all respects, meet our wishes, we must not instantly pronounce its
          defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from it the
          appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a gentleness of
          disposition utterly at variance with such a course. Yet our
          acknowledgment of societies to be churches of Christ must be
          accompanied by an explicit condemnation of everything in them that is
          improper or defective; for we must not imagine, that, wherever there
          is some kind of church, everything in it that ought to be desired in a
          church is perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make this observation, because the Papists,
          seizing on the single word Church, think that whatever they choose to
          force upon us is sanctioned; though the condition and aspect of the
          Church of Rome are widely different from what existed in Galatia. If
          Paul were alive at the present day, he would perceive the miserable
          and dreadfully shattered remains of a church; but he would perceive no
          building. In short, the word Church is often applied by a figure of
          speech in which a part is taken for the whole, to any portion of the
          church, even though it may not fully answer to the name.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
            Christ,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Grace be to you and peace</em>. The terms
          of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well
          understood. But since we are explaining this epistle, you will not
          mind if we repeat what we have so often explained elsewhere. The
          article of justification must be sounded in our ears incessantly
          because the frailty of our flesh will not permit us to take hold of it
          perfectly and to believe it with all our heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing.
          Grace remits sin, and peace quiets the conscience. Sin and conscience
          torment us, but Christ has overcome these fiends now and forever. Only
          Christians possess this victorious knowledge given from above. These
          two terms, grace and peace, constitute Christianity. Grace involves
          the remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience. Sin is not
          canceled by lawful living, for no person is able to live up to the
          Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills the conscience with terror, and
          drives men to despair. Much less is sin taken away by man-invented
          endeavors. The fact is, the more a person seeks credit for himself by
          his own efforts, the deeper he goes into debt. Nothing can take away
          sin except the grace of God. In actual living, however, it is not so
          easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone, in opposition to every
          other means, we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and peace with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.
          The world advances free will, the rational and natural approach of
          good works, as the means of obtaining the forgiveness of sin. But it
          is impossible to gain peace of conscience by the methods and means of
          the world. Experience proves this. Various holy orders have been
          launched for the purpose of securing peace of conscience through
          religious exercises, but they proved failures because such devices
          only increase doubt and despair. We find no rest for our weary bones
          unless we cling to the word of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace
          and peace from the emperor, or from kings, or from governors, but from
          God the Father. He wishes them heavenly peace, the kind of which Jesus
          spoke when He said, "Peace I leave unto you: my peace I give unto
          you." Worldly peace provides quiet enjoyment of life and possessions.
          But in affliction, particularly in the hour of death, the grace and
          peace of the world will not deliver us. However, the grace and peace
          of God will. They make a person strong and courageous to bear and to
          overcome all difficulties, even death itself, because we have the
          victory of Christ's death and the assurance of the forgiveness of our
          sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, Paul confirms our creed,
          "that Christ is very God." We need such frequent confirmation of our
          faith, for Satan will not fail to attack it. He hates our faith. He
          knows that it is the victory which overcometh him and the world. That
          Christ is very God is apparent in that Paul ascribes to Him divine
          powers equally with the Father, as for instance, the power to dispense
          grace and peace. This Jesus could not do unless He were God.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bestow peace and grace lies in the
          province of God, who alone can create these blessings. The angels
          cannot. The apostles could only distribute these blessings by the
          preaching of the Gospel. In attributing to Christ the divine power of
          creating and giving grace, peace, everlasting life, righteousness, and
          forgiveness of sins, the conclusion is inevitable that Christ is truly
          God. Similarly, St. John concludes from the works attributed to the
          Father and the Son that they are divinely One. Hence, the gifts which
          we receive from the Father and from the Son are one and the same.
          Otherwise Paul should have written: "Grace from God the Father, and
          peace from our Lord Jesus Christ." In combining them he ascribes them
          equally to the Father and the Son. I stress this on account of the
          many errors emanating from the sects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arians were sharp fellows. Admitting that
          Christ had two natures, and that He is called "very God of very God,"
          they were yet able to deny His divinity. The Arians took Christ for a
          noble and perfect creature, superior even to the angels, because by
          Him God created heaven and earth. Mohammed also speaks highly of
          Christ. But all their praise is mere palaver to deceive men. Paul's
          language is different. To paraphrase him: "You are established in this
          belief that Christ is very God because He gives grace and peace, gifts
          which only God can create and bestow."
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Who gave himself for our sins</em>. He
          begins with commending the grace of Christ, in order to recall and fix
          on Him the attention of the Galatians; for, if they had justly
          appreciated this benefit of redemption, they would never have fallen
          into opposite views of religion. He who knows Christ in a proper
          manner beholds him earnestly, embraces him with the warmest affection,
          is absorbed in the contemplation of him, and desires no other object.
          The best remedy for purifying our minds from any kind of errors or
          superstitions, is to keep in remembrance our relation to Christ, and
          the benefits which he has conferred upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          These words,
          <em>who gave himself for our sins</em>, were intended to convey to the
          Galatians a doctrine of vast importance; that no other satisfactions
          can lawfully be brought into comparison with that sacrifice of himself
          which Christ offered to the Father; that in Christ, therefore, and in
          him alone, atonement for sin, and perfect righteousness, must be
          sought; and that the manner in which we are redeemed by him ought to
          excite our highest admiration. What Paul here ascribes to Christ is,
          with equal propriety, ascribed in other parts of Scripture to God the
          Father; for, on the one hand, the Father, by an eternal purpose,
          decreed this atonement, and gave this proof of his love to us, that he
          "spared not his only-begotten Son, (Romans 8:32), but delivered him up
          for us all;" and Christ, on the other hand, offered himself a
          sacrifice in order to reconcile us to God. Hence it follows, that his
          death is the satisfaction for sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That he might deliver us</em>. He
          likewise declares the design of our redemption to be, that Christ, by
          his death, might purchase us to be his own property. This takes place
          when we are separated from the world; for so long as we are of the
          world, we do not belong to Christ. The word <em>age</em> is here put
          for the corruption which is in the world; in the same manner as in the
          first Epistle of John, (1 John 5:19) where it is said that "the whole
          world lieth in the wicked one," and in his Gospel, (John 17:15), where
          the Savior says, "I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the
          world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil;" for there it
          signifies the present life. What then is meant by the word "World" in
          this passage? Men separated from the kingdom of God and the grace of
          Christ. So long as a man lives to himself, he is altogether condemned.
          The World is, therefore, contrasted with regeneration, as nature with
          grace, or the flesh with the spirit. Those who are born of the world
          have nothing but sin and wickedness, not by creation, but by
          corruption. Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to redeem
          or separate us from the world.

          <em>From the present wicked age</em>. By
          adding the epithet "wicked", he intended to shew that he is speaking
          of the corruption or depravity which proceeds from sin, and not of
          God's creatures, or of the bodily life. And yet by this single word,
          as by a thunderbolt, he lays low all human pride; for he declares,
          that, apart from that renewal of the nature which is bestowed by the
          grace of Christ, there is nothing in us but unmixed wickedness. We are
          of the world; and, till Christ take us out of it, the world reigns in
          us, and we live to the world. Whatever delight men may take in their
          fancied excellence, they are worthless and depraved; not indeed in
          their own opinion, but in the judgment of our Lord, which is here
          pronounced by the mouth of Paul, and which ought to satisfy our minds.

          According to the will. He points out the
          original fountain of grace, namely, the purpose of God; "for God so
          loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son." (John 3:16). But
          it deserves notice, that Paul is accustomed to represent the decree of
          God as setting aside all compensation or merit on the part of men, and
          so Will denotes here what is commonly called "good pleasure." The
          meaning is, that Christ suffered for us, not because we were worthy,
          or because anything done by us moved him to the act, but because such
          was the purpose of God. Of God and our Father is of the same import as
          if he had said, "Of God who is our Father."

        <h2>Ver 5. <em>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></h2>
        <p>
          <em>To whom be glory</em>. By this sudden
          exclamation of thanksgiving, he intends to awaken powerfully in his
          readers the contemplation of that invaluable gift which they had
          received from God, and in this manner to prepare their minds more
          fully for receiving instruction. It must at the same time be viewed as
          a general exhortation. Every instance in which the mercy of God occurs
          to our remembrance, ought to be embraced by us as an occasion of
          ascribing glory to God.
