      <h2>E. Slaves and Sons (4:1-7)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1-2. <em>But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all, but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4-5. <em>But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law, that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as children.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Irenaeus writes, "For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners, [Romans 5:19] and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation. Thus, then, was the Word of God made man, as also Moses says: 'God, true are His works.' [Deuteronomy 32:4] But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh, His work was not a true one. But what He did appear, that He also was: God recapitulated in Himself the ancient formation of man, that He might kill sin, deprive death of its power, and vivify man; and therefore His works are true." (Against Heresies, 3.18.7).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</em></h2>
