          <h2>B. No Other Gospel (1:6-9)</h2>
          <h2>Ver 6. <span style="font-weight:normal">Θαυμάζω ὅτι οὕτως ταχέως
              μετατίθεσθε ἀπὸ τοῦ καλέσαντος ὑμᾶς ἐν χάριτι
              χριστοῦ εἰς ἕτερον εὐαγγέλιον·</span></h2>
          <p>
            μετατίθεσθε - you are removing [deserting]. The agitators had not
            yet achieved any decisive success, though the
            Galatians were disposed to lend too ready an ear to their
            suggestions. It was not so much their actual progress,
            as the evidence afforded of the instability of the Galatian faith,
            that excited misgivings in the mind of Paul
            (cf. Galatians 4:11; Galatians 4:20); he regarded the movement as
            merely a little leaven, and had not lost his
            confidence in the personal loyalty of his converts and the general
            soundness of their faith (Galatians 5:9-10,
            Galatians 6:17).
          </p>

          <p>
            τοῦ καλέσαντος - the one [him] who called. The Gospel call proceeded
            from God, like those to Abraham and the
            ancient servants and people of God; the Epistles of Paul invariably
            attribute it to Him (cf. Galatians 1:15),
            not to His human instruments.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἐν χάριτι - in [the] grace. This is evidently not εἰς τὴν χάριν
            (into the grace of Christ, A.V.), but records
            the spirit of Divine love which prompted the call. God, of His grace
            in Christ, sent forth the Gospel to the
            Galatians by the hands of Paul and Barnabas.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἕτερον - a different. This passage brings out forcibly the different
            meaning of ἕτερος and ἄλλος. ἕτερος is
            primarily the other of two, ἄλλος another of several. Hence ἕτερος
            fixes attention on two objects exclusively
            (cf. τὸν ἕτερον in Galatians 6:4); here it marks the essential
            difference between the true and the spurious
            Gospel, distinguishing the latter as quite a different Gospel.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 7. <span style="font-weight:normal">ὃ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλο, εἰ μή
              τινές εἰσιν οἱ ταράσσοντες ὑμᾶς καὶ θέλοντες
              μεταστρέψαι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ χριστοῦ.</span></h2>
          <p>
            ὃ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλο - but [which] is not another [Good News]. The
            translation of this clause in A.V. and R.V.
            (which is not another) has caused great embarrassment by its
            apparent identification of the spurious Gospel with
            the true. Lightfoot pleads ingeniously that ἄλλο may mean another
            besides the true Gospel, and so interprets the
            clause to mean that it is no Gospel at all; but this will hardly be
            accepted by most other scholars. The
            American revisers suggest the rendering which is nothing else than.
            But these difficulties arise from making ὅ
            the subject of the sentence: surely it is in fact a connecting
            adverb (touching which, as to which, whereas), as
            it is again in Galatians 2:10, and probably in Galatians 2:20. If
            the clause be rendered, whereas there is no
            other Gospel (i.e., than the true), the sense becomes perfectly
            clear, and it forms an appropriate introduction
            to the succeeding anathemas by its emphatic testimony to the one
            true Gospel.
          </p>

          <p>
            εἰ μή τινές εἰσιν... - only [but] there are some... This clause
            qualifies the former “there is no other Gospel,”
            only a spurious semblance (see εἰ μή Galatians 1:19).
          </p>

          <p>
            τινές - some. There is a studied vagueness in this and other
            references to the agitators. They were evidently
            not Galatian Christians, but strangers from abroad, whom the Apostle
            treats with real or affected contempt.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 8. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐὰν ἡμεῖς ἢ
              ἄγγελος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ εὐαγγελίζηται ὑμῖν παρ' ὃ
              εὐηγγελισάμεθα ὑμῖν, ἀνάθεμα ἔστω.</span></h2>
          <p>
            ἡμεῖς - we. Paul here associates with himself the colleagues
            Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, who had combined with him
            to preach the Gospel. He desires to impress on his disciples that
            the controversy is not between one teacher and
            another, but between truth and falsehood: no minister of Christ, not
            even an angel, can alter the truth in
            Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            ἀνάθεμα - accursed. The two derivatives, ἀνάθημα and ἀνάθεμα, are
            both employed in the LXX and N.T. in different
            senses. ἀνάθημα serves, as in other Greek authors, to denote a
            temple offering, statue, or ornament (cf. 2Ma
            9:16, Luke 21:5), while ἀνάθεμα is restricted to the Hebrew
            conception of an offering devoted under a solemn vow
            to death or destruction (Leviticus 27:28, Joshua 7:1, Acts 23:14).
            The Epistles of Paul attach to the word the
            idea of spiritual death. The significant addition ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ in
            Romans 9:3 associates with it the further
            idea of separation from Christ, and consequent loss of all Christian
            blessings and means of grace. It does not,
            like excommunication, pronounce a judicial sentence on particular
            convicted offenders, but solemnly affirms
            general laws of the spiritual kingdom, e.g., in 1 Corinthians 16:22,
            any who love not the Lord, here any who
            tamper with the truth of the Gospel, are pronounced outcasts from
            the faith, and dead to the Spirit of Christ.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 9. <span style="font-weight:normal">ὡς προειρήκαμεν, καὶ ἄρτι
              πάλιν λέγω, εἴ τις ὑμᾶς εὐαγγελίζεται παρ' ὃ
              παρελάβετε, ἀνάθεμα ἔστω.</span></h2>
          <p>
            προειρήκαμεν - we have forewarned you of late [said before]. The
            contrast between this plural and the singular
            λέγω proves that Paul is here referring, not to previous warnings of
            his own by letter, but to joint warnings
            given by his companions Silas and Timothy as well as himself during
            his visit to the Churches. He never speaks
            of himself in the plural number.
          </p>

          <p>
            ὡς προειρήκαμεν, καὶ ἄρτι - as we have forewarned you of late, I say
            again. Our versions interpret προειρήκαμεν
            we have said before and καὶ ἄρτι πάλιν λέγω so say I now again. But
            Greek usage forbids this antithesis between
            προ. and ἄρτι. Προλέγειν means to forewarn, not to say in time past
            (cf. 2 Corinthians 13:2, Galatians 5:21, 1
            Thessalonians 3:4); while ἄρτι is used indifferently of recent or of
            present time. In Matthew 9:18, 1
            Thessalonians 3:6 it means of late, in Matthew 26:53, John 13:7;
            John 13:37; John 16:12; John 16:31, 1
            Corinthians 13:12; 1 Corinthians 16:7 it means now, by way of
            contrast with the future. Ἄρτι cannot therefore be
            used to contrast the present time with the immediate past. The words
            καὶ ἄρτι belong really to the preceding
            clause, and contain a reminder how recent had been the warnings
            which the Apostle is repeating. Since the
            rendering of John 9:25 Whereas I was blind, now I see appears to
            contradict this view of ἄρτι, it may be well to
            point out that ὤν does not mean whereas I was, but that the speaker's
            real meaning was, I being (sc., by nature)
            blind now see. The true rendering is of some historical importance,
            as evidence that warnings on the subject of
            circumcision had been given to the Galatians by Paul and his
            companions during a recent visit.
