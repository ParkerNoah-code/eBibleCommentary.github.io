      <h2>A. Setup: Man's Gospel, Paul's Past (1:10-14)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 10. <em>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "Vice mimics virtue, and the tares strive to be thought wheat, growing like the wheat in appearance, but being detected by good judges from the taste... We have need therefore of divine grace, and of a sober mind, and of eyes that see, lest from eating tares as wheat we suffer harm from ignorance, and lest from taking the wolf to be a sheep we become his prey... for, as the Scripture says, <em>he goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour</em>...
        </p>

        The Greeks on the one hand draw men away by their smooth tongue, <em>for honey drops from a harlot's lips</em> whereas they of the Circumcision deceive those who come to them by means of the Divine Scriptures, which they miserably misinterpret though studying them from childhood to old age, and growing old in ignorance. But the children of heretics, by their good words and smooth tongue, deceive the hearts of the innocent, disguising with the name of Christ as it were with honey the poisoned arrows of their impious doctrines: concerning all of whom together the Lord says, <em>Take heed lest any man mislead you</em>." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310104.htm" target="_blank"><span>Catechetical Lecture</span></a>, 4, 1 and 2).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 11. <em>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Hippolytus writes, "There is, brethren, one God, the knowledge of whom we gain from the Holy Scriptures, and from no other source. For just as a man, if he wishes to be skilled in the wisdom of this world, will find himself unable to get at it in any other way than by mastering the dogmas of philosophers, so all of us who wish to practise piety will be unable to learn its practice from any other quarter than the oracles of God. Whatever things, then, the Holy Scriptures declare, at these let us took; and whatsoever things they teach, these let us learn; and as the Father wills our belief to be, let us believe; and as He wills the Son to be glorified, let us glorify Him; and as He wills the Holy Spirit to be bestowed, let us receive Him. Not according to our own will, nor according to our own mind, nor yet as using violently those things which are given by God, but even as He has chosen to teach them by the Holy Scriptures, so let us discern them." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0521.htm" target="_blank"><span>Against Noetus</span></a>, 9)
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 12. <em>For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Gregory of Nyssa writes, "Now they charge us with innovation, and frame their complaint against us in this way:— They allege that while we confess three Persons we say that there is one goodness, and one power, and one Godhead... But the ground of their complaint is that their custom does not admit this, and Scripture does not support it. What then is our reply? We do not think that it is right to make their prevailing custom the law and rule of sound doctrine. For if custom is to avail for proof of soundness, we too, surely, may advance our prevailing custom; and if they reject this, we are surely not bound to follow theirs. Let the inspired Scripture, then, be our umpire, and the vote of truth will surely be given to those whose dogmas are found to agree with the Divine words." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2904.htm" target="_blank"><span>On the Holy Trinity</span></a>, para 2).
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Thomas Aquinas, answering whether it must be said that the three persons are of one essence, raises and responds to an objection: 
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        "Objection 2. Further, nothing is to be affirmed of God except what can be confirmed by the authority of Holy Writ, as appears from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i). Now Holy Writ never says that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are of one essence. Therefore this should not be asserted.
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Reply to Objection 2. Although we may not find it declared in Holy Writ in so many words that the three persons are of one essence, nevertheless we find it so stated as regards the meaning; for instance, 'I and the Father are one (John 10:30),' and 'I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 10:38)'; and there are many other texts of the same import." (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17611/pg17611.html" target="_blank"><span>Summa Theologica</span></a>, I.39.2). 
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 13. <em>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 14. <em>I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</em></h2>
