      <h2>I. Faith Working through Love (5:1-12)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 1. <em>Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and donâ€™t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 2. <em>Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 3. <em>Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 4. <em>You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 5. <em>For we through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 6. <em>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to anything, but faith working through love.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Marius Victorinus comments, "Everywhere Paul states that when it comes to faith, all else ceases to count. This means social status, gender, or anything done that concerns the body, whether about, on, or for the sake of the body: circumcision, works, and other practices of this sort. None of these, he says, counts as anything in Christ." (<a href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment(BookFi.org).pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>, translated by Stephen Andrew Cooper, pg. 330).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 7. <em>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 8. <em>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 9. <em>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Marius Victorinus comments, "For faith liberates, and anyone, as we have said, who hopes for help in any way besides Christ, even if it be along with Christ, does not have faith." (<a href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment(BookFi.org).pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>, translated by Stephen Andrew Cooper, pg. 332).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 10. <em>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 11. <em>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Ambrose writes, "With regard to those who say that more would have believed if circumcision had not been instituted, let them receive this answer, that more would have believed if there had been no martyrdom, but the constancy of a few is to be preferred to the remissness of a larger number. For as many kinds of washings preceded, because that one true Sacrament of Baptism with water and the Spirit, whereby the whole man is redeemed, was to follow, so also the circumcision of many was to precede, because the circumcision of the Lord's Passion, which Jesus suffered as the Lamb of God, that He might <em>take away the sins of the world</em>, was to follow." (<a href="https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_08_letters71_80.htm" target="_blank"><span>Ambrose to Constantius</span></a>, Letter LXXII, 18).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 12. <em>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</em></h2>
