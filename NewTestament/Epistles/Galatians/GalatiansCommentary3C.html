      <h2>C. Law and Promise (3:15-22)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 15. <em>Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Origen writes, "These points now being briefly established, viz., regarding the deity of Christ, and the fulfilment of all that was prophesied respecting Him, I think that this position also has been made good, viz., that the Scriptures themselves, which contained these predic­tions, were divinely inspired, — those, namely, which had either foretold His advent, or the power of His doctrine, or the bringing over of all nations (to His obedience). To which this remark must be added, that the divinity and inspiration both of the predictions of the prophets and of the law of Moses have been clearly revealed and confirmed, especially since the advent of Christ into the world...
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        If any one, moreover, consider the words of the prophets with all the zeal and reverence which they deserve, it is certain that, in the perusal and careful examination thus given them, he will feel his mind and senses touched by a divine breath, and will acknowledge that the words which he reads were no human utterances, but the language of God; and from his own emotions he will feel that these books were the composition of no human skill, nor of any mortal eloquence, but, so to speak, of a style that is divine. The splendour of Christ's advent, therefore, illuminating the law of Moses by the light of truth, has taken away that veil which had been placed over the letter (of the law), and has unsealed, for every one who believes upon Him, all the blessings which were concealed by the covering of the word." (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04124.htm" target="_blank"><span>On First Principles</span></a>, 4.1.6).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19a. <em>Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19b. <em>It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 20. <em>Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        B. B. Warfield writes, " 'None is God,' says he, 'but one' (1 Cor 8:4); and he says it, as we have seen, in immediate connection with his recognition of 'one God, the Father' and 'one Lord, Jesus Christ' (cf. Rom 3:30, 16:27, Gal 3:20, Eph 4:6, 1 Tim 2:5). How, then, could he mean to set by the side of this 'one God the Father' the 'one Lord Jesus Christ' as a second, although somewhat inferior, God? And nothing could exceed the clearness and emphasis with which Paul represents Jesus' divine majesty not as an attainment but as an aboriginal possession." (<a href="https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/warfield/The%20Lord%20of%20Glory%20-%20B.%20B.%20Warfield.pdf" target="_blank"><span>The Lord of Glory</span></a>, pg 134).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 21. <em>Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 22. <em>But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John of Damascus writes, "So let us knock at the very beautiful paradise of the Scriptures... Let us not knock casually, but with eagerness and persistence, and let us not lose heart while knocking, for so it will be opened to us. Should we read once and then a second time and still not understand what we are reading, let us not be discouraged. Rather, let us persist, let us meditate and inquire... let us draw everflowing and most pure waters springing up into life everlasting... for they contain the grace which cannot be exhausted." (Orthodox Faith: Book 4, The Fathers of the Church: A New Translation, vol 37, ch 17, pg 374). 
        </p>

      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Hugh of Saint Victor writes, "All of Sacred Scripture is contained in two testaments, namely the Old and the New Testament…(the) writings of the Fathers are not included in the text of the Sacred Scriptures, just as in the Old Testament there are some books that not included in the canon but are still read. 
        </p>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        Hence the holy Fathers, taught by the Holy Spirt, accepted only four authoritative Gospels…Paul wrote fourteen letters... there are seven canonical letters…Luke…wrote his Gospel to Theophilus, to whom he also dedicated his Acts of the Apostles…John the Apostle wrote the Apocalypse…These are the writers of the sacred books, who speaking by the Holy Spirit, wrote down for our instruction the precepts and rule of living. Besides these there are other volumes that are called apocryphal…Their origin is obscure and the holy fathers do not tell us by whom they were written. There is some truth in them, but because of their many errors they nevertheless have no canonical authority." (On the Sacred Scripture, pgs 219 and 222).
