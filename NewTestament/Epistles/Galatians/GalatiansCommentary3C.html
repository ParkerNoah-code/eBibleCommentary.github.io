      <h2>C. Law and Promise (3:15-22)</h2>
      <h2>Ver 15. <em>Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 16. <em>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. He doesn’t say, “To descendants”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, which is Christ.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 17. <em>Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 18. <em>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19a. <em>Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 19b. <em>It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 20. <em>Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        B. B. Warfield writes, " 'None is God,' says he, 'but one' (1 Cor 8:4); and he says it, as we have seen, in immediate connection with his recognition of 'one God, the Father' and 'one Lord, Jesus Christ' (cf. Rom 3:30, 16:27, Gal 3:20, Eph 4:6, 1 Tim 2:5). How, then, could he mean to set by the side of this 'one God the Father' the 'one Lord Jesus Christ' as a second, although somewhat inferior, God? And nothing could exceed the clearness and emphasis with which Paul represents Jesus' divine majesty not as an attainment but as an aboriginal possession." (<a href="https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/warfield/The%20Lord%20of%20Glory%20-%20B.%20B.%20Warfield.pdf" target="_blank"><span>The Lord of Glory</span></a>, pg 134).
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 21. <em>Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        
        </p>

      <h2>Ver 22. <em>But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</em></h2>
      <p><span class="tab"></span>
        John of Damascus writes, "So let us knock at the very beautiful paradise of the Scriptures... Let us not knock casually, but with eagerness and persistence, and let us not lose heart while knocking, for so it will be opened to us. Should we read once and then a second time and still not understand what we are reading, let us not be discouraged. Rather, let us persist, let us meditate and inquire... let us draw everflowing and most pure waters springing up into life everlasting... for they contain the grace which cannot be exhausted." (Orthodox Faith: Book 4, The Fathers of the Church: A New Translation, vol 37, ch 17, pg 374).
