      <h1>Justification by Faith Alone</h1>
        <h2>Early Christians</h2>
        <p>Marius Victorinus:</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
            (1:6) "The gospel Paul announces is sure: that Christ is the Son of God, the power of God for salvation to all that believe, to the Greeks and to the Jews—and nothing besides! In fact, all hope for salvation and for the grace of God pertaining to us lies in faith pertaining to Christ, to the effect that we would believe he is the Son of God, that he suffered for our sake and rose again, from which we too might arise with the forgiveness of sins. This is the true gospel that Paul announces. Therefore, if anyone adds on something else—like Judaism, circumcision, sabbath observance, and other things of this sort—he is sinning and is a stranger to the truth." (<a href="https://library.mibckerala.org/lms_frame/eBook/%5BStephen_Andrew_Cooper%5D_Marius_Victorinus%27_Comment(BookFi.org).pdf" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on Galatians</span></a>, pg. 253).
            </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          (2:21) "<em>I am not ungrateful to God’s grace</em>, so that, God having redeemed me through Christ and Christ having handed himself over for my sake, I would return to the hope of the Law—all the hope I have in Christ being disregarded—and would believe myself to be justified based on the works of the Law. That would be ungrateful to the one who did so much for me, who for my sake would put himself in the line of fire in order to liberate me from my sins by taking their penalties upon himself."

            </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          (5:9) "For faith liberates, and anyone, as we have said, who hopes for help in any way besides Christ, even if it be along with Christ, does not have faith."

        <h2>Medieval Christians</h2>
        <p>Claudius of Turin:</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          (3:2) "And in so far as one progresses in God's work and love, by so much the more will he have in himself the mighty works of the Holy Spirit which hearing with faith, not works of the law, brings to completion. Not that works of the law should be despised and simple faith be grasped apart from them, but that the works themselves are adorned by faith in Christ." (Commentary on Galatians).
            </p>

        <h2>Reformation or Post-Reformation Christians</h2>
        <p>Charles Spurgeon:</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
            (2:21) "They who say that the death of Christ goes only part of the way, but that man must do something in order to merit eternal life,— these, I say, make this death of Christ to be only partially effective, and, in yet clearer terms, ineffectual in and of itself. If it be even hinted that the blood of Jesus is not price enough till man adds his silver or his gold, then his blood is not our redemption at all, and Christ is no Redeemer! If it be taught that our Lord’s bearing of sin for us did not make a perfect atonement, and that it is ineffectual till we either do or suffer something to complete it, then in the supplemental work lies the real virtue, and Christ’s work is in itself insufficient. His death cry of 'It is finished,' must have been all a mistake, if still it is not finished; and if a believer in Christ is not completely saved by what Christ has done, but must do something himself to complete it, then salvation was not finished, and the Saviour’s work remains imperfect till we, poor sinners, lend a hand to make up for his deficiencies. What blasphemy lies in such a supposition!" (<a href="https://www.spurgeongems.org/sermon/chs1534.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Salvation by Works, a Criminal Doctrine</span></a>).

        <p>Ambrose:</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          (1:3) “Thus I do not have the wherewithal to enable me to glory in my own works, I do not have the wherewithal to boast of myself, and so I will glory in Christ. I will not glory because I have been redeemed. I will not glory because I am free of sins, but because sins have been forgiven me. I will not glory because I am profitable or because anyone is profitable to me, but because Christ is an advocate in my behalf with the Father, because the blood of Christ has been poured out in my behalf.” (<a href="https://www.angelfire.com/ny4/djw/ambrose.lawandgospel.html" target="_blank"><span>Jacob and the Happy Life</span></a>, I:17-18).

        <p>Cyril of Alexandria:</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          (1:7) "We must try therefore and that most straitly, writings on the Divine doctrines, and if any should go along with the sacred Scriptures and speed its clear and most unerring way therein, let it be acclaimed by us too with testimonies to its orthodoxy: but if it form its language cold and astray and amiss, yea rather giver of destruction to the readers, let it hear from every mouth, <em>But ye are uttering and telling us another error</em>."

          <p>Abelard</p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            (1:1) "Whence even the teacher Augustine, cited above, in Book One of his Retractions: 'It is written,' he says, 'you do not avoid sin by loquacity.' And also 'The apostle James says (James 1:19), <em>Let every man be swift to hear but slow to speak</em>.’ And ' (James 3:2) <em>For in many things we all offend. If anyone does not offend in word, he is a perfect man</em>. I do not claim this perfection for myself even now, when I am an old man – how much less when as a young man I began to write.' And in the prologue to Book Three of the On the Trinity (proem 2): 'Do not defer to my writings as if they were canonical scriptures, but whatever you would find in the canonical scriptures that you did not believe, believe steadfastly...' Nor ought we to regard the arguments of anyone, no matter how Catholic and well-regarded, in the way we regard the canonical scriptures."

        <h2>Early Christians</h2>
          <p>John Chrysostom:</p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            (1:4) "Thus it appears, that the ministry which He undertook was free and uncompelled; that He was delivered up by Himself, not by another. Let not therefore the words of John, that the Father gave His only-begotten Son for us, lead you to derogate from the dignity of the Only-begotten, or conceive any thing of earth in Him... He says not 'by the command,' but 'according to the will,' for inasmuch as there is an unity of will in the Father and the Son, that which the Son wills, the Father wills also" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentary00newmuoft/page/n23/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians</span></a>).

        <p>F. F. Bruce:</p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
            (1:2) "The question of the North or South Galatian destination of our epistle is not one in which it is proper to take up partisan attitudes or indulge in  dogmatic assertions; and it ill becomes champions of either view to disparage the rival view of those who maintain it. The fact that so many competent scholars can be cited in  support of either position suggests that the evidence for neither is absolutely conclusive. But the weight of the evidence, it seems to me, favours the South Galatian view. If the Epistle to the Galatians was indeed addressed to the churches of Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Oerbe, then we have important historical, geographical, literary and epigraphic data which will provide material for its better understanding."
