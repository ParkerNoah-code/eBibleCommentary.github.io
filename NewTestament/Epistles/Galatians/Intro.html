          <h1>Introduction</h1>

          <h2>Author</h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>Internal evidence: The contents in the
            Epistle to the Galatians strongly suggest Pauline authorship. The
            letter
            exhibits Paul's distinct style, vocabulary, and theological
            emphases, which are consistent with his other letters. The
            passionate and forceful tone of the letter reflects Paul's personal
            investment in the Galatian churches and his authoritative stance as
            an apostle. Moreover, Paul's personal experiences, as mentioned in
            the letter, align with what is known about his life from other
            sources. He refers to his conversion experience (Galatians 1:11-17)
            and his meeting with the apostles in Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1-10).
            These accounts correspond with details found in the Book of Acts and
            Paul's other letters, reinforcing the link between the
            author of Galatians and the historical figure of Paul.</p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>External evidence: The information derived
            from early Christian writings and historical testimonies, further
            supports Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Galatians. The
            earliest extant Christian sources consistently attribute the letter
            to Paul. Early Church fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and
            Clement of Alexandria recognized the letter as Paul's work,
            demonstrating the widespread recognition and acceptance of its
            authorship in the
            early Christian community. Additionally, the letter's inclusion in
            the canon of the New Testament, alongside other Pauline
            letters, attests to its authorship by Paul. The early church also
            recognized the theological and doctrinal coherence between Galatians
            and Paul's other letters, further affirming their belief in his
            authorship.</p>

          <h2>Date</h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>While there is some uncertainty
            surrounding the date of Galatians because of the limited historical
            information available and the complexities of reconstructing the
            timeline of Paul's missionary activities, scholars generally agree
            that the letter was written in the late 40s or early 50s AD.
            There are three
            primary views (note that views 1 and 2 sometimes overlap): (1)
            Proponents of the early date, in the late 40s or
            early 50's,
            argue that the
            meeting in Jerusalem mentioned in Galatians 2:1-10 corresponds to
            the Jerusalem Council described in Acts 15 which is dated
            around 48-49 and typically follow the South Galatian view. (2)
            Proponents of a middle dating, in the early 50's, typically follow
            the North Galatian view in which case it would have taken Paul a
            longer time to reach them. (3) Proponents of a late dating, in the
            late 50's to early 60's, often believe the gravity of the issues at
            stake necessitate a longer timeframe.</p>

          <h2>Audience</h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>The matter of whether the Epistle was
            intended for the churches in North or South Galatia is an ongoing
            question. Although many scholars can be found supporting both
            positions, the evidence appears to me to lean towards the South
            Galatian view. If the Epistle to the Galatians was directed
            to the churches in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe,
            there is important historical, geographical, literary, and
            epigraphic data that would contribute to a better understanding of
            the letter (See <a
              href="https://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bjrl/problems-2_bruce.pdf"
              target="_blank"><span>F. F. Bruce</span></a>).</p>

          <h2>Occasion and Background</h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>Paul had previously established churches
            in this region during his missionary journeys. The
            occasion that prompted Paul to write this letter was the arrival of
            false teachers who were promoting a distorted version of the Gospel
            among the Galatian believers. These teachers, often referred to as
            "Judaizers," insisted that Gentile converts to Christianity needed
            to be circumcised and adhere to Jewish laws in order to be justified
            before God. The Judaizers sought to undermine Paul's authority and
            discredit his message, causing confusion and division among the
            believers. Recognizing the gravity of the situation and the
            potential danger of the Galatians abandoning the true Gospel, Paul
            writes Galatians as a passionate defense of his apostleship and a
            clear articulation of the Gospel of grace. Paul maintains the purity
            of the Gospel message of faith in Jesus Christ in opposition to the
            false apostles whose doctrine was not entirely different than Pual's,
            but corrupted by false additions (Gal 1:9).</p>

          <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>The overarching message of Galatians is
            the central theme of justification by faith. Paul emphasizes that a
            person is declared righteous before God, not by observing the law,
            but through faith in Jesus Christ. Salvation is a gift of God's
            grace, received by faith alone, and not by human effort or merit.
            Paul emphasizes the freedom that believers have in
            Christ enabling them to live in a new covenant of grace, as opposed
            to the bondage and futility of trying to attain righteousness
            through the law. In the new covenant of grace, there is neither Jew
            nor Gentile, but all who have faith in Christ are one family, heirs
            to the promise given to Abraham. The message of Galatians resonates
            with the ongoing struggle of balancing faith and works, grace and
            legalism, and the purity of the Gospel. It serves as a forceful
            reminder of the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and the danger of
            adding human effort or external requirements to the message of
            salvation.</p>

          <h2>Key Themes</h2>
          <p><span class="tab"></span><a
              href="../../../SystematicTheology/Salvation/Justification/Justification.html"><span>Justification</span></a>:
            The theme of justification by faith is a central and foundational
            concept in the Epistle to the Galatians. Throughout the letter, the
            apostle Paul passionately argues that justification is by faith in
            Christ
            for salvation and rejects any form of reliance on works of the law
            (Gal 3:28) or human effort (Gal 3:11). Paul vehemently opposes the
            necessity of observing Jewish laws (2:16), particularly circumcision
            (Gal 5:6), as a requirement for salvation and asserts that
            justification—being declared righteous before God—is solely by faith
            in Jesus Christ. It is Christ and his redemptive work on the cross
            that reconciles humanity with God (Gal 1:4) and grants them
            justification as a result of God's grace through faith (Gal 2:21).
            The theme of justification by faith in Galatians serves as a
            reminder of the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and the undeserved
            nature of salvation.
