        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author and Date</h2>
        <p>
          Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter (Eph 6:20; 4:1; 3:1). In
          comparing Ephesians 6:21 and Colossians 4:7, it appears that both
          letters were written during the same imprisonment and dispatched
          together by the same messenger. Most place the composition of this
          letter in Rome during the imprisonment mentioned in Acts 28:16 and
          28:30-31 (62-64 A.D.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some critics have questioned Paul's authorship, arguing that Ephesians
          differs in style from his other epistles and contains words not found
          in his other letters. However, it is natural for a great writer like
          Paul to vary his style and vocabulary depending on his purpose. This
          can be seen in the different styles of Shakespeare's Hamlet compared
          to A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Taming of the Shrew, or the Sonnets.
          Even an average writer will greatly change their vocabulary and style
          depending on the context. A letter to one's boss will sound very
          different than a letter to one's family member.
        </p>
        <h2>The City of Ephesus</h2>
        <p>
          Next to Rome, Ephesus was the most important city visited by Paul. It
          has been called the third capital of Christianity, it being the center
          of work in Asia through which were founded all the churches of Asia,
          especially the seven churches of Asia to which Jesus sent the message
          of Revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded by colonists from Athens around the eleventh century B.C.,
          Ephesus displaced the original inhabitants and developed into a
          significant Greek civilization. Ephesus held a pivotal position as the
          gateway to Asia during ancient times. Its strategic location
          contributed to its growth, making it a sought-after military prize for
          various naval states of Greece and successive kingdoms ruling over
          Asia Minor, including the Lydians and the Persians. Even Alexander the
          Great received homage from Ephesian rulers in 334 B.C., and later in
          188 B.C., the Romans took control of the city from Antiochus the
          Great.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Paul's time, Ephesus was among the three major trading centers in
          the eastern Mediterranean, alongside Alexandria and Antioch. It served
          as the commercial and political capital of Asia and owed much of its
          importance to the religious significance attributed to the city. The
          city boasted an estimated population of around one-third of a million
          people in the first century. It held the status of a free city under
          Roman rule, with its own assembly, council, and governor. The town
          clerk, responsible for city records, held a position of considerable
          influence and responsibility.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Ephesian Landmarks</h2>
        <p>The Temple of Diana:</p>
        <p>
          The structure is said to have measured approximately 425 feet in
          length and 239 feet in width, supported by an impressive array of 100
          columns, each standing 55 feet tall. Its construction spanned a period
          of 220 years. Surrounding this grand shrine, which attracted both
          worshippers and tourists from distant places, there thrived a bustling
          community of tradesmen and hucksters. They catered to the needs of
          visitors by providing food, lodging, dedicatory offerings, and
          especially silver souvenir models of the shrine, a specialty of the
          Demetrius guild (Acts 19:38).
        </p>
        <p>
          The city of Ephesus was founded near the sanctuary of an ancient
          Anatolian goddess, whom the Greeks equated with their own deity,
          Artemis. This goddess was associated with fertility rituals and
          religious practices involving prostitution. The depiction of Artemis
          in Ephesus was a peculiar one, with a female figure adorned with a
          shrine and a basket on her head, a veil decorated with various
          creatures, long necklaces, embroidered sleeves, and legs covered with
          images of animals. She was often represented with multiple breasts or
          an apron adorned with clusters of grapes or dates, symbolizing her
          role as the nurturing spirit of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the prevalence of the Artemis cult and its influence in the
          city, the apostle Paul boldly preached against it and the cultural
          practices associated with it. He confronted the stronghold of pagan
          religion, as well as the active commercial life revolving around the
          extensive heathen worship, in this key city of the central
          Mediterranean and a vital communication hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul's message against idolatry had a significant impact on the city,
          causing disruptions in various related trades. Ephesus, being a
          prominent center of communication and commerce in Asia Minor, became a
          crucial starting point for the spread of Christianity to the
          surrounding regions. From Ephesus, the gospel reached other cities in
          Asia Minor, such as Pergamum, Sardis, Thyatira, Laodicea,
          Philadelphia, Smyrna, Colosse, and Hierapolis. The transformative
          influence of Paul's preaching was akin to confronting gambling in Las
          Vegas, homosexuality in San Francisco, or Islam in Iran, affecting the
          very heart of Ephesian culture and society.
        </p>
        <p>The Theater:</p>
        <p>
          The Ephesian Theater was positioned on the southern slope of Mount
          Pion, providing a stunning backdrop and enhancing its acoustics due to
          the natural amphitheater-like setting. The theater could accommodate
          approximately 25,000 spectators, making it one of the largest theaters
          in the ancient world. It hosted such activites as theatrical
          performances, musical concerts, religious ceremonies, political
          gatherings, public gatherings, festivals, and possibly even
          gladitorial contests although these were usually held in dedicated
          arenas.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          Paul had briefly touched base here on his second journey (Acts
          18:19-21). Then around 54 A.D., on his third journey Paul came to
          Ephesus and stayed for 3 years. (Acts 19:1; 19:10; 20:31). From the
          book of Acts and this letter we know the church had elders (Acts
          20:17). It was composed of many Christians from a Gentile background
          (Eph 2:1; 2:11; 3:1). This congregation would face the lure of false
          teachers (Acts 20:28-31), and yet the Ephesian letter does not really
          meet any specific false teaching head on, as does Galatians or
          Colossians, and the members here dearly loved Paul (Acts 20:36-38).
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          The Ephesians had been instructed by Paul in the pure doctrine of the
          gospel during Paul's long stay there. At a later period, while he was
          a prisoner at Rome, and perceiving that they needed confirmation, he
          wrote to them the present Epistle. It has been said to contain the
          profoundest truth revealed to men, and the church at Ephesus was,
          perhaps, better prepared than any other to be the custodian of such
          truth, having been so well prepared them to hear and understand it. It
          may have been written as a circular letter to be sent in turn to
          several churches of which the church at Ephesus was one.
