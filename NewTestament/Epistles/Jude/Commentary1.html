              >Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those
              who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and kept for Jesus
              Christ:</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ</em>. Jude, the brother of the
            Lord. And though a brother of Jesus by the flesh, he calls himself
            "a servant of Jesus Christ." Though this is a title common to all
            believers, yet here, and in some other places, it is peculiar to an
            apostle, or minister of the Gospel; and therefore is used not merely
            in humility, and to acknowledge obedience to Christ, but as a title
            of dignity and honour.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, no doubt, he who declares himself to be the servant of God,
            includes both these things, that is, that God is the bestower of the
            office which he exercises, and that he faithfully performs what has
            been committed to him. Many act falsely, and falsely boast to be
            what they are very far from being: we ought always to examine
            whether the reality corresponds with the profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And brother of James</em>. He mentions a name more celebrated
            than his own, and more known to the churches. For though
            faithfulness of doctrine and authority do not depend on the names of
            mortal men, yet it is a confirmation to the faith, when the
            integrity of the man who undertakes the office of a teacher is made
            certain to us. This James must have been well known as to need no
            further description; and there was but one James at that time of
            whom this could be said, namely James the brother of the Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To those who are called</em>. Not merely externally by the
            ministry of the word, but internally by the Spirit and grace of God;
            so that this is to be understood of a special and effectual call,
            whereby souls are called out of darkness into light, and from
            bondage to liberty; and from a dependence on themselves to the grace
            and righteousness of Christ; and from society with the men of the
            world to fellowship with him; and to eternal glory, so as to have
            faith and hope concerning it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sanctified by God the Father</em>. Which is to be understood not
            of internal sanctification, which is usually ascribed to the Spirit
            of God, but of the act of eternal election, which is peculiar to God
            the Father; in which sense Christ is said to be sanctified by the
            Father, and men ordained and appointed to an office, and vessels are
            set apart the owner's use (Jn 10:36 and Jer 1:5). The language is
            taken from the ceremonial law, by which persons and things were
            sanctified, or set apart for sacred use and service (Ex 13:2);
          </p>
          <p>
            So the elect of God are by God the Father sanctified and set apart
            in the act of election, which is expressed by this word; partly
            because of its separating nature, men being by it separated from the
            rest of the world, to the use and service of God, and for his glory,
            so that they are a distinct and peculiar people; and partly because
            such are chosen through sanctification of the Spirit, and unto
            holiness both in this world and that which is to come; so that the
            doctrine of election is no licentious doctrine; for though holiness
            is not the cause of it, yet is a means fixed in it, and is certain
            by it, and an evidence of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And kept for Jesus Christ</em>. They were not preserved from
            falling in Adam, with the rest of mankind, nor from the corruption
            of human nature, nor from actual sins and transgressions; yet,
            notwithstanding these, were so preserved that the law could not
            execute the sentence of condemnation on them, nor sin damn them, nor
            Satan, who led them captive, hale them to prison; and after calling,
            they are preserved not from indwelling sin, nor from the temptations
            of Satan, nor from doubts and fears and unbelief, nor from slips and
            falls into sin; but from the tyranny and dominion of sin, from being
            devoured by Satan, and from a total and final falling away. They are
            preserved in the love of God, and of Christ; in the covenant of
            grace; in a state of justification and adoption; and in the paths of
            truth, faith, and holiness; and are preserved safe to the heavenly
            kingdom and glory.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 2.
            <em>May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>May mercy</em>. In this salutation the apostle wishes for a
            multiplication of "mercy", from God the Father, by whom these
            persons were sanctified: mercy is a perfection in God; and shows
            itself in a special manner towards the elect, in the covenant of
            grace, in the provision of Christ as a Saviour, in the mission of
            him into this world, in redemption by him, in the forgiveness of
            sin, in regeneration, and in their whole salvation; and the
            multiplication of it intends an enlarged view and fresh application
            of it, which they sometimes stand in need of, as under desertions,
            when they want the sense and manifestation of it to them; and under
            temptations and afflictions, when they need sympathy and compassion;
            and when they fall into sin they stand in need of the fresh
            discoveries and application of pardoning mercy to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Peace</em>. Moreover, herein is wished for a multiplication of
            "peace" from Christ, in whom these chosen ones were preserved; and
            may design a fresh and enlarged view of peace being made for them by
            his blood, and an increase of conscience peace in their own hearts,
            as the effect of it; and may include peace, and an abundance of it,
            among themselves, as well as all prosperity, both external,
            internal, and eternal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And love be multiplied to you</em>. Likewise in the salutation,
            "love", and a multiplication of it is wished for from the Spirit of
            God, by whom they were called; and may be understood of the love
            with which God loved them; and which may be said to be multiplied,
            when it is gradually shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, and
            they are by degrees led into it more and more, and the acts of it
            are drawn out and set before them one after another, and fresh
            manifestations of it are made unto them; as in afflictive
            providences, after the hidings of God's face, and under temptations:
            and it may design the love with which they love God, which may be
            increased and made to abound more and more.
