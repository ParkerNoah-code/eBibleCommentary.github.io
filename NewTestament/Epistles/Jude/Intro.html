        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          The Muratorian Canon accepts Jude, but indicates that it was doubted
          by some. Clement of Alexandria commented on it, and Tertullian quotes
          it by name. Origen acknowledges that there were doubts as to the
          canonicity of Jude, but does not seem to have shared them. Didymus of
          Alexandria defends the Epistle against those who questioned its
          authority on account of the use made in it of apocryphal books.
          Eusebius reckoned it with the Antilegomena; but it was accepted as
          canonical by the third council of Carthage in 397 A. D.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author designates himself as “Jude the servant of Jesus Christ,
          and brother of James.” There are several persons of that name
          mentioned in the New Testament, of which only two can come in
          consideration here, however, viz. Jude, the brother of the Lord, Mat
          13:55; Mk 6:3, and Jude the apostle, Lk 6:16; Acts 1:13, also called
          Lebbeus, Mat 10:3, and Thaddeus, Mk 3:18. It appears to us that the
          author was Jude, the brother of the Lord, because: (1) He seeks to
          give a clear indication of his identity by calling himself, “the
          brother of James.” This James must have been so well known, therefore,
          as to need no further description; and there was but one James at that
          time of whom this could be said, viz. James the brother of the Lord.
          (2) It is inconceivable that an apostle, rather than name his official
          position, should make himself known by indicating his relationship to
          another person, whoever that person might be. (3) Though it is
          possible that the writer, even if he were an apostle, should speak as
          he does in Jude 1:17, that passage seems to imply that he stood
          outside of the apostolic circle. - In favor of the view that the
          author was the apostle Jude, some have appealed to Lk 6:16; Acts 1:13,
          where the apostle is called ̓Ιούδας ̓Ιαχώβου but it is contrary to
          established usage to supply the word brother in such a case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Very little is known of this Jude. If the order in which the brethren
          of the Lord are named in Scripture is any indication of their age, he
          was the youngest or the youngest but one of the group; compare Mat
          13:55 with Mk 6:3. With his brothers he was not a believer in Jesus
          during the Lord’s public ministry, Jn 7:5, but evidently embraced him
          by faith after the resurrection, Acts 1:14. For the rest we can only
          gather from 1 Cor 9:5 respecting the brethren of the Lord in general,
          undoubtedly with the exception of James, who resided at Jerusalem,
          that they traveled about with their wives, willing workers for the
          Kingdom of God, and were even known at Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authenticity of the Epistle has been doubted, because: (1)The
          author speaks of faith in the objective sense, Ths a fides quae
          creditur, Jude 1:3, Jude 1:20, a usage that points to the
          post-apostolic period; (2) He mentions the apostles as persons who
          lived in the distant past, Jude 1:17; and (3) he evidently combats the
          second century heresy of the Carpocratians. But these grounds are very
          questionable indeed. The word faith is employed in the objective sense
          elsewhere in the New Testament, most certainly in the Pastorals, and
          probably also in Rom 10:8; Gal 1:23; Php 1:27. And there is nothing
          impossible in the assumption that that meaning should have become
          current in the time of the apostles. The manner in which Jude mentions
          the apostles does not necessarily imply that they had all passed away
          before this letter was composed. At most the death of a few is
          implied. But we agree with Dr. Chase, when he judges that the
          supposition that the apostles were dispersed in such a way that their
          voice could not at the time reach the persons to whom this letter is
          addressed, meets all the requirements of the case. Hastings D. B. Art.
          Jude. The assumption that the heretics referred to were second century
          Carpocratians, is entirely gratuitous; it rests on a mistaken
          interpretation of three passages, viz, the Jude 1:4 b, Jude 1:8, Jude
          1:19.
        </p>
        <h2>Destination</h2>
        <p>
          Jude addresses his Epistle to “those that are sanctified by God the
          Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called.” On account of the
          very general character of this designation some, as Ewald, regard the
          Epistle as a circular letter; but the contents of the Epistle are
          against this assumption. Yet we are left entirely to conjecture as to
          the particular locality in which the readers dwelt. Some scholars, e.
          g. Alford and Zahn, believe that the Epistle was written to Jewish
          readers, but we are inclined to think with Weiss, Chase, Bigg, Baljon
          e. a. that the recipients of the letter were Gentile Christians, (1)
          because the letter is so closely related to II Peter, which was sent
          to the Christians of Asia Minor; and (2) since the heresies to which
          it refers are known to have arisen in Gentile churches. Cf. especially
          I Corinthians and the letters to the seven churches in the Apocalypse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many expositors are inclined to look for the first readers in Asia
          Minor on account of the resemblance of the heresies mentioned in the
          Epistle to those referred to in II Peter. But possibly it is better to
          hold with Chase that the letter was sent to Syrian Antioch and the
          surrounding district, since they had evidently received oral
          instruction from the apostles generally, and were therefore most
          likely in the vicinity of Palestine. Moreover Jude may have felt some
          special responsibility for the church in that vicinity since the death
          of his brother James.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the condition of the readers there was cause for alarm. The danger
          that Peter saw as a cloud on the distant horizon, Jude espied as a
          leaven that was already working in the ranks of his readers. False
          brethren had crept into the church who were, it would seem, practical
          libertines, enemies of the cross of Christ, who abused their Christian
          liberty (Alford, Salmon, Weiss, Chase), and not at the same time
          heretical teachers (Zahn, Baljon). Perhaps they were no teachers at
          all. Their life was characterized by lasciviousness, Jude 1:4,
          especially fornication, Jude 1:7-8; Jude 1:11, mockery, Jude 1:10,
          ungodliness, Jude 1:15, murmuring, complaining, pride and greed, Jude
          1:16. Their fundamental error seems to have been that they despised
          and spoke evil of the authorities that were placed over them. They
          were Antinomians and certainly had a great deal in common with the
          Nicolaitans of the Apocalypse.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. The danger to which these Christians were
          thus exposed, led to the composition of this Epistle. Apparently Jude
          intended to write to them of the common salvation, when he suddenly
          heard of the grave situation and found it necessary to pen a word of
          warning, 3. In the verse from which we draw this conclusion, the
          author also clearly states his aim, when he says that he deemed it
          imperative to write to them that they should earnestly contend for the
          faith which was once delivered to the saints. In order to do this, he
          pictures to them the disobedient and immoral character of the ungodly
          persons that had unawares crept into the fold and endangered their
          Christian faith and life; reminds them of the fact that God would
          certainly punish those wanton libertines, just as He had punished
          sinners in the past; and exhorts them to stand in faith and to strive
          after holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. We have absolutely no indication of the place where
          this Epistle was written; it is not unlikely, however, that it was at
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the time of its composition we have a terminus ad quem
          in the date of II Peter, about A. D. 67, since that Epistle is
          evidently dependent on Jude. On the other hand it does not seem likely
          that Jude would write such a letter, while his brother James was still
          living, so that we have a terminus a quo in A. D. 62. A date later
          than 62 is also favored by the Pauline words employed in this letter,
          in some of which we seem to have an echo of Ephesians and Colossians.
          Moreover the great similarity between the conditions pictured in this
          letter and those described in II Peter is best explained, if we date
          them in close proximity to each other. We shall not go far wrong in
          dating the Epistle about the year 65.
        </p>
        <p>
          The older critics of the Tubingen school dated the Epistle late in the
          second century, while more recent critics, as Pfleiderer, Holtzmann,
          Julicher, Harnack, Baljon, think it originated about the middle or in
          the first half of the second century. They draw this conclusion from,
          (1) the way in which the writer speaks of faith, Jude 1:3; Jude 1:20;
          (2) the manner in which he refers to the apostles, Jude 1:17; (3) the
          use of the apocryphal books; and (4) the supposed references to the
          doctrines of the Carpocratians. But these arguments can all be met by
          counter-arguments, cf. above.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          As unprincipled men, under the name of Christians, had crept in, whose
          chief object was to lead the unstable and weak to a profane contempt
          of God, Jude first shows, that the faithful ought not to have been
          moved by agents of this kind, by which the Church has always been
          assailed; and yet he exhorts them carefully to beware of such pests.
          And to render them more hateful and detestable, he denounces on them
          the approaching vengeance of God, such as their impiety deserved. Now,
          if we consider what Satan has attempted in our age, from the
          commencement of the revived gospel, and what arts he still busily
          employs to subvert the faith, and the fear of God, what was a useful
          warning in the time of Jude, is more than necessary in our age.
        </p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          1. This Epistle is characterized by its very close resemblance to
          parts of II Peter. Since we have already discussed the relation in
          which the two stand to each other (II Peter), we now simply refer to
          that discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The letter is peculiar also in that it contains quotations from the
          apocryphal books. The story in Jude 1:9 is taken from the Assumption
          of Moses, according to which Michael was commissioned to bury Moses,
          but Satan claimed the body, in the first place because he was the lord
          of matter, and in the second place since Moses had committed murder in
          Egypt. The falsity of the first ground is brought out by Michael, when
          he says: “The Lord rebuke thee, for it was God’s Spirit which created
          the word and all mankind.” He does not reflect on the second. The
          prophecy in Jude 1:14-15 is taken from the Book of Enoch a book that
          was highly esteemed by the early church. According to some the
          statement regarding the fallen angels, Jude 1:6, is also derived from
          it. The latest editor of these writings, R. H. Charles, regards the
          first as a composite work, made up of two distinct books, viz, the
          Testament and the Assumption of Moses, of which the former, and
          possibly also the latter was written in Hebrew between 7 and 29 A. D.
          With respect to the Book of Enoch he holds, “that the larger part of
          the book was written not later than 160 B. C., and that no part of it
          is more recent than the Christian era.” Quoted by Mayor, Exp. Gk.
          Test. V p. 234.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The language of Jude may best be likened to that of his brother
          James. He speaks in a tone of unquestioned authority and writes a
          vigorous style. His Greek, though it has a Jewish complexion, is
          fairly correct; and his descriptions are often just as picturesque as
          those of James, when he compares the intruders to “spots (R. V.
          ‘hidden rocks) in the feasts of charity;” “clouds without water,
          carried along by winds,” “autumn trees without fruit, twice dead,
          plucked up by the roots,” “wild waves of the sea, foaming out their
          own shame ;” etc., Jude 1:12-13. Like James also he employs some words
          that are otherwise exclusively Pauline, as ἀί̈διος, χυριότης,
          οἰχητήριὀ, προγράφειν. Moreover the letter contains a few ἅπαξ
          λεγόμενα.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          In the early Church there was considerable doubt as to the canonicity
          of this epistle especially because it was not written by an apostle
          and contained passage from apocryphal books. There are allusions more
          or less clear to the Epistle in II Peter, Polycarp, Athenagoras and
          Theophilus of Antioch. The Muratorian Canon mentions it, but in a
          manner which implies that it was doubted by some. It is found in the
          old Latin Version, but not in the Peshito. Clement of Alexandria,
          Tertullian and Origen recognized it, though Origen intimates that
          there were doubts regarding its canonicity. Eusebius doubted its
          canonical authority, but the council of Carthage (397) accepted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Epistle of Jude we have the Christian war-cry, resounding
          through the ages: Contend earnestly for the faith that was once
          delivered unto the saints! This letter, the last of the New Testament,
          teaches with great emphasis that apostasy from the true creed with its
          central truths of the atonement of Christ and the permanent validity
          of the law as the rule of life, is assured perdition; and clearly
          reveals for all generations the inseparable connection between a
          correct belief and a right mode of living.
        </p>
        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          The writer begins his Epistle with the regular address and apostolic
          blessing, Jude 1:1-2. He informs his readers that he felt it incumbent
          on him to warn them against certain intruders, who deny Christ, lead
          lascivious lives and will certainly be punished like the people
          delivered from Egypt, the fallen angels and the cities of the plain,
          Jude 1:3-7. These intruders are further described as defilers of the
          flesh and as despisers and blasphemers of heavenly dignities, and the
          woe is pronounced on them, Jude 1:8-11. After giving a further
          description of their debauchery, the author exhorts the readers to be
          mindful of the words of the apostles, who had spoken of the appearance
          of such mockers, Jude 1:12-19. Admonishing them to increase in faith
          and to keep themselves in the love of God, and giving them directions
          as to the correct behaviour towards others, he concludes his Epistle
          with a doxology, Jude 1:20-25.
