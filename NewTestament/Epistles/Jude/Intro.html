        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          As unprincipled men, under the name of Christians, had crept in, whose
          chief object was to lead the unstable and weak to a profane contempt
          of God, Jude first shows, that the faithful ought not to have been
          moved by agents of this kind, by which the Church has always been
          assailed; and yet he exhorts them carefully to beware of such pests.
          And to render them more hateful and detestable, he denounces on them
          the approaching vengeance of God, such as their impiety deserved. Now,
          if we consider what Satan has attempted in our age, from the
          commencement of the revived gospel, and what arts he still busily
          employs to subvert the faith, and the fear of God, what was a useful
          warning in the time of Jude, is more than necessary in our age.
