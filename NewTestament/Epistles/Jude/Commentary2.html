              >Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you about our common
              salvation, I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to

            <em>Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you</em>. He was
            indeed glad and anxious to write to them, but yet necessity urged
            him to do so, even because they were assailed (according to what
            follows) by the ungodly, and stood in need of being prepared to
            fight with them. Had they not been forewarned how necessary his
            exhortation was, they might have been slothful and negligent; but
            when he makes this preface, that he wrote on account of the
            necessity of their case, it was the same as though he had blown a
            trumpet to awake them from their torpor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>About our common salvation</em>. The Gospel is sometimes called
            our salvation in opposition to the law, which is a ministration of
            condemnation; and because it is a declaration of salvation, and a
            means of it; and may be said to be "common," because preached to
            all, Jews and Gentiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus Christ the Saviour himself, who is also sometimes called
            "salvation," because he was called and appointed to it, and
            undertook it, and is become the author of it; and may be said to be
            a "common" Saviour, not of all men, but of all his people; of his
            whole body, the church, and every member of it, and of all sorts of
            men, in all nations. He is the one way of salvation, but that is not
            confined to any nation, family, community, or sect among men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or that spiritual and eternal salvation wrought out by him, which is
            common, not to all men, for all are not saved with it, but to all
            the elect of God, and true believers in Christ; the love of God is
            common to them all alike; the choice of them to eternal salvation is
            the same; the covenant of grace, the blessings and promises of it,
            are equally shared by them; and they are bought with the same price
            of Christ's blood, and are justified by the same righteousness, and
            are regenerated, sanctified, and called by the same grace, and shall
            possess the same glory.
          </p>

            <em
              >I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend
              earnestly</em
            >. The persons to be contended with on account of it, are such who
            deny, or depreciate any of the Persons in the Godhead, the assertors
            of the purity and power of human nature, and the deniers of
            sovereign, efficacious, and persevering grace: the persons who are
            to contend with them are all the saints in general, to whom it is
            delivered; which they may do by bearing an external testimony to it,
            by praying for the continuance and success of it, by standing fast
            in one spirit in it, and by dying for it; and particularly the
            ministers of the Gospel, by preaching it boldly, openly, fully, and
            faithfully, by disputing for it, and writing in the defence of it,
            and by laying down their lives, when called for. The manner in which
            this is to be done, is "earnestly," heartily, in good earnest, and
            without deceit, zealously, and constantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints</em
            >. By the "faith" is meant the doctrine of faith, in which sense it
            is used whenever faith is said to be preached, obeyed, departed, or
            erred from, or denied, or made shipwreck of, or when exhortations
            are made to stand fast, and continue in it, or to strive and contend
            for it, as here; and which is sometimes called the word of faith,
            the faith of the Gospel, the mystery of faith, or most holy faith,
            the common faith, and, as here, faith only; and designs the whole
            scheme of evangelical truths to be believed; such as the doctrine of
            the Trinity, the deity and sonship of Christ, the divinity and
            personality of the Spirit; what regards the state and condition of
            man by nature, as the doctrines of the imputation of Adam's sin to
            his posterity, the corruption of nature, and the impotence of men to
            that which is good; what concerns the acts of grace in the Father,
            Son, and Spirit, towards, and upon the sons of men; as the doctrines
            of everlasting love, eternal election, the covenant of grace,
            particular redemption, justification by the imputed righteousness of
            Christ, pardon and reconciliation by his blood, regeneration and
            sanctification by the grace of the Spirit, final perseverance, the
            resurrection of the dead, and the future glory of the saints with
            Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is said to be "delivered to the saints": it was delivered by
            God the Father to Christ as Mediator, and by him to his apostles,
            who may more especially be meant by "the saints," or holy men; who
            were chosen to be holy, and to whom Christ was made sanctification,
            and who were sanctified by the Spirit of God; and this faith, being
            a most holy faith, is fit for holy men, and only proper to be
            delivered to them, and preached by them; and by them it was
            delivered to the churches, both by word and writing; and this
            delivery of it supposes that it is not an invention of men, that it
            is of God, and a gift of his, and given in trust in order to be
            kept, held forth, and held fast; and it was but "once" delivered, in
            opposition to the sundry times and divers manners in which the mind
            of God was formerly made known; and designs the uniformity,
            perfection, and continuance of the doctrine of faith;
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no alteration to be made in it, or addition to it; no new
            revelations are to be expected, it has been delivered all at once:
            and therefore should be "earnestly contended for"; for could it be
            lost, another could not be had; and the whole of it is to be
            contended for; not only the fundamentals, but the lesser matters of
            faith; and not things essential only, but also what are
            circumstantial to faith and religion; every truth, ordinance, and
            duty, and particularly the purity of faith, and its consistency: and
            this contention includes a care and solicitude for it, to have it,
            own it, and hold it fast, and adorn it; and for the preservation of
            it, and for the spread of it, and that it might be transmitted to
            posterity: and it denotes a conflict, a combat, or a fighting for
            it, a striving even to an agony.
