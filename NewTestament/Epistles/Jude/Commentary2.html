            <em>Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you</em>. He was
            indeed glad and anxious to write to them, but yet necessity urged
            him to do so, even because they were assailed (according to what
            follows) by the ungodly, and stood in need of being prepared to
            fight with them. Had they not been forewarned how necessary his
            exhortation was, they might have been slothful and negligent; but
            when he makes this preface, that he wrote on account of the
            necessity of their case, it was the same as though he had blown a
            trumpet to awake them from their torpor.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>About our common salvation</em>. The Gospel is sometimes called
            our salvation in opposition to the law, which is a ministration of
            condemnation; and because it is a declaration of salvation, and a
            means of it; and may be said to be "common," because preached to
            all, Jews and Gentiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus Christ the Saviour himself, who is also sometimes called
            "salvation," because he was called and appointed to it, and
            undertook it, and is become the author of it; and may be said to be
            a "common" Saviour, not of all men, but of all his people; of his
            whole body, the church, and every member of it, and of all sorts of
            men, in all nations. He is the one way of salvation, but that is not
            confined to any nation, family, community, or sect among men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or that spiritual and eternal salvation wrought out by him, which is
            common, not to all men, for all are not saved with it, but to all
            the elect of God, and true believers in Christ; the love of God is
            common to them all alike; the choice of them to eternal salvation is
            the same; the covenant of grace, the blessings and promises of it,
            are equally shared by them; and they are bought with the same price
            of Christ's blood, and are justified by the same righteousness, and
            are regenerated, sanctified, and called by the same grace, and shall
            possess the same glory.
          </p>

              >I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to contend
              earnestly</em
            >. The persons to be contended with on account of it, are such who
            deny, or depreciate any of the Persons in the Godhead, the assertors
            of the purity and power of human nature, and the deniers of
            sovereign, efficacious, and persevering grace: the persons who are
            to contend with them are all the saints in general, to whom it is
            delivered; which they may do by bearing an external testimony to it,
            by praying for the continuance and success of it, by standing fast
            in one spirit in it, and by dying for it; and particularly the
            ministers of the Gospel, by preaching it boldly, openly, fully, and
            faithfully, by disputing for it, and writing in the defence of it,
            and by laying down their lives, when called for. The manner in which
            this is to be done, is "earnestly," heartily, in good earnest, and
            without deceit, zealously, and constantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints</em
            >. By the "faith" is meant the doctrine of faith, in which sense it
            is used whenever faith is said to be preached, obeyed, departed, or
            erred from, or denied, or made shipwreck of, or when exhortations
            are made to stand fast, and continue in it, or to strive and contend
            for it, as here; and which is sometimes called the word of faith,
            the faith of the Gospel, the mystery of faith, or most holy faith,
            the common faith, and, as here, faith only; and designs the whole
            scheme of evangelical truths to be believed; such as the doctrine of
            the Trinity, the deity and sonship of Christ, the divinity and
            personality of the Spirit; what regards the state and condition of
            man by nature, as the doctrines of the imputation of Adam's sin to
            his posterity, the corruption of nature, and the impotence of men to
            that which is good; what concerns the acts of grace in the Father,
            Son, and Spirit, towards, and upon the sons of men; as the doctrines
            of everlasting love, eternal election, the covenant of grace,
            particular redemption, justification by the imputed righteousness of
            Christ, pardon and reconciliation by his blood, regeneration and
            sanctification by the grace of the Spirit, final perseverance, the
            resurrection of the dead, and the future glory of the saints with
            Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is said to be "delivered to the saints." It was delivered by
            God the Father to Christ as Mediator, and by him to his apostles,
            who may more especially be meant by "the saints," or holy men; who
            were chosen to be holy, and to whom Christ was made sanctification,
            and who were sanctified by the Spirit of God; and this faith, being
            a most holy faith, is fit for holy men, and only proper to be
            delivered to them, and preached by them; and by them it was
            delivered to the churches, both by word and writing; and this
            delivery of it supposes that it is not an invention of men, that it
            is of God, and a gift of his, and given in trust in order to be
            kept, held forth, and held fast; and it was but "once" delivered, in
            opposition to the sundry times and divers manners in which the mind
            of God was formerly made known; and designs the uniformity,
            perfection, and continuance of the doctrine of faith;
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no alteration to be made in it, or addition to it; no new
            revelations are to be expected, it has been delivered all at once:
            and therefore should be "earnestly contended for"; for could it be
            lost, another could not be had; and the whole of it is to be
            contended for; not only the fundamentals, but the lesser matters of
            faith; and not things essential only, but also what are
            circumstantial to faith and religion; every truth, ordinance, and
            duty, and particularly the purity of faith, and its consistency: and
            this contention includes a care and solicitude for it, to have it,
            own it, and hold it fast, and adorn it; and for the preservation of
            it, and for the spread of it, and that it might be transmitted to
            posterity: and it denotes a conflict, a combat, or a fighting for
            it, a striving even to an agony.

              >For there are certain men who crept in secretly, even those who
              were long ago written about for this condemnation: ungodly men,

          <p>
            <em>For there are certain men who crept in secretly</em>. These
            words contain a reason why the doctrine of faith should be contended
            for, because of false teachers, who are described as being then upon
            the spot; the Apostles Peter and Paul had foretold that they would
            come, but Jude here speaks of them as in being; wherefore present
            rigour and vigilance were necessary to be used: their names are not
            mentioned, nor their number, only that there were "certain", or
            "some men"; which is done to stir up the saints to self-examination,
            whether they were in the faith; to diligence, in finding out these
            men; to vigour, in opposing them; and to care, to nip error and
            heresy in the bud.
          </p>
          <p>
            These certain men "crept in secretly" either into private houses to
            lead people astray; or into the churches, being the tares the enemy
            sows among the wheat; or into the ministry, assuming that office to
            themselves, without being called and sent of God; and so into the
            public assemblies of the saints, spreading their poisonous doctrines
            among them; and also into their affections, until discovered; and
            all this was done secretly, without any thought about them, or
            suspicion of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Even those who were long ago written about for this
              condemnation</em
            >. Meaning either judicial blindness of heart, they were given up
            to, in embracing and spreading errors and heresies; so that these
            fall under the ordination and decree of God, which does not make God
            the author of them, nor excuse the men that hold them; and they are
            ordained and ordered for many valuable ends; on the part of God, to
            show his power and wisdom; and on the part of truth, that it might
            be tried and appear the brighter, and to manifest his people and
            their graces: or else punishment is designed, even everlasting
            condemnation, to which some are preordained of God; for this act of
            preordination respects persons, and not mere actions and events; and
            is not a naked prescience, but a real decree, and which is sure,
            certain, and irrevocable. It is God's act, and springs from his
            sovereignty, is agreeably to his justice and holiness; nor is it
            contrary to his goodness, and is for his glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The date of this act is "of old," that is, from eternity (2 Thes
            2:13); Reprobation is of the same date with election; if the one is
            from eternity, the other must be so too, since there cannot be one
            without the other: if some were chosen before the foundation of the
            world, others must be left or passed by; and if some were appointed
            unto salvation from the beginning, others must be foreordained to
            condemnation from the beginning also.
          </p>
          <p>
            These words cannot be understood of any prophecy of old, in which it
            was forewritten, or prophesied of these men, that they should be
            condemned for their ungodliness; not in Matthew 24:1, in which no
            such persons are described as here, nor any mention made of their
            punishment or condemnation; nor in 2 Peter 2:1; for then the apostle
            would never have said that they were "of old", a long while ago,
            before written, or prophesied of, since according to the common
            calculation, that epistle of Peter's, and this of Jude's, were
            written in the same year; nor in the prophecy of Enoch, Judges 1:14;
            for Enoch's prophecy was not written, as we know of; and therefore
            these men could not be said to be before written in it; besides,
            that prophecy is spoken of as something distinct from these persons
            being before written, to condemnation; and after all, was a prophecy
            referred to, the sense would be the same, since such a prophecy
            concerning them must be founded upon an antecedent ordination and
            appointment of God; the word here used does not intend their being
            forewritten in any book of the Scriptures, but in the book of God's
            eternal purposes and decrees.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Ungodly men</em>. All men are by nature ungodly, some are
            notoriously so, and false teachers are generally such; here it
            signifies such who are destitute of the fear of God, and of all
            internal devotion, and powerful godliness; and who did not worship
            God externally, according to his institutions and appointments, and
            much less sincerely, and in a spiritual manner; and who even
            separated themselves from the true worshippers of God, and gave
            themselves up to sensuality, and therefore their condemnation was
            just.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Turning the grace of our God into indecency</em>. Not the love
            and favour of God, as in his own heart, or as shed abroad in the
            hearts of others; for that can never, be turned to such a purpose,
            it always working in a contrary way; nor the principle of grace
            wrought in the soul, which being of a spiritual nature, lusteth
            against the flesh, and cannot be turned into it; more likely the
            goodness of God in his providential dispensations, which is despised
            by some, and abused by others; but rather the doctrine of grace,
            which though lasciviousness is not in its nature, nor has it any
            natural tendency to it, yet wicked men turn or transfer it from its
            original nature, design, and use, to a foreign one: and they may be
            said to turn it into lasciviousness, either by asserting it to be a
            licentious doctrine, when it is not; or by treating it in a wanton
            and ludicrous manner, scoffing at it, and lampooning it; or by
            making the doctrine of grace universal, extending it equally alike
            to all mankind, and thereby harden and encourage men in sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And denying our only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ</em>.
            Who is the only sovereign Lord, both in providence and grace; and
            the only God, not to the exclusion of the Father and Spirit, but in
            opposition to nominal and fictitious deities, or Heathen gods; and
            he was denied by these men, if not in words, yet in works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Denying Jesus' deity, or sonship, or humanity, or that he was the
            Messiah, or the alone Saviour, or his sacrifice, satisfaction, and
            righteousness; with respect to either of which he may be said to be
            denied doctrinally, as he is also practically, when men do not walk
            worthy of their profession of him; and both might be true of these
            men, and therefore their condemnation was righteous.
