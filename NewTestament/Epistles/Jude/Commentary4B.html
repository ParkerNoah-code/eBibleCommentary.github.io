            and pray in the Holy Spirit. Keep yourselves in God's love as you
            wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal

          <p align="justify">
            In every age there has prevailed in the Church a proneness to depart
            both from the principles and practice of the Gospel. Jude in his
            day, writing to the whole Christian Church respecting "their common
            salvation," says, "it was needful for him to write to them, and to
            exhort them all to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to
            the saints."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            At the same time he declares, that "ungodly men had crept in among
            the saints," and had not only grievously dishonored the Gospel, but
            had "turned the very grace of God itself into a license for sin,"
            and vindicated their licentious practices as allowed and sanctioned
            by the Gospel of Christ.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Against the influence of such pernicious examples, the Apostle was
            anxious to preserve all who yet maintained their integrity. He bade
            them remember, that the Apostles of our Lord had from the beginning
            taught them to expect that such hypocrites and apostates would
            arise: and he exhorted them so to walk before God, that they might
            hold fast their steadfastness even to the end. The directions which
            he gave them were such as could not but approve themselves to their
            judgment, and commend themselves to their inmost souls.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The same dangers to the Church are existing still; and the same
            directions therefore are necessary for us, as well as for those in
            the apostolic age. Permit me then to call your attention to them:
          </p>

              <p align="justify">
                I. To the two former directives, as instrumental to your
                welfare.
              </p>
            </font>
            <p align="justify">
              "Build up yourselves, brethren, on your most holy faith."
            </p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            It is here supposed that you have embraced the faith, and that you
            are standing upon the true foundation which God himself has laid in
            Zion. But you must not be satisfied with having believed in Christ:
            for Paul says, "As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
            in him, rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as
            you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Your faith is truly a "most holy faith," in its nature, in its
            tendency, and in all its practical effects, it is "most holy;" and
            to build up yourselves more and more upon it is your bounden duty.
            Seek then to advance continually in the knowledge of it, in all its
            bearings, and in all its relations. View the whole mystery as
            planned by Infinite Wisdom, and formed into a covenant of grace:
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            the <i>Father </i>undertaking to accept an atonement in our behalf;
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            the <i>Son </i>engaging to offer that atonement in his own sacred
            person;
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            and the <i>Holy Spirit </i>engaging to bring to Christ those who
            would be given him of the Father, and those whom Christ would
            purchase with his most precious blood.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Eternity itself will not suffice to explore the wonders contained in
            this mystery; and therefore, like the holy angels, we should
            incessantly be searching into it, with a view to comprehend, as far
            as our limited capacities can reach, the wisdom of God displayed in
            it.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We should seek to grow also in a simple reliance on the Gospel of
            Christ, as of itself perfectly suited to us, and altogether
            sufficient for the necessities of the whole world. It is impossible
            ever to be too jealous upon this head; since the mixing of anything
            with this foundation will subvert it utterly, and make void all that
            Christ has done and suffered for us.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In a realizing sense of its excellency, we should also be making
            higher and higher attainments. There is a <i>rest of the mind</i>,
            and a <i>satisfaction of the soul</i>, which it is our privilege to
            possess; and which, in its sublimer actings, approximates very
            nearly to the felicity of the saints above. There is no measure of
            this in which we should rest. We are told, that, by believing in
            Christ, we may be elevated to "a joy that is unspeakable and full of
            glory, and may already (by anticipation) receive the end of our
            faith, even the salvation of our souls."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Yet not in these respects only, but in every possible view, we
            should "be building up ourselves on our most holy faith," and be
            daily manifesting our progress, and "making our profiting to appear"
            to all around us.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            At the same time<b> be "praying continually in the Holy Spirit."</b>
          </p>
          <b> </b>
          <p align="justify">
            Of ourselves we can do nothing: our sufficiency even for a good
            thought, must be of God alone: and from him it must be sought by
            earnest prayer. "He will be inquired of by us, before he will do for
            us" what in his covenant of grace he has promised to us. If we ask
            not, we cannot have: but, if we ask in faith, we shall have our joy
            increased to the full. We must therefore go to God continually;
            seeking from him in the first instance the "Spirit of grace and
            supplications," by whose gracious influences alone we can approach
            him in an acceptable manner, and pray to him as we ought. "That
            blessed Spirit will help our infirmities;" and though he may not
            give us that fluency of utterance, or that enlargement of heart,
            which we may desire, "he will make intercession in us with groanings
            which cannot be uttered," but which will enter the ears of our
            heavenly Father, "who knows the mind of the Spirit," and will answer
            the petitions which are so dictated by him.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            We are not indeed to expect any <i>miraculous aid </i> from the Holy
            Spirit: but a <i>gracious influence </i>we may expect; as Paul says,
            "Pray always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit." Nor
            need we be concerned whether we address our God in words conceived
            at the moment, or in a pre-composed form: it is the frame of mind
            and heart which God regards: and, if that be spiritual,
            <i
              >our prayer, even though it consist only of a sigh, or a groan,
              shall come up with acceptance before him, and shall bring down
              into our souls all the blessings both of grace and glory.</i
            >
          </p>
          <i> </i>
          <p align="justify">
            While then we are building up ourselves on our most holy faith, we
            must be "pouring out our hearts before him" through the assistance
            of his Spirit, and be bringing down from him such communications of
            grace and strength as our daily necessities require.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The beneficial tendency of the two former directions being thus
            clear and manifest, let me call your attention,
          </p>
          <b
            ><font color="#0000ff">

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            This was primary in the mind of the Apostle: the two preceding being
            urged only as conducive to it. And certainly this is the great
            object which every Christian should keep in view, and at which he
            should aim day and night. To have a sense of "God's love shed abroad
            in the heart;" to "have the light of his countenance lifted up upon
            us;" to be going to him continually as a Father; to "walk with him,"
            as Enoch did; and, like Abraham, to commune with him as a friend; to
            "set him always before us;" to have no wish or desire but to please
            him; to be "delighting ourselves in him," as our God, our portion,
            our eternal great reward: this is our wisdom; this is our happiness;
            this is our security.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            If we descend on lower ground, we are open to all manner of
            assaults: but who can reach us there? Who can break through to harm
            us, when we are "dwelling in God, and God is dwelling in us?" We are
            "encompassed as with a wall of fire;" we are in a fortress that is
            absolutely impregnable: we may defy the whole universe to "separate
            us from his loved."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let me then especially urge upon you this important duty. Live not
            at a distance from God: rest not in a formal acknowledgment of him:
            but endeavor to "walk worthy of him unto all pleasing," get back, as
            far as possible, to the state of man in Paradise; and labor to walk
            as on the very borders of the eternal world. My beloved brethren,
            "let your conversation be thus in Heaven," and let all the faith
            which you exercise, and every prayer that you utter, be, as it were,
            a breeze to fill your sails, and bear you forward to your desired
            haven; that "you may never fall, but have an abundant entrance
            ministered unto you into the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
            Christ."
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">
              "Look also for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal
              life."
            </p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            However close your walk with God may be, you must not on that
            account lean in the least degree to your own righteousness, but must
            rely entirely on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, and expect
            "eternal life solely as the gift of God for Christ's sake." And for
            this you must be waiting, looking, longing, in a state of constant
            preparation, and of eager expectation. The very perfection of the
            Christian state on earth is this, to be "looking for and hastening
            unto the coming of the day of God." Of many in the Corinthian Church
            the Apostle says, "they came behind in no gift, waiting for the
            coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            You then aspire after the same blessed attainment. "Let your loins
            be girt, and your lamps trimmed, and yourselves as those who wait
            for the coming of the heavenly Bridegroom;" that, when he shall
            come, you may "enter in with him to the marriage feast."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            While you are in such a frame as this, all earthly things will lose
            their influence; and all attempts, whether of men or devils, to
            retard your progress be in vain. From my inmost soul therefore I
            would offer in behalf of you the prayer which Paul offered for the
            Thessalonian Church, the prayer which so remarkably coincides with
            that of Jude in my text, "May the Lord direct your hearts into the
            love of God, and a patient waiting for Christ."

            so living you are sure of mercy, and cannot fail of attaining that
            eternal life which the Lord Jesus Christ has purchased for you.
