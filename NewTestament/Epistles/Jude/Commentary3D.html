            God has had in every age some to testify against the ungodly, and to
            warn them of the consequences of their sin at the future judgment:
            and though the faithful execution of this office meets with but ill
            returns from an ungrateful world, yet we trust there will be found,
            to the end of time, some, who will gladly suffer reproach or even
            death itself in the service of their God, and in the benevolent
            attempt to save their fellow-sinners from destruction.

            We do not indeed hear of many who were witnesses for God, before the
            time of Moses; and even his warnings and exhortations were enforced
            principally with temporal sanctions: yet the certainty of a future
            judgment was known not only by Moses, but by the antediluvian world;
            and was solemnly urged by Enoch as a motive to repentance. This
            prophecy is not recorded in the Old Testament; but, by whatever
            means Jude attained the knowledge of it, whether by tradition, or by
            some written memorial, or by immediate inspiration, we may be sure
            that it was delivered by Enoch; and we may be thankful that such a
            precious fragment of inspired truth has been preserved to us.

            Christ, we are assured, is coming to judge the world.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            There can be no reason to doubt that Enoch referred to Christ, even
            to that very "seed of the woman, who was to bruise the serpent's
            head," him he represents as coming to complete his victory over
            Satan and his agents by calling them to his tribunal, and by
            consigning them over to the punishment they have deserved.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            The New Testament writers uniformly speak to the same effect: they
            declare that it is at the judgment seat of Christ we must stand;
            that it is Christ who is ordained to be the Judge of the living and
            the dead; and, that all judgment is therefore committed unto him,
            because he is the Son of man; or, in other words, that
            <i
              >he who died for sinners, shall, in that very nature that he
              assumed for them, be the immediate author of salvation to his
              followers and of condemnation to his enemies.</i

          <p align="justify">
            It is not with "his saints," but with his holy ones, or holy angels,
            that he will come. The saints will not be his assessors in judgment
            until they themselves shall have received their sentence: then
            indeed "they shall judge angels;" but until then, they themselves
            will stand before him to be judged.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But the holy angels will be his attendants in the clouds of Heaven;
            all the "myriads" of them shall descend with him from their blessed
            abodes, to increase the solemnity of that day, and to honor him to
            whom they owe their very existence. This accords with the
            description given by Daniel, by Paul, and by Christ himself.

            Nor will Jesus merely pronounce the sentence of condemnation or
            acquittal, but he will "execute" it himself, either exalting them
            instantly to thrones of glory, or casting them headlong into "the
            lake that burns with fire and brimstone!"

            Whatever endeavors be now used to show men their guilt and danger,
            they have many things to allege in their own favor; nor even "if we
            could speak with the tongues of angels," could we bring home
            conviction to their hearts. But Jesus will show them, beyond all
            contradiction, the futility of their excuses: and will prove by such
            unquestionable evidence "the <i>deeds </i>they have committed, the
            <i>words </i>they have spoken," and the <i>thoughts </i>they have
            entertained, that they shall be silenced and confounded before him.
            The ministers, who once labored for their salvation, shall then be
            forced to bear testimony against them. Their companions in sin,
            though to their own confusion, must also testify of those deeds of
            darkness, which they once fondly hoped would be buried in eternal
            oblivion. The very places, where their most secret iniquities were
            committed, will stand forth to accuse them, than that they should
            escape with impunity. Above all, "God himself will be a swift
            witness against them," and will so thoroughly "convince" them of all
            their sins, whether of commission or of omission, that they shall be
            constrained to acknowledge the equity of that sentence which dooms
            them to everlasting burnings! Even in Hell will they be compelled to
            say, "Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments!"

            Five thousand years ago the prophet spoke of Jesus as so near at
            hand, that it seemed as if he were already come; and it is in this
            way that all, whether Prophets or Apostles, have been inspired to
            speak. So strongly did Paul express himself on this subject that the
            Thessalonians conceived the judgment-day to be almost immediately at
            hand. In the same manner must we say, "The Lord is at hand!" "The
            Judge is at the door!" He surely is coming as soon as ever the
            events that are ordained to precede his advent shall have received
            their accomplishment.

          <p align="justify">
            With respect to us, it signifies little whether it is near or
            distant, since <i>as death leaves us, judgment will find us. </i>Is
            it not even madness then to delay our repentance, since we cannot
            tell but that death may come within the next year, or day, or hour?
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Beloved, shall your Lord come, and find you sleeping? Is he
            hastening towards you, and will you not prepare to meet him? O awake
            from your slumbers, and turn to him with your whole hearts; so that
            you may "have confidence before him at his coming."

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            It surely is not necessary to prove that we are ungodly, since
            <i
              >we have all sinned, times without number, in thought, word, and
              deed, against the Divine Majesty. </i
            >Where then shall we go for the remission of our sins? How shall we
            get our iniquities blotted out from the book of his remembrance? Our
            tears, even if we could shed rivers of tears, will never avail for
            this end.
            <i
              >Nothing but the blood of Jesus can ever cleanse us from the guilt
              of one sin! And, if we are not washed in that fountain, we shall
              die in our iniquities, and lie under the guilt of them forever.</i
            >
            Let us then seek a saving interest in Christ. Let us never attempt
            to substitute any repentance or reformation of our own, in the place
            of his meritorious blood and righteousness: but let it be our one
            desire to "be found in him," and to obtain from him those garments
            of salvation, which alone can "cover the nakedness" of our guilty
            souls.

            to whom they cleaved with full purpose of heart? Be it so then; the
            catalogue of their sins shall be produced, a catalogue reaching, as
            it were, from Heaven to earth; and they shall not have one word to
            offer in arrest of judgment! Yet, will the Savior pass a sentence of
            condemnation upon them? Will he not himself stand forth and testify,
            "I saw their deep contrition; I treasured up their tears in my vial;
            I was witness to their frequent sighs and groans, and to their cries
            for mercy through my atoning blood," "Deliver them from going down
            into the pit! I paid their ransom," they were mine; and they
            manifested that they were mine, by their obedience to my will, and
            their conformity to my image! "Come, you blessed children of my
            Father, inherit my kingdom prepared for you!"
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Fear not then, weak and trembling saints; but rather "be looking for
            and hastening to the coming of the day of Christ," you shall surely
            stand before him with joy; while they, who once justified their
            ungodliness, and thought, that to be among the godly was a fit
            matter for derision, shall bewail their folly, and confess the
            equity of the sentence that fixes you in Heaven, and themselves in
            Hell. Remember then with gratitude that you are to have Jesus for
            your judge; and when he says, "Behold, I come quickly!" let your
            hearts reply, "Even so, come Lord Jesus!"
