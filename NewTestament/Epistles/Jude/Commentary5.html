              >Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling, and to
              present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling</em>. The
            people of God are liable to falling into temptation, into sin, into
            errors and mistakes, from an exercise of grace, or from a degree of
            steadfastness in Gospel truths, and even into a final and total
            apostasy, were it not for divine power; and they are not able to
            keep themselves. Adam, in his state of innocence, could not keep
            himself from falling; nor could the angels, many of whom fell, and
            the rest are preserved by the grace of God; wherefore, much less can
            imperfect sinful men keep themselves, they want both skill and power
            to do it; nor can any, short of Christ, keep them, and it is his
            work and office to preserve them; they were given to him with this
            view, and he undertook to do it; and sensible sinners commit
            themselves to him, as being appointed for that purpose; and this is
            a work Christ has been, and is, employed in, and he is every way
            qualified for it: he is "able" to do it, for he is the mighty God,
            the Creator and upholder of all things; and as Mediator, he has all
            power in heaven and in earth; instances of persons kept by him prove
            it; and there is such evidence of it, that believers may be, and are
            persuaded of it: and he is as willing as he is able; it is his
            Father's will he should keep them, and in that he delights; and as
            he has undertook to keep them, he is accountable for them; besides,
            he has an interest in them, and the greatest love and affection for
            them; to which may be added, that the glory of the Father, Son, and
            Spirit, in man's salvation, depends on the keeping of them: and what
            he keeps them from is, from falling by temptations, not from being
            tempted by Satan, but from sinking under his temptations, and from
            being devoured by him; and from falling by sin, not from the being
            or commission of sin, but from the dominion of it, and from the
            falling into it, so as to perish by it; and from falling into
            damnable heresies; and from the true grace of God, and into final
            impenitence, unbelief, and total apostasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And to present you faultless</em>. The word here rendered
            “faultless” is the same which is rendered “unblamable” in Colossians
            1:22.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Before the presence of his glory</em>. In his own glorious
            presence; before himself encompassed with glory in heaven. The
            saints are to be presented there as redeemed and sanctified, and as
            made worthy by grace to dwell there forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In great joy</em>. With the abounding joy that they are
            redeemed; that they are rescued from sorrow, sin, and death, and
            that heaven is to be their eternal home. Who now can form an
            adequate idea of the happiness of that hour?

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>To God our Savior</em>. By whom is meant, not the Trinity of
            Persons in general, nor the Father in particular; but the Lord Jesus
            Christ, who is truly God, though not to the exclusion of the Father
            and Spirit; and is the wisdom of God, and the author of all wisdom,
            natural and spiritual; and is the only Saviour of his people.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who alone is wise</em>. "To the only wise God, through Jesus
            Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen" (Rom 16:27).
          </p>
          <p>
            "Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is
            wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen" (1 Tim 1:17).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Be glory and majesty</em>. Glory of his deity, and divine
            sonship, of his mediatorial works, and of salvation. And majesty
            which belongs to him as God, and which he has in his human nature,
            being crowned with glory, and honour, and enthroned and set down at
            the right hand of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Dominion and power</em>. See Matthew 6:13. It is common in the
            Scriptures to ascribe power, dominion, and glory to God, expressing
            the feeling that all that is great and good belongs to him, and the
            desire of the heart that he may reign in heaven and on earth.
            Compare Revelation 4:11; Revelation 19:1. With the expression of
            such a desire it was not inappropriate that this Epistle should be
            closed - and it is not inappropriate that this volume should be
            closed with the utterance of the same wish. In all our affections
            and aspirations, may God be supreme; in all the sin and woe which
            prevail here below, may we look forward with strong desire to the
            time when his dominion shall be set up over all the earth; in all
            our own sins and sorrows, be it ours to look onward to the time when
            in a purer and happier world his reign may be set up over our own
            souls, and when we may cast every crown at his feet and say, “Thou
            art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power: for thou
            hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were
            created. - Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power,
            unto the Lord our God,” Revelation 4:11; Revelation 19:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Both now and forever</em>. In the present life, and to all
            eternity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Amen</em>. Which is an assent unto it, that so it should be; and
            a wish that so it may be; and an expression of faith, and strong
            asseveration, that so it shall be.

            By many this Doxology is considered as addressed to the Lord Jesus
            Christ: but though it is certain that by all the heavenly choir our
            most adorable Savior is worshiped as one with the Father, without
            any distinction whatever, and that he is to be honored in all
            respects by us precisely as the Father--yet we must be cautious
            never to strain any portion of Scripture for the purpose of honoring
            him; for, if we do, we give advantage to those who deny his proper
            Divinity, to represent all our worship of him as unauthorized and
            erroneous.

              >The more fully we are assured of any doctrine, the more careful
              we should be not to establish it on a weak foundation</i
            >; lest, when the foundation on which we have indiscreetly built is
            shaken, we be led to doubt the truth of the doctrine itself. Of the
            Divinity of our blessed Lord we have no more doubt than of any other
            truth of our holy religion: but in the passage before us we
            apprehend, that it is not to Him in particular that this Doxology is
            addressed, but to the Father. For, in several other passages, the
            Father beyond all doubt is addressed, and under the same character
            as is here described. Paul concludes his Epistle to the Romans thus:
            "Now to him who is able to establish you, … to God only wise, be
            glory through Jesus Christ forever." In the Epistle to the Ephesians
            he again speaks in similar terms: "Now unto him who is able to do
            exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, unto him be
            glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world
            without end." So again, in his First Epistle to Timothy he says,
            "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
            be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Those who would apply our text to Christ, think that it must refer
            to him, because he alone (as they imagine) presents his Church
            before the presence of his Father's glory: as it is said, "He loved
            the Church and gave himself for it, … that he might present it to
            himself as a glorious Church, etc." But the very same thing is
            spoken of the Father also, of whom it is said, that, "by Christ, the
            Father reconciled all things to himself, … even in the body of his
            flesh through death, to present us holy and unblamable and
            unreprovable in his sight." I consider the text therefore as
            addressed to the Father: and, in order to a suitable improvement of
            it, will set before you,

            His <i>wisdom </i>and his <i>power </i>are altogether infinite: and
            we might, not improperly, speak of those two perfections as they are
            delineated in the Holy Scriptures. But I conceive, that, though
            mentioned generally in the text, we should notice them not as
            existing in himself, but as exercised towards his Church.

            mystery!" To contemplate that, will be the employment of eternity.

          <p align="justify">
            Nor, if we entered into his particular dispensations towards his
            people, would this perfection appear in less bright colors; so
            "unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out." The
            experience of every saint will furnish abundant matter for adoration
            through all eternity; for "he has abounded towards every one of them
            in all wisdom and prudence."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor is the <u>power</u> which he exercises towards them less
            stupendous.

            View the temptations with which every saint is beset. View the
            enemies, even all the hosts of Hell, with whom he has to contend.
            View his utter incapacity to do anything of himself—and yet his
            conflicts, his victories, and his triumphs! Must not that power be
            wonderful that is able to keep him, and effectual for his
            preservation even to the end? Yes truly, it is no less a power than
            that which was put forth to raise the Lord Jesus Christ himself from
            the dead, and to exalt him above all the principalities and powers
            both of Heaven and Hell.

            It is by the united and continued exercise of these two perfections

          <p align="justify">
            In the name of "Savior" he glories; and under that character he
            loves to be viewed by us. His perfections would indeed be the same,
            though never put forth for us, any more than for the fallen angels:
            but, as they are so exercised for our welfare, it befits us to
            contemplate them in that particular view, and to render to him the
            praise which such manifestations of them demand.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Reflect a moment on him as a "Savior!" not merely as preserving us
            in our conflicts here, but as "presenting us faultless before the

            seek to live in this spirit every day, and all the day long. Then,
            when death shall call you hence, you shall change your place, but
            not your employment; your sorrows, but not your songs!
