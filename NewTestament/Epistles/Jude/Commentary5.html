            By many this Doxology is considered as addressed to the Lord Jesus
            Christ: but though it is certain that by all the heavenly choir our
            most adorable Savior is worshiped as one with the Father, without
            any distinction whatever, and that he is to be honored in all
            respects by us precisely as the Father--yet we must be cautious
            never to strain any portion of Scripture for the purpose of honoring
            him; for, if we do, we give advantage to those who deny his proper
            Divinity, to represent all our worship of him as unauthorized and
            erroneous.

              >The more fully we are assured of any doctrine, the more careful
              we should be not to establish it on a weak foundation</i
            >; lest, when the foundation on which we have indiscreetly built is
            shaken, we be led to doubt the truth of the doctrine itself. Of the
            Divinity of our blessed Lord we have no more doubt than of any other
            truth of our holy religion: but in the passage before us we
            apprehend, that it is not to Him in particular that this Doxology is
            addressed, but to the Father. For, in several other passages, the
            Father beyond all doubt is addressed, and under the same character
            as is here described. Paul concludes his Epistle to the Romans thus:
            "Now to him who is able to establish you, … to God only wise, be
            glory through Jesus Christ forever." In the Epistle to the Ephesians
            he again speaks in similar terms: "Now unto him who is able to do
            exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, unto him be
            glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world
            without end." So again, in his First Epistle to Timothy he says,
            "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
            be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Those who would apply our text to Christ, think that it must refer
            to him, because he alone (as they imagine) presents his Church
            before the presence of his Father's glory: as it is said, "He loved
            the Church and gave himself for it, … that he might present it to
            himself as a glorious Church, etc." But the very same thing is
            spoken of the Father also, of whom it is said, that, "by Christ, the
            Father reconciled all things to himself, … even in the body of his
            flesh through death, to present us holy and unblamable and
            unreprovable in his sight." I consider the text therefore as
            addressed to the Father: and, in order to a suitable improvement of
            it, will set before you,

            His <i>wisdom </i>and his <i>power </i>are altogether infinite: and
            we might, not improperly, speak of those two perfections as they are
            delineated in the Holy Scriptures. But I conceive, that, though
            mentioned generally in the text, we should notice them not as
            existing in himself, but as exercised towards his Church.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Wonderful is the wisdom which he has displayed in his dealings with
            his people.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Contemplate the <i>plan of salvation </i>through the incarnation and
            death of his only-begotten Son. What unfathomable depths of
            <u>wisdom</u> are here? Well is it called, "The wisdom of God in a
            mystery!" To contemplate that, will be the employment of eternity.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor, if we entered into his particular dispensations towards his
            people, would this perfection appear in less bright colors; so
            "unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out." The
            experience of every saint will furnish abundant matter for adoration
            through all eternity; for "he has abounded towards every one of them
            in all wisdom and prudence."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor is the <u>power</u> which he exercises towards them less
            stupendous.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            View the temptations with which every saint is beset. View the
            enemies, even all the hosts of Hell, with whom he has to contend.
            View his utter incapacity to do anything of himself—and yet his
            conflicts, his victories, and his triumphs! Must not that power be
            wonderful that is able to keep him, and effectual for his
            preservation even to the end? Yes truly, it is no less a power than
            that which was put forth to raise the Lord Jesus Christ himself from
            the dead, and to exalt him above all the principalities and powers
            both of Heaven and Hell.

          <p align="justify">
            It is by the united and continued exercise of these two perfections
            of wisdom and power, that he becomes "our Savior."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In the name of "Savior" he glories; and under that character he
            loves to be viewed by us. His perfections would indeed be the same,
            though never put forth for us, any more than for the fallen angels:
            but, as they are so exercised for our welfare, it befits us to
            contemplate them in that particular view, and to render to him the
            praise which such manifestations of them demand.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Reflect a moment on him as a "Savior!" not merely as preserving us
            in our conflicts here, but as "presenting us faultless before the
            presence of his glory" in the world above—One moment's reflection
            upon his character in that view, will abundantly suffice to show

            Go to the world above, and see and hear how all the glorified saints
            are occupied around the throne: what songs of praise are they
            singing night and day to God, and to the Lamb! How do they all labor
            for utterance; and, by the very accumulation of the terms by which
            they strive to evince their gratitude, show how inadequate even the
            language of Heaven itself is to express the feelings of their
            hearts.

          <p align="justify">
            Thus then should it be with us: our whole life should be, as theirs

            you. Go then to him: spread before him your every need: expect from
            him a supply in every hour of need, a supply suited to your wants
            and sufficient for your necessities. Never for a moment entertain a
            doubt of his kindness, his care, his all-sufficiency: for he is God,
            and not man; and therefore you have not been consumed hitherto, nor

            in the same spirit that the angelic hosts are doing it above. And
