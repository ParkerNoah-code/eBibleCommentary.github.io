          <p align="justify">
            "We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we
            pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus
            and of the love you have for all the saints—the faith and love that
            spring from the hope that is stored up for you in Heaven and that
            you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel that
            has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and
            growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard
            it and understood God's grace in all its truth."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            "God's grace in all its truth!" What a beautiful description of the
            Gospel! It is grace: it is all grace, from first to last: it is the
            most stupendous grace that ever God given to any creature, whether
            in Heaven or on earth. It was marvelous grace to confer on
            <i>angels </i> such an exalted nature as they possess, together with
            all the glory and felicity of Heaven. It was most astonishing grace
            also to form <i>man </i>in Paradise; to form him in the very image
            of his God; and to give him a promise, that if he would hold fast
            his integrity, both he and all his posterity would participate with
            the angels in all the blessedness they enjoy.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But what is all this to the gift of God's only dear Son to bear the
            iniquities of fallen man, and, by his own obedience unto death, to
            restore man to his forfeited inheritance? This is emphatically
            called, "The Gospel of the grace of God:" and truly it does exhibit
            the grace of God in such a view as no creature could ever have
            anticipated; and in such a view as must fill the whole creation,
            whether of men or angels, with the profoundest admiration, and
            gratitude, and love. This is the Gospel which you "have heard;"
            which also, through the illuminating influence of the Spirit of God,
            many of you "know;" and the excellency of which may be seen,
          </p>

                I. By the effects the Gospel produces in our <u>hearts</u>—
              </p>
            </b></font
          >
          <p align="justify">
            There are three effects mentioned, as produced in the converts of
            Colosse:
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">1. "Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ"—</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            This is the first effect which the Gospel produces, wherever it is
            received into the heart. It reveals to us our need of a Savior; and
            it holds forth the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, sent
            into the world to bear our sins, and to expiate our guilt by his
            atoning sacrifice, and thereby to reconcile us to our offended God.
            It reveals to us the fullness and suitableness of this salvation;
            and brings us to this Savior, as our only hope. It leads every one
            to renounce altogether every other hope, and to trust entirely in
            the merits and mediation of this adorable Redeemer.
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">2. Love to all the saints—</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            This is the next effect produced on all. Through faith in the Lord
            Jesus Christ, we are brought into a new family, of which Christ is
            the master: yes, we are incorporated into a new body, of which
            Christ is the head, and all the saints are members. I add further,
            we are all penetrated with one spirit; (for "he who is joined to the
            Lord is one spirit;") and have thus a bond of union, which never
            did, nor could, exist before. The very instant we believe in Christ,
            we feel ourselves brought into this relation to all his believing
            people, whether they be separately known to us or not; and we have,
            from that moment, somewhat of the same sympathy with them, as every
            member of our body has with all the rest, the eye with the hand, and
            the hand with the foot.
          </p>
          <b>
            <p align="justify">3. Hope of happiness in Heaven—</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            "The hope laid up for us in Heaven" is that for which the Apostle
            principally gives thanks in the passage before us. The faith and
            love are parenthetically inserted. But this hope, like the two
            foregoing principles, is wrought in the heart by the Gospel: by
            which, as Peter says, "we are begotten again to a living hope of an
            inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fades not away,
            reserved in Heaven for us,
            <a

              href="https://biblia.com/bible/niv/1%20Pet%201.4"

              rel="noopener"
              >1 Peter 1:4</a
            >." Yes, faith penetrates the highest heavens, and sees there crowns
            and kingdoms purchased by the blood of Christ, and promised to all
            who believe in him. An eternity of glory upon the very throne of
            God, the believer expects as his assured portion.

            discovery which it gives us of the glory of Christ transforms us

            Were you all reduced to the most abject state of poverty, and

            enriched with all that the whole world could bestow; or were you all

            were nothing, in comparison with the blessings you have received

            faith. See what Paul prayed for in behalf of the Colossians, verse
            9-14; That same prayer would I offer for you, and entreat all of you
            to offer for yourselves. "Open your mouths wide, and God will fill
            them." "Be not straitened in yourselves; for you are not straitened

            and love, and hope, which it forms in the hearts of those who truly
