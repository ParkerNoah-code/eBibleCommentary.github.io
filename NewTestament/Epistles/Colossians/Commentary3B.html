            THE greatest joy of a faithful minister is to see his people
            spiritually flourish. The Apostles were eminent examples to us in
            this respect Paul was no less comforted with the piety of some, 2
            Corinthians 7:4, than he was grieved with the lack of it in others,

            THE Church of Christ in the first ages was composed of Jews and
            Gentiles. Now, the Jews were at all times fond of their own
            traditions, as the Gentiles were of the dogmas of philosophy: and
            the two, meeting together upon one common ground, were ready to
            incorporate their respective peculiarities with the Gospel of
            Christ. To what extent this has been done in Roman Catholic Church
            is well known. In truth,<i>
              the whole system of the Catholics is little better than a mixture
              of heathen rites with Jewish superstitions</i
            >. And those corruptions, which have prevailed to such an awful
            extent in the Church of Rome, began at a very early period to make
            their way into the house of God.

            Symptoms of an alarming nature had already appeared in the different
            Churches of Asia: and against them the Apostle put the Colossian
            converts on their guard; reminding them, that, whatever they might
            hope to <i>add </i>to Christ and his Gospel, their efforts would be
            in vain; since "in Him dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead
            bodily;" and, consequently, without any addition from the conceits
            of philosophy, or the traditions of Judaism, he was amply sufficient
            for the work assigned him, and was "able to save to the uttermost

            There are some texts, which, to a superficial observer, bear
            somewhat of a similar aspect with that before us. For instance, it
            is said in this very epistle, "It has pleased the Father, that in

              rel="noopener"
              >John 1:16</a
            >." There is yet a stronger expression in the Epistle to the
            Ephesians, wherein we are exhorted to contemplate the love of
            Christ, until we are "filled with all the fullness of God,
            <a

            fills all in all,
            <a
              class="rtBibleRef"

          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            From such Scriptures as these it is argued by many, that the
            fullness spoken of in my text is only a fullness of gifts committed
            to Christ for the use of his Church; and that we may as well assume
            to ourselves the character of the Godhead, as give it to him; since
            we, no less than he, are said to be "filled with all the fullness of
            God."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But, on a closer inspection, there will be found a wide difference
            between all the foregoing passages and our text. The fullness spoken
            of in the text is the fullness of "the Godhead;" residing in Christ,
            not symbolically, and for a season, as the Shechinah did in the
            tabernacle, but corporeally, substantially, permanently. There is no
            doubt a reference here to the Shechinah, which was a shadowy
            representation of the Deity. But the reference is rather in a way of
            contrast than of comparison: for, in my text, it is not God who is
            spoken of, and who is frequently said to dwell in his people, but
            the Godhead. Nor is Christ said to "be filled" with it, but to have
            it essentially dwelling in him; and this, not in a type or shadow,
            but really, vitally, necessarily, immutably: "In Him dwells all the
            fullness of the Godhead bodily."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Suppose, now, the Lord Jesus Christ to be truly and unquestionably
            God: suppose, too, it is God's purpose to make this known to us:
            then, I would ask, can we conceive of any words that would more
            clearly convey that truth than the language of my text? I must say,
            that if the words of my text do not clearly and decidedly declare
            the Godhead of Christ, no words whatever can express it. Nay, more;
            if Christ be not truly and properly God, the Apostle has done more,
            by his unguarded expressions, to lead us to idolatry, than all the
            most impious sophists in the universe could have done by their most
            ingenious arguments.

          <p align="justify">
            To enter fully into this subject, would embrace too large a field
            for one discourse. I shall therefore confine myself to a few
            passages only, which establish the Divinity of Christ in connection
            with his humanity. And here let me call to your remembrance that
            prophecy of Isaiah, where it is said, "To us a child is born; to us
            a son is given: and his name shall be called, The Mighty God!

          <p align="justify">
            Again, in another part of the same prophecy, it is said, "A Virgin
            shall conceive, and bring forth a son; and they shall call his name

            attentive to this point, and, more than all the other inspired
            writers, anxious to impress it on our minds, says expressly, "In the
            beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
            <i>was </i>God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,

            Supposing the Lord Jesus Christ to have been a creature, how could
            he make atonement for sin, or work out a righteousness that would be
            imputable to us? He could do no more than what, by the law of his
            creation, he was bound to do; and, after having done it, he would
            have been only "an unprofitable servant." Supposing him to be
            capable of meriting anything, he could have merited only for
            himself. If it is said, that the Divine appointment was sufficient
            to make his sufferings available for us also, I answer that,
            according to that argument, the same value might as easily have been
            stamped on the sacrifices of the Mosaic law, if God had seen fit to
            do so. But the Apostle has said, that "it is not possible for the
            blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins." And why not
            possible? If a Divine appointment were to stamp on one sacrifice a
            value which it possessed not, it might as well do so on another.
            But, if the impossibility arises from the inefficacy of a creature's
            blood, then it must attach to one creature as well as to another.
            For however remote two creatures may be asunder, their distance is
            but finite: whereas, to take away sin, the value of a sacrifice must
            be infinite: it must satisfy the demands of infinite justice, and
            entail upon the sinner all the blessings of infinite love and
            unbounded mercy. The divinity, of our blessed Lord renders all tins
            practical to him.

            The Mosaic code was perverted by the Jews. The Christian code has
            been no less perverted by those who have called themselves
            Christians. Even in the apostolic age, and while the Apostles were

            mutilate and pervert the Christian faith.

            through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men,
            after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ, verse 8."
            The heathen philosophers having multiplied their deities, and
            assigned to them a variety of ranks and offices, those who had been
            converted from among them still felt inclined to look to subordinate
            deities as their mediators and protectors: while others from among
            the Jews, who had, or pretended to have, a great veneration for
            Moses, could not part with the traditions which they had received
            from their fathers, and which they supposed to he highly conducive

            justification before God, besides that which the Scripture reveals,
            through the blood and righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ? Can it
            add any thing to the operations of the Holy Spirit for the

            was necessary for that end: he was circumcised, as being made under
            the law for us: he died under the curse of that law; and after
            having been buried in the grave, he rose again for our justification
            before God. Now all this which was done in him corporeally, is to be
            done in us spiritually: the one was intended to be a pattern of the
            other. This is very minutely set forth by the Apostle Paul, who
            tells us that the power exercised towards us who believe, exactly
            accords with that which was exercised towards our Lord Jesus Christ
            in all the fore-mentioned particulars:<br />
            his quickening from the dead, <br />

            principalities and powers of Heaven or Hell, <br />
            have all a counterpart in us, wrought by the same divine Agent.

            <u>a compound of Pagan idolatry and Jewish superstition</u>. For
            lack of seeing it before our eyes, we are apt to conceive of it as

            its masses, penances, indulgences, such a system of delusion and
            impiety as makes one's very blood run cold! It is inconceivable how
            such a system of tyranny and imposture would have ever gained
            footing in the world. Little do the Protestants of the present day
            reflect on the obligations which they owe to their forefathers, and
            on the responsibility attaching to them for the advantages they

            is still, in some places, as there was even in the apostolic age, a
            leaven of these deadly evils: but we speak, to those who have
            learned to seek a completeness in Christ and a conformity to Christ,
            as the unalienable privilege, not of themselves only, but of every

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            It was a false humility that led those in the apostolic age to seek
            other mediators or protectors besides Christ, and other means of
            obtaining his blessings than by faith alone. But while they assumed
            this "voluntary humility," they in reality were "vainly puffed up
            with a fleshly mind, verse 18." So it is with those in the present
            day, who look for something to recommend them to Christ, while they
            would be receiving all out of his fullness as a free unmerited gift.
            Their principle is precisely that of which the Apostle complained in
            the Colossian Church. They think it would be presumption in them to
            go directly to Christ, and to expect to be admitted by him with such
            a load of guilt and corruption as they feel: and therefore they hope
            to make themselves better before they go, so that they may find a
            readier acceptance with him. But this is to dishonor Christ, and to
            take from him both the sovereignty, and the riches, of his grace. We
            must never forget the terms on which alone we are to obtain the
            blessings of his salvation: we are to buy them, it is true; but we
            are to "buy them all without money and without price".

            It is "through faith in the Divine power" that all our completeness
            in Christ, or conformity to Christ, is to be obtained; and to
            exercise that faith, we are encouraged by the recollection of what
            that power has effected "in raising Christ from the dead The text."
            Take a view then of the Lord Jesus after his crucifixion: see him
            dead, and buried, and guarded by a host of enemies who were
            determined in a few hours to prove him an impostor. Is he beyond the
            reach of Divine power? No; at the appointed moment he rises, and
            ascends to Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, far above
            all the principalities and powers of earth and Hell. Are you then in
            a more desperate state than he? or is not the power of God alike
            able to effect this change for you? Yes, is it not as much pledged
            for you as it was for him? Fear not then, "nor stagger at the
            promises of God through unbelief;" but as Abraham before you was,
            "be strong in faith, giving glory to God."

            Paul in particular insists upon it in all his epistles; he declares
            that it was the only one thing which he deemed necessary for him to
            preach, or for his people to be acquainted with. He takes every
            occasion of magnifying its importance, and of urging his converts to

            innocent victim. From hence it appears, that "the hand-writing of
            ordinances," which, in its external obligation, related only to the
            Jews, did, in its spiritual and more enlarged sense, declare the
            state of all mankind, whether Jews or Gentiles: and in this view it
            was equally "against us, and contrary to us."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Now this hand-writing Christ has "blotted out," and, by "nailing it
            to his cross," has "taken it out of the way." There were different
            ways of cancelling a bond: sometimes it was blotted out; and
            sometimes it was pierced with a nail, and rendered thereby of no
            effect. Both these ways, if we may so speak, has Christ adopted,
            that we might have the fullest security that we shall never be dealt
            with according to the rigor of the law; and that the debt we owe on
            account of our sins shall never be required at our hands.
