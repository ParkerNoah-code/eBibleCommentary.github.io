        <h2>I. Opening: Grace and Peace (1:1-2)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and
            Timothy our brother,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus</em>. The apostle puts his name
          to this epistle, by which he was known in the Gentile world, as he
          usually does in all his epistles; and styles himself "an apostle", as
          he was, having seen Christ in person, and received his commission,
          doctrine, and qualifications immediately from him, with a power of
          doing miracles to confirm the truth of his mission. This he chose to
          make mention of, partly because the false teachers everywhere
          insinuated that he was not an apostle; and partly to give the greater
          sanction and authority, and command the greater regard and credit to
          what he should say; as well as to excuse his freedom in writing to
          them whom he had never seen, since he was an apostle of the Gentiles,
          and so to them; see Romans 11:13; he calls himself an apostle "of
          Jesus Christ"; not of men, he was not sent out by men, but by Christ,
          who appeared to him, made him a minister of his, gave him his Gospel
          by revelation, abundantly qualified him for the work, sent him forth
          unto the Gentiles, in whose name he went as an ambassador and
          messenger of his, and whom he preached, and by whom he was greatly
          succeeded, to the conversion of many souls, who were seals of his
          apostleship in every place (1 Cor 9:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Through the will of God</em>. Not by the will of men, for he
          derived no authority and power, nor received any doctrine from men;
          nor by his own will, of his own head, by any usurpation of his; he did
          not take this office upon him of himself, but was invested with it,
          according to the secret will and purpose of God, from everlasting, who
          had ordained and appointed him to this service, and according to his
          will of command made known to him in time, when he told him what he
          should do, and openly separated, and sent him forth to do the work he
          had called him to; and which arose not from any merits or worthiness
          of the apostle, but from the sovereign good will and pleasure, free
          grace and favour, of God, to which the apostle continually ascribes it
          in all his epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And Timothy our brother</em>. Who joined with the apostle in this
          epistle, and whom he calls a "brother"; partly because of the
          Christian relation he stood in to him, and them, they being all
          brethren, children of the same Father, partakers of the same grace of
          regeneration, belonging to the same family, and so should own and love
          one another as brethren; and partly and chiefly because of his being a
          brother, companion, fellow soldier, and a fellow labourer in the
          Gospel. He mentions him, either because he was known unto them, or
          that he might be so; and to show the agreement there was between them
          in the doctrine of Christ, which might have the greater weight with
          them to abide in it.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to
            you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>To the saints and faithful brothers</em>. This is the inscription
          of the epistle, in which the persons wrote unto are described as
          "saints", or holy men; not by birth, for all are unholy and unclean by
          nature; nor by baptism, for that neither takes away sin, nor gives
          grace; nor merely externally, by an outward reformation; but by
          separation, being by an act of eternal election set apart for God, for
          holiness, and happiness; and by imputation, Christ being made
          sanctification to them; and by the sanctifying grace of the Spirit of
          God in regeneration, being called with an holy calling, and having
          principles of grace and holiness wrought in them, and they formed as
          new men in righteousness and true holiness: and as "brethren"; being
          born of God, having him for their Father, and being of his household,
          and a part of the family in heaven and earth named of Christ, and
          heirs together of the grace of life, and of the heavenly glory: and as
          "faithful" ones; true and sincere believers in Christ, constant and
          persevering in the faith of him; faithful to the Gospel, and their
          profession of it, and to Christ, whose name they bore, and to one
          another, to whom they stood in the relation of brethren: and all this
          "in Christ"; and by, and through him; they were saints in him; they
          were chosen in him, and sanctified in him their head, and received all
          their holiness from him; they were brethren in him the firstborn of
          them; his God being their God, and his Father their Father; and had
          their faith and faithfulness from him, as well as it was exercised
          towards, and on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
            Christ</em
          >. This is the salutation, and which stands in this form in most of
          Paul's epistles.
