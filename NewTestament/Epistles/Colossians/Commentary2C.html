            "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all
            creation. For by him all things were created: things in Heaven and
            on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers
            or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. He is
            before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is
            the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the
            firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have
            the preeminence."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            THE preeminence he must have: the preeminence he shall have: his
            title to it is indisputable: and it is at the peril of our souls to
            withhold it from him. Do you ask, Of whom we speak thus? I answer,
            of the Lord Jesus Christ; of whom the Apostles evidently thought
            that they could never speak enough. Let the Apostle Paul but touch
            upon his name, and he launches forth in his praise, and scarcely
            knows when to stop.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Mark the passage before us. The Apostle had informed the Colossians
            what prayers and thanksgivings he daily poured forth before God, on
            their behalf. He especially praised God for "delivering them from
            the power of darkness, and translating them into the kingdom of his
            dear Son," and having thus, accidentally as it were, mentioned the
            Lord Jesus, he goes on to expatiate on his transcendent
            excellencies, not only as the Redeemer of his people, but as "the
            image of the invisible God, and the first-born (that is, the Heir
            and Lord) of the whole creation."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            And lest it would be thought that he was speaking too highly of the
            despised and persecuted Jesus, he proceeds yet further to establish
            his claim to these high titles, by declaring what he had done for
            the world at large, and for the Church in particular; and that the
            preeminence thus given him was no more than his due.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In opening up this sublime passage, I shall be led to show,

            <p align="justify">1. His personal dignity—</p>
          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            He, though born into the world as a little infant, after the world
            had existed four thousand years—was the Creator of all, the
            Preserver of all, the End of all. "By Him were all things created,"
            both in Heaven and earth, whether they be thrones or dominions, or
            principalities or powers. Whether they be "visible," as the heavenly
            bodies and the earth, with the things upon it; or whether they be
            "invisible," as the holy angels and the souls of men; he formed them
            all: whatever rank or order they possess in their respective
            spheres, (for it seems that in Heaven, as well as on earth and in
            Hell, there are beings of different ranks and orders,)
            <i>
              from his creating hand they have derived their existence, and from
              his sovereign will their station</i
            >.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor is there anything in the whole creation which is not upheld by
            him. He directs the <i>stars </i>in their orbits, and causes the sun
            and moon to know their appointed seasons. The smallest
            <i>insect </i> too, which is so small as to be invisible to the
            naked eye, is as much noticed and supplied by him, as if it were the
            only work of his hands. For himself too, as the supreme God, he made
            these things: and all of them, whether wittingly or unwittingly,
            subserve his glory.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            If we could suppose that God had delegated to Jesus the work of
            creating everything, and of upholding it in its order, (though, as
            he was the Creator of all things, he could not be himself a
            creature,) still it would be impossible for God to devolve on Jesus
            the honor of being the end of all things: that is incapable of being
            communicated to any creature: it is the prerogative of God alone:
            nor could he divest himself of it, without giving a license to his
            creatures to alienate from him the most essential rights of Godhead.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Behold, then, the Lord Jesus Christ, in this his personal dignity,
            as the author and end of all; and then say, whether he is not
            entitled to a pre-eminence above all? The highest archangel has no
            such claims. In respect of these things, he is on a level with the
            basest clod of earth; and must unite with all the rest of the
            creation in giving glory to our blessed Lord.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            In his <u>mediatorial</u> capacity he is no less glorious. He is
            "the Head of the Church, which is his body:" he is the Head of vital
            influence, from which every member receives his supply of grace; and
            he is the Head and Representative of all his members, who at this
            very moment "are risen, as it were, in him, and sitting in heavenly
            places in him,

            first-born from the dead."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            It is true that he existed before all; and that he was the most
            distinguished among those who have risen from the dead; having
            raised himself by his own power, while all others have owed their
            restoration to life to the miraculous exertion of God's power. But,
            as he is called "the first-born of the whole creation," not because
            he was himself created, but because the rights of the first-born all
            centered in him, and he was, as mediator, the Heir and Lord of all,

            dead," imports, that in his risen state the rights of primogeniture
            still attach to him; and that he is, in Heaven, the Head and
            Representative of all his members, who, in due time, shall
            participate in the glory which he there enjoys. This is what the
            Apostle elsewhere distinctly states; saying, "Now has Christ risen
            from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept,

            Consider him, then, in this his mediatorial character; and say,

            for their happiness; even as the moon and stars, no less than this

            text. It refuses to Christ the honor put upon him by the Father, and
            ascribes to <i>self </i>that which belongs to him alone. And shall
            it be thought a small evil to rob Christ of his glory? Shall it
            appear a light matter to rebel against the eternal counsels of the
            Father, and to set ourselves in direct opposition to his blessed
            will? Let none henceforth suppose, that the trusting in our own
            wisdom, righteousness, or strength, is a trivial offense: for surely
            God will be jealous for his own honor, and the honor of his dear
            Son; and will look with scorn on every proud Pharisee, while he will
            receive with boundless compassion the vilest of repenting harlots.

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            Vital godliness, especially under the Christian dispensation,
            consists in a conformity of mind to the revealed will of our
            heavenly Father. Now in no respect is that will more sacred than in
            reference to the glory designed for Christ; nor is there anything
            wherein a conformity to it is more characteristic of true and
            eminent piety.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            In one word then, the true Christian is well pleased that all
            fullness would dwell in Christ: if he might have some fullness in
            himself, he would rather have it in Christ, that he might receive
            all from him. Every part of salvation is the more endeared to him,
            on account of its coming through that channel: and it is his supreme
            felicity in this world, as it will be also in the world to come, to
            owe everything to that adorable Savior, and to glorify him in all,
            and for all.

          <p align="justify">
            Beloved, let this be your daily experience. Let it be your delight
            to live upon Christ's fullness; and it shall be his delight to
            communicate to you all spiritual and eternal blessings!

            This very strongly appears in the passage now before us. Having in
            the beginning of this chapter thanked God for bringing the
            Colossians to the knowledge of his Gospel, and informed them what
            were the peculiar blessings which in his daily prayers he sought for
            in their behalf, and what thanksgivings he constantly offered up,
            especially for that which they had experienced in being "translated
            from the power of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son," he
            launches forth into the praises of the Lord Jesus Christ for all
            that he had done in the creation, preservation, and redemption of
            the world, and particularly for his redeeming love, as manifested
            to, and exercised upon, the Colossian converts. But, as they were
            converts from the Gentile world, we may fitly consider his address
            to them as delivered also to us; and may take occasion from it to

          </b>
          <p align="justify">
            "We were <u>alienated</u> from God." This is no less true of us than
            of the idolatrous Gentiles: for though by <i>calling </i> ourselves
            Christians we have professed a regard for God and his Christ, we
            have not really sought our happiness in God: we have not even
            desired his favor, or used any means to obtain it. We have been
            contented to live at a distance from him, to put the very
            remembrance of him far from us, and to seek our happiness in things
            which had no proper tendency to endear either him to us, or us to
            him. However observant we may have been of outward forms, we have
            had no pleasure in communion with him. The exercises of prayer and
            praise have rather been an irksome task, than occupations in which
            we found our chief delight. And if at any time we have had
            opportunities of becoming better acquainted with God and with his
            holy will, we have not been forward to avail ourselves of them: and
            if instruction on the subject of his Gospel has been offered to us,
            we have rather turned away from it, as distasteful to us, than
            listened to it as pleasing to our souls. The very light which would
            have revealed him to us, has been offensive to us; and we have
            turned our eyes from it, as bringing to our view an object whose
            presence was to us a source of pain.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Nor is this all. We were "<u>enemies</u> to him;" yes, "enemies to
            him in our mind:" we have had a decided aversion to his law: instead
            of contemplating it as "holy, just, and good," we have viewed it as
            imposing a yoke that could not be endured. And this hatred to it has
            been proved by our actual rebellion against it: our "wicked works"
            have shown clearly enough that the service of sin was more congenial
            with our minds than the service of our God. As for all the sublime
            duties which God's law inculcates, we have lived in a willful
            neglect of them: and of innumerable evils which it forbids, we have
            lived in the daily and habitual commission. Such had been the state
            of the Colossians in their time of unregeneracy; and such is the
            state of every child of man, until he is renewed by God in the
            spirit of his mind.

            sinned he might bear the penalty that was due to sin, and expiate
            our guilt by his own blood. The sacrifices under the law were
            substituted in the place of the offender, and they surrendered up
            <i>their </i>life as an atonement for <i> his </i>sins: and through
            the death of the victim in his stead, the sinner was reconciled unto
            his God.

            when with penitential sorrow they implore mercy for Christ's sake.

            Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their

            sight of a holy God, or any pleasure in the employments which
            constitute the felicity of the heavenly hosts. To restore man
            therefore to the image which he had lost, was one great end of

            occasion: we must be so firmly "settled" in it, that a man may as
            well attempt to pluck the sun from the firmament, as to shake either
            our faith or hope. This is the way to "endure unto the end;" and it
            is in this way only that we can fulfill that beneficial injunction,
            "Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have
            wrought, but that you receive a full reward, 2 John verse 8."

            O! think what a mercy it is that God's wrath has not broken forth
            against you to your utter and everlasting destruction! Think how
            many of the human race are now suffering the penalty due to their
            sins in hopeless sorrows, and in torments of which we have no
            conception. Do not, I entreat you, let the efforts made for your
            salvation be in vain. Let not "Christ have died in vain;" and
            "receive not the grace of God in vain:" but "today, while it is
            called today, harden not your hearts, lest you provoke God to swear
            in his wrath that you shall never enter into his rest!"

              2. Are there here those whom God has reconciled to himself?

            How can you ever adore him as you ought to do? Can you reflect on
            the means he has used for your redemption. Can you reflect on his
            laying your iniquities on the person of his only dear Son, and not
            bless him? The wonder is, how you can find a moment for any other
            employment; and that you are not, like the lame man whom Peter and
            John healed, leaping, and dancing, and praising God every day and
            all the day long!
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            But, if this were the frame of your mind, I would still point you to
            a more excellent way of glorifying your heavenly Benefactor. You
            have seen that the Lord Jesus, in dying for you, sought "to present
            you to God holy, and unblamably and unreprovable in his sight:"
            <i
              >let his object then in redeeming you be the one object at which
              you shall aim through the remainder of your lives</i
            >. And remember, that it is not sufficient that you are unblamably
            and unreprovable before men; you must be so "in the sight of God"
            also, even of that "God who searches the heart, and tries the
            thoughts."
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            Let your secret walk with God be such as he will approve. Let your
            every temper, and disposition, and habit, mark the friendship that
            exists between God and you. And let every day be so spent, as if at
            the close of it you expected your soul to be required of you, and to
            be presented by your Savior to your reconciled God.
