          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>If you died with Christ</em>. To be clear, there's no doubt about
          your union with Christ leading to death alongside him. Your connection
          with him means you've shared in his crucifixion, burial, and
          resurrection. You've gained the benefits of redemption, pardon,
          justification, and reconciliation through his death. You've been
          planted together with him, experiencing a likeness to his death. This
          doesn't mean mere shared suffering; just as he died to sin and lived
          for God, you've done the same. The power of his death has made you
          dead to sin, preventing it from condemning and destroying you. In
          fact, it's like sin itself was crucified and destroyed by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as for the law – I'm talking about the moral law here – you do
          live in accordance with it, guided by Christ. But you don't seek life,
          righteousness, or salvation through it. You're dead to its
          justificatory role, and even to strict, compulsory obedience. You've
          moved beyond fearing its threats, curses, and condemnation to
          understanding it through the lens of your love for Christ. You're also
          dead to the ceremonial law, as it was always meant to lead you to
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>From the elemental spirits of the world</em>. The ordinances of a
          worldly sanctuary, the rites and ceremonies of the world, or state of
          the Jews, in opposition to, and distinction from, the Gospel
          dispensation, or times of the Messiah, called, and that by them, "the
          world to come": these were like letters to a language, or like the
          grammar, which contains the rudiments of it; these were the first
          principles of the oracles of God, which led to Christ, and had their
          accomplishment and end in him; and so believers were dead unto them,
          and delivered from them, as they were also to the world, the Jewish
          state, and were entered into the world to come; and even to this
          present evil world, and to the men and things of it, being by Christ
          crucified to it, and that to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Why, as though living in the world</em>. Since ye are dead unto
          it, and from the rudiments of it, why should ye be as though ye lived
          in it? his meaning is not, that they should not live in the world, nor
          among the men of it, for then they must needs go out of the world;
          saints may live in the world, though they are not of it, and among the
          inhabitants of it, though they do not belong to them, but to another
          and better country: nor does he suggest, that they lived according to
          the course of the world, as they did in their unregenerate state; but
          what he seems to blame them for, and reason with them about, was, that
          they acted as if they sought for life and righteousness in the
          rudiments of the world, or by their obedience to ceremonial rites, or
          human inventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Do you subject yourselves to ordinances</em>? Not civil and
          political ones, which are for the better and more orderly government
          of kingdoms, states, and cities, for these the saints ought to be
          subject to, both for the Lord's sake, and conscience sake; nor Gospel
          ordinances, as baptism, and the Lord's supper, for such all believers
          ought to submit unto; but either legal ones, the weak and beggarly
          elements, the yoke of bondage, the law of commandments contained in
          ordinances, the handwriting of ordinances, which some were desirous of
          conforming to; or rather the ordinances and appointments of the Jewish
          fathers, the traditions of the elders, their constitutions and
          decrees, which are collected together, and make up their Misna, or
          oral law; and so the argument is from the one to the other, from the
          greater to the less, that if they were delivered by Christ from the
          burdensome rites of the ceremonial law, which were originally
          appointed by God, it must be great weakness in them to be subject to
          the ordinances of men; or both the institutions of the ceremonial law,
          and the decrees of the Jewish doctors about them, which were devised
          by them, and added to them, and imposed as necessary to be observed,
          may be intended; of which the apostle gives some particulars in
          Colossians 2:21.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Ver 21-22.
          <em
            >“Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch” (all of which perish with
            use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch</em>. This the apostle says,
          not of himself, but in the person of the Jewish doctors; who urging
          the use of the ceremonial law, to which they added decrees and
          constitutions of their own, said, "touch not" the dead body of any
          man, the bone of a man, or a grave, any man or woman in their
          uncleanness; not only their flesh, but the bed they lay on, or the
          seat they sat on; or any creature that was by the law unclean; of a
          Gentile, or any notorious sinner, or common man: hence the Pharisees
          used to wash themselves when they returned from market, lest they
          should have been by any means accidentally defiled by touching any
          thing unclean. There is a treatise in their Misna, called Oholot,
          which gives many rules, and is full of decrees about things "that
          defile by touching". And so they likewise said, "taste not", neither
          the fat, nor the blood of any creature which might be eaten itself,
          nor swine's flesh, nor the flesh of any creature that chewed the cud,
          or divided the hoof; nor might the Nazarites taste wine, or strong
          drink, or vinegar made of either, or moist grapes, or even the kernels
          and husks; and if a man ate but the quantity of an olive of any of the
          above things, he was, according to the Jewish canons, to be cut off,
          or beaten x: and they also said, "handle not"; or, as the Syriac and
          Arabic read, "do not come near", or "draw not nigh", to a Gentile, to
          one of another nation, or any unclean person, to whom they forbid any
          near approach or conversation; or "handle not" any of the above
          things. Some think that these several rules have respect only to
          meats; as "touch not", that is, do not eat of things forbidden ever so
          little; nay, "taste not", do not let anything of them come within your
          lips; yea, "handle not", do not so much as touch them with your
          fingers. Others think that touch not regards abstinence from women;
          see 1 Corinthians 7:1; and respects the prohibition of marriage by
          some in those times; and "taste not", the forbearance of certain
          meats, at certain times, which God had not restrained any from; and
          "handle not", that is, make no use of, or enjoy your own goods, and so
          designs that voluntary poverty which some entered into under the
          direction of false teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>All of which perish with use</em>. Meaning either the ordinances
          concerning touching, tasting, and handling, which bring destruction
          and death on them that use them, and comply with them, in order to
          obtain righteousness and life; for instead of enjoying salvation
          through them, they were the cause of damnation to them. Or rather the
          meats not to be touched, tasted, or handled; these are in their own
          nature perishing things, and perish by being used; they are only of
          service to the body, and can be of none to the soul; the using of them
          cannot defile the man, nor an abstinence from them sanctify him, or
          commend him to God; they only relate to this present life, and will
          cease with it, and can have no manner of influence on the spiritual
          and eternal concerns of men: and besides, the ordinances concerning
          them are not of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>According to the precepts and doctrines of men</em>? For so even
          the ceremonial law, being now abolished, though originally of God, yet
          the imposition of it, as necessary to salvation, was a commandment and
          doctrine of man's; and particularly the traditions of the elders, and
          the various rules and decrees, which the doctors among the Jews
          obliged men to regard, were human inventions and devices: and this is
          another reason the apostle makes use of to dissuade from any regard
          unto them; for whatever is of man, and not of God, in religious
          worship, ought to be rejected.

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>These things indeed appear like wisdom</em>. The authors of them
          set up for men of wisdom, and were esteemed such, and are often styled
          "wise men"; and their scholars that received their traditions, and
          explained and enforced them on others, "the disciples of the wise
          men": and they pretended, that these constitutions of theirs were "a
          hedge for the law", and for the honour of it, and to preserve it, and
          keep men from transgressing it; and this carried in it some appearance
          of wisdom: and their pretensions to it lay in self-imposed worship,
          humility, and severity to the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In self-imposed worship</em>. Being what was over and above that
          which was commanded by God, and so, like the freewill offerings under
          the law, must be acceptable to him; this was one of their colours,
          which had some show of wisdom, religion, and zeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Humility</em>. In worshipping of angels, and not coming directly,
          and with boldness, to God or Christ; or rather in subjecting
          themselves to the yoke of the law, and submitting to the decrees of
          the fathers and doctors of the church, who were more wise, and
          learned, and knowing than they, and so had the appearance of prudence,
          gentleness, and goodness
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And severity to the body</em>. By fastings and watchings, whereby
          they seemed to be very religious and devout, holy and mortified
          persons, who kept under their bodies, subdued their unruly appetites,
          and fulfilled not the lusts of the flesh: but then this was only a
          show of wisdom and godliness; there was no truth nor reality in these
          things; they were only a mere form, an outside show, a mere pretence;
          there was no true devotion nor religion in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>But aren’t of any value</em>. Or to be had in any esteem; for if
          the rites of the ceremonial law itself were weak and beggarly
          elements, much more must these additions to it, and corruptions of it,
          be such; and at most only regarded things external.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Against the indulgence of the flesh</em>. Either the body, or the
          carnal mind, in which they were vainly pulled up: though some consider
          this last clause as explanative of the former, "neglecting of the
          body", or not sparing it, but afflicting it with austerities of life;
          depriving it of its proper right, what is necessary for it, not taking
          due care of it, so as to satisfy nature; whereby instead of honouring,
          they dishonoured it: for though the body is not to be pampered, and
          the lusts of it indulged, or luxury and intemperance to be encouraged;
          yet since the body is the work of God's hands, is the habitation of
          the soul, and by which it performs its offices, and is the purchase of
          Christ, the temple of the Holy Spirit, and will be raised a glorious
          body at the last day, it ought not to be neglected and dishonoured;
          but should have a sufficiency of food and clothing, whereby it may be
          comfortably and honourably nourished and supported.
