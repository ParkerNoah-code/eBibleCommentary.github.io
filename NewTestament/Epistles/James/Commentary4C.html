        <h2>
          Ver 21.
          <em
            >Wasn‚Äôt Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up
            Isaac his son on the altar?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          We must understand the state of the question, for the dispute here is
          not respecting the cause of justification, but only what avails a
          profession of faith without works, and what opinion we are to form of
          it. It would be absurd to try to prove by this passage that man is
          justified in a legal sense by works, because James meant no such
          thing. For the proofs which he subjoins refer to this declaration,
          that no faith, or only a dead faith, is without works. No one will
          ever understand what is said, nor judge wisely of words, except he who
          keeps in view the design of the writer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Justified</em>. We must take notice of the two fold meaning of the
          word justified. Paul means by it the gratuitous imputation of
          righteousness before the tribunal of God; and James, the manifestation
          of righteousness by the conduct, and that before men, as we may gather
          from the preceding words, "Show to me thy faith," etc. In this sense
          we fully allow that man is justified by works, as when any one says
          that a man is enriched by the purchase of a large and valuable chest,
          because his riches, before hid, shut up in a chest, were thus made
          known.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Wasn‚Äôt Abraham our father justified by works</em>? Not as the
          causes of his justification (see Rom 4:2), but as effects of it,
          showing the truth of his faith, and the reality of his justification:
          he had both faith and works, and the former were known by the latter;
          and even the faith which he had expressed years ago was manifested,
          demonstrated, and confirmed to be true and genuine, by the instance of
          his obedience to God, here produced; by which it appeared he was a
          true believer, a justified person, approved of God, and loved by him.
          Now if this was the case of Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation,
          yea, the father of the faithful, of all that believe, he is, and must
          be a vain man, that talks of faith without works; and his faith must
          be a dead one, and he be very unlike the father of them that believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar</em>. For when he
          was bid to take his son, his only and beloved son, Isaac, and offer
          him up on one of the mountains, that should be shown him, he made
          haste to do it; he provided everything for it; he split the wood, and
          carried it with him, and fire in his hand; he built an altar, laid the
          wood on it, bound his son, laid the wood on the altar, and his son on
          the wood, and stretched out his hand, with his knife in it, to slay
          him; so that it was all one, with respect to his intention and will,
          as if he had actually offered him, and was a full trial and proof of
          his obedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was not the only act of obedience, or good work, which he
          performed; but this being a very eminent one, the apostle instances in
          it, as a very considerable evidence of his faith in God, and love to
          him; and which showed him to be a justified person, as he was long
          before he performed this action, even before Isaac was born; see
          Genesis 15:6 and therefore it can never be the apostle's meaning, that
          he was justified before God by this, or any other good work or works,
          as cause or causes of it; but only that he was declared to be so; or,
          in other words, that his faith was attended with good works, and
          evidenced by them.
