          Ver 14.
          <em
            >What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has
            no works? Can faith save him?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>What good is it?</em> The apostle having finished his discourse on
          respect of persons, and the arguments he used to dissuade from it, by
          an easy transition passes to treat upon faith and works, showing that
          faith without works, particularly without works of mercy, is of no
          profit and advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If a man says he has faith, but has no works?</em> It is clear
          that the apostle is not speaking of true faith, for that, in persons
          capable of performing them, is not without works; it is an operative
          grace; it works by love and kindness, both to Christ, and to his
          members; but of a profession of faith, a mere historical one, by which
          a man, at most, assents to the truth of things, as even devils do,
          James 2:19 and only says he has faith, but has it not; as Simon the
          Sorcerer, who said he believed, but did not (Acts 8:9-24).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Can faith save him?</em> When he says "Can faith save him?" his
          meaning is "Can the faith which he says he has save him?" that is,
          faith which is dead and produces no works; for that is the faith
          clearly intended here, as it appears from what follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same as though he had said, that we do not attain
          salvation by a frigid and bare knowledge of God, which all confess to
          be most true; for salvation comes to us by faith for this reason,
          because it joins us to God. And this comes not in any other way than
          by being united to the body of Christ, so that, living through his
          Spirit, we are also governed by him. There is no such thing as this in
          the dead image of faith. There is then no wonder that James denies
          that salvation is connected with it.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 15-16.
          <em
            >And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, and
            one of you tells them, ‚ÄúGo in peace. Be warmed and filled;‚Äù yet you
            didn‚Äôt give them the things the body needs, what good is it?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>If a brother or sister</em>. He takes an example from what was
          connected with his subject; for he had been exhorting them to exercise
          the duties of love. If any one, on the contrary, boasted that he was
          satisfied with faith without works, he compares this shadowy faith to
          the saying of one who bids a famished man to be filled without
          supplying him with the food of which he is destitute. As, then, he who
          sends away a poor man with words, and offers him no help, treats him
          with mockery, so they who devise for themselves faith without works,
          and without any of the duties of religion, trifle with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Go in peace. Be warmed and filled</em>. As the saying of a man to
          the naked, "Be ye clothed and fed," when he does nothing, effects no
          good and is wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no works;
          it being as it were dead, it cannot save.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What good is it?</em> He repeats this phrase once more to prove
          his point. These will neither warm them, nor fill them; or the persons
          themselves, that say these tidings to them: and the apostle, by this
          instance, shows, that as that charity which lies only in words, and in
          tongue, and not in deed, and in truth, is unprofitable, and good for
          nothing, even to them that profess it; so that faith, which a man says
          he has, and yet is without works, is alike unprofitable unto him.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 17. <em>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is like a lifeless carcass, a body without a soul (2:26), for as
          works, without faith, are dead works, so faith, without works, is a
          dead faith, and not like the lively hope and faith of regenerated
          persons: and indeed, such who have no other faith than this are dead
          in trespasses and sins; not that works are the life of faith, or that
          the life of faith lies in, and flows from works; but good works are
          second acts, necessarily flowing from the life of faith; to which may
          be added, and by these faith appears to be living, lively and active,
          or such who perform them appear to be true and living believers.
