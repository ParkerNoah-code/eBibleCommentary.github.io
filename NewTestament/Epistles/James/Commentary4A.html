            Lyrics: <br />
            When we walk with the Lord<br />
            in the light of his word,<br />
            what a glory he sheds on our way!<br />
            While we do his good will,<br />
            he abides with us still,<br />
            and with all who will trust and obey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br />
            to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not a shadow can rise,<br />
            not a cloud in the skies,<br />
            but his smile quickly drives it away;<br />
            not a doubt nor a fear,<br />
            not a sigh nor a tear,<br />
            can abide while we trust and obey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not a burden we bear,<br />
            not a sorrow we share,<br />
            but our toil he doth richly repay;<br />
            not a grief or a loss,<br />
            not a frown or a cross,<br />
            but is blest if we trust and obey.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we never can prove<br />
            the delights of his love<br />
            until all on the altar we lay;<br />
            for the favor he shows,<br />
            and the joy he bestows,<br />
            are for them who will trust and obey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then in fellowship sweet<br />
            we will sit at his feet,<br />
            or we'll walk by his side in the way;<br />
            what he says we will do,<br />
            where he sends we will go;<br />
            never fear, only trust and obey.

          <p>
            <em>What good is it?</em> The apostle having finished his discourse
            on respect of persons, and the arguments he used to dissuade from
            it, by an easy transition passes to treat upon faith and works,
            showing that faith without works, particularly without works of
            mercy, is of no profit and advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If a man says he has faith, but has no works?</em> It is clear
            that the apostle is not speaking of true faith, for that, in persons
            capable of performing them, is not without works; it is an operative
            grace; it works by love and kindness, both to Christ, and to his
            members; but of a profession of faith, a mere historical one, by
            which a man, at most, assents to the truth of things, as even devils
            do, James 2:19 and only says he has faith, but has it not; as Simon
            the Sorcerer, who said he believed, but did not (Acts 8:9-24).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Can faith save him?</em> When he says "Can faith save him?" his
            meaning is "Can the faith which he says he has save him?" that is,
            faith which is dead and produces no works; for that is the faith
            clearly intended here, as it appears from what follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the same as though he had said, that we do not attain
            salvation by a frigid and bare knowledge of God, which all confess
            to be most true; for salvation comes to us by faith for this reason,
            because it joins us to God. And this comes not in any other way than
            by being united to the body of Christ, so that, living through his
            Spirit, we are also governed by him. There is no such thing as this
            in the dead image of faith. There is then no wonder that James
            denies that salvation is connected with it.
          </p>

              >And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
              and one of you tells them, ‚ÄúGo in peace. Be warmed and filled;‚Äù

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>If a brother or sister</em>. He takes an example from what was
            connected with his subject; for he had been exhorting them to
            exercise the duties of love. If any one, on the contrary, boasted
            that he was satisfied with faith without works, he compares this
            shadowy faith to the saying of one who bids a famished man to be
            filled without supplying him with the food of which he is destitute.
            As, then, he who sends away a poor man with words, and offers him no
            help, treats him with mockery, so they who devise for themselves
            faith without works, and without any of the duties of religion,
            trifle with God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Go in peace. Be warmed and filled</em>. As the saying of a man
            to the naked, "Be ye clothed and fed," when he does nothing, effects
            no good and is wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no
            works; it being as it were dead, it cannot save.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>What good is it?</em> He repeats this phrase once more to prove
            his point. These will neither warm them, nor fill them; or the
            persons themselves, that say these tidings to them: and the apostle,
            by this instance, shows, that as that charity which lies only in
            words, and in tongue, and not in deed, and in truth, is
            unprofitable, and good for nothing, even to them that profess it; so
            that faith, which a man says he has, and yet is without works, is
            alike unprofitable unto him.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 17.
            <em>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            It is like a lifeless carcass, a body without a soul (2:26), for as
            works, without faith, are dead works, so faith, without works, is a
            dead faith, and not like the lively hope and faith of regenerated
            persons: and indeed, such who have no other faith than this are dead
            in trespasses and sins; not that works are the life of faith, or
            that the life of faith lies in, and flows from works; but good works
            are second acts, necessarily flowing from the life of faith; to
            which may be added, and by these faith appears to be living, lively
            and active, or such who perform them appear to be true and living
            believers.

            ·ΩÑœÜŒµŒªŒøœÇ). Transitioning from exhortation, the apostle meets the case
            of those who seek to avoid practice, by sheltering themselves under
            the pretence of faith. He begins by asking a rhetorical question
            using an expression commonly found in the animated style of moral
            diatribes. ·ΩÑœÜŒµŒªŒøœÇ is only elsewhere used in 1 Cor 15:32.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If anyone claims to have faith</em> or
            <em>If someone says they have faith</em> (·ºê·Ω∞ŒΩ œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπŒΩ ŒªŒ≠Œ≥·øÉ œÑŒπœÇ
            ·ºîœáŒµŒπŒΩ). Many expositors place the emphasis on "says" (ŒªŒ≠Œ≥·øÉ), as if
            the assertion was a mere pretext and the one speaking does not, in
            reality, possess faith. It is self-evident that James is not arguing
            that a faith, which one has not, cannot save him. That it is not
            simply said ·ºê·Ω∞ŒΩ œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπŒΩ œÑŒπœÇ ·ºîœáŒ∑, is explained from his lively mode of
            representation, by which he introduces his opponent as appealing to
            his "faith" (œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also incorrect to emphasize the want of the article before
            "faith" (œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ). The article is here wanting, as is often the case
            in the N. T. where the word expresses something definite in itself,
            particularly when it is to be brought forward according to its
            quality. For those whom James combats considered their faith to be
            whole and complete faith which was sufficient to save them. Nor were
            they lacking in confidence in their faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            They indeed believed, but they did not receive Christ in themselves
            as a principle of a new life. The object of their faith remained to
            them purely external, and thus they lacked those works which spring
            from living faith. They believed in the way demons believe (v. 19).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But has no works</em> (·ºîœÅŒ≥Œ± Œ¥·Ω≤ Œº·Ω¥ ·ºîœá·øÉ). ·ºîœÅŒ≥Œ± ("works") is
            entirely general, but according to the context means those works are
            which are proofs of living faith. Again, it is the spurious claim to
            faith that James here condemns. Put one way: they possess a dead
            faith, a demon-like faith, a non-saving faith, a mere intellectual
            belief. Put another way: they do not possess a real, living, saving,
            active, true, faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Can such faith save him?</em> or
            <em>Is that faith that he spoke of able to save him?</em> (ŒºŒ∑
            Œ¥œçŒΩŒ±œÑŒ±Œπ ·º° œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ œÉ·ø∂œÉŒ±Œπ Œ±·ΩêœÑœåŒΩ). Negative answer expected from ŒºŒ∑.
            Effective aorist active infinitive œÉœâœÉŒ± (from œÉœâŒ∂œâ). The article ·º°
            here refers back to the claim of faith which has no works just made,
            so that which is here called "faith" (œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ), which James denies as
            being able to save, is again the spurious claim of faith called
            "dead faith" in v. 17. The force of it then is: that faith which you
            speak of, that which is called faith, faith in the manner the
            speaker claims; James' use of "wisdom" in 3:15 is another example of
            this. "Him" (Œ±·ΩêœÑœåŒΩ) refers back to the subject "anyone" (œÑŒπœÇ), that
            is, to the person whom James has introduced as speaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is often taught that James denies to faith its saving-power. With
            the previous observations, it is evident that James does not affirm
            generally that faith cannot save, but that the "faith" of one who
            remains destitute of works cannot save. The force of the second
            question, then, confirms and narrows the judgment contained in the
            first: that it profits nothing and doesn't save to have a faith that
            works not.
