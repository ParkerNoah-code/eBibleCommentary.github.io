        <h2>A. Can that Faith Save Him? (2:14-17)</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Ver 14.</b> Τί τὸ ὄφελος, ἀδελφοί μου, ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν,
          ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ; μη δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What is the profit?</em> or <em>What use is it?</em> (Τί τὸ
          ὄφελος). Transitioning from exhortation, the apostle meets the case of
          those who seek to avoid practice, by sheltering themselves under the
          pretence of faith. He begins by asking a rhetorical question using an
          expression commonly found in the animated style of moral diatribes.
          ὄφελος is only elsewhere used in 1 Cor 15:32.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If anyone claims to have faith</em> or
          <em>If someone says they have faith</em> (ἐὰν πίστιν λέγῃ τις ἔχειν).
          Many expositors place the emphasis on "says" (λέγῃ), as if the
          assertion was a mere pretext and the one speaking does not, in
          reality, possess faith. It is self-evident that James is not arguing
          that a faith, which one has not, cannot save him. That it is not
          simply said ἐὰν πίστιν τις ἔχη, is explained from his lively mode of
          representation, by which he introduces his opponent as appealing to
          his "faith" (πίστις).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also incorrect to emphasize the want of the article before
          "faith" (πίστις). The article is here wanting, as is often the case in
          the N. T. where the word expresses something definite in itself,
          particularly when it is to be brought forward according to its
          quality. For those whom James combats considered their faith to be
          whole and complete faith which was sufficient to save them. Nor were
          they lacking in confidence in their faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          They indeed believed, but they did not receive Christ in themselves as
          a principle of a new life. The object of their faith remained to them
          purely external, and thus they lacked those works which spring from
          living faith. They believed in the way demons believe (v. 19).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>But has no works</em> (ἔργα δὲ μὴ ἔχῃ). ἔργα ("works") is entirely
          general, but according to the context means those works are which are
          proofs of living faith. Again, it is the spurious claim to faith that
          James here condemns. Put one way: they possess a dead faith, a
          demon-like faith, a non-saving faith, a mere intellectual belief. Put
          another way: they do not possess a real, living, saving, active, true,
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Can such faith save him?</em> or
          <em>Is that faith that he spoke of able to save him?</em> (μη δύναται
          ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν). Negative answer expected from μη. Effective
          aorist active infinitive σωσα (from σωζω). The article ἡ here refers
          back to the claim of faith which has no works just made, so that which
          is here called "faith" (πίστις), which James denies as being able to
          save, is again the spurious claim of faith called "dead faith" in v.
          17. The force of it then is: that faith which you speak of, that which
          is called faith, faith in the manner the speaker claims; James' use of
          "wisdom" in 3:15 for another example of this. "Him" (αὐτόν) refers
          back to the subject "anyone" (τις), that is, to the person whom James
          has introduced as speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often taught that James denies to faith its saving-power. With
          the previous observations, it is evident that James does not affirm
          generally that faith cannot save, but that the "faith" of one who
          remains destitute of works cannot save. The force of the second
          question, then, confirms and narrows the judgment contained in the
          first: that it profits nothing and doesn't save to have a faith that
          works not.
        </p>

          <b>Ver 15-16.</b> Ἐὰν δὲ ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἀδελφὴ γυμνοὶ ὑπάρχωσιν καὶ
          λειπόμενοι ὦσιν τῆς ἐφημέρου τροφῆς, εἴπῃ δέ τις αὐτοῖς ἐξ ὑμῶν,
          Ὑπάγετε ἐν εἰρήνῃ, θερμαίνεσθε καὶ χορτάζεσθε, μὴ δῶτε δὲ αὐτοῖς τὰ
          ἐπιτήδεια τοῦ σώματος, τί τὸ ὄφελος;
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <p>
          <b>Ver 17.</b> Οὕτως καὶ ἡ πίστις, ἐὰν μὴ ἔργα ἔχῃ, νεκρά ἐστιν καθ'
          ἑαυτήν.
