        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various

          <span class="tab"></span> <em>All joy</em>. The first exhortation is,
          to bear trials with a cheerful mind. And it was especially necessary
          at that time to comfort the Jews, almost overwhelmed as they were with
          troubles. For the very name of the nation was so infamous, that they
          were hated and despised by all people wherever they went; and their
          condition as Christians rendered them still more miserable, because
          they held their own nation as their most inveterate enemies. However,
          this consolation is not only suited for this specific situation, but
          is always useful to believers, whose life is a constant warfare on
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          But that we may know more fully what he means, we must doubtless take
          <em>temptations</em> or trials as including all adverse things; and
          they are so called, because they are the tests of our obedience to
          God. He bids the faithful, while exercised with these, to rejoice; and
          that not only when they fall into one temptation, but into many, not
          only of one kind, but of various kinds. And doubtless, since they
          serve to mortify our flesh, as the vices of the flesh continue to work
          in us, so they must necessarily be often repeated. Besides, as we
          labor under diseases, so it is no wonder that different remedies are
          applied to remove them. The Lord then afflicts us in various ways,
          because ambition, avarice, envy, gluttony, intemperance, excessive
          love of the world, and the innumerable lusts in which we abound,
          cannot be cured by the same medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> When he bids us to
          <em>count it all joy</em>, it is the same as though he had said, that
          temptations ought to be so deemed as gain, as to be regarded as
          occasions of joy. He means, in short, that there is nothing in
          afflictions which ought to disturb our joy. And thus, he not only
          commands us to bear adversities calmly, and with an even mind, but
          shows us that this is a reason why the faithful should rejoice when
          pressed down by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          It is, indeed, certain, that all the senses of our nature are so
          formed, that every trial produces in us grief and sorrow; and no one
          of us can so far divest himself of his nature as not to grieve and be
          sorrowful whenever he feels any evil. But this does not prevent the
          children of God to rise, by the guidance of the Spirit, above the
          sorrow of the flesh. Hence it is, that in the midst of trouble they
          cease not to rejoice.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em>knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span> <em>Knowing that the testing</em>. We now
          see why he called adversities trials or temptations, even because they
          serve to try our faith. And there is here a reason given to confirm
          the last sentence. For it might, on the other hand, be objected, "How
          comes it, that we judge that sweet which to the sense is bitter?" He
          then shows by the effect that we ought to rejoice in afflictions,
          because they produce fruit that ought to be highly valued, even
          patience. If God then provides for our salvation, he affords us an
          occasion of rejoicing. Peter uses a similar argument at the beginning
          of his first Epistle, "That the trial of your faith, more precious
          than gold, may be," etc. We certainly dread diseases, and want, and
          exile, and prison, and reproach, and death, because we regard them as
          evils; but when we understand that they are turned through God's
          kindness unto helps and aids to our salvation, it is ingratitude to
          murmur, and not willingly to submit to be thus paternally dealt with.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>Paul says, in Romans 5:3, that we are to
          glory in tribulations; and James says here, that we are to rejoice.
          "We glory," says Paul, "in tribulations, knowing that tribulation
          worketh patience." What immediately follows seems contrary to the
          words of James; for he mentions probation in the third place, as the
          effect of patience, which is here put first as though it were the
          cause. But the solution is obvious; the word there has an active, but
          here a passive meaning. Probation or trial is said by James to produce
          patience; for were not God to try us, but leave us free from trouble,
          there would be no patience, which is no other thing than fortitude of
          mind in bearing evils. But Paul means, that while by enduring we
          conquer evils, we experience how much God's help avails in
          necessities; for then the truth of God is as it were in reality
          manifested to us. Hence it comes that we dare to entertain more hope
          as to futurity; for the truth of God, known by experience, is more
          fully believed by us. Hence Paul teaches that by such a probation,
          that is, by such an experience of divine grace, hope is produced, not
          that hope then only begins, but that it increases and is confirmed.
          But both mean, that tribulation is the means by which patience is
          produced.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>Moreover, the minds of men are not so formed
          by nature, that affliction of itself produces patience in them. But
          Paul and Peter regard not so much the nature of men as the providence
          of God through which it comes, that the faithful learn patience from
          troubles; for the ungodly are thereby more and more provoked to
          madness, as the example of Pharaoh proves.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 4.
          <em
            >Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and
            complete, lacking in nothing.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>Let endurance have its perfect work.</em>
          As boldness and courage often appear in us and soon fail, he therefore
          requires perseverance. "Real patience," he says, "is that which
          endures to the end." For
          <em>work</em> here means the effort not only to overcome in one
          contest, but to persevere through life. His perfection may also he
          referred to the sincerity of the soul, that men ought willingly and
          not feignedly to submit to God; but as the word <em>work</em> is
          added, I prefer to explain it of constancy. For there are many, as we
          have said, who show at first an heroic greatness, and shortly after
          grow weary and faint. He therefore bids those who would be perfect and
          entire, to persevere to the end. But what he means by these two words,
          he afterwards explains of those who fail not, or become not wearied:
          for they, who being overcome as to patience, be broken down, must, by
          degrees, be necessarily weakened, and at length wholly fail.
