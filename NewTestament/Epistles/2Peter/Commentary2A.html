          <p>
            <em>His divine power</em>. Meaning either the power of God the
            Father, to whom belong eternal power and Godhead; and he is
            sometimes called by the name of power itself; see Matthew 26:64
            being all powerful and mighty; or rather the power of Christ, since
            he is the next and immediate antecedent to this relative; and who,
            as he has the fulness of the Godhead in him, is almighty, and can do
            all things; and is "El-shaddai", God all-sufficient, and can
            communicate all things whatsoever he pleases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Has granted to us all things that pertain to life and
              godliness</em
            >. Referring not so much to a temporal life, though he gives that
            and preserves it, and furnishes with all the mercies and comforts of
            it; and which come to us, from him, in a covenant way, as his left
            hand blessings, and in great love; but rather a spiritual life,
            which he is the author and maintainer of, all the joys, pleasures,
            blessings, and supports of it, being given by him; as also eternal
            life, for that, and everything appertaining to it, are from him; he
            gives a meetness for it, which is his own grace, and a right unto
            it, which is his own righteousness; and he has power to give that
            itself to as many as the Father has given him, and he does give it
            to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise all things belonging to "godliness", or internal religion;
            and which is the means of eternal life, and leads on to it, and is
            connected with it, and has the promise both of this life, and of
            that which is to come; and everything relating to it, or is in it,
            or it consists of, is from Christ: the internal graces of the
            Spirit, as faith, hope, and love, which, when in exercise, are the
            principal parts of powerful godliness, are the gifts of Christ, are
            received out of his fulness, and of which he is the author and
            finisher; and he is the donor of all the fresh supplies of grace to
            maintain the inward power of religion, and to assist in the external
            exercise of it.
