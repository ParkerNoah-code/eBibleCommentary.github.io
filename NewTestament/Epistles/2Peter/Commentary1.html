          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ</em>. The
          writer of this epistle is described first by his names, Simon Peter;
          Simon, or Simeon as it is sometimes put, was the name by which he was
          called from his infancy by his parents, and by which he was known when
          Christ called him to be a disciple and follower of him (Acts 15:14), a
          name common with the Jews; Peter is what was given him by Christ at
          his conversion (Jn 1:4), and answers to Cephas in the Syriac language;
          and both signify a rock or stone, because he was built upon Christ,
          the rock and foundation, and chief corner stone, and with a view to
          his future solidity, firmness, and constancy: and he is next described
          by his character as a servant, not of sin, nor Satan, nor man, but
          Jesus Christ, whose servant he was, not only by creation, but by
          redemption and grace; and not merely a servant of his, in common with
          other believers, but in a ministerial way, as a preacher of the
          Gospel, which this phrase sometimes designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of it shows the apostle's humility, his sense of obligation to
          Christ, and acknowledgment of him as his Lord, and that he esteemed it
          an honour to stand in such a relation to him: but to distinguish him
          from a common servant of Christ, and an ordinary minister of the word,
          it is added, "an apostle of Jesus Christ": one that was immediately
          sent by Christ, had his commission and doctrine directly from him, and
          a power of working miracles, in confirmation of his mission and
          ministry being divine, and an authority at large to go everywhere and
          preach the Gospel, plant churches, and put them in due order, and
          place proper persons over them. This is said to give weight and
          authority to his epistle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To those who have obtained a like precious faith with us</em>.
          They were believers in Christ, who had a faith of the right kind; not
          a faith of doing miracles, which was not common to all, nor was it
          saving; nor a mere assent to truths, nor a temporary one, or a bare
          profession of faith; but that faith which is the faith of God's elect,
          the gift of his grace, and the operation of his power; which sees the
          Son, goes to him, ventures on him, trusts in him, lives upon him, and
          works by love to him. This is said to be "precious", as it is in its
          own nature, being a rich and enriching grace, of more worth and value
          than gold that perisheth, or than thousands of gold and silver; it is
          not to be equalled by, nor purchased with the riches of the whole
          world; it is precious in its object, it being conversant with the
          precious person, precious blood, and precious righteousness and
          sacrifice of Christ, and is that grace which makes Christ, and all
          that is his, precious to souls; it is precious in its acts and
          usefulness; it is that grace by which men go to God and Christ,
          receive from them, and give all glory to them, and without which it is
          not possible to please God: to which add the durableness of it; it is
          an abiding grace, and will never fail, when the most precious things
          in nature do.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a commendation of the grace which God had indiscriminately
          showed to all his elect people; for it was no common gift, that they
          had all been called to one and the same faith, since faith is the
          special and chief good of man. But he calls it like or equally
          precious, not that it is equal in all, but because all possess by
          faith the same Christ with his righteousness, and the same salvation.
          Though then the measure is different, that does not prevent the
          knowledge of God from being common to all, and the fruit which
          proceeds from it. Thus we have a real fellowship of faith with Peter
          and the Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In the righteousness of... Christ</em>. In order that they might
          know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or
          strength, but through God's favor alone. For these things stand
          opposed the one to the other, the righteousness of God (in the sense
          in which it is taken here) and the merit of man. For the efficient
          cause of faith is called God's righteousness for this reason, because
          no one is capable of conferring it on himself. So the righteousness
          that is to be understood, is not that which remains in God, but that
          which he imparts to men, as in Romans 3:22. Besides, he ascribes this
          righteousness in common to God and to Christ, because it flows from
          God, and through Christ it flows down to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ</em>.
          Here is a testimony of the deity of Christ, as well as of his
          character as a Saviour, who is an able and a willing one, a full,
          complete, suitable, and only Saviour: and the reason why he is so is
          because he is truly and properly "God"; and why he is so to us,
          because he is "our" God: wherefore by "righteousness" here, cannot be
          meant the goodness and mercy of God, as some think, though faith
          undoubtedly comes through that; nor the faithfulness of God making
          good his purpose and promise of giving faith to his elect, as others
          think: but the righteousness of Christ, which is not the righteousness
          of a creature, but of God; that is wrought out by one that is God, as
          well as man, and so answerable to all the purposes for which it is
          brought in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now faith comes "in", or "with" this righteousness, as the phrase may
          be rendered; when the Spirit of God reveals and brings near this
          righteousness to a poor sensible sinner, he at the same time works
          faith in him to look to it, lay hold upon it, and plead it as his
          justifying righteousness with God: or it comes "through" it; hence it
          appears that faith and righteousness are two distinct things; and that
          faith is not a man's righteousness before God, for it comes to him
          through it; as also that righteousness is before faith, or otherwise
          faith could not come by it; and, moreover, is the cause and reason of
          it; faith has no causal influence upon righteousness, but
          righteousness has upon faith: the reason why a man has a justifying
          righteousness is not because he has faith; but the reason why he has
          faith given him is because he has a justifying righteousness provided
          for him, and imputed to him.

          Ver 2.
          <em
            >Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of God and of
            Jesus our Lord,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Grace</em>. By grace is designated God's paternal favor towards
          us. We have indeed been once for all reconciled to God by the death of
          Christ, and by faith we come to the possession of this so great a
          benefit; but as we perceive the grace of God according to the measure
          of our faith, it is said to increase according to our perception when
          it becomes more fully known to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Peace</em>. For as the beginning of our happiness is when God
          receives us into favor; so the more he confirms his love in our
          hearts, the richer blessing he confers on us, so that we become happy
          and prosperous in all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Be multiplied</em>. By a multiplication of grace may be meant a
          larger discovery of the love and favour of God; which though it admits
          of no degrees in itself, being never more or less in God's heart, yet,
          as to the manifestations of it, it is different, and capable of being
          increased, and drawn out to a greater length; or else an increase of
          the internal graces of the Spirit of God, as to the actings and
          exercise of them; or a larger measure of the gifts of the Spirit, for
          greater usefulness among them; or a clearer view, and a more enlarged
          knowledge of the Gospel of the grace of God, and the truths of it; and
          indeed, the word grace may take in all these senses: and by a
          multiplication of peace, which the apostle in this salutation also
          wishes for, may be designed an affluence of all kind of prosperity,
          temporal, and spiritual, external and internal; and more especially an
          increase of spiritual peace, a fulness of joy and peace in believing,
          arising from a sense of free justification by Christ's righteousness,
          and full pardon and atonement by his blood and sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>In the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord</em>. Which is to be
          understood, not of a natural, but of a spiritual and evangelical
          knowledge; of a knowledge of God, not as the God of nature and
          providence, but as the God of all grace, as in Christ, and a covenant
          God in him, and of the person, offices, and grace of Christ; and which
          designs true faith in him, by which means larger discoveries of the
          grace of God are made, and a greater enjoyment of spiritual peace is
          had. The apostle prays, as for a multiplication of grace and peace, so
          along with it, an increase of spiritual and evangelical knowledge
          which in the best is imperfect, but may be increased by the blessing
          of God on those means which he has appointed for that end.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the more any one advances in the knowledge of God, every kind of
          blessing increases also equally with the sense of divine love.
          Whosoever then aspires to the full fruition of the blessed life which
          is mentioned by Peter, must remember to observe the right way. He
          connects together at the same time the knowledge of God and of Christ;
          because God cannot be rightly known except in Christ, according to
          that saying, "No one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom
          the Son will reveal him." (Mat 11:27).
