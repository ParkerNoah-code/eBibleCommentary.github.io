        <h2>AUTHORSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          In the case of these Epistles it seems best to consider the question
          of authorship first, and to treat them as a unity in the discussion of
          their authenticity. When we examine the external testimony to these
          letters we find that this is in no way deficient. If many have doubted
          their genuineness, it was not because they discovered that the early
          Church did not recognize them. It is true that some early heretics,
          who acknowledged the genuineness of the other letters attributed to
          Paul, rejected these, such as Basilides and Marcion, but Jerome says
          that their adverse judgment was purely arbitrary. From the time of
          Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian, who were the first to
          quote the New Testament books by name, until the beginning of the
          nineteenth century, no one doubted the Pauline authorship of these
          letters. The Muratorian Fragment ascribes them to Paul, and they are
          included in all MSS., Versions and Lists of the Pauline letters, in
          all of which (with the single exception of the Muratorian Fragment)
          they are arranged in the same order, viz. I Timothy, II Timothy,
          Titus.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the internal evidence is concerned we may call attention in
          a preliminary way to a few facts that favor the authenticity of these
          letters and take up the consideration of other features in connection
          with the objections that are urged against them. They are all
          self-attested; they contain the characteristic Pauline blessing at the
          beginning, end with the customary salutation, and reveal the usual
          solicitude of Paul for his churches and for those associated with him
          in the work; they point to the same relation between Paul and his
          spiritual sons Timothy and Titus that we know from other sources; and
          they refer to persons (cf. 2 Tim 4:1-22. Titus 3:1-15) that are also
          mentioned elsewhere as companions and co-laborers of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet it is especially on the strength of internal evidence that these
          Epistles have been attacked. J. E. C. Schmidt in 1804, soon followed
          by Schleiermacher, was the first one to cast doubt on their
          genuineness. Since that time they have been rejected, not only by the
          Tubingen school and by practically all negative critics, but also by
          some scholars that usually incline to the conservative side, such as
          Neander (rejecting only I Timothy), Meyer; (Introd. to Romans) and
          Sabatier. While the majority of radical critics reject these letters
          unconditionally, Credner, Harnack, Hausrath and McGiffert believe that
          they contain some genuine Pauline sections; the last named scholar
          regarding especially the passages that contain personal references,
          such as 2 Tim 1:15-18; 2 Tim 4:9-21; Titus 3:12-13, as authentic, and
          surmising that some others may be saved from the ruins, The Apostolic
          Age p. 405 if. The genuineness of the Pastorals is defended by Weiss,
          Zahn, Salmon, Godet, Barth, and nearly all the Commentators, such as
          Huther, Van Oosterzee, Ellicott, Alford, White (in The Exp. Gk. Test.)
          e. a.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several arguments are employed to discredit the authenticity of these
          letters. We shall briefly consider the most important ones. (1) It is
          impossible to find a place for their composition and the historical
          situation which they reflect in the life of Paul, as we know it from
          the Acts of the Apostles. Reuss, who provisionally accepted their
          Pauline authorship in his, History of the New Testament I pp. 80-85;
          121-129, did so with the distinct proviso that they had to fit into
          the narrative of Acts somewhere. Finding that his scheme did not work
          out well, he afterwards rejected I Timothy and Titus. Cf. his
          Commentary on the Pastorals. (2) The conception of Christianity found
          in these letters is un-Pauline and clearly represents a later
          development. They contain indeed some Pauline ideas, but these are
          exceptional. “There is no trace whatever,” says McGiifert, “of the
          great fundamental truth of Paul’s gospel,—death unto the flesh and
          life in the Spirit.” Instead of the faith by which we are justified
          and united to Christ, we find piety and good works prominently in the
          foreground. Cf. 1 Tim 1:5; 1 Tim 2:2; 1 Tim 2:15; 1 Tim 4:7 f.; 1 Tim
          5:4; 1 Tim 6:6;—2 Tim 1:3; 2 Tim 3:5; 2 Tim 3:12;—Titus 1:1; Titus
          2:12. Moreover the word faith does not, as in the letters of Paul,
          denote the faith that believes, but rather the sum and substance of
          that which is believed, 1 Tim 1:19; 1 Tim 3:9; 1 Tim 4:1; 1 Tim 4:6; 1
          Tim 5:8. And sound doctrine is spoken of in a way that reminds one of
          the characteristic esteem in which orthodoxy was later held, cf. 1 Tim
          1:10; 1 Tim 4:6; 1 Tim 6:3 ;— 2 Tim 4:3 ;—Titus 1:9; Titus 2:1; Titus
          2:7. (3) The church organization that is reflected in these letters
          points to a later age. It is unlikely that Paul, believing as he did
          in the speedy second coming of Christ, would pay so much attention to
          details of organization; nor does it seem probable that he would lay
          such stress on the offices received by ecclesiastical appointment, and
          have so little regard to the spiritual gifts that are independent of
          official position and that occupy a very prominent place in the
          undoubted writings of the apostle. Moreover the organization assumed
          in these letters reveals second century conditions. Alongside of the
          πρεσβύτεροιthe ἐπίσκοποςis named as a primus inter pares (notice the
          singular in 1 Tim 3:1; Titus 1:7); and the office-bearers in general
          are given undue prominence. There is a separate class of widows, of
          which some held an official position in the Church, just as there was
          in the second century, 1 Timothy 5. Ecclesiastical office is conferred
          by the laying on of hands, 1 Tim 5:22; and the second marriage of
          bishops, deacons, and ministering widows was not to be tolerated, 1
          Tim 3:2; 1 Tim 3:12; 1 Tim 5:9-11; Titus 1:6. (4) The false teachers
          and teachings to which the Epistles refer are evidently second century
          Gnostics and Gnosticism. The term ἀντιθὲσεις, 1 Tim 6:20, according to
          Baur, contains a reference to the work of Marcion which bore that
          title. And the endless genealogies of 1 Tim 1:4 are supposed to refer
          to the Aeons of Valentinus. (5) The most weighty objection is,
          however, that the style of these letters differs from that of the
          Pauline Epistles to such a degree as to imply diversity of authorship.
          Says Davidson: “The change of style is too great to comport with
          identity of authorship. Imitations of phrases and terms occurring in
          Pauls authentic Epistles are obvious; inferiority and feebleness show
          dependence; while the new constructions and words betray a writer
          treating of new circumstances and giving expression to new ideas, yet
          personating the apostle all the while. The change is palpable; though
          the author throws himself back into the situation of Paul the
          prisoner.” Introd. II p. 66. Holtzmann claims that of the 897 words
          that constitute these letters (proper names excepted) 171 (read 148)
          are ἅπαξ λεγόμενα of which 74 are found in I Timothy, 46 in II
          Timothy, and 28 in Titus. Besides these there is a great number of
          phrases and expressions that are peculiar and point away from Paul,
          such as δώκειν δικαιοσύνην, 1 Tim 6:11; 2 Tim 2:22; φυλάσσειν τὴν
          παραθήκην, 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 1:12; 2 Tim 1:14; παρακολουθεῖν τῇ
          διδασκαλία̨, 1 Tim 4:6; 2 Tim 3:10; βέβηλοι κενοφωνίαι, 1 Tim 6:20; 2
          Tim 2:16; ἅ̓νθρωπος θεοῦ 1 Tim 6:11; 2 Tim 3:17; etc. On the other hand
          many expressions that play a prominent part in Pauline literature are
          absent from these letters, as ἄδικος, ἀκροβυστία, γνωπίζειν,
          δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ, δικαίωμα, ἔ̓́ργα νόμου, ὁμοίωμα, παράδοσις, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the first argument is concerned, it must be admitted that
          these Epistles do not fit in the life of Paul, as we know it from the
          Acts of the Apostles. Their genuineness depends on the question,
          whether or not Paul was set free again after the imprisonment
          described in Acts 28:1-31. Now we have reasons, aside from the
          contents of these Epistles, to believe that he was liberated and
          resumed his missionary labors. In view of the fact that Felix, Festus
          and Agrippa found no guilt in Paul, and that the apostle was sent to
          Rome, only because he appealed to Caesar, the presumption is that he
          was not condemned at Rome. This presumption is greatly strengthened by
          the fact that, when the apostle wrote his letters to the Philippians
          and to Philemon, the prospect of his release seemed favorable, Php
          1:25; Php 2:24; Phm 1:22; compare 2 Tim 4:6-8. It is objected to this
          that Paul, in taking his farewell of the Ephesian elders, says to
          them: “I know (οἷδα) that ye all—shall see my face no more,” Acts
          20:25. But it may be doubted, whether we have the right to press this
          οἷδα so that it becomes prophetic; if we have, it is counterbalanced
          by the οἷδα in Php 1:25. The most natural inference from the data of
          Scripture (outside of these Epistles) is that Paul was set free; and
          this is confirmed by the tradition of the early Church, as it is
          expressed by Eusebius, Church Hist. II 22: Paul is said (λόγος
          ἓχει)after having defended himself to have set forth again upon the
          ministry of preaching, and to have entered the same city a second
          time, and to have ended his life by martyrdom. Whilst then a prisoner,
          he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy, in which he both mentions his
          first defense, and his impending death.” Moreover the Muratorian
          Fragment speaks of a visit that Paul paid to Spain, which cannot be
          placed before the first Roman imprisonment. And Clement of Rome states
          in his letter to the Corinthians, after relating that the apostle
          labored in the East and in the West, that he came to “the boundaries
          of the West.” Now it does not seem likely that he, who himself lived
          in Rome, would refer to the city on the Tiber in those terms. And if
          this is not the import of those words, the presumption is that he too
          has reference to Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul’s movements after his release are uncertain, and all that can be
          said regarding, them is conjectural. Leaving Rome he probably first
          repaired to Macedonia and Asia Minor for the intended visits, Php
          1:23-26; Phm 1:22, and then undertook his long looked for journey to
          Spain, Rom 15:24. Returning from there, he possibly went to Ephesus,
          where he had a dispute with Hymenaeus and Alexander, 1 Tim 1:20, and
          engaged the services of Onesiphorus, 2 Tim 1:16-18. Leaving Timothy in
          charge of the Ephesian church, he departed for Macedonia, 1 Tim 1:3,
          from where he most likely wrote I Timothy. After this he may have
          visited Crete with Titus, leaving the latter there to organize the
          churches, Titus 1:5, and returning to Ephesus according to his wishes,
          1 Tim 3:14; 1 Tim 4:13, where Alexander the coppersmith did him great
          evil, 2 Tim 4:14. From here he probably wrote the Epistle to Titus,
          for he was evidently in some center of missionary enterprise, when he
          composed it, Titus 3:12-15. Departing from Ephesus, he went through
          Miletus, 2 Tim 4:20 to Troas, 2 Tim 4:13, where he was probably
          re-arrested, and whence he was taken to Rome by way of Corinth, the
          abode of Erastus, 2 Tim 4:20; Rom 16:23. In that case he did not reach
          Nicopolis, where he intended to spend the winter. In this statement we
          proceed on the assumption that the winter mentioned in 2 Tim 4:21 is
          the same as that of Titus 3:12. The second imprisonment of Paul was
          more severe than the first, 2 Tim 1:16-17; 2 Tim 2:9. His first
          defense appears to have been successful, 2 Tim 4:16-17, but as his
          final hearing drew nigh, he had a presentiment of approaching
          martyrdom. According to the Chronicles of Eusebius Paul died as a
          martyr in the thirteenth year of Nero, or A. D. 67.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objection that the theological teaching of these Epistles is
          different from that of Paul, must be taken cum grano salis, because
          this teaching merely complements and in no way contradicts the
          representation of the undoubted Epistles. We find no further objective
          development of the truth here, but only a practical application of the
          doctrines already unfolded in previous letters. And it was entirely
          fitting that, as every individual letter, so too the entire cycle of
          Pauline Epistles should end with practical admonitions. Historically
          this is easily explained, on the one hand, by the fact that the
          productive period of the apostles life had come to an end, and it is
          now Paul the aged—for all the vicissitudes of a busy and stormy life
          must greatly have sapped his strength—that speaks to us, cf. Phm 1:9;
          and, on the other hand, by the fact that the heresy which the apostle
          here encounters had developed into ethical corruption. If it is said
          that the writer of these Epistles ascribes a meritorious character to
          good works, we take exception and qualify that as a false statement.
          The passages referred to, such as 1 Tim 1:15; 1 Tim 3:13; 1 Tim 4:8; 1
          Tim 6:18 if.; 2 Tim 4:8, do not prove the assertion. Since a rather
          full statement of the Christian truth had preceded these letters, it
          need not cause surprise that Paul should refer to it as “the sound
          doctrine,” Cf. Rom 6:17. Nor does it seem strange, in view of this,
          that alongside of the subjective the objective sense of the word faith
          should begin to assert itself. We find an approach to this already in
          Rom 12:6; Gal 1:23; Php 1:27.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a mistake to think that the emphasis which these letters place
          on the external organization of the churches, and the particular type
          of ecclesiastical polity which they reflect, precludes their Pauline
          authorship. There is nothing strange in the fact that Paul, knowing
          that the day of Christ was not at hand (2 Thes 2:1-12), should lay
          special stress on church government now that his ministry was drawing
          to a close. It might rather have caused surprise, if he had not thus
          made provision for the future of his churches. And it is perfectly
          natural also that he should emphasize the offices in the church rather
          than the extraordinary spiritual gifts, since these gradually vanished
          and made place for the ordinary ministry of the Word. The position
          that the office-bearers mentioned in these letters prove a development
          beyond that of the apostolic age. is not substantiated by the facts.
          Deacons were appointed shortly after the establishment of the Church,
          Acts 6; elders were chosen from place to place, as the apostle founded
          churches among the Gentiles, Acts 14:23; and in Php 1:1 Paul addresses
          not only the Philippians in general, but also “the bishops and
          deacons.” Moreover in Eph 4:11 the apostle says: “And He gave you some
          apostles; and some prophets; and some evangelists; and some pastors
          and teachers.” Surely it does not seem that the Pastoral Epistles are
          strikingly different in this respect from the others. If it be said
          that the bishop becomes so prominent here as to indicate that the
          leaven of hierarchy was already working, we answer that in the New
          Testament the terms ἐπίσκοπος and πρεσβύτερος; are clearly synonymous.
          The fact that the bishop is spoken of in the singular proves nothing
          to the contrary. Not once are bishops and presbyters arranged
          alongside of each other as denoting two separate classes, and in Titus
          1:5-7 the terms are clearly interchangeable. The case of Phebe, Rom
          16:1 certainly does not countenance the theory that the office of
          deaconess was not called into existence until the second century. And
          the passages that are supposed to prohibit the second marriage of
          office-bearers are of too uncertain interpretation to justify the
          conclusions drawn from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Granted that the errors to which these letters refer were of a Gnostic
          character—as Alford is willing to grant—, it by no means follows that
          the Epistles are second century productions, since the first signs of
          the Gnostic heresy are known to have made their appearance in the
          apostolic age. But it is an unproved assumption that the writer refers
          to Gnosticism of any kind. It is perfectly evident from the letters
          that the heresy was of a Judaeistic, though not of a Pharisaic type,
          resembling very much the error that threatened the Colossian church.
          Hort, after examining it carefully comes to the conclusion that “there
          is a total want of evidence for anything pointing to even rudimentary
          Gnosticism or Essenism.” In view of the fact that the errorists prided
          themselves as being teachers of the law, 1 Tim 1:7, and that the term
          γενεαλογία is brought in close connection with “strivings about the
          law” in Titus 3:9, the presumption is that it contains no reference
          whatever to the emanations of Gnostic aeons, but rather, as Zahn
          surmises, to rabbinic disputations regarding Jewish genealogies. And
          the word “antitheses,” of which Hort says that it cannot refer to
          Marcions work, is simply descriptive of the opposition in which the
          heretics that boasted of a higher knowledge placed themselves to the
          Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument from style has often proved to be a very precarious one.
          If a persons vocabulary were a fixed quantity, he were limited to the
          use of certain set phrases and expressions, and his style, once
          acquired, were unchangeable and necessarily wanting in flexibility, a
          plausible case might be made out. But as a matter of fact such is not
          the usual condition of things, and certainly was not the case with
          Paul, who to a great extent moulded the language of the New Testament.
          We need not and cannot deny that the language of the Pastorals has
          many peculiarities, but in seeking to explain these we should not
          immediately take refuge in a supposed difference of authorship, but
          rather make allowance for the influence of Paul’s advancing years, of
          the altered conditions of his life, of the situation in which his
          readers were placed. And of the subjects with which he was obliged to
          deal in these Epistles. And let us not forget what N. J. D. White
          says, Exp. Gk. Test. IV p. 63, that “the acknowledged peculiarities
          must not be allowed to obscure the equally undoubted fact that the
          Epistles present not only as many characteristic Pauline words as the
          writer had use for, but that, in the more significant matter of turns
          of expression, the style of the letters is fundamentally Pauline. Cf.
          also the judicious remarks of Reuss on the style of these letters.
          History of the New Testament, I p. 123.
        </p>
        <p>
          In concluding our discussion of the authenticity of the Pastoral
          Epistles we desire to remark: (1) The critics admit that the
          objections urged by them against the genuineness of these letters do
          not apply to all three of them in the same degree. According to Baur
          II Timothy and Titus are the least suspicious. He maintains, however,
          that I Timothy will always be “the betrayer of its spurious brothers.”
          But it would be reasonable to turn the statement about with Reuss, and
          to say that “so long as no decisive and palpable proofs of the
          contrary are presented the two which are in and of themselves less
          suspicious ought always to afford protection to the third which is
          more so.” Ibid. p. 84. (2) Baur and his followers rightly held that,
          in order to prove the spuriousness of these letters, they had to point
          out the positive purpose of the forgery; in which, according to Reuss,
          they utterly failed, when they said that it was to combat the Gnostic
          heresies that were prevalent after A. D. 150, Ibid. p. 124 f. (3) It
          looks a great deal like a confession of defeat, when several of the
          negative critics admit that the passages in which personal
          reminiscences are found, must be regarded as genuine, for it means
          that they yield their case wherever they can be controlled. For a
          broader discussion of the authenticity of these letters, cf. Alford,
          Prolegomena Section I; Holtzmann, Einl. pp. 274-292; Zahn, Einl. I pp.
          459-491; Godet, Introd. pp. 567-611; Farrar, St. Paul, II pp. 607-622;
          Salmon, Introd. pp. 433-452; McGiffert, Apostolic Age pp. 399-423;
          Davidson, Introd. II pp. 21-76. Lock (in Hastings D. B. Artt. I
          Timothy, II Timothy and Titus.)
