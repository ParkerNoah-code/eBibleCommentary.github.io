        <h2>THE EPISTOLARY FORM IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE.</h2>
        <p>
          The revelation of God comes to us in many forms, in diverse manners.
          It is not only embodied in facts, but also in words; it is borne not
          only by the prophets, but also by the sweet singers and by the wise
          men of Israel; it finds expression not only in the Gospels, but also
          in the Epistles. About one-third of the New Testament is cast in the
          epistolary form.
        </p>
        <p>
          This form of teaching was not something absolutely new in the time of
          the apostles, although we find but few traces of it in the Old
          Testament. Mention is made there of some letters written by kings and
          prophets, in 1Ki_21:8-9; 2Ki_5:5-7; 2Ki_19:14; 2Ki_20:12; Jer_29:1;
          but these are quite different from our New Testament Epistles. The
          letter as a particular type of self-expression took its rise, so it
          seems, among the Greeks and the Egyptians. In later time it was also
          found among the Romans and in Hellenistic Judaism, as we notice from
          the epistle of Aristion, that treats of the origin of the Septuagint.
          According to Deissmann the Egyptian papyri especially offer a great
          amount of material for comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all probability, however, it was Paul who first introduced the
          epistle as a distinct type of literary form for the conveyance of
          divine truth. Aside from the Gospels his Epistles form the most
          prominent part of the New Testament. In this connection it is well to
          bear in mind the important distinction made by Deissmann between a
          letter and an epistle, of which the former is non-literary, or, as J.
          V. Bartlet says, “pre-literary,” and the latter is a literary artistic
          form of communication. It is Deissmann’s conviction that the writings
          of Paul have been very much misunderstood. “They have been regarded as
          treatises, as pamphlets in letter form, or at any rate as literary
          productions, as the theological works of the primitive Christian
          dogmatist.” He insists that they are letters, serving the purpose of
          communication between Paul and the congregations, letters that were
          not intended by Paul for publication, but only for the private use of
          the addressees, arising from some historical exigency, unsystematic
          and pulsating with the life of the writer. Deissmann, St. Paul p. 7
          ff. This writer certainly rendered us good service by calling
          attention to the fact, often lost sight of, that the Epistles of Paul
          are the living spontaneous expression of a great mind, continually
          meditating and reflecting on the truth of God; that they are letters,
          often clearly revealing the changing moods of the apostle. They are
          marked as letters by their occasional character, by their being
          calculated for a single community and situation, and by their
          addresses, prescripts and salutations.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the fitness of this form for the communication of the
          divine thoughts the remarks of Bernard are very valuable. He finds
          that it is in perfect harmony “with that open and equal participation
          of revealed truth, which is the prerogative of the later above the
          former dispensation; indicating too that the teacher and the taught
          are placed on one common level in the fellowship of the truth. The
          prophets delivered oracles to the People, but the apostles wrote
          letters to the brethren, letters characterized by all that fulness of
          unreserved explanation, and that play of various feeling, which are
          proper to that form of intercourse. It is in its nature a more
          familiar communication, as between those who are or should be equals.”
          “The form adopted in the New Testament combines the advantages of the
          treatise and the conversation. The letter may treat important subjects
          with accuracy and fulness, but it will do so in immediate connection
          with actual life. It is written to meet any occasion. It is addressed
          to peculiar states of mind. It breathes of the heart of the writer. It
          takes its aim from the exigencies, and its tone from the feelings of
          the moment.” Bernard, The Progress of Doctrine in the N. T. pp. 156,
          157.
        </p>
        <h2>THE INSPIRATION OF THE EPISTLES</h2>
        <p>
          The Scriptural Epistles are as well as the Gospels and Acts divinely
          inspired. Even as in their preaching, so also in writing their letters
          the apostles were guided by the Holy Spirit. Here again we must
          distinguish between the apostolic and the graphical inspiration,
          although in this case the two are very closely connected. For a
          general description of the apostolic inspiration we refer to p. 30 if.
          above. It is necessary to remark, however, that in the case of the
          Epistles, as distinguished from that of the Gospels, it did not almost
          exclusively assume the character of a ὑπομνήσις, but was also to a
          great extent a διδασκαλία. Both of those elements are indicated in the
          promise of the Holy Spirit given by Christ before his departure: “But
          the Comforter, even the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my
          name, He shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all
          that I said unto you.” Joh_14:26. Cf. also Joh_16:12-13. In the
          Gospels we have the totality of the apostolic κήρυγμα hence their
          production naturally depended in great measure on a faithful memory.
          The Epistles, on the other hand, contain the fruit of the apostles
          reflection on this κήρυγμα, their interpretation of it. Therefore it
          was not sufficient that the writers in composing them should
          faithfully remember former things; they needed more light on them, a
          better understanding of their real meaning and profound significance.
          For that reason the Holy Spirit became their διδασκαλος.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostles were evidently conscious of being inspired by the Holy
          Ghost in the composition of their Epistles. This follows from the
          authority with which they address the congregations. They feel sure
          that their word is binding on the conscience; they condemn in
          unqualified terms those who teach any other doctrine as coming from
          God; they commend and praise all that diligently follow their
          directions; but they also reprimand and censure those that dare to
          follow another course. If this is not due to the fact that they were
          conscious of divine inspiration, it bespeaks an overweening arrogance;
          which, however cannot be harmonized with their life of service and
          their many expressions of deep humility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover there are several explicit statements in the Epistles
          testifying to the fact that the apostles were aware of being the
          instruments of Gods Spirit. Thus Paul claims that the Spirit revealed
          to him the hidden things of God, which he also spoke, not in words
          which man’s wisdom taught, but in words which the Spirit taught,
          1Co_2:10; 1Co_2:13. He is willing to subject his words to the judgment
          of the prophets, 1Co_14:37; and to give a proof of Christ speaking in
          him, 2Co_13:3. He thanks God that the Thessalonians received the word
          of his message, not as the word of man, “but as it is in truth, the
          word of God,” 1Th_2:13; and admonishes them to hold the traditions
          which they were taught by his word or by his Epistle. Peter places the
          word of the prophets and that of the apostles on a level as the Word
          of God, in 1Pe_1:10-12; and elsewhere he arranges his Epistle
          alongside of those of Paul, which he calls Scripture by implication,
          and thus clearly shows that he also regards his own writing as a
          product of the Spirit of God, 2Pe_3:15-16. John writes: “We are of
          God; he that knoweth God knoweth us; he that is not of God knoweth us
          not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.”
          1Jn_4:6. This language is intelligible only on the supposition that
          John spoke the words of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we must bear in mind that the apostles speak thus regarding their
          written words, so that they were evidently conscious of the guidance
          of the Holy Spirit in writing their Epistles. To that extent they too
          shared in a separate transcriptive inspiration. Their Epistles are a
          part of the Word of God, and have been accepted as such by the Church.
          It is true that for a time five of them, viz., the Epistles of James
          and Jude, II Peter and II and III John, were classed as antilegomena,
          but this only means that their canonicity was subject to doubt and
          dispute for a while, not that they were ever numbered among the
          spurious books. They have been recognized by the majority of
          ecclesiastical writers from the very beginning, and were generally
          accepted by the Church after the council of Laodicea in A. D. 363.
        </p>
        <h2>THE CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EPISTLES IN GENERAL</h2>
        <p>
          The Old and the New Testament revelations run on parallel lines. In
          the Old Testament we have the fundamental revelation of the Law in the
          Pentateuch; in the New Testament, the fundamental revelation of the
          Gospel in the fourfold witness of the evangelists. This is followed in
          the Old Testament by the historical books, revealing the institutions
          to which the Law gave rise; and in the New Testament, by a historical
          book, showing how the Gospel of Jesus Christ found embodiment in the
          Church. After this we find in the New Testament the Epistles that
          reveal the operation of the truth in the churches, and contain, in
          connection with the life of the churches, the interpretation of the
          Gospel; thus corresponding in part to the Old Testament books of
          experience, such as Job, Psalms, Proverbs, etc., and in part to the
          prophets as interpreters of the Law. The Gospels show us, how Christ
          was preached to the world; the Epistles, how he was taught to the
          Church. The former contain the facts of the manifestation of Christ;
          the latter the effects of it in the spiritual experience of the
          churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Epistles we get a glimpse of the inner life of the
          congregations; we see, how they receive the truth and to what degree
          they are guided by it in their actions. We behold Christian life in
          operation, working on the great principles that have been received. We
          find that some heartily embrace the truth and endeavor to apply it
          consistently to life in its manifold forms; that others grasp it but
          imperfectly and, as a result, misapply it in practical life; and that
          still others resist the truth and pervert it to their own
          condemnation. And in connection with these conditions the truth is now
          set forth and interpreted and applied to the multifarious relations of
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This teaching is given in the epistolary form, of which we have
          already spoken. Cf. p.129 above. And the method employed by the
          writers in presenting the truth is, as Bernard says, “one of
          companionship rather than of dictation.” They do not announce a series
          of revelations that come to them from without, but they speak out of
          the fulness of their own Christian knowledge and experience. Neither
          do they approach their readers with the authoritative prophetic
          formula, “Thus saith the Lord,” which in the Old Testament was the end
          of all contradiction; but they appeal to the judgment and conscience
          of those whom they address. They state their propositions and then
          substantiate them by giving the grounds on which they rest. They argue
          with their readers from the Old Testament, from generally admitted
          truths and from experience, often employing the argumentum ad hominem
          to give point to their teachings; and they intercept the objections of
          their readers and refute them. This method of teaching, as compared
          with that of the prophets, is more truly human, the divine factor
          being less prominent; and as compared with that of Christ in the
          Gospels, is far more argumentative, calculated to train the minds of
          men to that thoughtfulness that leads to a thorough assimilation of
          the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In their contents as well as in their form the Epistles are a distinct
          advance on the Gospels. After the latter have presented to us the
          manifestation of Christ in the world, the former treat of the life in
          Christ, in which the acceptance of his manifestation issues. After the
          Spirit of God has been poured out, Christ, who had formerly dwelt
          among men, makes his abode in the very hearts of believers. Hence it
          is especially of that new life of believers in union with Christ, that
          the Epistles speak. They constantly emphasize the fact that the
          individual believers and that the churches are “in Christ,” and that
          therefore their conversation too must be “in Christ.” They clearly
          interpret the significance of Christ’s work for believers out of every
          nation and tribe. and point out that his experiences are paralleled in
          the life of every believer. All those that are united with Christ by
          faith suffer with Christ, are crucified with Christ, die with Christ,
          and live with Christ in newness of life. And their future life is hid
          with Christ in God. The origin of that new life, its conditions, its
          nature, its progressive and communal character, and its final
          perfection and glory,—are all clearly described in the Epistles. As
          the foundation on which all these blessings rest we are pointed to the
          redemptive, the justifying, the sanctifying, and the intercessory work
          of Jesus Christ. He is the beginning and the end. The Epistles contain
          clear evidence that believers are gathered from every nation and tribe
          to Christ who is the Head of the Church, and in whom they are builded
          together for a habitation of God in the Spirit, that God may be all in
          all.
        </p>
        <h2>CLASSIFICATION</h2>
        <p>
          The New Testament contains in all twenty-one Epistles, which may be
          divided into two classes, viz., 1. The Pauline Epistles; and, 2. The
          General Epistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Pauline Epistles. Thirteen of the New Testament Epistles bear
          the name of the great apostle to the gentiles. Hence they are
          generally known as the Pauline Epistles. By some the Epistle to the
          Hebrews is added to this number, though it nowhere claims to have been
          written by Paul. The Church has always been divided on the question of
          it’s authorship, the Eastern church affirming and the Western denying
          that Paul wrote it. Clement of Alexandria states that the apostle
          composed it in the Hebrew language, and that Luke translated it into
          Greek. From a statement of his we may probably infer that his teacher,
          Pantaenus, also affirmed the Pauline authorship of this Epistle, which
          would carry the testimony back another generation. Origen admits that
          a very old tradition points to Paul as the author, but he comes to the
          conclusion that only God knows who wrote the book. Irenaeus does not
          attribute the Epistle to Paul; nor does Tertullian, who regards
          Barnabas as the author. Eusebius says: “Of Paul the fourteen Epistles
          commonly received are at once manifest and clear. It is not, however,
          right to ignore the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the
          Hebrews, asserting that it is gainsaid by the church of Rome as not
          being Paul’s.” He was inclined to believe that the apostle wrote it in
          Hebrew and that Luke, or more likely, Clement of Rome translated it.
          The catalogue of the council of Laodicea also speaks of fourteen
          Epistles of Paul. We shall leave the question of the authorship of
          this Epistle in suspense for the present, and classify the fourteen
          Epistles of which we have now spoken, as follows:
        </p>
        <p>I. Pauline Epistles:</p>
        <p>
          1. Those written during the period of Pauls missionary activity:<br />
          a. The two Epistles to the Thessalonians;<br />
          b. The Epistle to the Galatians;<br />
          c. The two Epistles to the Corinthians;<br />
          d. The Epistle to the Romans.<br /><br />
          2. Those written during Pauls imprisonment:<br />
          a. The Epistle to the Ephesians;<br />
          b. The Epistle to the Colossians;<br />
          c. The Epistle to Philemon;<br />
          d. The Epistle to the Philippians.<br /><br />
          3. Those written after Pauls release from the Roman prison:<br />
          a. The two Epistles to Timothy;<br />
          b. The Epistle to Titus.<br /><br />
          II. Of uncertain Authorship:<br />
          The Epistle to the Hebrews.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may well be supposed that Paul who always remained in touch with
          the churches he founded wrote many more letters than we now possess of
          him. This is evident also from the Epistles themselves. 1Co_5:9 refers
          to a letter now lost, and it is possible that 2Co_7:8 does also,
          although this may refer to first Corinthians. Col_4:16 speaks of a
          letter out of (ix) Laodicea, of which we have no further knowledge.
          Although these letters were undoubtedly inspired as well as the ones
          we still possess, we may rest assured that no Epistle intended by God
          for the canon of Holy Scriptures was ever lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may further remark that Paul evidently wrote very little with his
          own hand; he generally employed an amanuensis in the composition of
          his Epistles and merely added with his own hand the salutation to his
          friends and the authenticating signature, cf. 2Th_3:17; Phm_1:19; and
          Gal_6:11, which is, however, of uncertain interpretation. Only in one
          letter do we find a definite designation of the amanuensis, viz., in
          Rom_16:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The General Epistles. This is a group of seven Epistles which in
          the old manuscripts usually follows immediately after the Acts of the
          Apostles and therefore precedes the Pauline Epistles, perhaps because
          they are the works of the older apostles and in general represent the
          Jewish type of Christianity. Their representation of the truth
          naturally differs from that of the Pauline Epistles, but is in perfect
          harmony with it. Among these general Epistles there are:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Those written to a community of Christians:<br />
          a. The Epistle of James;<br />
          b. The two Epistles of Peter;<br />
          c. The first Epistle of John;<br />
          d. The Epistle of Jude.<br /><br />
          2. Those written to a certain individual:<br />
          a. The second Epistle of John; (?)<br />
          b. The third Epistle of John.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these seven Epistles the first one of Peter and the first one of
          John were generally accepted as canonical from the beginning, while
          the other five were at first subject to doubt and only gradually found
          acceptance throughout the Church. Yet they were never regarded as
          spurious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why these Epistles should be called general or catholic, is more or
          less of an enigma. Various interpretations of the name have been
          given, but none of them is entirely satisfactory. Some hold that they
          were so called, because they contain the one catholic doctrine which
          was delivered to the churches by the apostles; but this is not a
          characteristic mark of these Epistles, since those of Paul contain the
          same doctrine. Others maintain that the adjective catholic was used by
          some of the church fathers in the sense of canonical, and was by them
          applied first to the first Epistle of Peter and the first of John to
          indicate their general acceptance, and afterwards to the entire group.
          But this explanation is unlikely, because (1) there is scant proof
          that the term catholic was ever equivalent to canonical; and (2) it is
          hard to see, if this really was the case, why the term should not have
          been applied to the Pauline Epistles as well, that were all accepted
          from the beginning. Still others think that they received this
          appellation, because they were not addressed to one person or church
          like the Epistles of Paul, but to large sections of the Church. We
          consider this to be the best explanation of the name, since it is most
          in harmony with the usual meaning of the term, and accounts best for
          the way in which it is used in patristic literature. Even so, however
          the name cannot be regarded as entirely correct, because on the one
          hand the second (?) and third Epistles of John are written to
          individuals, and on the other, the Epistle to the Ephesians is also an
          encyclical letter. These two Epistles of John were probably included
          in this group, because of their smallness and close relation to the
          first Epistle of John.
