        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>CONTENTS</h2>
        <p>The contents of the letter naturally falls into three parts:</p>
        <p>
          I. Introduction, 2Th_1:1-12. The apostle begins his letter with the
          regular blessing, 2Th_1:1-2. He thanks God for the increasing faith
          and patience of the Thessalonians, reminding them of the fact that in
          the day of Christ’s coming God will provide rest for his persecuted
          church and will punish her persecutors; and prays that God may fulfill
          his good pleasure in them to the glory of his Name, 2Th_1:3-12.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Instruction respecting the Parousia, 2Th_2:1-17. The church is
          warned against deception regarding the imminence of the great day of
          Christ and is informed that it will not come until the mystery of
          iniquity has resulted in the great apostasy, and the man of sin has
          been revealed whose coming is after the work of Satan, and who will
          utterly deceive men to their own destruction, 2Th_2:1-12. The
          Thessalonians need not fear the manifestation of Christ, since they
          were chosen and called to everlasting glory; and it is the apostles
          wish that the Lord may comfort their hearts and establish them in all
          good work, 2Th_2:13-17.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Practical Exhortations, 2Th_3:1-18. The writer requests the
          prayer of the church for himself that he may be delivered from
          unreasonable and wicked men, and exhorts her to do what he commanded,
          2Th_3:1-5. They should withdraw from those who are disorderly and do
          not work, because each one should labor for his daily bread and thus
          follow the example of the apostle, 2Th_3:6-12. Those who do not heed
          the apostolic word should be censured, 2Th_3:13-15. With a blessing
          and a salutation the apostle closes his letter, 2Th_3:16-18.
        </p>
        <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>
          1. The main characteristic of this letter is found in the apocalyptic
          passage, 2Th_2:1-12. In these verses, that contain the most essential
          part of the Epistle, Paul speaks as a prophet, revealing to his
          beloved church that the return of Christ will be preceded by a great
          final apostasy and by the revelation of the man of sin, the son of
          perdition who, as the instrument of Satan, will deceive men, so that
          they accept the lie and are condemned in the great day of Christ. II
          Thessalonians, no doubt, was written primarily for the sake of this
          instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Aside from this important doctrinal passage the Epistle has a
          personal and practical character. It contains expressions of gratitude
          for the faith and endurance of the persecuted church, words of
          encouragement for the afflicted, fatherly advice for the spiritual
          children of the apostle, and directions as to their proper behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The style of this letter, like that of I Thessalonians, is simple
          and direct, except in 2Th_2:1-12, where the tone is more elevated.
          This change is accounted for by the prophetic contents of that
          passage. The language clearly reveals the working of the vigorous mind
          of Paul, who in the expression of his thoughts was not limited to a
          few stock phrases. Besides the many expressions that are
          characteristically Pauline the Epistle contains several that are
          peculiar to it, and also a goodly number which it has in common only
          with I Thessalonians. Of the 26 ἅπαξ λεγόμενα in the letter 10 are not
          found in the rest of the New Testament, and 16 are used elsewhere in
          the New Testament but not in the writings of Paul.
        </p>
        <h2>AUTHORSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          The external testimony for the authenticity of this Epistle is just as
          strong as that for the genuineness of the first letter. Marcion has it
          in his canon, the Muratorian Fragment names it, and it is also found
          in the old Latin and Syriac Versions. From the time of Irenaeus it is
          regularly quoted as a letter of Paul, and Origen and Eusebius claim
          that it was universally received in their time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle itself claims to be the work of Paul, 2Th_1:1; and again
          in 2Th_3:17, where the apostle calls attention to the salutation as a
          mark of genuineness. The persons associated with the writer in the
          composition of this letter are the same as those mentioned in I
          Thessalonians. As in the majority of Paul’s letters the apostolic
          blessing is followed by a thanksgiving. The Epistle is very similar to
          I Thessalonians and contains some cross-references to it, as in the
          case of the parousia and of the idlers. It clearly reveals the
          character of the great apostle, and its style may confidently be
          termed Pauline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless the genuineness of the Epistle has been doubted far more
          than that of I Thessalonians. Schmidt was the first one to assail it
          in 1804; in this he was followed by Schrader, Mayerhof and De Wette,
          who afterwards changed his mind, however. The attack was renewed by
          Kern and Baur in whose school the rejection of the Epistle became
          general. Its authenticity is defended by Reuss, Sabatier, Hofmann,
          Weiss, Zahn, Julicher, Farrar, Godet, Baljon, Moffat e. a.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principal objections urged against the genuineness of this letter
          are the following: (1) The teaching of Paul regarding the parousia in
          2Th_2:1-12 is not consistent with what he wrote in 1Th_4:13-18;
          1Th_5:1-11. According to the first letter the day of Christ is
          imminent and will come suddenly and unexpectedly; the second
          emphasizes the fact that it is not close at hand and that several
          signs will precede it. (2) The eschatology of this passage 2Th_2:1-12
          is not Paul’s but clearly dates from a later time and was probably
          borrowed from the Revelation of John. Some identify the man of sin
          with Nero who, though reported dead, was supposed to be hiding in the
          East and was expected to return; and find the one still restraining
          the evil in Vespasian. Others hold that this passage clearly refers to
          the time of Trajan, when the mystery of iniquity was seen in the
          advancing tide of Gnosticism. (3) This letter is to a great extent but
          a repetition of I Thessalonians, and therefore looks more like the
          work of a forger than like a genuine production of Paul. Holtzmann
          says that, with the exception of 2Th_1:5-6; 2Th_1:9; 2Th_1:12;
          2Th_2:2-9; 2Th_2:11-12; 2Th_2:15; 2Th_3:2; 2Th_3:13-14; 2Th_3:17, the
          entire Epistle consists of a reproduction of parallel passages from
          the first letter. Einl. p. 214. (4) The Epistle contains a
          conspicuously large number of peculiar expressions that are not found
          in the rest of Paul’s writings, nor in the entire New Testament. Cf.
          lists in Frames Comm. pp. 28-34, in the Intern. Crit. Comm. (5) The
          salutation in 2Th_3:17 has a suspicious look. It seems like the
          attempt of a later writer to ward off objections and to attest the
          Pauline authorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the objections raised are not sufficient to discredit the
          authenticity of our Epistle. The contradictions in Paul’s teaching
          regarding the parousia of Christ, are more apparent than real. The
          signs that precede the great day will not detract from its suddenness
          any more than the signs of Noah’s time prevented the flood from taking
          his contemporaries by surprise. Moreover these two features, the
          suddenness of Christ’s appearance and the portentous facts that are
          the harbingers of his coming, always go hand in hand in the
          eschatological teachings of Scripture. Dan_11:1 to Dan_12:3;
          Mat_24:1-44; Luk_17:20-37. As to the immediacy of Christ’s coming we
          can at most say that the first Epistle intimates that the Lord might
          appear during that generation (though possibly it does not even imply
          that), but it certainly does not teach that Christ will presently
          come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eschatology of 2Th_2:1-17 has given rise to much discussion and
          speculation regarding the date and authorship of the Epistle, but
          recent investigations into the conditions of the early church have
          clearly brought out that the contents of this chapter in no way
          militate against the genuineness of the letter. Hence they who deny
          the Pauline authorship have ceased to place great reliance on it.
          There is nothing improbable in the supposition that Paul wrote the
          passage regarding the man of sin. We find similar representations as
          early as the time of Daniel (cf. Dan_11:1-45), in the pseudepigraphic
          literature of the Jews (cf. Schfirer, Geschichte des fiidischen Volkes
          II p. 621 f.), and in the eschatological discourses of the Lord. The
          words and expressions found in this chapter are very well susceptible
          of an interpretation that does not necessitate our dating the Epistle
          after the time of Paul. We cannot delay to review all the preterist
          and futurist expositions that have been given (for which cf. Alford,
          Prolegomena Section V), but can only indicate in a general way in what
          direction we must look for the interpretation of this difficult
          passage. In interpreting it we should continually bear in mind its
          prophetic import and its reference to something that is still future.
          No doubt, there were in history prefigurations of the great day of
          Christ in which this prophecy found a partial fulfilment, but the
          parousia of which Paul speaks in these verses is even now only a
          matter of faithful expectation. The history of the world is gradually
          leading up to it. Paul was witnessing some apostasy in his day, the
          μυστήριον της ἀνομίας was already working, but the great apostasy (ἡ
          ἀποστασία) could not come in his day, because there had been as yet
          but a very partial dissemination of the truth; and will not come until
          the days immediately preceding the second coming of Christ, when the
          mystery of godlessness will complete itself, and will finally be
          embodied in a single person, in the man of sin, the son of perdition,
          who will then develop into a power antagonistic to Christ
          (anti-christ, ὃ ἀντικείμενος), yea to every form of religion, the very
          incarnation of Satan. Cf. 2Th_2:9. This can only come to pass,
          however, after the restraining power is taken out of the way, a power
          that is at once impersonal (κατέχον) and personal (κατέχων), and which
          may refer first of all to the strict administration of justice in the
          Roman empire and to the emperor as the chief executive, but certainly
          has a wider signification and probably refers in general to “the
          fabric of human polity and those who rule that polity.” (Alford). For
          a more detailed exposition cf. especially, Alford, Prolegomena Section
          V; Zahn, Einleitung I p. 162 if.; Godet, Introduction p .171 if.; and
          Eadie, Essay on the Man of Sin in Comm. p. 329 if.
        </p>
        <p>
          We fail to see the force of the third argument, unless it is an
          established fact that Paul could not repeat himself to a certain
          degree, even in two Epistles written within the space of a few months,
          on a subject that engaged the mind of the apostle for some time, to
          the same church and therefore with a view to almost identical
          conditions. This argument looks strange especially in view of the
          following one, which urges the rejection of this letter, because it is
          so unlike the other Pauline writings. The points of difference between
          our letter and I Thessalonians are generally exaggerated, and the
          examples cited by Davidson to prove the dissimilarity are justly
          ridiculed by Salmon, who styles such criticism “childish criticism,
          that is to say, criticism such as might proceed from a child who
          insists that a story shall always be told to him in precisely the same
          way.” Introd. p. 398. The salutation in 2Th_3:17 does not point to a
          time later than that of Paul, since he too had reason to fear the evil
          influence of forged Epistles, 2Th_2:2. He merely states that, with a
          view to such deception, he would in the future authenticate all his
          letters by attaching an autographic salutation.
        </p>
        <h2>COMPOSITION</h2>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. Evidently some additional information
          regarding the state of affairs at Thessalonica had reached Paul, it
          may be through the bearers of the first Epistle, or by means of a
          communication from the elders of the church. It seems that some letter
          had been circulated among them, purporting to come from Paul, and that
          some false spirit was at work in the congregation. The persecution of
          the Thessalonians still continued and had probably increased in force,
          and in some way the impression had been created that the day of the
          Lord was at hand. This led on the one hand to feverish anxiety, and on
          the other, to idleness. Hence the apostle deemed it necessary to write
          a second letter to the Thessalonians.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the writer was to encourage the sorely pressed church;
          to calm the excitement by pointing out that the second advent of the
          Lord could not be expected immediately, since the mystery of
          lawlessness had to develop first and to issue in the man of sin; and
          to exhort the irregular ones to a quiet, industrious and orderly
          conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. Some writers, such as Grotius, Ewald, Vander Vies
          and Laurent advocated the theory that II Thessalonians was written
          before I Thessalonians, but the arguments adduced to support that
          position cannot bear the burden. Moreover 2Th_2:15 clearly refers to a
          former letter of the apostle. In all probability our Epistle was
          composed a few months after the first one, for on the one hand Silas
          and Timothy were still with the apostle, 2Th_1:1, which was not the
          case after he left Corinth, and they were still antagonized by the
          Jews so that most likely their case had not yet been brought before
          Gallio, Act_18:12-17; and on the other hand a change had come about
          both in the sentiment of the apostle, who speaks no more of his desire
          to visit the Thessalonians, and in the condition of the church to
          which he was writing, a change that would necessarily require some
          time. We should most likely date the letter about the middle of A. D.
          53.
        </p>
        <h2>CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <p>
          The early Church found no reason to doubt the canonicity of this
          letter. Little stress can be laid, it is true, on the supposed
          reference to its language in Ignatius, Barnabas, the Didache and
          Justin Martyr. It is quite evident, however, that Polycarp used the
          Epistle. Moreover it has a place in the canon of Marcion, is mentioned
          among the Pauline letters in the Muratorian Fragment, and is contained
          in the old Latin and Syriac Versions. Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria,
          Tertullian and others since their time, quote it by name. The great
          permanent value of this Epistle lies in the fact that it corrects
          false notions regarding the second advent of Christ, notions that led
          to indolence and disorderliness. We are taught in this Epistle that
          the great day of Christ will not come until the mystery of iniquity
          that is working in the world receives its full development, and brings
          forth the son of perdition who as the very incarnation of Satan will
          set himself against Christ and his Church. If the Church of God had
          always remembered this lesson, she would have been spared many an
          irregularity and disappointment. The letter also reminds us once more
          of the fact that the day of the Lord will be a day of terror to the
          wicked, but a day of deliverance and glory for the Church of Christ.
