    <div>
      <font
        >ON no portion of THE NEW TESTAMENT have so many COMMENTARIES been
        written as on THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS. We have indeed no separate
        Comment extant by any of the Fathers on this Epistle; though it has been
        explained, together with other parts of Scripture, by Origen in the
        third century; by Jerome<i>, </i>Chrysostom<i>, </i>and in part by
        Augustine, in the fourth; by Theodoret in the fifth; by &#338;cumenius
        in the tenth; and by Theophylact in the eleventh century. But since the
        Reformation, many separate Expositions have been published, beside a
        learned Introduction by Luther,<i> </i>and Notes or <i>Scholia</i> by
        Zuingle and Melancthon.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The first complete COMMENTARY, as it appears, was written by Bullinger;
        the second by Bucer, a Professor of Theology at Cambridge for a short
        time in the reign of Edward the Sixth; and the next in order of time was
        this Work by CALVIN, composed at Strasbourg in the year 1539. The fourth
        was by Peter Martyr; and this was translated into English in the year
        1568. Another was afterwards published by Rodolph Gualter, Minister at
        Zurich.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>Early in the next century the learned Pareus<i> </i></font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f1</font></sup
      ><font
        ><i> </i>delivered lectures on this Epistle, as Professor of Theology in
        the University of Heidelberg &#8212; a work of great learning and of
        great merits though written in a style too scholastic to suit the taste
        of the present day. His special object was to rebut the arguments and
        expose the sophistries of Popish writers, particularly those of
        Bellarmine, the acutest, the subtlest and the most learned of all the
        Jesuits of his own age, and perhaps of any in after ages. There is
        hardly a subject in any measure connected with the contents of this
        Epistle which Pareus does not discuss: at the end of every chapter a
        number of questions are stated and answered, especially such as refer to
        the disputes between Papists and Protestants. He also controverts the
        perversions of Socinianism.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The next work that requires particular notice is that of Turrettin, a
        Professor of Theology in the University of Geneva. It was published
        about the commencement of the last century; the author died in the year
        1737. The doctrine of Calvin had somewhat degenerated in his time,
        though the work on the whole takes the side of orthodoxy. It yet shows a
        leaning to those views, which commonly issue it sentiments subversive of
        the essentials of true Christianity.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The first Commentary published in this country, composed in English,
        was by Elnathan Parr, B.D., Rector of Palgrave in Suffolk. He was, as it
        appears the personal friend of Sir Nathaniel <i>Bacon</i>, an elder
        brother of Lord <i>Bacon</i>. He dedicated his work to Sir Nathaniel,
        and speaks of him a having been a hearer of what he published when
        delivered from the pulpit. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f2</font></sup
      ><font>
        His style is that of his age, and appear quaint now; but his thoughts
        are often very striking an truly excellent, and his sentiments are
        wholly in accordant with those of the Reformers.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Since that time until this century, no work of any not has appeared
        separately on this Epistle. But within the last thirty years several
        Commentaries have been published. Besides those of Flatt and Tholuck<i
        > </i>in Germany, three at least have appeared in this country, and
        three in America. The authors in America are Moses Stuart, M.A.,
        Professor of Sacred Literature at Andover in Massachusetts, the Rev
        Albert Barnes, and Charles Hodge, Professor of Biblical Literature at
        Princeton. Those in this country are the Rev F. Fry<i>,</i> Rector of
        Desford, Leicestershire, Robert Haldane<i> </i>Esq., and Dr Chalmers.
        The doctrine held by Calvin is essentially maintained in all these
        works, and in most of them in its fullest extent.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Of our American brethren, the most learned and the most versed in
        criticisms is Professor Stuart; the fullest and the minutest expositor
        is the Rev. A. Barnes; and the acutest and the most concise commentator
        is Professor Hodge. The two first seem, in some instances, like
        Turrettin, to deviate somewhat from what may be considered strict
        orthodoxy, at least in their mode of explaining some subjects: the last
        is liable to no charge of this kind.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Respecting our own countrymen, there is a more perfect unanimity,
        though they belonged to different Churches. The Lectures of the Rev. J.
        Fry are those of a strict Predestinarian, and yet replete with remarks,
        both experimental and practical. The layman, R. Haldane, Esq., has
        displayed very high qualifications as an expositor; he is strictly and
        even stiffly orthodox, and can brook no deviation from what he regards
        as the truth. Of Dr. Chalmers&#8217; Lectures, comprised in four
        volumes, 12mo, it is difficult to pronounce an opinion. They are the
        productions of a philosopher&#8217;s and one of the highest grade, who,
        at the same time, possessed the heart and the experience of an humble
        Christian. He expatiates over the whole field of truth with the eye of
        an eagle, and with the docility of a child, without ever overleaping the
        boundaries of revelation. He was evidently a man by himself, taller by
        his shoulders than most men, either in this or in any other age, having
        a mind as sound as at was vigorous, an imagination as sober as it was
        creative, and a capacity to illustrate and to amplify quite
        unequaled.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >All these works have their peculiar excellencies, adapted to different
        tastes and capacities, and no doubt they have their defects. The same
        must be said of Calvin<i>&#8217;s</i> work. But as a concise and lucid
        commentator he certainly excels. He is not so much an expounder of
        words, as of principles. He carries on an unbroken chain of reasoning
        throughout, in a brief and clear manner. Having well considered the main
        drift of a passage, he sets before us what it contains, by a brief
        statement or by a clear process of reasoning; and often by a single
        sentence he throws light on a whole passage: and though his mind
        possessed more vigour of intellect and sound good sense, than what is
        called imagination; yet there are some fine thoughts occasionally
        occurring, beautifully expressed, to which that faculty must have given
        birth. There is also a noble grandeur and dignity in his sentiments,
        rarely to be found in other writers.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Professor Stuart has justly characterized this Work by saying, that it
        contains &#8220;fundamental investigation of the logic and course of
        thought contained in the Epistle;&#8221; and that it embraces
        &#8220;very little verbal criticism. Many a difficulty is solved without
        any appearance of effort, or any show of learning. Calvin,&#8221; he
        adds, &#8220;is by far the most distinguished of all the Commentators of
        his times.&#8221;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It was mainly to supply the defect named above, the want of verbal
        criticism, that NOTES have been added in the present Edition. They are
        also designed to furnish the reader with such expositions as have been
        suggested by posterior critics and commentators. And as we are generally
        desirous of knowing the names of authors, they have been for the most
        part given. Much light is thrown on a passage by conveying the full
        meaning of the original. This has been done partly by giving such
        different versions as seemed most entitled to approbation, and partly by
        referring to other passages where such words occur: so that a common
        reader, unacquainted with the original, may, to a certain extent, have
        the advantage of one well versed in the Greek language.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Variety of meanings given to words, and also to passages, has been
        deemed by some to lessen the certainty of truth, but without any solid
        reason; for this variety as found in the works of all sound and
        judicious critics, seldom or <i>ever</i> affects any thing important,
        either in doctrine, experience, or practice, and tends often to expand
        the meaning and to render it clearer and more prominent. There has been
        in deed sometimes a pruriency in this respect, an unholy ambition for
        novelty, a desire for new discoveries, an indulgence of mere curiosity,
        which have been very injurious. Much of this sort of mania prevailed
        among some of the German divines in the last century, as Wolfius clearly
        shows in his works, in which he notices and disproves many vagaries
        assuming the name of critical expositions; and much of a similar kind of
        spirit seems to prevail still in that country. It is a mania for
        criticism, for its own sake, without any concern or solicitude for the
        truth: and ingenious criticism has often been resorted to by the
        oppugners of vital Christianity as means for supporting heterodoxical
        sentiments. But there is a palpable difference between men of this
        character, the mere gladiators of criticism, and those who embrace the
        truth, and whose object it is faithfully to explain it in consistency
        with the general tenor of what is revealed, and who have what is
        indispensably necessary for such a work, a spiritual experience, which
        often affords better assistance than any critical acumen that can ever
        be possessed. The man who has seen a thing has a much better idea of it
        than the man who has only heard it described.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Attempts have been made by various authors to show and prove, that the
        STYLE OF THE EPISTLES, especially those of PAUL, is consonant with that
        of classical writers. Blackwall laboured much to do this in this
        country, as well as many German divines, particularly in the last
        century. In common with some of the Fathers, they thought to recommend
        in this way the Apostolic Writings to the attention of literary men. But
        it was a labour not wisely undertaken, as it must have necessarily
        proved abortive: for though some phrases may be classical, yet the
        general style is what might have been naturally expected from the
        writers, brought up, as they had all been, in the Jewish religion, and
        accustomed, as they had been, to the writings of the Old Testament.
        Hence their style throughout is Hebraistic; and the meaning of many of
        the Greek words which they use is not to be sought from the Classics,
        but from the Greek Translation of the ancient Scriptures, and sometimes
        from the Hebrew itself, of which that is a translation. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f3</font></sup
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Much evil and no good must result from a claim that cannot be
        supported: nor is it at all necessary to make such a claim. It has been
        long ago repudiated, and repudiated by Paul himself. Writers have often
        ascribed to Paul what he himself distinctly and entirely disclaimed, and
        never <i>attempted</i> to attain or to practice, and that on principle,
        &#8220;Lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.&#8221; It
        was not by &#8220;excellency of speech&#8221; that he courted the
        attention of the classical and refined Grecians, that he recommended the
        gospel to them; it was not by the tinsel of mere eloquence that he
        succeeded in his preaching, nor by the elegance and beauty of his
        diction; but by something much higher, much greater, much more powerful
        and efficient. We ought to follow his example, and stand on his high
        ground, and not to descend to that which is no better than a quagmire.
        It is a happy thing, and no doubt so designed by God, that the shell
        should not be made of fine materials, lest men&#8217;s minds should be
        attracted by it and neglect the kernel. God might, if he chose, have
        easily endued his Apostles with eloquence more than human, and enabled
        them to write with elegance more than Grecian; but He did not do so, and
        Paul expressly gives us the reason, &#8220;that our faith should not
        stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.&#8221;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It is generally agreed, that the EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS was written at
        CORINTH, and about the end of the year 57, or at the beginning of the
        year 58, and that it is the <i>fifth</i> Epistle in order of time; the
        two Epistles to the <b><i>Thessalonians</i></b
        >, the Epistle to the <b><i>Galatians</i></b
        >, and the first to the <b><i>Corinthians</i></b
        >, having been previously written. Then followed the second Epistle to
        the <b><i>Corinthians</i></b

        >The common date assigned to Paul&#8217;s conversion is AD 35. He wrote
        his first Epistle, that is, the first to the <b><i>Thessalonians</i></b
        >, in 52, seventeen years after his conversion. His second Epistle to
        <b><i>Timothy</i></b
        >, his last, was written from Rome in 65. So that he wrote his fourteen
        Epistles during these thirteen years. The whole extent of his ministry
        seems to have been about thirty years; for it is not supposed that he
        long outlived the date of his second Epistle to Timothy. Tradition says,
        that he was beheaded at Rome, June 29; AD 66.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Paul&#8217;s first coming to ROME was in the spring of the year 61. He
        continued there as a prisoner for two years. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f4</font></sup
      ><font>
        When he was released, most writers are of the opinion, that he returned
        early in 63 to Judea, in company with Timothy, and left Titus at Crete;
        that he visited the Churches in Asia Minor, then the Churches in
        Macedonia; that he wintered at Nicopolis, a city of Epirus, in 64; that
        afterwards he proceeded to Crete and also to Corinth; and that early in
        65 he again visited Rome, was taken prisoner, and beheaded in the
        following year. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f5</font></sup
      ><font>
        This account clearly shows that he did not accomplish his purpose of
        visiting Spain, as tradition has recorded.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The first introduction of the Gospel into Rome is involved in
        uncertainty. The probability is, that some of the &#8220;strangers of
        Rome,&#8221; present at the day of Pentecost, were converted, and at
        their return promoted the spread of the Gospel. Paul mentions two,
        &#8220;Andronicus and Junia,&#8221; as having professed the faith before
        him, and as having been noted among the Apostles. He makes mention, too,
        of another eminent Christian, &#8220;Rufus&#8221; whose father, as it is
        supposed carried our Savior&#8217;s cross, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;411521&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Mark 15:21. It is not improbable, that these were afterwards assisted
        by such as had been converted under the ministry of Paul; for he speaks
        of some of those whom he salutes at Rome as being &#8220;beloved,&#8221;
        and as having been his &#8220;fellow-workers.&#8217;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >What some of the Fathers have related was in the first instance a
        tradition, as there was nothing recorded on the subject before the
        latter part of the second century, except what has been ascribed to
        Dionysius of Corinth, preserved by Eusebius.<i> </i>Iren&#339;us and
        Tertullian were the first retailers of the tradition, that Peter, in
        conjunction with Paul, was the founder of the Church at Rome. This
        tradition increased considerably by the time of Jerome, who, in the
        fourth century, says, that Peter had been bishop of Rome for twenty-five
        years! But this account is so clearly inconsistent with what we learn
        from the Acts of the Apostles respecting Peter, that some of the most
        reasonable of the Papists themselves have given it up as unworthy of
        credit. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f6</font></sup
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It appears next to a certainty that Peter was not at Rome when Paul
        wrote his Epistle in 57 or 58, for he sends no salutation to Peter:
        &#8212; And also that he had not been there previous to that time; for
        it is wholly unreasonable to suppose, that, had he been there, Paul
        would have made no reference to his labours. It further amounts almost
        to a certainty, that Peter was not at Rome when Paul was for two years a
        prisoner there, from 61 to 63; for he makes no mention of him in any
        way, not even in the four or five Epistles which he wrote during that
        time: And that Peter was not at Rome during Paul&#8217;s last
        imprisonment in 65 and 66, is evident from the second Epistle to
        Timothy; for he makes no mention of Peter, and what he says of
        Christians there, that they &#8220;all forsook him,&#8221; would have
        been highly discreditable to Peter, if he was there. So that we have the
        strongest reasons to conclude, that Peter had no part in forming and
        establishing a Church in Rome during Paul&#8217;s life, whatever share
        in the work he might have had afterwards. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f7</font></sup
      ><font>
        But the first tradition, or the first account, given by Iren&#339;us and
        Tertullian, refers only to a co-operation: and yet this co-operation is
        wholly inconsistent with what has been stated, the force of which no
        reasonable man can resist.</font

        >The learned Pareus proceeds in a different way to prove that Peter was
        never at Rome. He shows from different parts of the Acts of the Apostles
        and the Epistle to the Galatians, that Peter was in Judea at the time
        when tradition declares that he was at Rome. Peter was in Judea when
        Paul was converted, Acts 9; and <i>three</i> years after this &#8212;
        that is, in the year 38, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480108&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 1:8. He was in Judea in the year 45, when he was imprisoned
        by Herod, Acts 12, and in 49, fourteen years after Paul&#8217;s
        conversion, Acts 15, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480201&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 2:1-9. Had he been to Rome during this time, some account of
        such a journey must surely have been given. After this time we find that
        he was at Antioch, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480211&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 2:11. If it be asked, where did he afterwards exercise his
        ministry? Where more likely than among the Jews, as he had hitherto most
        clearly done; for he was the Apostle of the Circumcision, and among
        those to whom he sent his Epistles. The dating of the first at
        &#8220;Babylon,&#8221; has led some to conjecture that it was a
        figurative term for Rome; but why not for Jerusalem, or for Antioch? for
        Christians were at that time treated everywhere like captives or aliens,
        and especially in the land of Judea.</font

        >What then are we to say as to this tradition? The same, according to
        the just remark of Pareus, as what we must say of many other traditions
        of that age, that it is nothing but a fable, which, like many others,
        would have passed away, had it not been allied to a growing
        superstition. With respect to what Eusebius says of the testimony of a
        presbyter, named Caius, that about the beginning of the third century he
        saw the graves of Peter and Paul at Rome, it may be easily accounted
        for: it was the age of pious fraud, when the relics of saints could be
        found almost everywhere; and, in the next century, the wood and the
        nails of the Cross were discovered! Those who can believe these things,
        may have a credulity large enough to swallow up the testimony of Caius. </font

        >The most probable account, then, of the commencement of a Christian
        Church at Rome, is what has been already stated. The condition of that
        Church, when Paul wrote to it, we may in a great measure learn from the
        Epistle itself. It had a high character, viewed in a general way; but
        there were some defects and blemishes. Its faith had been widely
        reported: there were at the same time some contentions and divisions
        among its members, arising especially from the prejudices of the Jewish
        believers. To remove the causes of this dissension, was evidently one of
        the main objects of Paul in this Epistle.</font

        brief summary &#8212; &#8220;The Jews and Gentiles are equally guilty;
        they are equally justified freely by faith in Christ, without works;
        they are equally bound to lead a holy life, to be humble, and to love
        one another.&#8221; Stuart says, that the whole of what the Epistle
        contains may be expressed in a single brief sentence &#8212;
        &#8220;Christ our justification and sanctification.&#8221;</font

        &#8212; <i>doctrinal</i>, 1-8.; <i>answers</i> to objections, 9-11.; and

        embracing chapters 9, 10, 11, treats of The Calling of the Gentiles, The

      <font
        >We have set before us in this Epistle especially two things, which it
        behoves us all rightly to understand &#8212; the righteousness of man
        and the righteousness of God &#8212; merit and grace, or salvation by
        works and salvation by faith. The light in which they are exhibited here
        is clearer and brighter than what we find in any other portion of
        Scripture, with the exception, perhaps, of the Epistle to the Galatians.
        Hence the great value which has in every age been attached to this
        Epistle by all really enlightened Christians; and hence also the
        strenuous efforts which have often been made to darken and wrest its
        meaning by men, though acute and learned, yet destitute of spiritual
        light. But let not the simple Christian conclude from the contrariety
        that is often found in the expositions on these two points, that there
        is no certainty in what is taught respecting them. There are no contrary
        views given of them by spiritually-minded men. Though on other subjects
        discussed here, such men have had their differences, yet on these they
        have ever been found unanimous: that salvation is from first to last by
        grace, and not by works, has ever been the conviction of really
        enlightened men in every age, however their opinion may have varied in
        other respects.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It may seem very strange, when we consider the plain and decisive
        language, especially of this Epistle, and the clear and conclusive
        reasoning which it exhibits, that any attempt should ever be made by a
        reasonable being, acknowledging the authority of Scripture, to pervert
        what it plainly teaches, and to evade what it clearly proves. But a
        right view of what human nature is, when unrenewed, as exhibited in
        God&#8217;s Word, and as proved by history and made evident by
        observation, enables us fully to account for what would otherwise remain
        an enigma. No truth is more fully confirmed by facts (and it ought ever
        to be remembered) than that &#8220;the natural man receiveth not the
        things of the Spirit of God,&#8221; and that he &#8220;cannot know them,
        because they are spiritually discerned.&#8221; This declaration clearly
        accounts for the fact, that men of great learning have often
        misunderstood many things in Scripture, and such things as are plain
        enough even to the unlettered when spiritually enlightened. The learned
        Scribes and Rabbins were blind leaders of the blind, when even babes
        understood the mysteries of the kingdom of God: and no better then the
        Scribes are many learned men, professing Christianity, in our day.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >There is indeed a special reason why, on these points, unenlightened
        men should contrive means to evade the obvious meaning of Scripture; for
        they are such things as come in constant contact with a principle, the
        strongest that belongs to human nature in its fallen state. Other
        doctrines may be held as speculations, and kept, as it were, at a
        distance; but when we come to merit and grace, to work and faith,
        man&#8217;s pride is touched; and as long as under he is its prevailing
        influence, he will be certain, in some way or another, direct or
        evasive, to support merit in opposition to grace, or works in opposition
        to faith. When the authority of tradition supplanted the authority of
        Scripture, the doctrine of merit so prevailed, that the preposterous
        idea, that merits were a salable and a transferable commodity, gained
        ground in the world. A notion of this kind is too gross and absurd to be
        entertained by any who acknowledge God&#8217;s Word as the only umpire
        in religion; and yet what is not essentially different has often been
        maintained; for to say that salvation is partly by faith and partly by
        works, is really the same thing, inasmuch as the principle of merit is
        thereby admitted. Man naturally cleaves to his own righteousness; all
        those who are ignorant are self-righteous, and all the learned who
        understand not the gospel; and it is wonderful what ingenious evasions
        and learned subtleties men will have recourse to in order to resist the
        plain testimony of Scripture. When they cannot maintain their ground as
        advocates of salvation alone by merits, they will attempt to maintain it
        as advocates of a system, which allows a part to grace and a part to
        works &#8212; an amalgamation which Paul expressly repudiates, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451106&gt;</font></sup
      ><font>Romans 11:6.</font><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But it is remarkable how the innate disposition of man has displayed
        itself in this respect. Conscious, as it were, in some measure of
        <i>moral</i> imperfections, he has been striving for the most part to
        merit his salvation by <i>ceremonial</i> works. This has been the case
        in all ages with heathens: their scarifies, austerities, and mechanical
        devotions were their merits; they were the works by which they expected
        to obtain happiness. God favored the people of Israel with the rituals
        of religion, which were designed merely as aids and means to attain and
        preserve true religion; but they converted them to another purpose, and,
        like the heathens, regarded them as meritorious performances, and
        expected God&#8217;s acceptance for the very religious acts which they
        exercised: and in order to make up, as it were, a sufficient quantity of
        merit, they made additions to those services which God had appointed, as
        though to multiply acts of this kind was to render their salvation more
        certain. The very same evil crept early into the Christian Church, and
        still continues to exist. The accumulation of ceremonies is of itself a
        sufficient proof, that salvation by faith was in a great measure lost
        sight of: we want no other evidence; it is what has been ever done
        whenever the light of truth has become dim and obscure. We see the same
        evil in the present day. Outward privileges and outward acts of worship
        are in effect too often substituted for that grace which changes the
        heart, and for that living faith which unites us to the Savior, which
        works by love and overcomes the world. The very disposition to
        over-value external privileges and the mere performances of religious
        duties, is an unequivocal evidence, that salvation by faith is not
        understood, or very imperfectly understood, and not really
        embraced.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The only remedy, as means for this evil, is that which we find employed
        by Paul in this Epistle. He begins by showing what every man, Jew and
        Gentile, is by nature; he proves by the clearest evidence, that all have
        sinned and become guilty before God. And having done this, he discloses
        the way of salvation which God himself has planned and revealed; and he
        teaches us, that it is altogether by grace and through faith that we can
        be saved, and not by works. In order cordially to embrace this latter
        truth, it is necessary to know the first, that we are sinners under
        condemnation. It is impossible, according to the very constitution of
        man&#8217;s mind, that he should really and truly accede to the one,
        without a real and deep knowledge of the other. The whole need not a
        physician, but the sick. It is only he who is really convinced of sin
        and who feels its guilt and its burden intolerable, that ever will, or
        indeed ever can, really lay hold on that free salvation which God has
        provided. And when this free salvation is really known, all other things
        compared with it will be deemed as nothing; and then all outward
        privileges will be viewed only as means, and all outward acts of
        religion only as aids and helps; and then also all our works, however
        great and self-denying, will be regarded in no way meritorious, but
        imperfect and defective, and acceptable only through the merits of our
        High Priest at God&#8217;s right hand.</font

        >I REMEMBER that when three years ago we had a friendly converse as to
        the best mode of expounding Scripture, the plan which especially pleased
        you, seemed also to me the most entitled to approbation: we both thought
        that the chief excellency of an expounder consists in
        <i>lucid brevity</i>. And, indeed, since it is almost his only work to
        lay open the mind of the writer whom he undertakes to explain, the
        degree in which he leads away his readers from it, in that degree he
        goes astray from his purpose, and in a manner wanders from his own
        boundaries. Hence we expressed a hope, that from the number of those who
        strive at this day to advance the interest of theology by this kind of
        labour, some one would be found, who would study plainness, and
        endeavour to avoid the evil of tiring his readers with prolixity. I know
        at the same time that this view is not taken by all, and that those who
        judge otherwise have their reasons; but still I cannot be drawn away
        from the love of what is compendious. But as there is such a variety,
        found in the minds of men, that different things please different
        persons, let every one in this case follow his own judgment, provided
        that no one attempts to force others to adopt his own rules. Thus it
        will be, that we who approve of brevity, will not reject nor despise the
        labours of those who are more copious and diffused in their explanations
        of Scripture, and that they also in their turn will bear with us, though
        they may think us too compressed and concise.</font

        did I hope to attain it when I began; but I have endeavoured so to
        regulate my style, that I might appear to aim at that model. How far I
        have succeeded, as it is not my part to determine, I leave to be decided

        produce any thing better. And I confess, that though I promised to
        myself some fruit from my labour, I was at first deterred by this
        thought; for I feared, lest I should incur the imputation of presumption
        by applying my hand to a work which had been executed by so many
        illustrious workmen. There are extant on this Epistle many Commentaries
        by the ancients, and many by modern writers: and truly they could have
        never employed their labours in a better way; for when any one

        >Philip Melancthon, who, by his singular learning and industry, and by
        that readiness in all kinds of knowledge, in which he excels, has
        introduced more light than those who had preceded him. But as it seems
        to have been his object to examine only those things which are mainly
        worthy of attention, he dwelt at large on these, and designedly passed
        by many things which common minds find to be difficult. Then follows
        Bullinger, who has justly attained no small praise; for with learning he
        has connected plainness, for which he has been highly commended. In the
        last place comes Bucer, who, by publishing his works, has given as it
        were the finishing stroke. For in addition to his recondite learning and
        enlarged knowledge of things, and to the clearness of his mind, and much
        reading and many other excellencies, in which he is hardly surpassed by
        any at this day, equaled by few and excelled by still fewer &#8212; he
        possesses, as you know, this praise as his own &#8212; that no one in

        praise. Let that favor and authority, which according to the confession

        I trust, will be allowed &#8212; that nothing has been done by men so
        absolutely perfect, that there is no room left for the industry of those
        who succeed them, either to polish, or to adorn, or to illustrate. Of
        myself I venture not to say any thing, except that I thought that my
        labour would not be useless, and that I have undertaken it for no other
        reason than to promote the public good of the Church.</font

      <font
        >I farther hoped, that by adopting a different plan, I should not expose
        myself to the invidious charge of rivalry, of which I was afraid in the
        first instance. <i>Philipp</i> attained his object by illustrating the
        principal points: being occupied with these primary things, he passed by
        many things which deserve attention; and it was not his purpose to
        prevent others to examine them. Bucer is too diffuse for men in business
        to read, and too profound to be understood by such as are simple and not
        capable of much application: for whatever be the subject which he
        handles, so many things are suggested to him through the incredible
        fecundity of his mind, in which he excels, that he knows not when to
        stop. Since then the first has not explained every passage, and the
        other has handled every point more at large than it can be read in a
        short time, my design has not even the appearance of being an act of
        rivalship. I, however, hesitated for some time, whether it would be
        better to gather some gleanings after these and others, by which I might
        assist humbler minds &#8212; or to compose a regular comment, in which I
        should necessarily have to repeat many things which have been previously
        said by them all, or at least by some of them. But as they often vary
        from one another, and thus present a difficulty to simple readers, who
        hesitate as to what opinion they ought to receive, I thought that it
        would be no vain labour, if by pointing out the best explanation, I
        relieved them from the trouble of forming a judgment, who are not able
        to form a judgment for themselves; and especially as I determined to
        treat things so briefly, that without much loss of time, readers may
        peruse in my work what is contained in other writings. In short, I have
        endeavoured that no one may justly complain, that there are here many
        things which are superfluous.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Of the usefulness of this work I will say nothing; men not malignant,
        will, however, it may be, have reasons to confess, that they have
        derived from it more benefit than I can with any modesty dare to
        promise. Now, that I some times dissent from others, or somewhat differ
        from them, it is but right that I should be excused. Such veneration we
        ought indeed to entertain for the Word of God, that we ought not to
        pervert it in the least degree by varying expositions; for its majesty
        is diminished, I know not how much, especially when not expounded with
        great discretion and with great sobriety. And if it be deemed a great
        wickedness to contaminate any thing that is dedicated to God, he surely
        cannot be endured, who, with impure, or even with unprepared hands, will
        handle that very thing, which of all things is the most sacred on earth.
        It is therefore an audacity, closely allied to a sacrilege, rashly to
        turn Scripture in any way we please, and to indulge our fancies as in
        sport; which has been done-by many in former times.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But we ever find, that even those who have not been deficient in their
        zeal for piety, nor in reverence and sobriety in handling the mysteries
        of God, have by no means agreed among themselves on every point; for God
        hath never favored his servants with so great a benefit, that they were
        all endued with a full and perfect knowledge in every thing; and, no
        doubt, for this end &#8212; that he might first keep them humble; and
        secondly, render them disposed to cultivate brotherly intercourse. Since
        then what would otherwise be very desirable cannot be expected in this
        life, that is, universal consent among us in the interpretation of all
        parts of Scripture, we must endeavour, that, when we depart from the
        sentiments of our predecessors, we may not be stimulated by any humour
        for novelty, nor impelled by any lust or defaming others, nor instigated
        by hatred, nor tickled by any ambition, but constrained by necessity
        alone, and by the motive of seeking to do good: and then, when this is
        done in interpreting Scripture, less liberty will be taken in the
        principles of religion, in which God would have the minds of his people
        to be especially unanimous. Readers will easily perceive that I had both
        these things in view.</font

      <font
        >WITH regard to the excellency of this Epistle, I know not whether it
        would be well for me to dwell long on the subject; for I fear, lest
        through my recommendations falling far short of what they ought to be, I
        should do nothing but obscure its merits: besides, the Epistle itself,
        at its very beginning, explains itself in a much better way than can be
        done by any words which I can use. It will then be better for me to pass
        on to the Argument, or the contents of the Epistle; and it will hence
        appear beyond all controversy, that besides other excellencies, and
        those remarkable, this can with truth be said of it, and it is what can
        never be sufficiently appreciated &#8212; that when any one gains a
        knowledge of this Epistle, he has an entrance opened to him to all the
        most hidden treasures of Scripture.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The whole Epistle is so methodical, that even its very beginning is
        framed according to the rules of art. As contrivance appears in many
        parts, which shall be noticed as we proceed, so also especially in the
        way in which the main argument is deduced: for having begun with the
        proof of his Apostleship, he then comes to the Gospel with the view of
        recommending it; and as this necessarily draws with it the subject of
        faith, he glides into that, being led by the chain of words as by the
        hand: and thus he enters on the main subject of the whole Epistle
        justification by faith; in treating which he is engaged to the end of
        the fifth chapter.</font

        with a false notion about righteousness, so that they think not that
        they need the righteousness of faith, except they be cast down from all
        self-confidence, &#8212; and further, as they are inebriated with the
        sweetness of lusts, and sunk in deep self-security, so that they are
        not-easily roused to seek righteousness, except they are struck down by
        the terror of divine judgment, &#8212; the Apostle proceeds to do two
        things &#8212; to convince men of iniquity, and to shake off the torpor
        of those whom he proves guilty.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >He <i>first</i> condemns all mankind from the beginning of the world
        for ingratitude, because they recognized not the workman in his
        extraordinary work: nay, when they were constrained to acknowledge him,
        they did not duly honor his majesty, but in their vanity profaned and
        dishonored it. Thus all became guilty of impiety, a wickedness more
        detestable than any thing else. And that he might more clearly show that
        all had departed from the Lord, he recounts the filthy and horrible
        crimes of which men everywhere became guilty: and this is a manifest
        proof, that they had degenerated from God, since these sins are
        evidences of divine wrath, which appear not except in the ungodly. And
        as the Jews and some of the Gentiles, while they covered their inward
        depravity by the veil of outward holiness, seemed to be in no way
        chargeable with such crimes, and hence thought themselves exempt from
        the common sentence of condemnation, the Apostle directs his discourse
        against this fictitious holiness; and as this mask before men cannot be
        taken away from saintlings, (sanctulis &#8212; petty saints,) he summons
        them to the tribunal of God, whose eyes no latent evils can escape.
        Having afterwards divided his subject, he places apart both the Jews and
        the Gentiles before the tribunal of God. He cuts off from the Gentiles
        the excuse which they pleaded from ignorance, because conscience was to
        them a law, and by this they were abundantly convicted as guilty. He
        chiefly urges on the Jews that from which they took their defense, even
        the written law; and as they were proved to have transgressed it, they
        could not free themselves from the charge of iniquity, and a sentence
        against them had already been pronounced by the mouth of God himself. He
        at the same time obviates any objection which might have been made by
        them &#8212; that the covenant of God, which was the symbol of holiness,
        would have been violated, if they were not to be distinguished from
        others. Here he first shows, that they excelled not others by the right
        of the covenant, for they had by their unfaithfulness departed from it:
        and then, that he might not derogate from the perpetuity of the divine
        promise, he concedes to them some privilege as arising from the
        covenant; but it proceeded from the mercy of God, and not from their
        merits. So that with regard to their own qualifications they were on a
        level with the Gentiles. He then proves by the authority of Scripture,
        that both Jews and Gentiles were all sinners; and he also slightly
        refers to the use of the law.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Having wholly deprived all mankind of their confidence in their own
        virtue and of their boast of righteousness, and laid them prostrate by
        the severity of God&#8217;s judgment, he returns to what he had before
        laid down as his subject &#8212; that we are justified by faith; and he
        explains what faith is, and how the righteousness of Christ is by it
        attained by us. To these things he adds at the end of the
        <i>third</i> chapter a remarkable conclusion, with the view of beating
        down the fierceness of human pride, that it might not dare to raise up
        itself against the grace of God: and lest the Jews should confine so
        great a favor of God to their own nation, he also by the way claims it
        in behalf of the Gentiles.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >In the <i>fourth</i> chapter he reasons from example; which he adduces
        as being evident, and hence not liable to be cavilled at; and it is that
        of Abraham, who, being the father of the faithful ought to be deemed a
        pattern and a kind of universal example. Having then proved that he was
        justified by faith, the Apostle teaches us that we ought to maintain no
        other way of justification. And here he shows, that it follows from the
        rule of contraries, that the righteousness of works ceases to exist,
        since the righteousness of faith is introduced. And he confirms this by
        the declaration of David, who, by making the blessedness of man to
        depend on the mercy of God, takes it away from works, as they are
        incapable of making a man blessed. He then treats more fully what he had
        before shortly referred to &#8212; that the Jews had no reason to raise
        themselves above the Gentiles, as this felicity is equally common to
        them both, since Scripture declares that Abraham obtained this
        righteousness in an uncircumcised state: and here he takes the
        opportunity of adding some remarks on the use of circumcision. He
        afterwards subjoins, that the promise of salvation depends on
        God&#8217;s goodness alone: for were it to depend on the law, it could
        not bring peace to consciences, which it ought to confirm, nor could it
        attain its own fulfillment. Hence, that it may be sure and certain, we
        must, in embracing it, regard the truth of God alone, and not ourselves,
        and follow the example of Abraham, who, turning away from himself, had
        regard only to the power of God. At the end of the chapter, in order to
        make a more general application of the adduced example, he introduces
        several comparisons.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >In the <i>fifth</i> chapter, after having touched on the fruit and
        effects of the righteousness of faith, he is almost wholly taken up with
        illustrations, in order to make the point clearer. For, deducing an
        argument from one greater, he shows how much we, who have been redeemed
        and reconciled to God, ought to expect from his love; which was so
        abundantly poured forth towards us, when we were sinners and lost, that
        he gave for us his only-begotten and beloved Son. He afterwards makes
        comparisons between sin and free righteousness, between Christ and Adam,
        between death and life, between the law and grace: it hence appears that
        our evils, however vast they are, are swallowed up by the infinite mercy
        of God.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >He proceeds in the <i>sixth</i> chapter to mention the sanctification
        which we obtain in Christ. It is indeed natural to our flesh, as soon as
        it has had some slight knowledge of grace, to indulge quietly in its own
        vices and lusts, as though it had become free from all danger: but Paul,
        on the contrary, contends here, that we cannot partake of the
        righteousness of Christ, except we also lay hold on sanctification. He
        reasons from baptism, by which we are initiated into a participation of
        Christ, (<i>per quem in Christi participationem initiamur;</i>) and in
        it we are buried together with Christ, so that being dead in ourselves,
        we may through his life be raised to a newness of life. It then follows,
        that without regeneration no one can put on his righteousness. He hence
        deduces exhortations as to purity and holiness of life, which must
        necessarily appear in those who have been removed from the kingdom of
        sin to the kingdom of righteousness, the sinful indulgence of the flesh,
        which seeks in Christ a greater liberty in sinning, being cast aside. He
        makes also a brief mention of the law as being abrogated; and in the
        abrogation of this the New Testament shines forth eminently; for
        together with the remission of sins, it contains the promise of the Holy
        Spirit.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >In the <i>seventh</i> chapter he enters on a full discussion on the use
        of the law, which he had pointed out before as it were by the finger,
        while he had another subject in hand: he assigns a reason why we are
        loosed from the law, and that is, because it serves only for
        condemnation. Lest, however, he should expose the law to reproach, he
        clears it in the strongest terms from any imputation of this kind; for
        he shows that through our fault it is that the law, which was given for
        life, turns to be an occasion of death. He also explains how sin is by
        it increased. He then proceeds to describe the contest between the
        Spirit and the flesh, which the children of God find in themselves, as
        long as they are surrounded by the prison of a mortal body; for they
        carry with them the relics of lust, by which they are continually
        prevented from yielding full obedience to the law.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The <i>eighth</i> chapter contains abundance of consolations, in order
        that the consciences of the faithful, having heard of the disobedience
        which he had before proved, or rather imperfect obedience, might not be
        terrified and dejected. But that the ungodly might not hence flatter
        themselves, he first testifies that this privilege belongs to none but
        to the regenerated, in whom the Spirit of God lives and prevails. He
        unfolds then two things &#8212; that all who are planted by the Spirit
        in the Lord Jesus Christ, are beyond the danger or the chance of
        condemnation, however burdened they may yet be with sins; and, also,
        that all who remain in the flesh, being without the sanctification of
        the Spirit, are by no means partakers of this great benefit. He
        afterwards explains how great is the certainty of our confidence, since
        the Spirit of God by his own testimony drives away all doubts and fears.
        He further shows, for the purpose of anticipating objections, that the
        certainty of eternal life cannot be intercepted or disturbed by present
        evils, to which we are subject in this life; but that, on the contrary,
        our salvation is promoted by such trials, and that the value of it, when
        compared with our present miseries, renders them as nothing. He confirms
        this by the example of Christ, who, being the first-begotten and holding
        the highest station in the family of God, is the pattern to which we
        must all be conformed. And, in the last place, as though all things were
        made secure, he concludes in a most exulting strain, and boldly triumphs
        over all the power and artifices of Satan.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But as most were much concerned on seeing the Jews, the first guardians
        and heirs of the covenant, rejecting Christ, for they hence concluded,
        that either the covenant was transferred from the posterity of Abraham,
        who disregarded the fulfilling of the covenant, or that he, who made no
        better provision for the people of Israel, was not the promised Redeemer
        &#8212; he meets this objection at the beginning of the
        <i>ninth </i>chapter. Having then spoken of his love towards his own
        nation, that he might not appear to speak from hatred, and having also
        duly mentioned those privileges by which they excelled others, he gently
        glides to the point he had in view, that is, to remove the offence,
        which arose from their own blindness. And he divides the children of
        Abraham into two classes, that he might show that not all who descended
        from him according to the flesh, are to be counted for seed and become
        partakers of the grace of the covenant; but that, on the contrary,
        aliens become his children, when they possess his faith. He brings
        forward Jacob and Esau as examples. He then refers us back here to the
        election of God, on which the whole matter necessarily depends. Besides,
        as election rests on the mercy of God alone, it is in vain to seek the
        cause of it in the worthiness of man. There is, on the other hand,
        rejection (<i>rejectio</i>), the justice of which is indubitable, and
        yet there is no higher cause for it than the will of God. Near the end
        of the chapter, he sets forth the calling of the Gentiles and the
        rejection of the Jews as proved by the predictions of the
        Prophets.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Having again begun, in the <i>tenth</i> chapter, by testifying his love
        towards the Jews, he declares that a vain confidence in their own works
        was the cause of their ruin; and lest they should pretend the law, he
        obviates their objection, and says, that we are even by the law itself
        led as it were by the hand to the righteousness of faith. He adds that
        this righteousness is through God&#8217;s bountiful goodness offered
        indiscriminately to all nations, but that it is only apprehended by
        those, whom the Lord through special favor illuminates. And he states,
        that more from the Gentiles than from the Jews would obtain this
        benefit, as predicted both by Moses and by Isaiah; the one having
        plainly prophesied of the calling of the Gentiles, and the other of the
        hardening of the Jews.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The question still remained, &#8220;Is there not a difference between
        the seed of Abraham and other nations according to the covenant of
        God?&#8221; Proceeding to answer this question, he first reminds us,
        that the work of God is not to be limited to what is seen by our eyes,
        since the elect often escape our observation; for Elias was formerly
        mistaken, when he thought that religion had become wholly extinct among
        the Israelites, when there were still remaining seven thousand; and,
        further, that we must not be perplexed by the number of unbelievers,
        who, as we see, hate the gospel. He at length alleges, that the covenant
        of God continues even to the posterity of Abraham according to the
        flesh, but to those only whom the Lord by a free election hath
        predestinated. He then turns to the Gentiles, and speaks to them, lest
        they should become insolent on account of their adoption, and exult over
        the Jews as having been rejected since they excel them in nothing,
        except in the free favor of the Lord, which ought to make them the more
        humble; and that this has not wholly departed from the seed of Abraham,
        for the Jews were at length to be provoked to emulation by the faith of
        the Gentiles, so that God would gather all Israel to himself.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The <i>three</i> chapters which follow are admonitory, but they are
        various in their contents. The <i>twelfth</i> chapter contains general
        precepts on Christian life. The <i>thirteenth</i>, for the; most part,
        speaks of the authority of magistrates. We may hence undoubtedly gather
        that there were then some unruly persons, who thought Christian liberty
        could not exist without overturning the civil power. But that Paul might
        not appear to impose on the Church any duties but those of love, he
        declares that this obedience is included in what love requires. He
        afterwards adds those precepts, which he had before mentioned, for the
        guidance of our conduct. In the <i>next</i> chapter he gives an
        exhortation, especially necessary in that age: for as there were those
        who through obstinate superstition insisted on the observance of Mosaic
        rites, and could not endure the neglect of them without being most
        grievously offended; so there were others, who, being convinced of their
        abrogation, and anxious to pull down superstition, designedly showed
        their contempt of such things. Both parties offended through being too
        intemperate; for the superstitious condemned the others as being
        despisers of God&#8217;s law; and the latter in their turn unreasonably
        ridiculed the simplicity of the former. Therefore the Apostle recommends
        to both a befitting moderation, deporting the one from superciliousness
        and insult, and the other from excessive moroseness: and he also
        prescribes the best way of exercising Christian liberty, by keeping
        within the boundaries of love and edification; and he faithfully
        provides for the weak, while he forbids them to do any thing in
        opposition to conscience.</font

      <font
        >The <i>fifteenth </i>chapter begins with a repetition of the general
        argument, as a conclusion of the whole subject &#8212; that the strong
        should use their strength in endeavours to confirm the weak. And as
        there was a perpetual discord, with regard to the Mosaic ceremonies,
        between the Jews and the Gentiles, he allays all emulation between them
        by removing the cause of contention; for he shows, that the salvation of
        both rested on the mercy of God alone; on which relying, they ought to
        lay aside all high thoughts of themselves and being thereby connected
        together in the hope of the same inheritance, they ought mutually to
        embrace one another. And being anxious, in the last place, to turn aside
        for the purpose of commending his own apostleship, which secured no
        small authority to his doctrine, he takes occasion to defend himself,
        and to deprecate presumption in having assumed with so much confidence
        the office of teacher among them. He further gives them some hope of his
        coming to them, which he had mentioned at the beginning, but had
        hitherto in vain looked for and tried to effect; and he states the
        reason which at that time hindered him, and that was, because the
        churches of Macedonia and Achaia had committed to him the care of
        conveying to Jerusalem those alms which they had given to relieve the
        wants of the faithful in that city.</font

        &#8212; With regard to the word Paul, as it is a subject of no such
        moment as ought to detain us, and as nothing can be said which has not
        been mentioned by other expounders, I should say nothing, were it not
        proper to satisfy some at small expense without being tedious to others;
        for the subject shall be despatched in a very few words.</font

      <font
        >They who think that the Apostle attained this name as a trophy for
        having brought Sergius, the proconsul, to the faith of Christ, are
        confuted by the testimony of Luke, who shows that he was so called
        before that time. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441307&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Acts 13:7, 9.) Nor does it seem probable to me, that it was given him
        when he was converted to Christ; though this idea so pleased Augustine,
        that he took occasion refinedly to philosophize on the subject; for he
        says, that from a proud Saul he was made a very little (<i
          >parvulum</i
        ></font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f12</font></sup
      ><font
        >) disciple of Christ. More probable is the opinion of Origen, who
        thought that he had two names; for it is not unlikely to be true, that
        his name, Saul, derived from his kindred, was given him by his parents
        to indicate his religion and his descent; and that his other name, Paul,
        was added, to show his right to Roman citizenship; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f13</font></sup
      ><font>
        they would not have this honor, then highly valued, to be otherwise than
        made evident; but they did not so much value it as to withhold a proof
        of his Israelitic descent. But he has commonly taken the name Paul in
        his Epistles, and it may be for the following reasons: because in the
        churches to which he wrote, it was more known and more common, more
        acceptable in the Roman empire, and less known among his own nation. It
        was indeed his duty to avoid the foolish suspicion and hatred under
        which the name of a Jew then labored among the Romans and in their
        provinces, and to abstain from inflaming the rage of his own countrymen,
        and to take care of himself.</font

        &#8212; He signalizes himself with these distinctions for the purpose of
        securing more authority to his doctrine; and this he seeks to secure by
        two things &#8212; first, by asserting his call to the Apostleship; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f14</font></sup
      ><font>
        and secondly, by showing that his call was not unconnected with the
        Church of Rome: for it was of great importance that he should be deemed
        an Apostle through God&#8217;s call, and that he should be known as one
        destined for the Roman Church. He therefore says, that he was a </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>servant</i> </font
      ><font
        >of Christ, and called to the office of an Apostle, thereby intimating
        that he had not presumptuously intruded into that office. He then adds,
        that he was <i>chosen</i>, (selectum &#8212; selected, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f15</font></sup
      ><font
        >) by which he more fully confirms the fact, that he was not one of the
        people, but a particular Apostle of the Lord. Consistently with this, he
        had before proceeded from what was general to what was particular, as
        the Apostleship was an especial service; for all who sustain the office
        of teaching are to be deemed Christ&#8217;s servants, but Apostles, in
        point of honor, far exceed all others. But the <i>choosing</i> for the
        gospel, etc., which he afterwards mentions, expresses the end as well as
        the use of the Apostleship; for he intended briefly to show for what
        purpose he was called to that function. By saying then that he was
        servant of Christ, he declared what he had in common with other
        teachers; by claiming to himself the title of an Apostle, he put himself
        before others; but as no authority is due to him who willfully intrudes
        himself, he reminds us, that he was appointed by God.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Then the meaning is, &#8212; that Paul was a servant of Christ, not any
        kind of servant, but an Apostle, and that by the call of God, and not by
        presumptuous intrusion: then follows a clearer explanation of the
        Apostolic office, &#8212; it was ordained for the preaching of the
        Gospel. For I cannot agree with those who refer this call of which he
        speaks to the eternal election of God; and who understand the
        separation, either that from his mother&#8217;s womb, which he mentions
        in </font

      ><font
        >Galatians 1:15, or that which Luke refers to, when Paul was appointed
        for the Gentiles: but I consider that he simply glories in having God as
        the author of his call, lest any one should think that he had through
        his own rashness taken this honor to himself. </font

      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >We must here observe, that all are not fitted for the ministry of the

        without a call. But as to the character of the Apostolic and of the
        Episcopal call, we shall consider it in another place. We must further
        observe, that the office of an Apostle is the preaching of the gospel.
        It hence appears what just objects of ridicule are those dumb dogs, who
        render themselves conspicuous only by their mitre and their crook, and

        I mention this to remove the mistake of those who too much refine on

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Which he had before promised</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. &#8212; As the suspicion of being new subtracts much from the
        authority of a doctrine, he confirms the faith of the gospel by
        antiquity; as though he said, &#8220;Christ came not on the earth
        unexpectedly, nor did he introduce a doctrine of a new kind and not
        heard of before, inasmuch as he, and his gospel too, had been promised
        and expected from the beginning of the world.&#8221; But as antiquity is
        often fabulous, he brings witnesses, and those approved, even the
        Prophets of God, that he might remove every suspicion. He in the third
        place adds, that their testimonies were duly recorded, that is, in the
        Holy Scriptures.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >We may learn from this passage what the gospel is: he teaches us, not
        that it was promulgated by the Prophets but only promised. If then the
        Prophets promised the gospel, it follows, that it was revealed, when our
        Lord was at length manifested in the flesh. They are then mistaken who
        confound the promises with the gospel, since the gospel is properly the
        appointed preaching of Christ as manifested, in whom the promises
        themselves are exhibited. </font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Concerning his own Son,</i></font

        etc. &#8212; This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that
        the whole gospel is included in Christ, so that if any removes one step
        from Christ, he withdraws himself from the gospel. For since he is the
        living and express image of the Father, it is no wonder, that he alone
        is set before us as one to whom our whole faith is to be directed and in
        whom it is to center. It is then a definition of the gospel, by which
        Paul expresses what is summarily comprehended in it. I have rendered the
        words which follow, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Jesus Christ our Lord</i></font
      ><font
        >, in the same case; which seems to me to be most agreeable with the
        context. We hence learn, that he who has made a due proficiency in the
        knowledge of Christ, has acquired every thing which can be learned from
        the gospel; and, on the other hand, that they who seek to be wise
        without Christ, are not only foolish, but even completely insane.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Who was made,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. &#8212; Two things must be found in Christ, in order that we may
        obtain salvation in him, even divinity and humanity. His divinity
        possesses power, righteousness, life, which by his humanity are conveyed
        to us. Hence the Apostle has expressly mentioned both in the Summary he
        gives of the gospel, that Christ was manifested in the flesh &#8212; and
        that in it he declared himself to be the Son of God. So John says; after
        having declared that the Word was made flesh, he adds, that in that
        flesh there was a glory as of the only-begotten Son of God. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >John 1:14.) That he specially notices the descent and lineage of Christ
        from his ancestor David, is not superfluous; for by this he calls back
        our attention to the promise, that we may not doubt but that he is the
        very person who had been formerly promised. So well known was the
        promise made to David, that it appears to have been a common thing among
        the Jews to call the Messiah the Son of David. This then &#8212; that
        Christ did spring from David &#8212; was said for the purpose of
        confirming our faith.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>He adds,</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> according to the flesh</i></font
      ><font
        >; and he adds this, that we may understand that he had something more
        excellent than flesh, which he brought from heaven, and did not take
        from David, even that which he afterwards mentions, the glory of the
        divine nature. Paul does further by these words not only declare that
        Christ had real flesh, but he also clearly distinguishes his human from
        his divine nature; and thus he refutes the impious raving of
        <i>Servetus</i>, who assigned flesh to Christ, composed of three
        untreated elements.</font

        >Psalm 2:7, &#8220;I have this day begotten thee:&#8221; for this
        begetting refers to what was made known. Though some indeed find here
        three separate evidences of the divinity of Christ &#8212;
        &#8220;power,&#8221; understanding thereby miracles &#8212; then the
        testimony of the Spirit &#8212; and, lastly, the resurrection from the
        dead &#8212; I yet prefer to connect them together, and to reduce these
        three things to one, in this manner &#8212; that Christ was declared the
        Son of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the
        power of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead; but that this power is
        comprehended, when a conviction of it is imprinted on our hearts by the
        same Spirit. The language of the Apostle well agrees with this view; for
        he says that he was declared by power, because power, peculiar to God,
        shone forth in him, and uncontestably proved him to be God; and this was
        indeed made evident by his resurrection. Paul says the same thing in
        another place; having stated, that by death the weakness of the flesh
        appeared, he at the same time extols the power of the Spirit in his
        resurrection; (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470804&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >2 Corinthians 8:4) This glory, however, is not made known to us, until
        the same Spirit imprints a conviction of it on our hearts. And that Paul
        includes, together with the wonderful energy of the Spirit, which Christ
        manifested by rising from the dead, the testimony which all the faithful
        feel in their hearts, is even evident from this &#8212; that he
        expressly calls it the Spirit of Holiness; as though he had said, that
        the Spirit, as far as it sanctifies, confirms and ratifies that evidence
        of its power which it once exhibited. For the Scripture is wont often to
        ascribe such titles to the Spirit, as tend to illustrate our present
        subject. Thus He is called by our Lord the Spirit of Truth, on account
        of the effect which he mentions; (</font

        introduced for the recommendation of his office, he now returns to speak
        of his own call; and it was a great point that this should be proved to
        the Romans. By mentioning grace and apostleship apart, he adopts a form
        of speech, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f20</font></sup
      ><font>
        which must be understood as meaning, gratuitous apostleship or the favor
        of the apostleship; by which he means, that it was wholly through divine
        favor, not through his own worthiness, that he had been chosen for so
        high an office. For though it has hardly any thing connected with it in
        the estimation of the world, except dangers, labors, hatred, and
        disgrace; yet before God and his saints, it possesses a dignity of no
        common or ordinary kind. It is therefore deservedly counted a favor. If
        you prefer to say, &#8220;I have received grace that I should be an
        Apostle,&#8221; the sense would be the same. </font

        design of his calling, he again reminds the Romans of his office, as
        though he said, &#8220;It is indeed my duty to discharge the office
        committed to me, which is to preach the word; and it is your duty to

        the name of obedience is given to it, and for this reason &#8212;
        because the Lord calls us by his gospel; we respond to his call by

        his ministry had reference to some who were to be taught: hence he adds,
        that his apostleship extended to all nations. He afterwards calls
        himself more distinctly the Apostle of the Romans, when he says, that
        they were included in the number of the nations, to whom he had been
        given as a minister And further, the Apostles had in common the command
        to preach the gospel to all the world; and they were not, as pastors and
        bishops, set over certain churches. But Paul, in addition to the general
        undertaking of the apostolic function, was constituted, by a special
        appointment, to be a minister to proclaim the gospel among the Gentiles.
        It is no objection to this, that he was forbidden to pass through
        Macedonia and to preach the word in Mysia: for this was done, not that
        there were limits prescribed to him, but that he was for a time to go
        elsewhere; for the harvest was not as yet ripe there.</font

        the Lord had already exhibited in them an evidence by which he had
        manifested that he had called them to a participation of the gospel. It
        hence followed, that if they wished their own calling to remain sure,
        they were not to reject the ministry of Paul, who had been chosen by the
        same election of God. I therefore take this clause, &#8220;the called of
        Jesus Christ,&#8221; as explanatory, as though the particle
        &#8220;even&#8221; were inserted; for he means, that they were by
        calling made partakers of Christ. For they who shall be heirs of eternal
        life, are chosen by the celestial Father to be children in Christ; and
        when chosen, they are committed to his care and protection as their
        shepherd. </font

        of commendation; he says, that first the Lord through his own kindness
        made us the objects of his favor and love; and then that he has called
        us; and thirdly, that he has called us to holiness: but this high honor
        only then exists, when we are not wanting to our call.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >Here a rich truth presents itself to us, to which I shall briefly
        refer, and leave it to be meditated upon by each individual: Paul does
        by no means ascribe the praise of our salvation to ourselves, but
        derives it altogether from the fountain of God&#8217;s free and paternal
        love towards us; for he makes this the first thing &#8212; God loves us:
        and what is the cause of his love, except his own goodness alone? On
        this depends our calling, by which in his own time he seals his adoption
        to those whom he had before freely chosen. We also learn from this
        passage that none rightly connect themselves with the number of the
        faithful, except they feel assured that the Lord is gracious, however
        unworthy and wretched sinners they may be, and except they be stimulated
        by his goodness and aspire to holiness, for he hath not called us to
        uncleanness, but to holiness. (</font

        etc. Nothing is more desirable than to have God propitious to us, and
        this is signified by <i>grace</i>; and then to have prosperity and
        success in all things flowing from him, and this is intimated by </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font
      ><font
        >; for however things may seem to smile on us, if God be angry, even
        blessing itself is turned to a curse. The very foundation then of our
        felicity is the favor of God, by which we enjoy true and solid
        prosperity, and by which also our salvation is promoted even when we are
        in adversities. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f25</font></sup
      ><font>
        And then as he prays to God for peace, we must understand, that whatever
        good comes to us, it is the fruit of divine benevolence. Nor must we
        omit to notice, that he prays at the same time to the Lord Jesus Christ
        for these blessings. Worthily indeed is this honor rendered to him, who
        is not only the administrator and dispenser of his Father&#8217;s bounty
        to us, but also works all things in connection with him. It was,
        however, the special object of the Apostle to show, that through him all
        God&#8217;s blessings come to us. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f26</font></sup
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>There are those who prefer to regard the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font
      ><font>
        as signifying quietness of conscience; and that this meaning belongs to
        it sometimes, I do not deny: but since it is certain that the Apostle
        wished to give us here a summary of God&#8217;s blessings, the former
        meaning, which is adduced by <i>Bucer</i>, is much the most suitable.
        Anxiously wishing then to the godly what makes up real happiness, he
        betakes himself, as he did before, to the very fountain itself, even the
        favor of God, which not only alone brings to us eternal felicity but is
        also the source of all blessings in this life.</font

        occasion, as he seasonably prepares them for receiving instruction by
        reasons connected with himself as well as with them. What he states
        respecting them is, the celebrity of their faith; for he intimates that
        they being honored with the public approbation of the churches, could
        not reject an Apostle of the Lord, without disappointing the good
        opinion entertained of them by all; and such a thing would have been
        extremely uncourteous and in a manner bordering on perfidy. As then this
        testimony justly induced the Apostle, by affording him an assurance of
        their obedience, to undertake, according to his office, to teach and
        instruct the Romans; so it held them bound not to despise his authority.
        With regard to himself, he disposes them to a teachable spirit by

        that he implies that it had been received from God. We are here taught
        that faith is God&#8217;s gift; for thanksgiving is an acknowledgment of
        a benefit. He who gives thanks to God for faith, confesses that it comes
        from him. And since we find that the Apostle ever begins his
        congratulations with thanksgiving, let us know that we are hereby
        reminded, that all our blessings are God&#8217;s free gifts. It is also
        needful to become accustomed to such forms of speaking, that we may be
        led more fully to rouse ourselves in the duty of acknowledging God as
        the giver of all our blessings, and to stir up others to join us in the
        same acknowledgment. If it be right to do this in little things, how
        much more with regard to faith; Which is neither a small nor an
        indiscriminate (<i>promiscua</i>) gift of God. We have here besides an

        The eulogy of faithful men was to Paul equal to that of the whole world,
        with regard to the faith of the Romans; for the unbelieving, who deemed
        it detestable, could not have given an impartial or a correct testimony
        respecting it. We then understood that it was by the mouths of the
        faithful that the faith of the Romans was proclaimed through the whole
        world; and that they were alone able to judge rightly of it, and to
        pronounce a correct opinion. That this small and despised handful of men
        were unknown as to their character to the ungodly, even at Rome, was a
        circumstance he regarded as nothing; for Paul made no account of their
        judgment.</font

        etc. He proves his love by its effects; for had he not greatly loved
        them, he would not have so anxiously commended them to the Lord, and
        especially he would not have so ardently desired to promote their
        welfare by his own labors. His anxiety then and his ardent desire were
        certain evidences of his love; for had they not sprung from it, they
        would never have existed. And as he knew it to be necessary for
        establishing confidence in his preaching, that the Romans should be
        fully persuaded of his sincerity, he added an oath &#8212; a needful
        remedy, whenever a declaration, Which ought to be received as true and
        indubitable vacillates through uncertainty. For since an oath is nothing
        else but an appeal to God as to the truth of what we declare, most
        foolish is it to deny that the Apostle used here an oath. He did not
        notwithstanding transgress the prohibition of Christ.</font

        law, allowing an oath, only condemns perjury and needless swearing. If
        then we would use an oath aright, let us imitate the seriousness and the
        reverent manner exhibited by the Apostles; and that you may understand
        what it is, know that God is so called as a witness, that he is also
        appealed to as an avenger, in case we deceive; which Paul expresses

        name, no less boldly than presumptuously; but the Apostle here speaks of
        his own piety, in order to gain credit; and those, in whom the fear of
        God and reverence for his name prevail, will dread to swear falsely. At
        the same time, he sets his own spirit in opposition to the outward mask
        of religion; for as many falsely pretend to be the worshippers of God,
        and outwardly appear to be so, he testifies that he, from the heart
        served, God. </font

      ><font>
        It may be also that he alluded to the ancient ceremonies, in which alone
        the Jews thought the worship of God consisted. He then intimates, that
        though he retained not observance of these, he was yet a sincere
        worshipper of God, according to what he says in </font

    <div>
      <font
        >But it was expedient, as I have said, in order that his oath might
        attain more credit, that Paul should declare his piety towards God; for
        perjury is a sport to the ungodly, while the pious dread it more than a
        thousand deaths; inasmuch as it cannot be, but that where there is a
        real fear of God, there must be also a reverence for his name. It is
        then the same thing, as though Paul had said, that he knew how much
        sacredness and sincerity belonged to an oath, and that he did not rashly
        appeal to God as a witness, as the profane are wont to do. And thus, by
        his own example, he teaches us, that whenever we swear, we ought to give
        such evidence of piety, that the name of God, which we use in our
        declarations, may retain its sacredness. And further, he gives a proof,
        even by his own ministry, that he worshipped not God feignedly; for it
        was the fullest evidence, that he was a man devoted to God&#8217;s
        glory, when he denied himself, and hesitated not to undergo all the
        hardships of reproach, poverty, and hatred, and even the peril of death,
        in advancing the kingdom of God. </font

      <font

        worship which he said he rendered to God, on this account, &#8212;
        because it corresponded with what the gospel prescribes. It is indeed
        certain that spiritual worship is enjoined on us in the gospel; but the
        former interpretation is far the most suitable, &#8212; that he devoted
        his service to God in preaching the gospel. He, however, makes at the
        same time a difference between himself and hypocrites, who have
        something else in view rather than to serve God; for ambition, or some
        such thing, influences most men; and it is far from being the case, that
        all engage cordially and faithfully in this office. The meaning is, that
        Paul performed sincerely the office of teaching; for what he says of his

        an excellent service, when they know that their labor is pleasing to
        God, and is approved by him? Moreover, he calls it<i> </i></font

        constancy in praying for them. It was, indeed, a strong evidence, when
        he poured forth no prayers to the Lord without making mention of them.

        Now he speaks not of every kind of calling on God, but of those prayers
        to which the saints, being at liberty, and laying aside all cares, apply
        their whole attention to the work; for he might have often expressed
        suddenly this or that wish, when the Romans did not come into his mind;
        but whenever he had previously intended, and, as it were, prepared
        himself to offer up prayers to God, among others he remembered them. He
        then speaks peculiarly of those prayers, for which the saints
        deliberately prepare themselves; as we find to have been the case with
        our Lord himself, who, for this purpose, sought retirement. He at the
        same time intimates how frequently, or rather, how unceasingly he was
        engaged in such prayers, since he says that he prayed continually.</font

        etc. As it is not probable that we from the heart study his benefit,
        whom we are not ready to assist by our labors, he now adds, after having
        said that he was anxious for their welfare, that he showed by another
        proof his love to them, as before God, even by requesting that he might
        be able to advance their interest. That you may, therefore, perceive the
        full meaning, read the words as though the word <i>also</i> were

        in his journey, but that he deemed his journey prosperous, if it was
        approved by the Lord. According to this model ought all our wishes to be

        that he wished to undertake the toil of a journey, not for his own, but

        exhortation, or of prophesy which he knew had come to him through
        God&#8217;s favor. He has here strikingly pointed out the use of gifts

      ><font

        to regard them such as were yet to be instructed in the first elements
        of religion, as though they were not hitherto rightly taught in Christ.
        He then says, that he wished so to lend his aid to them, that they who
        had for the most part made a proficiency, might be further assisted: for
        a confirmation is what we all want, until Christ be fully formed in us.

        desire so to confirm you according to the measure of grace conferred on
        me, that your example may also add courage (<i>alacritatem</i> &#8212;

        intimates that it ought not to be ascribed to his arrogance, that he
        thought himself in a manner capable of teaching the Romans, however much
        they excelled in learning and wisdom and in the knowledge of things,

        variety of talents, and every kind of science, and the loftiness of all
        arts, to give way to the simplicity of his doctrine; and what is more,
        they are to be reduced to the same rank with the unlearned, and to be
        made so meek, as to be able to bear those to be their fellow-disciples
        under their master, Christ, whom they would not have deigned before to
        take as their scholars; and then that the unlearned are by no means to
        be driven away from this school, nor are they to flee away from it
        through groundless fear; for if Paul was indebted to them, being a
        faithful debtor, he had doubtless discharged what he owed; and thus they
        will find here what they will be capable of enjoying. All teachers have
        also a rule here which they are to follow, and that is, modestly and
        kindly to accommodate themselves to the capacities of the ignorant and
        unlearned. Hence it will be, that they will be able, with more evenness
        of mind, to bear with many absurdities and almost innumerable things
        that may disgust them, by which they might otherwise be overcome. They
        are, however, to remember, that they are not so indebted to the foolish,

        gather fruit for the Lord, he was anxious to fulfill God&#8217;s

        etc. This is an anticipation of an objection; for he declares
        beforehand, that he cared not for the taunts of the ungodly; and he thus
        provides a way for himself, by which he proceeds to pronounce an eulogy
        on the value of the gospel, that it might not appear contemptible to the
        Romans. He indeed intimates that it was contemptible in the eyes of the
        world; and he does this by saying, that he was not ashamed of it. And
        thus he prepares them for bearing the reproach of the cross of Christ,
        lest they should esteem the gospel of less value by finding it exposed
        to the scoffs and reproaches of the ungodly; and, on the other hand, he
        shows how valuable it was to the faithful. If, in the first place, the
        power of God ought to be extolled by us, that power shines forth in the
        gospel; if, again, the goodness of God deserves to be sought and loved
        by us, the gospel is a display of his goodness. It ought then to be
        reverenced and honored, since veneration is due to God&#8217;s power;
        and as it avails to our salvation, it ought to be loved by us.</font

        follows, that those as it were willfully despise the power of God, and
        drive away from them his delivering hand, who withdraw themselves from
        the hearing of the word.</font

        The gospel is indeed offered to all for their salvation, but the power
        of it appears not everywhere: and that it is the savor of death to the
        ungodly, does not proceed from what it is, but from their own
        wickedness. By setting forth but one Salvation he cuts off every other
        trust. When men withdraw themselves from this one salvation, they find
        in the gospel a sure proof of their own ruin. Since then the gospel
        invites all to partake of salvation without any difference, it is
        rightly called the doctrine of salvation: for Christ is there offered,
        whose peculiar office is to save that which was lost; and those who
        refuse to be saved by him, shall find him a Judge. But everywhere in
        Scripture the word salvation is simply set in opposition to the word
        destruction: and hence we must observe, when it is mentioned, what the
        subject of the discourse is. Since then the gospel delivers from ruin
        and the curse of endless death, its salvation is eternal life. </font

        Under the word Greek, he includes all the Gentiles, as it is evident
        from the comparison that is made; for the two clauses comprehend all
        mankind. And it is probable that he chose especially this nation to
        designate other nations, because, in the first place, it was admitted,
        next to the Jews, into a participation of the gospel covenant; and,
        secondly, because the Greeks, on account of their vicinity, and the
        celebrity of their language, were more known to the Jews. It is then a
        mode of speaking, a part being taken for the whole, by which he connects
        the Gentiles universally with the Jews, as participators of the gospel:
        nor does he thrust the Jews from their own eminence and dignity, since
        they were the first partakers of God&#8217;s promise and calling. He
        then reserves for them their prerogative; but he immediately joins the
        Gentiles, though in the second place, as being partakers with
        them.</font

      ><font>
        etc. This is an explanation and a confirmation of the preceding clause
        &#8212; that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation. For if we
        seek salvation, that is, life with God, righteousness must be first
        sought, by which being reconciled to him, we may, through him being
        propitious to us, obtain that life which consists only in his favor;
        for, in order to be loved by God, we must first become righteous, since
        he regards unrighteousness with hatred. He therefore intimates, that we
        cannot obtain salvation otherwise than from the gospel, since nowhere
        else does God reveal to us his righteousness, which alone delivers us
        from perdition. Now this righteousness, which is the groundwork of our
        salvation, is revealed in the gospel: hence the gospel is said to be the
        power of God unto salvation. Thus he reasons from the cause to the
        effect.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >Notice further, how extraordinary and valuable a treasure does God
        bestow on us through the gospel, even the communication of his own

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f40</font></sup
      ><font>
        as that, on the contrary, is usually called the righteousness of men,
        which is by men counted and supposed to be righteousness, though it be
        only vapor. Paul, however, I doubt not, alludes to the many prophecies
        in which the Spirit makes known everywhere the righteousness of God in
        the future kingdom of Christ.</font

        justifies us by the gospel, and thus saves us: yet the former view seems
        to me more suitable, though it is not what I make much of. Of greater
        moment is what some think, that this righteousness does not only consist
        in the free remission of sins, but also, in part, includes the grace of
        regeneration. But I consider, that we are restored to life because God
        freely reconciles us to himself, as we shall hereafter show in its
        proper place.</font

      ><font>
        for righteousness is offered by the gospel, and is received by faith.
        And he adds, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>to faith</i></font
      ><font
        >: for as our faith makes progress, and as it advances in knowledge, so
        the righteousness of God increases in us at the same time, and the
        possession of it is in a manner confirmed. When at first we taste the
        gospel, we indeed see God&#8217;s smiling countenance turned towards us,
        but at a distance: the more the knowledge of true religion grows in us,
        by coming as it were nearer, we behold God&#8217;s favor more clearly
        and more familiarly. What some think, that there is here an implied
        comparison between the Old and New Testament, is more refined than
        well-founded; for Paul does not here compare the Fathers who lived under
        the law with us, but points out the daily progress that is made by every
        one of the faithful.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>As it is written</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. By the authority of the Prophet Habakkuk he proves the
        righteousness of faith; for he, predicting the overthrow of the proud,
        adds this &#8212; that the life of the righteous consists in faith. Now
        we live not before God, except through righteousness: it then follows,
        that our righteousness is obtained by faith; and the verb being future,
        designates the real perpetuity of that life of which he speaks; as
        though he had said, &#8212; that it would not be momentary, but continue
        forever. For even the ungodly swell with the false notion of having
        life; but when they say, &#8220;Peace and safety,&#8221; a sudden
        destruction comes upon them, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520503&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >1 Thessalonians 5:3.) It is therefore a shadow, which endures only for
        a moment. Faith alone is that which secures the perpetuity of life; and
        whence is this, except that it leads us to God, and makes our life to
        depend on him? For Paul would not have aptly quoted this testimony had
        not the meaning of the Prophet been, that we then only stand, when by
        faith we recumb on God: and he has not certainly ascribed life to the
        faith of the godly, but in as far as they, having renounced the
        arrogance of the world, resign themselves to the protection of God
        alone. </font

        there is a mutual connection between faith and the gospel: for as the

        the first proof of condemnation, the fact, &#8212; that though the

        where salvation is to be found. He has already declared that we cannot

        humble itself so far as to assign the praise of salvation to the grace

        these two words one thing is designated, and that is, ingratitude

      ><font
        >, according to the usage of Scripture, speaking after the manner of
        men, means the vengeance of God; for God, in punishing, has, according
        to our notion, the appearance of one in wrath. It imports, therefore, no
        such emotion in God, but only has a reference to the perception and
        feeling of the sinner who is punished. Then he says that it is</font

        all that appertains to the setting forth of the glory of the Lord, or,
        which is the same thing, whatever ought to move and excite us to glorify
        God. And by this expression he intimates, that God in his greatness can
        by no means be fully comprehended by us, and that there are certain
        limits within which men ought to confine themselves, inasmuch as God
        accommodates to our small capacities what he testifies of himself.
        Insane then are all they who seek to know of themselves what God is: for
        the Spirit, the teacher of perfect wisdom, does not in vain invite our

        etc. God is in himself invisible; but as his majesty shines forth in his
        works and in his creatures everywhere, men ought in these to acknowledge
        him, for they clearly set forth their Maker: and for this reason the
        Apostle in his Epistle to the Hebrews says, that this world is a mirror,
        or the representation of invisible things. He does not mention all the
        particulars which may be thought to belong to God; but he states, that
        we can arrive at the knowledge of his eternal power and divinity; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f47</font></sup
      ><font>
        for he who is the framer of all things, must necessarily be without
        beginning and from himself. When we arrive at this point, the divinity
        becomes known to us, which cannot exist except accompanied with all the
        attributes of a God, since they are all included under that idea.</font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>So that they are inexcusable.</i></font

        It hence clearly appears what the consequence is of having this evidence
        &#8212; that men cannot allege any thing before God&#8217;s tribunal for
        the purpose of showing that they are not justly condemned. Yet let this
        difference be remembered, that the manifestation of God, by which he
        makes his glory known in his creation, is, with regard to the light
        itself, sufficiently clear; but that on account of our blindness, it is
        not found to be sufficient. We are not however so blind, that we can
        plead our ignorance as an excuse for our perverseness. We conceive that
        there is a Deity; and then we conclude, that whoever he may be, he ought
        to be worshipped: but our reason here fails, because it cannot ascertain
        who or what sort of being God is. Hence the Apostle in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581103&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Hebrews 11:3, ascribes to faith the light by which man can gain real
        knowledge from the work of creation, and not without reason; for we are
        prevented by our blindness, so that we reach not to the end in view; we
        yet see so far, that we cannot pretend any excuse. Both these things are
        strikingly set forth by Paul in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441417&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Acts 14:17, when he says, that the Lord in past times left the nations
        in their ignorance, and yet that he left them not without witness
        (<i>amarturon</i>,) since he gave them rain and fertility from heaven.
        But this knowledge of God, which avails only to take away excuse,
        differs greatly from that which brings salvation, which Christ mentions
        in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431203&gt;</font></sup

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For when they knew God</i></font

        of all the means of knowing him, having so manifested himself by his
        works, that they must necessarily see what of themselves they seek not
        to know &#8212; that there is some God; for the world does not by chance
        exist, nor could it have proceeded from itself. But we must ever bear in
        mind the degree of knowledge in which they continued; and this appears
        from what follows.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>They glorified him not as God</i></font
      ><font
        >. No idea can be formed of God without including his eternity, power,
        wisdom, goodness, truth, righteousness, and mercy. His eternity appears
        evident, because he is the maker of all things &#8212; his power,
        because he holds all things in his hand and continues their existence
        &#8212; his wisdom, because he has arranged things in such an exquisite
        order &#8212; his goodness, for there is no other cause than himself,
        why he created all things, and no other reason, why he should be induced
        to preserve them &#8212; his justice, because in his government he
        punishes the guilty and defends the innocent &#8212; his mercy, because
        he bears with so much forbearance the perversity of men &#8212; and his
        truth, because he is unchangeable. He then who has a right notion of God
        ought to give him the praise due to his eternity, wisdom, goodness, and
        justice. Since men have not recognized these attributes in God, but have
        dreamt of him as though he were an empty phantom, they are justly said
        to have impiously robbed him of his own glory. Nor is it without reason
        that he adds, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>that they were not thankful</i></font
      ><font>, </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f48</font></sup
      ><font>
        for there is no one who is not indebted to him for numberless benefits:
        yea, even on this account alone, because he has been pleased to reveal
        himself to us, he has abundantly made us indebted to him. </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But they became vain</i></font
      ><font>, </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f49</font></sup
      ><font>
        etc.; that is, having forsaken the truth of God, they turned to the
        vanity of their own reason, all the acuteness of which is fading and
        passes away like vapor. And thus their foolish mind, being involved in
        darkness, could understand nothing aright but was carried away headlong,
        in various ways, into errors and delusions. Their unrighteousness was
        this &#8212; they quickly choked by their own depravity the seed of
        right knowledge, before it grew up to ripeness.</font

        etc. It is commonly inferred from this passage, that Paul alludes here
        to those philosophers, who assumed to themselves in a peculiar manner
        the reputation of wisdom; and it is thought that the design of his
        discourse is to show, that when the superiority of the great is brought
        down to nothing, the common people would have no reason to suppose that
        they had any thing worthy of being commended: but they seem to me to
        have been guided by too slender a reason; for it was not peculiar to the
        philosophers to suppose themselves wise in the knowledge of God, but it
        was equally common to all nations, and to all ranks of men. There were
        indeed none who sought not to form some ideas of the majesty of God, and
        to make him such a God as they could conceive him to be according to
        their own reason. This presumption I hold is not learned in the schools,
        but is innate, and comes with us, so to speak, from the womb. It is
        indeed evident, that it is an evil which has prevailed in all ages
        &#8212; that men have allowed themselves every liberty in coining
        superstitions. The arrogance then which is condemned here is this
        &#8212; that men sought to be of themselves wise, and to draw God down
        to a level with their own low condition, when they ought humbly to have
        given him his own glory. For Paul holds this principle, that none,
        except through their own fault, are unacquainted with the worship due to
        God; as though he said, &#8220;As they have proudly exalted themselves,
        they have become infatuated through the righteous judgment of
        God.&#8221; There is an obvious reason, which contravenes the
        interpretation which I reject; for the error of forming an image of God
        did not originate with the philosophers; but they, by their consent,
        approved of it as received from others. </font

        their carnal reason, they were very far from acknowledging the true God:
        but devised a fictitious and a new god, or rather a phantom. And what he
        says is, that they </font

        pretense, that they believe that God dwells in heaven, and that they
        count not the wood to be God, but his image; for it is a high indignity
        to God, to form so gross an idea of his majesty as to dare to make an
        image of him. But from the wickedness of such a presumption none were
        exempt, neither priests, nor statesmen, nor philosophers, of whom the
        most sound-minded, even Plato himself, sought to find out some likeness
        of God.</font

        etc. As impiety is a hidden evil, lest they should still find an
        evasion, he shows, by a more palpable demonstration, that, they cannot
        escape, but must be held fast by a just condemnation, since such fruits
        have followed this impiety as cannot be viewed otherwise than manifest
        evidences of the Lord&#8217;s wrath. As the Lord&#8217;s wrath is always
        just, it follows, that what has exposed them to condemnation, must have
        preceded it. By these evidences then he now proves the apostasy and
        defection of men: for the Lord indeed does so punish those, who alienate
        them selves from his goodness, that he casts them headlong into various
        courses which lead to perdition and ruin. And by comparing the vices, of
        which they were guilty, with the impiety, of which he had before accused
        them, he shows that they suffered punishment through the just judgment
        of God: for since nothing is dearer to us than our own honor, it is
        extreme blindness, when we fear not to bring disgrace on ourselves; and
        it is the most suitable punishment for a reproach done to the Divine
        Majesty. This is the very thing which he treats of to the end of the
        chapter; but he handles it in various ways, for the subject required
        ample illustration.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >What then, in short, he proves to us is this, &#8212; that the
        ingratitude of men to God is incapable of being excused; for it is
        manifest, by unequivocal evidences, that the wrath of God rages against
        them: they would have never rolled themselves in lusts so filthy, after
        the manner of beasts, had not the majesty of God been provoked and
        incensed against them. Since, then, the worst abominations abounded
        everywhere, he concludes that there existed among them evidences of
        divine vengeance. Now, as this never rages without reason, or unjustly,
        but ever keeps within the limits of what is right, he intimates that it
        hence appears that perdition, not less certain than just, impended over
        all.</font

        >As to the manner in which God gives up or delivers men to wickedness,
        it is by no means necessary in this place to discuss a question so
        intricate, (<i>longam</i> &#8212; tedious.) It is indeed certain, that
        he not only permits men to fall into sin, by allowing them to do so, and
        by conniving at them; but that he also, by his equitable judgment, so
        arranges things, that they are led and carried into such madness by
        their own lusts, as well as by the devil. He therefore adopts the word,
        <i>give up</i>, according to the constant usage of Scripture; which word
        they forcibly wrest, who think that we are led into sin only by the
        permission of God: for as Satan is the minister of God&#8217;s wrath,
        and as it were the executioner, so he is armed against us, not through
        the connivance, but by the command of his judge. God, however, is not on
        this account cruel, nor are we innocent, inasmuch as Paul plainly shows,
        that we are not delivered up into his power, except when we deserve such
        a punishment. Only we must make this exception, that the cause of sin is
        not from God, the roots of which ever abide in the sinner himself; for
        this must be true,</font

        to a lie, his glory is obliterated. It is then but just, that they

        honor cannot be given to a creature, without taking it away, in a
        disgraceful and sacrilegious manner, from God: and vain is the excuse
        that images are worshipped on God&#8217;s account, since God
        acknowledges no such worship, nor regards it as acceptable; and the true
        God is not then worshipped at all, but a fictitious God, whom the flesh
        has devised for itself. </font

      ><font> What is added, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Who is blessed for ever</i></font

        to greater reproach, and in this way, &#8220;He is one whom they ought
        alone to have honored and worshipped, and from whom it was not right to

        etc. After having introduced as it were an intervening clause, he
        returns to what he had before stated respecting the judgment of God: and
        he brings, as the first example, the dreadful crime of unnatural lust;
        and it hence appears that they not only abandoned themselves to beastly
        lusts, but became degraded beyond the beasts, since they reversed the
        whole order of nature. He then enumerates a long catalogue of vices
        which had existed in all ages, and then prevailed everywhere without any
        restraint.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It is not to the purpose to say, that every one was not laden with so
        great a mass of vices; for in arraigning the common baseness of men, it
        is proof enough if all to a man are constrained to acknowledge some
        faults. So then we must consider, that Paul here records those
        abominations which had been common in all ages, and were at that time
        especially prevalent everywhere; for it is marvelous how common then was
        that filthiness which even brute beasts abhor; and some of these vices
        were even popular. And he recites a catalogue of vices, in some of which
        the whole race of man were involved; for though all were not murderers,
        or thieves, or adulterers, yet there were none who were not found
        polluted by some vice or another. He calls those
        <i>disgraceful passions</i>, which are shameful even in the estimation
        of men, and redound to the dishonoring of God.</font

        They indeed deserved to be blinded, so as to forget themselves, and not
        to see any thing befitting them, who, through their own malignity,
        closed their eyes against the light offered them by God, that they might
        not behold his glory: in short, they who were not ashamed to extinguish,
        as much as they could, the glory of God, which alone gives us light,
        deserved to become blind at noonday.</font

        etc. There is an evident comparison to be observed in these words, by
        which is strikingly set forth the just relation between sin and
        punishment. As they chose not to continue in the knowledge of God, which
        alone guides our minds to true wisdom, the Lord gave them a perverted
        mind, which can choose nothing that is right. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f53</font></sup
      ><font>
        And by saying, that they chose not, (non probasse-approved not,) it is
        the same as though he had said, that they pursues not after the
        knowledge of God with the attention they ought to have done, but, on the
        contrary, turned away the; thoughts resignedly from God. He then
        intimates, that they, making a depraved choice, preferred their own
        vanities to the true God; and thus the error, by which they were
        deceived, was voluntary.</font

        abomination, which prevailed indeed among many, but was not common to
        all, he begins here to enumerate vices from which none could be found
        free: for though every vice, as it has been said, did not appear in each
        individual, yet all were guilty of some vices, so that every one might
        separately be accused of manifest depravity. As he calls them in the
        first instance <i>not meet</i>, understand him as saying, that they were
        inconsistent with every decision of reason, and alien to the duties of
        men: for he mentions it as an evidence of a perverted mind, that men
        addicted themselves, without any reflection, to those vices, which
        common sense ought to have led them to renounce.</font

        appears to me the correctest interpretation, &#8212; that men left
        nothing undone for the purpose of giving unbridled liberty to their
        sinful propensities; for having taken away all distinction between good
        and evil, they approved in themselves and in others those things which
        they knew displeased God, and would be condemned by his righteous
        judgment. For it is the summit of all evils, when the sinner is so void
        of shame, that he is pleased with his own vices, and will not bear them
        to be reproved, and also cherishes them in others by his consent and
        approbation. This desperate wickedness is thus described in
        Scripture:</font

        us, and are approved, there is no more any hope of reformation. Such,
        then, is the interpretation I give; for I see that the Apostle meant
        here to condemn something more grievous and more wicked than the very
        doing of vices: what that is I know not, except we refer to that which
        is the summit of all wickedness, &#8212; that is, when wretched men,
        having cast away all shame, undertake the patronage of vices in
        opposition to the righteousness of God.</font

        Hence Paul, after having stated the grosser vices, that he might prove
        that none are just before God, now attacks saintlings (<i>sanctulos</i>)
        of this kind, who could not have been included in the first catalogue.
        Now the inference is too simple and plain for any one to wonder how the
        Apostle derived his argument; for he makes them </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>inexcusable,</i></font
      ><font>
        because they themselves knew the judgment of God, and yet transgressed
        the law; as though he said, &#8220;Though thou consented not to the
        vices of others, and seemest to be avowedly even an enemy and a reprover
        of vices; yet as thou art not free from them, if thou really examinest

      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kri&gt;nein</font
      ><font> and </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katakri&gt;nein</font
      ><font>
        (to judge and to condemn,) the enhancing of their sin ought to be
        noticed; for his mode of speaking is the same, as though he said,
        &#8220;Thou art doubly deserving of condemnation; for thou art guilty of
        the same vices which thou blamest and reprovest in others.&#8221; It is,
        indeed, a well-known saying, &#8212; that they who scrutinize the life
        of others lay claim themselves to innocence, temperance, and all
        virtues; and that those are not worthy of any indulgence who allow in
        themselves the same things which they undertake to correct in others. </font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>For thou, judging, doest the same things</i></font
      ><font
        >: so it is literally; but the meaning is, &#8220;Though thou judgest,
        thou yet doest the same things.&#8221; And he says that they
        <i>did</i> them, because they were not in a right state of mind; for sin
        properly belongs to the mind. They then condemned themselves on this
        account, &#8212; because, in reproving a thief, or an adulterer, or a
        slanderer, they did not merely condemn the persons, but those very vices
        which adhered to themselves. </font

        self-complacencies, that they may not think that they can really gain
        any thing, though they be applauded by the world, and though they regard
        themselves guiltless; for a far different trial awaits them in heaven.
        But as he charges them with inward impurity, which, being hid from the
        eyes of men, cannot be proved and convicted by human testimonies, he
        summons them to the tribunal of God, to whom darkness itself is not hid,
        and by whose judgment the case of sinners, be they willing or unwilling,
        must be determined.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>Moreover, </font><font color="Maroon"><i>the truth</i></font
      ><font>
        of judgment will in two ways appear, because God will punish sin without
        any respect of persons, in whomsoever it will be found; and he will not
        heed outward appearances, nor be satisfied with any outward work, except
        what has proceeded from real sincerity of heart. It hence follows, that
        the mask of feigned sanctity will not prevent him from visiting secret
        wickedness with judgment. It is, no doubt, a Hebrew idiom; for
        <i>truth</i> in Hebrew means often the inward integrity of the heart,
        and thus stands opposed not only to gross falsehood, but also to the
        outward appearance of good works. And then only are hypocrites awakened,
        when they are told that God will take an account, not only of their
        disguised righteousness, but also of their secret motives and feelings. </font

        etc. As rhetoricians teach us, that we ought not to proceed to give
        strong reproof before the crime be proved, Paul may seem to some to have
        acted unwisely here for having passed so severe a censure, when he had
        not yet proved the accusation which he had brought forward. But the fact
        is otherwise; for he adduced not his accusation before men, but appealed
        to the judgment of conscience; and thus he deemed that proved which he
        had in view &#8212; that they could not deny their iniquity, if they
        examined themselves and submitted to the scrutiny of God&#8217;s
        tribunal. And it was not without urgent necessity, that he with so much
        sharpness and severity rebuked their fictitious sanctity; for men of
        this class will with astonishing security trust in themselves, except
        their vain confidence be forcibly shaken from them. Let us then
        remember, that this is the best mode of dealing with hypocrisy, in order
        to awaken it from its inebriety, that is, to draw it forth to the light
        of God&#8217;s judgment.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>That thou shalt escape,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. This argument is drawn from the less; for since our sins are
        subject to the judgment of men, much more are they to that of God, who
        is the only true Judge of all. Men are indeed led by a divine instinct
        to condemn evil deeds; but this is only an obscure and faint resemblance
        of the divine judgment. They are then extremely besotted, who think that
        they can escape the judgment of God, though they allow not others to
        escape their own judgment. It is not without an emphatical meaning that
        he repeats the word man; it is for the purpose of presenting a
        comparison between man and God.</font
      ><br /><font><b>4.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Dost thou despise the riches?</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. It does not seem to me, as some think, that there is here an
        argument, conclusive on two grounds, (<i>dilemma</i>,) but an
        anticipation of an objection: for as hypocrites are commonly transported
        with prosperity, as though they had merited the Lord&#8217;s kindness by
        their good deeds, and become thus more hardened in their contempt of
        God, the Apostle anticipates their arrogance, and proves, by an argument
        taken from a reason of an opposite kind, that there is no ground for
        them to think that God, on account of their outward prosperity, is
        propitious to them, since the design of his benevolence is far
        different, and that is, to convert sinners to himself. Where then the
        fear of God does not rule, confidence, on account of prosperity, is a
        contempt and a mockery of his great goodness. It hence follows, that a
        heavier punishment will be inflicted on those whom God has in this life
        favored; because, in addition to their other wickedness, they have
        rejected the fatherly invitation of God. And though all the gifts of God
        are so many evidences of his paternal goodness, yet as he often has a
        different object in view, the ungodly absurdly congratulate themselves
        on their prosperity, as though they were dear to him, while he kindly
        and bountifully supports them.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Not knowing that the goodness of God</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> etc. For the Lord by his kindness shows to us, that it is he
        to whom we ought turn, if we desire to secure our wellbeing, and at the
        same time he strengthens our confidence in expecting mercy. If we use
        not God&#8217;s bounty for this end, we abuse it. But yet it is not to
        be viewed always in the same light; for when the Lord deals favorably
        with his servants and gives them earthly blessings, he makes known to
        them by symbols of this kind his own benevolence, and trains them up at
        the same time to seek the sum and substance of all good things in
        himself alone: when he treats the transgressors of his law with the same
        indulgence, his object is to soften by his kindness their perverseness;
        he yet does not testify that he is already propitious to them, but, on
        the contrary, invites them to repentance. But if any one brings this
        objection &#8212; that the Lord sings to the deaf as long as he does not
        touch inwardly their hearts; we must answer &#8212; that no fault can be
        found in this case except with our own depravity. But I prefer rendering
        the word which Paul here uses, <i>leads</i>, rather than
        <i>invites,</i> for it is more significant; I do not, however, take it
        in the sense of driving, but of leading as it were by the hand.</font

        openly provoke the Lord. </font

        here, but that the gifts of God also, which they continually enjoy,
        shall increase their condemnation; for an account of them all will be
        required: and it will then be found, that it will be justly imputed to
        them as an extreme wickedness, that they had been made worse through
        God&#8217;s bounty, by which they ought surely to have been improved.

        themselves, the stream of which shall then be poured on their heads:
        they accumulate hidden destruction, which then shall be drawn out from
        the treasures of God. The day of the last judgment is called the day of
        wrath, when a reference is made to the ungodly; but it will be a day of
        redemption to the faithful. And thus all other visitations of God are
        ever described as dreadful and full of terror to the ungodly; and on the
        contrary, as pleasant and joyful to the godly. Hence whenever the
        Scripture mentions the approach of the Lord, it bids the godly to exult
        with joy; but when it turns to the reprobate, it proclaims nothing but
        dread and terror.</font

        the Lord will then manifest his judgment: though he gives daily some
        indications of it, he yet suspends and holds back, till that day, the
        clear and full manifestation of it; for the books shall then be opened;
        the sheep shall then be separated the goats, and the wheat shall be
        cleansed from the tares.</font

        etc. As he had to do with blind saintlings, who thought that the
        wickedness of their hearts was well covered, provided it was spread over
        with some disguises, I know not what, of empty works, he pointed out the
        true character of the righteousness of works, even that which is of
        account before God; and he did this, lest they should feel confident
        that it was enough to pacify him, if they brought words and trifles, or
        leaves only. But there is not so much difficulty in this verse, as it is
        commonly thought. For the Lord, by visiting the wickedness of the
        reprobate with just vengeance, will recompense them with what they have
        deserved: and as he sanctifies those whom he has previously resolved to
        glorify, he will also crown their good works, but not on account of any
        merit: nor can this be proved from this verse; for though it declares
        what reward good works are to have, it does yet by no means show what
        they are worth, or what price is due to them. And it is an absurd
        inference, to deduce merit from reward.</font

        perseverance, when one is not wearied in constantly doing good; but
        patience also is required in the saints, by which they may continue
        firm, though oppressed with various trials. For Satan suffers them not
        by a free course to come to the Lord; but he strives by numberless
        hinderances to impede them, and to turn them aside from the right way.
        And when he says, that the faithful, by continuing in good works, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>seek glory and honor</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> he does not mean that they aspire after any thing else but the
        favor of God, or that they strive to attain any thing higher, or more
        excellent: but they can not seek him, without striving, at the same
        time, for the blessedness of his kingdom, the description of which is
        contained in the paraphrase given in these words. The meaning then is,
        &#8212; that the Lord will give eternal life to those who, by attention
        to good works, strive to attain immortality. </font

        account of its tenor being interrupted, for the thread of the discourse
        required, that the second clause of the contrast should be thus

        and whatever obedience they may pretend, yet they never cease perversely
        to clamor and struggle against God&#8217;s word. For as they who are
        openly wicked scoff at the truth, so hypocrites fear not to set up in
        opposition to it their artificial modes of worship. The Apostle further
        adds, that such disobedient persons </font

        observe, that of the four which are mentioned, the two last are, as it
        were, the effects of the two first; for they who perceive that God is

        as kindred, country, dignity, wealth, and similar things; so that
        respect of persons is to be here taken for the distinction or the

        But if any hence objects and says, &#8220;That then there is no such
        thing as the gratuitous election of God;&#8221; it may be answered, That
        there is a twofold acceptation of men before God; the first, when he
        chooses and calls us from nothing through gratuitous goodness, as there
        is nothing in our nature which can be approved by him; the second, when
        after having regenerated us, he confers on us his gifts, and shows favor
        to the image of his Son which he recognizes in us.</font

        etc. In the former part of this section he assails the Gentiles; though
        no Moses was given them to publish and to ratify a law from the Lord, he
        yet denies this omission to be a reason why they deserved not the just
        sentence of death for their sins; as though he had said &#8212; that the
        knowledge of a written law was not necessary for the just condemnation
        of a sinner. See then what kind of advocacy they undertake, who through
        misplaced mercy, attempt, on the ground of ignorance, to exempt the
        nations who have not the light of the gospel from the judgment of
        God.</font

        etc. This anticipates an objection which the Jews might have adduced. As
        they had heard that the law was the rule of righteousness, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050401&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Deuteronomy 4:1,) they gloried in the mere knowledge of it: to obviate
        this mistake, he declares that the hearing of the law or any knowledge
        of it is of no such consequence, that any one should on that account lay
        claim to righteousness, but that works must be produced, according to
        this saying, &#8220;He who will do these shall live in them.&#8221; The
        import then of this verse is the following, &#8212; &#8220;That if
        righteousness be sought from the law, the law must be fulfilled; for the
        righteousness of the law consists in the perfection of works.&#8221;
        They who pervert this passage for the purpose of building up
        justification by works, deserve most fully to be laughed at even by
        children. It is therefore improper and beyond what is needful, to
        introduce here a long discussion on the subject, with the view of
        exposing so futile a sophistry: for the Apostle only urges here on the
        Jews what he had mentioned, the decision of the law, &#8212; That by the
        law they could not be justified, except they fulfilled the law, that if
        they transgressed it, a curse was instantly pronounced on them. Now we
        do not deny but that perfect righteousness is prescribed in the law: but
        as all are convicted of transgression, we say that another righteousness
        must be sought. Still more, we can prove from this passage that no one
        is justified by works; for if they alone are justified by the law who
        fulfill the law, it follows that no one is justified; for no one can be
        found who can boast of having fulfilled the law. </font

        not think it enough to condemn us by mere assertion, and only to
        pronounce on us the just judgment of God; but he proceeds to prove this
        by reasons, in order to excite us to a greater desire for Christ, and to
        a greater love towards him. He indeed shows that ignorance is in vain
        pretended as an excuse by the Gentiles, since they prove by their own
        deeds that they have some rule of righteousness: for there is no nation
        so lost to every thing human, that it does not keep within the limits of
        some laws. Since then all nations, of themselves and without a monitor,
        are disposed to make laws for themselves, it is beyond all question
        evident that they have some notions of justice and rectitude, which the
        Greeks call preconceptions </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prolhyeiv</font
      ><font
        >, and which are implanted by nature in the hearts of men. They have
        then a law, though they are without law: for though they have not a
        written law, they are yet by no means wholly destitute of the knowledge
        of what is right and just; as they could not otherwise distinguish
        between vice and virtue; the first of which their restrain by
        punishment, and the latter they commend, and manifest their approbation
        of it by honoring it with rewards. He sets nature in opposition to a
        written law, meaning that the Gentiles had the natural light of
        righteousness, which supplied the place of that law by which the Jews
        were instructed, so that they were a law to themselves. </font

        discrimination and judgment by which they distinguish between what is
        just and unjust, between what is honest and dishonest. He means not that
        it was so engraven on their will, that they sought and diligently
        pursued it, but that they were so mastered by the power of truth, that
        they could not disapprove of it. For why did they institute religious
        rites, except that they were convinced that God ought to be worshipped?

        All the Gentiles alike instituted religious rites, they made laws to
        punish adultery, and theft, and murder, they commended good faith in
        bargains and contracts. They have thus indeed proved, that God ought to
        be worshipped, that adultery, and theft, and murder are evils, that
        honesty is commendable. It is not to our purpose to inquire what sort of
        God they imagined him to be, or how many gods they devised; it is enough
        to know, that they thought that there is a God, and that honor and
        worship are due to him. It matters not whether they permitted the
        coveting of another man&#8217;s wife, or of his possessions, or of any
        thing which was his, &#8212; whether they connived at wrath and hatred;

        testimony of their own conscience, which is equal to a thousand
        witnesses. By the consciousness of having done good, men sustain and
        comfort themselves; those who are conscious of having done evil, are
        inwardly harassed and tormented. Hence came these sayings of the
        heathens &#8212; &#8220;A good conscience is the widest sphere; but a
        bad one is the cruelest executioner, and more fiercely torments the
        ungodly than any furies can do.&#8221; There is then a certain knowledge
        of the law by nature, which says, &#8220;This is good and worthy of

        Lord; not that it will then first commence, for it is now continually
        carried on, but that it will then also be in operation; and he says
        this, that no one should disregard this process, as though it were vain
        and evanescent. And he has put, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>in the day,</i></font

        Most suitable to the present occasion is this periphrastic definition of
        judgment: it teaches those, who willfully hide themselves in the
        recesses of insensibility, that the most secret thoughts and those now
        completely hid in the depths of their hearts, shall then be brought
        forth to the light. So he speaks in another place; in order to show to
        the Corinthians what little value belongs to human judgment, which
        regards only the outward action, he bids them to wait until the Lord
        came, who would bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal
        the secrets of the heart. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460405&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >1 Corinthians 4:5) When we hear this, let it come to our minds, that we

      <font>He adds, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>according to my gospel,</i></font
      ><font>
        intimating, that he announced a doctrine, to which the judgments of men,
        naturally implanted in them, gave a response: and he calls it
        <i>his </i>gospel, on account of the ministry; for the authority for
        setting forth the gospel resides in the true God alone; and it was only
        the dispensing of it that was committed to the Apostles. It is indeed no
        matter of surprise, that the gospel is in part called the messenger and
        the announcer of future judgment: for if the fulfillment and completion
        of what it promises be deferred to the full revelation of the heavenly
        kingdom, it must necessarily be connected with the last judgment: and
        further, Christ cannot be preached without being a resurrection to some,
        and a destruction to others; and both these things have a reference to
        the day of judgment. The words, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>through Jesus Christ</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> I apply to the day of judgment, though they are regarded
        otherwise by some; and the meaning is, &#8212; that the Lord will
        execute judgment by Christ, for he is appointed by the Father to be the
        Judge of the living and of the dead, &#8212; which the Apostles always
        mention among the main articles of the gospel. Thus the sentence will be
        full and complete, which would otherwise be defective.</font

        Josephus<i>,</i> in the eleventh book of his Antiquities, thinks that it
        gas taken from Judas Maccab&aelig;us, under whose auspices the liberty
        and honor of the people, after having for some time fallen, and been
        almost buried, revived again. Though I allow this opinion to be
        probable, yet, if there be some to whom it is not satisfactory, I will
        offer them a conjecture of my own. It seems, indeed, very likely, that
        after having been degraded and scattered through so many disasters, they
        were not able to retain any certain distinction as to their tribes; for
        a census could not have been made at that time, nor did there exist a
        regular government, which was necessary to preserve an order of this
        kind; and they dwelt scattered and in disorder; and having been worn out
        by adversities, they were no doubt less attentive to the records of
        their kindred. But though you may not grant these things to me, yet it
        cannot be denied but that a danger of this kind was connected with such
        disturbed state of things. Whether, then, they meant to provide for the
        future, or to remedy an evil already received, they all, I think assumed
        the name of that tribe, in which the purity of religion remained the
        longest, and which, by a peculiar privilege, excelled all the rest, as
        from it the Redeemer was expected to come; for it was their refuge in
        all extremities, to console themselves with the expectation of the
        Messiah. However this may be, by the name of Jews they avowed themselves
        to be the heirs of the covenant which the Lord had made with Abraham and
        his seed.</font

        etc. He means not that they rested in attending to the law, as though
        they applied their minds to the keeping of it; but, on the contrary, he
        reproves them for not observing the end for which the law had been
        given; for they had no care for its observance, and were inflated on
        this account only, &#8212; because they were persuaded that the oracles
        of God belonged to them. In the same way they<i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>gloried in God</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> not as the Lord commands by his Prophet, &#8212; to humble

      ><font
        >Jeremiah 9:24,) &#8212; but being without any knowledge of God&#8217;s
        goodness, they made him, of whom they were inwardly destitute,
        peculiarly their own, and assumed to be his people, for the purpose of
        vain ostentation before men. This, then, was not the glorying of the
        heart, but the boasting of the tongue.</font

        and the approval of things useful; and this they had attained from the
        doctrine of the law. But there is a twofold approval, &#8212; one of
        choice, when we embrace the good we approve; the other of judgment, by
        which indeed we distinguish good from evil, but by no means strive or
        desire to follow it. Thus the Jews were so learned in the law that they
        could pass judgment on the conduct of others, but were not careful to
        regulate their life according to that judgment. But as Paul reproves
        their hypocrisy, we may, on the other hand, conclude, that excellent
        things are then only rightly approved (provided our judgment proceeds
        from sincerity) when God is attended to; for his will, as it is revealed
        in the law, is here appointed as the guide and teacher of what is to be
        justly approved. </font

        sufficient for themselves, but also that by which they could enrich
        others. He grants, indeed, that they had such abundance of learning, as

        teaching, and what is commonly called display; and it certainly appears
        that they were destitute of that knowledge which they pretended. But
        Paul, by indirectly ridiculing the perverted use of the law, intimates,
        on the other hand, that right knowledge must be sought from the law, in
        order that the truth may have a solid basis.</font

        Though the excellencies (<i>encomia</i> &#8212; commendations) which he
        has hitherto stated respecting the Jews, were such as might have justly
        adorned them, provided the higher ornaments were not wanting; yet as
        they included qualifications of a neutral kind, which may be possessed
        even by the ungodly and corrupted by abuse, they are by no means
        sufficient to constitute true glory. And hence Paul, not satisfied with
        merely reproving and taunting their arrogance in trusting in these
        things alone, employs them for the purpose of enhancing their
        disgraceful conduct; for he exposes himself to no ordinary measure of
        reproach, who not only renders useless the gifts of God, which are
        otherwise valuable and excellent, but by his wickedness vitiates and
        contaminates them. And a strange counselor is he, who consults not for
        his own good, and is wise only for the benefit of others. He shows then
        that the praise which they appropriated to themselves, turned out to
        their own disgrace.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Thou who preachest, steal not,</i></font

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195016&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Psalm 50:16, where God says to the wicked, &#8220;Why dost thou declare
        my statutes, and takest my covenant in thy mouth? And thou hatest
        reform, and hast cast my words behind thee: when thou seest a thief,
        thou joinest him, and with adulterers is thy portion.&#8221; And as this
        reproof was suitable to the Jews in old time, who, relying on the mere
        knowledge of the law, lived in no way better than if they had no law; so
        we must take heed, lest it should be turned against us at this day: and
        indeed it may be well applied to many, who, boasting of some
        extraordinary knowledge of the gospel, abandon themselves to every kind
        of uncleanness, as though the gospel were not a rule of life. That we
        may not then so heedlessly trifle with the Lord, let us remember what
        sort of judgment impends over such prattlers, (<i>logod&#339;dalis</i>
        &#8212; word-artificers,) who make a show of God&#8217;s word by mere
        garrulity.</font
      ><br /><font><b>22.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Thou who abhorrest idols,</i></font

        etc. He fitly compares sacrilege to idolatry, as it is a thing of the
        same kind; for sacrilege is simply a profanation of the Divine Majesty,
        a sin not unknown to heathen poets. On this account
        <i>Ovid </i>(Metamor. 3,) calls<i> Lycurgus</i> sacrilegious for
        despising the rites of Bacchus; and in his <i>Fasti</i> he calls those
        sacrilegious hands which violated the majesty of Venus. But as the
        Gentiles ascribed the majesty of their gods to idols, they only thought
        it a sacrilege when any one plundered what was dedicated to their
        temples, in which, as they believed, the whole of religion centered. So
        at this day, where superstition reigns, and not the word of God, they
        acknowledge no other kind of sacrilege than the stealing of what belongs
        to churches, as there is no God but in idols, no religion but in pomp
        and magnificence. </font

        as they avowed God as their Lawgiver, and yet had no care to form their
        life according to his rule, they clearly proved that the majesty of
        their God was not so regarded by them, but that they easily despised
        him. In the same manner do they at this day dishonor Christ, by
        transgressing the gospel, who prattle idly about its doctrine, while yet
        they tread it under foot by their unbridled and licentious mode of

        &#8220;Since the Prophet upbraided, not without cause, the Jews of his
        time, that on account of their captivity, the glory and power of God
        were ridiculed among the Gentiles, as though he could not have preserved
        the people, whom he had taken under his protection, much more are ye a
        disgrace and dishonor to God, whose religion, being judged of by your
        wicked life, is blasphemed.&#8221; This view I do not reject, but I
        prefer a simpler one, such as the following, &#8212; &#8220;We see that
        all the reproaches cast on the people of Israel do fall on the name of
        God; for as they are counted, and are said to be the people of God, his
        name is as it were engraven on their foreheads: it must hence be, that
        God, whose name they assume, is in a manner defamed by men, through
        their wicked conduct.&#8221; It was then a monstrous thing, that they
        who derived their glory from God should have disgraced his holy name;
        for it behoved them surely to requite him in a different manner. </font

        objected in opposition to him in the defense of their own cause: for
        since circumcision was a symbol of the Lord&#8217;s covenant, by which
        he had chosen Abraham and his seed as his peculiar people, they seemed
        not to have gloried in vain; but as they neglected what the sign
        signified, and regarded only the outward form, he gives this answer
        &#8212; That they had no reason to lay claim to any thing on account of
        the bare sign. The true character of circumcision was a spiritual
        promise, which required faith: the Jews neglected both, the promise as
        well as faith. Then foolish was their confidence. Hence it is, that he
        omits to state here the main use of circumcision, and proceeds to expose
        their gross error, as he does in his Epistle to the Galatians. And this
        ought to be carefully noticed; for if he were explaining the whole
        character and design of circumcision, it would have been inconsistent in
        him not to have made mention of grace and free promise: but in both
        instances he spoke according to what the subject he had in hand
        required, and therefore he only discussed that part which was
        controverted.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >They thought that circumcision was of itself sufficient for the purpose
        of obtaining righteousness. Hence, speaking according to such an
        opinion, he gives this reply &#8212; That if this benefit be expected
        from circumcision, it is on this condition, that he who is circumcised,
        must serve God wholly and perfectly. Circumcision then requires
        perfection. The same may be also said of our baptism: when any one
        confidently relies on the water of baptism alone, and thinks that he is
        justified, as though he had obtained holiness by that ordinance itself,
        the end of baptism must be adduced as an objection; which is, that the
        Lord thereby calls us to holiness of life: the grace and promise, which
        baptism testifies (<i>testificatur</i>) and seals, (<i>obsignat,</i>)
        need not in this case to be mentioned; for our business is with those
        who, being satisfied with the empty shadow of baptism, care not for nor
        consider what is material (<i>solidum</i> &#8212; substantial) in it.
        And this very thing you may observe in Paul &#8212; that when he speaks
        to the faithful of signs, apart from controversy, he connects them with
        the efficacy and fulfillment of the promises which belong to them; but
        when he contends with the absurd and unskillful interpreters of signs,
        he omits all mention of the proper and true character of signs, and
        directs his whole discourse against their perverted
        interpretation.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Now many, seeing that Paul brings forward circumcision rather than any
        other part of the law, suppose that he takes away justification only
        from ceremonies: but the matter is far otherwise; for it always happens,
        that those who dare to set up their own merits against the righteousness
        of God, glory more in outward observances than in real goodness; for no
        one, who is seriously touched and moved by the fear of God, will ever
        dare to raise up his eyes to heaven, since the more he strives after
        true righteousness, the clearer he sees how far he is from it. But as to
        the Pharisees, who were satisfied with imitating holiness by an outward
        disguise, it is no wonder that they so easily deluded themselves. Hence
        Paul, after having left the Jews nothing, but this poor subterfuge of
        being justified by circumcision, does now also take from them even this
        empty pretense.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>If then the uncircumcision,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. This is a very strong argument. Every thing is below its end and
        subordinate to it. Circumcision looks to the law, and must therefore be
        inferior to it: it is then a greater thing to keep the law than
        circumcision, which was for its sake instituted. It hence follows, that
        the uncircumcised, provided he keeps the law, far excels the Jew with
        his barren and unprofitable circumcision, if he be a transgressor of the
        law: and though he is by nature polluted, he shall yet be so sanctified
        by keeping the law, that uncircumcision shall be imputed to him for
        circumcision. The word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>uncircumcision,</i></font
      ><font>
        is to be taken in its proper sense in the second clause; but in the
        first, figuratively, for the Gentiles, the thing for the persons.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It must be added &#8212; that no one ought anxiously to inquire what
        observers of the law are those of which Paul speaks here, inasmuch no
        such can be found; for he simply intended to lay down a supposed case
        &#8212; that if any Gentile could be found who kept the law, his
        righteousness would be of more value without circumcision, than the
        circumcision of the Jew without righteousness. And hence I refer what
        follows, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>And what is by nature uncircumcision shall judge thee</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> etc., not to persons, but to the case that is supposed,
        according to what is said of the Queen of the south, that she shall
        come, etc., (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401242&gt;</font></sup
      ><font

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421132&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Luke 11:32) For the very words of Paul lead us to this view &#8212;
        &#8220;The Gentile,&#8221; he says, &#8220;being a keeper of the law,
        shall judge thee who art a transgressor, though he is uncircumcised, and
        thou hast the literal circumcision.&#8221;</font

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f85</font></sup
      ><font>
        which means a literal circumcision. He does not mean that they violated
        the law, because they had the literal circumcision; but because they
        continued, though they had the outward rite, to neglect the spiritual
        worship of God, even piety, justice, judgment, and truth, which are the
        chief matters of the law. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f86</font></sup

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For a Jew is not he</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> etc. The meaning is, that a real Jew is not to be ascertained,
        either by natural descent, or by profession, or by an external symbol;
        that the circumcision which constitutes a Jew, does not consist in an
        outward sign only, but that both are inward. And what he subjoins with
        regard to true circumcision, is taken from various passages of
        Scripture, and even from its general teaching; for the people are
        everywhere commanded to circumcise their hearts, and it is what the Lord
        promises to do. The fore-skin was cut off, not indeed as the small
        corruption of one part, but as that of the whole nature. Circumcision
        then signified the mortification of the whole flesh.</font
      ><br /><font><b>29.</b> What he then adds, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>in the spirit, not in the letter</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> understand thus: He calls the outward rite, without piety,
        the</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> letter</i></font
      ><font><i>,</i> and the spiritual design of this rite, the</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> spirit</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>;</i> for the whole importance of signs and rites depends on what is
        designed; when the end in view is not regarded, the letter alone
        remains, which in itself is useless. And the reason for this mode of
        speaking is this, &#8212; where the voice of God sounds, all that he
        commands, except it be received by men in sincerity of heart, will
        remain in the letter, that is, in the dead writing; but when it
        penetrates into the heart, it is in a manner transformed into spirit.
        And there is an allusion to the difference between the old and the new
        covenant, which Jeremiah points out in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243133&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Jeremiah 31:33; where the Lord declares that his covenant would be firm
        and permanent when engraven on the inward parts. Paul had also the same
        thing in view in another place, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >2 Corinthians 3:6,) where he compares the law with the gospel, and
        calls the former &#8220;the letter,&#8221; which is not only dead but
        killeth; and the latter he signalizes with the title of
        &#8220;spirit.&#8221; But extremly gross has been the folly of those who
        have deduced a double meaning from the &#8220;letter,&#8221; and
        allegories from the &#8220;spirit.&#8221;</font

        denies that we ought to be satisfied with what is commendable in the
        estimation of men, who are often deceived by outward splendor; but that
        we ought to be satisfied with the all-seeing eyes of God, from which the
        deepest secrets of the heart are not hid. He thus again summons
        hypocrites, who soothe themselves with false opinions, to the tribunal
        of God.</font

        nothing to the Jews, yet since he could not deny but that there was some
        difference between the Gentiles and the Jesus, which by that symbol was
        sealed to them by the Lord, and since it was inconsistent to make a
        distinction, of which God was the author, void and of no moment, it
        remained for him to remove also this objection. It was indeed evident,
        that it was a foolish glorying in which the Jews on this account
        indulged; yet still a doubt remained as to the design of circumcision;
        for the Lord would not have appointed it had not some benefit been
        intended. He therefore, by way of an objection, asks, what it was that
        made the Jew superior to the Gentile; and he subjoins a reason for this
        by another question, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>What is the benefit of circumcision</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>? </i>For this separated the Jews from the common class of men; it

        etc.; that is, very much. He begins here to give the sacrament its own
        praise; but he concedes not, that on this account the Jews ought to have
        been proud; for when he teaches that they were sealed by the symbol of
        circumcision, by which they were counted the children of God, he does
        not allow that they became superior to others through any merit or
        worthiness of their own, but through the free mercy of God. If then
        regard be had to them as men, he shows that they were on a level with
        others; but if the favors of God be taken to the account, he admits that
        they possessed what made them more eminent than other men.</font

        sets down what he does not afterwards complete. But the word
        <i>first </i>seems not to me to be a note of number, but means
        chiefly&#8221; or especially, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f88</font></sup
      ><font>
        and is to be taken in this sense &#8212; &#8220;Though it were but this
        one thing, that they have the oracles </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f89</font></sup
      ><font>
        of God committed to them, it might be deemed sufficient to prove their
        superiority.&#8221; And it is worthy of being noticed, that the
        advantage of circumcision is not made to consist in the naked sign, but
        its value is derived from the word; for Paul asks here what benefit the
        sacrament conferred on the Jews, and he answers, that God had deposited
        with them the treasure of celestial wisdom. It hence follows, that,
        apart from the word, no excellency remained. By
        <i>oracles</i> he means the covenant which God revealed first to Abraham
        and to his posterity, and afterwards sealed and unfolded by the law and
        the Prophets.</font

        But if this benefit was to be so highly esteemed when the Lord favored
        one nation only with the revelation of his word, we can never

        naked sign, he allowed them no not even a spark of glory; so now, while
        considering the nature of the sign, he testifies that its virtue (<i

        >) is not destroyed, no, not even by their inconstancy. As then he
        seemed before to have intimated that whatever grace there might have
        been in the sign of circumcision, it had wholly vanished through the
        ingratitude of the Jews, he now, anticipating an objection, again asks
        what opinion was to be formed of it. There is here indeed a sort of
        reticence, as he expresses less than what he intended to be understood;
        for he might have truly said that a great part of the nation had
        renounced the covenant of God; but as this would have been very grating
        to the ears of the Jews, he mitigated its severity, and mentioned only
        some.</font

        is properly to render void and ineffectual; a meaning most suitable to
        this passage. For Paul&#8217;s inquiry is not so much whether the
        unbelief of men neutralizes the truth of God, so that it should not in
        itself remain firm and constant, but whether it hinders its effect and
        fulfillment as to men. The meaning then is, &#8220;Since most of the
        Jews are covenant-breakers, is God&#8217;s covenant so abrogated by
        their perfidiousness that it brings forth no fruit among them? To this
        he answers, that it cannot be that the truth of God should lose its
        stability through man&#8217;s wickedness. Though then the greater part
        had nullified and trodden under foot God&#8217;s covenant, it yet
        retained its efficacy and manifested its power, not indeed as to all,
        but with regard to a few of that nation: and it is then efficacious when
        the grace or the blessing of the Lord avails to eternal salvation. But
        this cannot be, except when the promise is received by faith; for it is
        in this way that a mutual covenant is on both sides confirmed. He then
        means that some ever remained in that nation, who by continuing to
        believe in the promise, had not fallen away from the privileges of the
        covenant.</font
      ><br /><font><b>4.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But let God be true</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>etc. Whatever may be the opinion of others, I regard this as
        an argument taken from the necessary consequence of what is opposed to
        it, by which Paul invalidates the preceding objection. For since these
        two things stand together, yea, necessarily accord, that God is true and
        that man is false, it follows that the truth of God is not nullified by
        the falsehood of men; for except he did now set those two things in
        opposition, the one to the other, he would afterwards have in vain
        labored to refute what was absurd, and show how God is just, though he
        manifests his justice by our unjustice. Hence the Leaning is by no I
        means ambiguous, &#8212; that the faithfulness of God is so far from
        being nullified by the perfidy and apostasy of men that it thereby
        becomes more evident. &#8220;<i>God</i>,&#8221; he says, &#8220;<i
          >is true,</i
        >
        not only because he is prepared to stand faithfully to his promises, but
        because he also really fulfills whatever he declares; for he so speaks,
        that his command becomes a reality. On the other hand,
        <i>man is false,</i> not only because he often violates his pledged
        faith, but because he naturally seeks falsehood and shuns the
        truth.&#8221;</font

      <font
        >Now this is a remarkable passage, and contains a consolation that is
        much needed; for such is the perversity of men in rejecting and
        despising God&#8217;s word, that its truth would be often doubted were
        not this to come to our minds, that God&#8217;s verity depends not on
        man&#8217;s verity. But how I does this agree with what has been said
        previously &#8212; that in order to make the divine promise effectual,
        faith, which receives it, is on the part of men necessary? for faith
        stands opposed to falsehood. This seems, indeed, to be a difficult
        question; but it may with no great difficulty be answered, and in this
        way &#8212; the Lord, notwithstanding the lies of men, and though these
        are hinderances to his truth, does yet find a way for it through a
        pathless track, that he may come forth a conqueror, and that is, by
        correcting in his elect the inbred unbelief of our nature, and by
        subjecting to his service those who seem to be unconquerable. It must be
        added, that the discourse here is concerning the corruption of nature,
        and not the grace of God, which is the remedy for that corruption.</font

    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>That thou mightest be justified,</i></font

        etc. The sense is, So for is it that the truth of God is destroyed by
        our falsehood and unfaithfulness, that it thereby shines forth and
        appears more evident, according to the testimony of David, who says,
        that as he was sinner, God was a just and righteous Judge in whatever he
        determined respecting him, and that he would overcome all the calumnies
        of the ungodly who murmured against his righteousness. By the
        <i>words</i> of God, David means the judgments which he pronounces upon
        us; for the common application of these to promises is too strained: and
        so the particle <i>that, </i>is not so much final, nor refers to a
        far-fetched consequence, but implies an inference according to this
        purport, &#8220;Against thee have I sinned; justly then dost thou punish
        me.&#8221; And that Paul has quoted this passage according to the proper
        and real meaning of David, is clear from the objection that is
        immediately added, &#8220;How shall the righteousness of God remain
        perfect if our iniquity illustrates it?&#8221; For in vain, as I have
        already observed, and unseasonable has Paul arrested the attention of
        his readers with this difficulty, except David meant, that God, in his
        wonderful providence, elicited from the sins of men a praise to his own
        righteousness. The second clause in Hebrew is this, &#8220;And that thou
        mightest be pure in thy judgment;&#8221; which expression imports
        nothing else but that God in all his judgments is worthy of praise, how
        much soever the ungodly may clamor and strive by their complaints
        disgracefully to efface his glory. But Paul has followed the Greek
        version, which answered his purpose here even better. We indeed know
        that the Apostles in quoting Scripture often used a freer language than
        the original; for they counted it enough to quote what was suitable to
        their subject: hence they made no great account of words.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >The application then of this passage is the following: Since all the

        etc. Though this is a digression from the main subject, it was yet
        necessary for the Apostle to introduce it, lest he should seem to give
        to the ill-disposed an occasion to speak evil, which he knew would be
        readily laid hold on by them. For since they were watching for every
        opportunity to defame the gospel, they had, in the testimony of David,
        what they might have taken for the purpose of founding a calumny,
        &#8212; &#8220;If God seeks nothing else, but to be glorified by men,
        why does he punish them, when they offend, since by offending they
        glorify him? Without cause then surely is he offended, if he derives the
        reason of his displeasure from that by which he is glorified.&#8221;
        There is, indeed, no doubt, but that this was an ordinary, and
        everywhere a common calumny, as it will presently appear. Hence Paul
        could not have covertly passed it by; but that no one should think that
        he expressed the sentiments of his own mind, he premises that he assumes
        the person of the ungodly; and at the same time, he sharply, touches, by
        a single expression, on human reason; whose work, as he intimates, is
        ever to bark against the wisdom of God; for he says not,
        &#8220;according to the ungodly,&#8221; but &#8220;according to
        man,&#8221; or as man. And thus indeed it is, for all the mysteries of
        God are paradoxes to the flesh: and at the same tine it possesses so
        much audacity, that it fears not to oppose them and insolently to assail
        what it cannot comprehend. We are hence reminded, that if we desire to
        become capable of understanding them, we must especially labor to become
        freed from our own reason, (<i>proprio sensu</i>) and to give up
        ourselves, and unreservedly to submit to his word. &#8212; The word
        <i>wrath,</i> taken here for judgment, refers to punishment; as though
        he said, &#8220;Is God unjust, who punishes those sins which set forth
        his righteousness?&#8221;</font
      ><br /><font><b>6.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>By no means,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. In checking this blasphemy he gives not a direct reply to the
        objection, but begins with expressing his abhorrence of it, lest the
        Christian religion should even appear to include absurdities so great.
        And this is more weighty than if he adopted a simple denial; for he
        implies, that this impious expression deserved to be regarded with
        horror, and not to be heard. He presently subjoins what may be called an
        indirect refutation; for he does not distinctly refute the calumny, but
        gives only this reply, &#8212; that the objection was absurd. Moreover,
        he takes an argument from an office which belongs to God, by which he
        proves it to be in possible, &#8212; </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>God shall judge the world</i></font

        own righteousness, and to reduce to the best order whatever there is in
        it out of order: he cannot then determine any thing unjustly.&#8221; And

        Since, then, he is by nature judge, it must be that he is just, for he
        cannot deny himself. Paul then proves from what is impossible, that God
        is absurdly accused of unrighteousness; for to him peculiarly and
        naturally belongs the work of justly governing the world. And though
        what Paul teaches extends to the constant government of God, yet I allow
        that it has a special reference to the last judgment; for then only a
        real restoration of just order will take place. But if you wish for a
        direct refutation, by which profane things of this kind may be checked,
        take this, and say, &#8220;That it comes not through what
        unrighteousness is, that God&#8217;s righteousness becomes more
        illustrious, but that our wickedness is so surpassed by God&#8217;s

        becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more
        glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to
        display God&#8217;s glory, should be punished as a sinner.&#8221; </font

        ><i>,</i> etc. This is an elliptical sentence, in which a word is to be
        understood. It will be complete, if you read it thus, &#8212; &#8220;and
        why is it not rather said, (as we are reproached, etc.) that we are to
        do evils, that good things may come?&#8221; But the Apostle deigns not
        to answer the slander; which yet we may check by the most solid reason.
        The pretense, indeed, is this, &#8212; &#8220;If God is by our iniquity
        glorified, and if nothing can be done by man in this life more befitting
        than to promote the glory of God, then let us sin to advance his
        glory!&#8221; Now the answer to this is evident, &#8212; &#8220;That
        evil cannot of itself produce anything but evil; and that God&#8217;s
        glory is through our sin illustrated, is not the work of man, but the
        work of God; who, as a wonderful worker, knows how to overcome our
        wickedness, and to convert it to another end, so as to turn it contrary
        to what we intend, to the promotion of his own glory.&#8221; God has
        prescribed to us the way, by which he would have himself to be glorified
        by us, even by true piety, which consists in obedience to his word. He
        who leaps over this boundary, strives not to honor God, but to dishonor
        him. That it turns out otherwise, is to be ascribed to the Providence of
        God, and not to the wickedness of man; through which it comes not, that
        the majesty of God is not injured, nay, wholly overthrown </font

        >(<i>As we are reproached,)</i> etc. Since Paul speaks so reverently of
        the secret judgments of God, it is a wonder that his enemies should have
        fallen into such wantonness as to calumniate him: but there has never
        been so much reverence and seriousness displayed by God&#8217;s servants
        as to be sufficient to check impure and virulent tongues. It is not then
        a new thing, that adversaries at this day load with so many false
        accusations, and render odious our doctrine, which we ourselves know to
        be the pure gospel of Christ, and all the angels, as well as the
        faithful, are our witnesses. Nothing can be imagined more monstrous than
        what we read here was laid to the charge of Paul, to the end, that his
        preaching might be rendered hateful to the inexperienced. Let us then
        bear this evil, when the ungodly abuse the truth which we preach by
        their calumnies: nor let us cease, on this account, constantly to defend
        the genuine confession of it, inasmuch as it has sufficient power to
        crush and to dissipate their falsehoods. Let us, at the same time,
        according to the Apostle&#8217;s example, oppose, as much as we can, all
        malicious subtilties, (<i>technis</i> &#8212; crafts, wiles,) that the
        base and the abandoned may not, without some check, speak evil of our
        Creator.</font

        Some take this in an active sense, as signifying that Paul so far
        assents to them, that what they objected was absurd, in order that the
        doctrine of the gospel might not be thought to be connected with such
        paradoxes: but I approve more of the passive meaning; for it would not
        have been suitable simply to express an approval of such a wickedness,
        which, on the contrary, deserved to be severely condemned; and this is
        what Paul seems to me to have done. And their perverseness was, on two
        accounts, to be condemned, &#8212; first, because this impiety had
        gained the assent of their minds; and secondly, because, in traducing
        the gospel, they dared to draw from it their calumny. </font

        Jews should object that they were deprived of their right, as he had
        mentioned those distinctions of honor, for which they thought themselves
        superior to the Gentiles, he now at length replies to the question
        &#8212; in what respect they excelled the Gentiles. And though his
        answer seems in appearance to militate against what he had said before,
        (for he now strips those of all dignity to whom he had attributed so
        much,) there is yet no discord; for those privileges in which he allowed
        them to be eminent, were separate from themselves, and dependent on
        God&#8217;s goodness, and not on their own merit: but here he makes
        inquiry as to their own worthiness, whether they could glory in any
        respect in themselves. Hence the two answers he gives so agree together,
        that the one follows from the other; for while he extols their
        privileges, by including them among the free benefits of God, he shows
        that they had nothing of their own. Hence, what he now answers might
        have been easily inferred; for since it was their chief superiority,
        that God&#8217;s oracles were deposited with them, and they had it not
        through their own merit, there was nothing left for them, on account of
        which they could glory before God. Now mark the holy contrivance (<i
          >sanctum artificium</i
        >) which he adopts; for when he ascribes pre-eminency to them, he speaks
        in the third person; but when he strips them of all things, he puts
        himself among them, that he might avoid giving offense.</font

        for an accuser in an action is said to charge a crime, which he is
        prepared to substantiate by testimonies and other proofs. Now the
        Apostle had summoned all mankind universally before the tribunal of God,
        that he might include all under the same condemnation: and it is to no
        purpose for any one to object, and say that the Apostle here not only
        brings a charge, but more especially proves it; for a charge is not true
        except it depends on solid and strong evidences, according to what
        <i>Cicero </i>says, who, in a certain place, distinguishes between a
        charge and a slander. We must add, that to be under sin means that we
        are justly condemned as sinners before God, or that we are held under
        the curse which is due to sin; for as righteousness brings with it
        absolution, so sin is followed by condemnation.</font

        he repeats again, in other words, what we have noticed at the beginning
        &#8212; that every wickedness flows from a disregard of God: for as the
        principal part of wisdom is the fear of God, when we depart from that,
        there remains in us nothing right or pure. In short, as it is a bridle
        to restrain our wickedness, so when it is wanting, we feel at liberty to
        indulge every kind of licentiousness.</font

        looking on them all in their different conditions, could not find a
        righteous man, no, not one. It then follows, that this evil pervaded
        mankind universally; for nothing is hid from the sight of God. He speaks
        indeed at the end of the Psalm of the redemption of Israel: but we shall
        presently show how men become holy, and how far they are exempt from
        this condition. In the other Psalms he speaks of the treachery of his
        enemies, while he was exhibiting in himself and in his descendants a
        type of the kingdom of Christ: hence we have in his adversaries the
        representatives of all those, who being alienated from Christ, are not
        led by his Spirit. Isaiah expressly mentions Israel; and therefore his
        charge applies with still greater force against the Gentiles. What,
        then? There is no doubt but that the character of men is described in
        those words, in order that we may see what man is when left to himself;
        for Scripture testifies that all men are in this state, who are not
        regenerated by the grace of God. The condition of the saints would be
        nothing better, were not this depravity corrected in them: and that they
        may still remember that they differ nothing from others by nature, they
        do find in the relics of their flesh (by which they are always
        encompassed) the seeds of those evils, which would constantly produce
        fruits, were they not prevented by being mortified; and for this
        mortification they are indebted to God&#8217;s mercy and not to their
        own nature. We may add, that though all the vices here enumerated are
        not found conspicuously in every individual, yet they may be justly and

        to the Jews; for he had a much more difficult work in subduing them,
        because they, though no less destitute of true righteousness than the
        Gentiles, yet covered themselves with the cloak of God&#8217;s covenant,
        as though it was a sufficient holiness to them to have been separated
        from the rest of the world by the election of God. And he indeed
        mentions those evasions which he well understood the Jews were ready to
        bring forward; for whatever was said in the law unfavorably of mankind,
        they usually applied to the Gentiles, as though they were exempt from
        the common condition of men, and no doubt they would have been so, had
        they not fallen from their own dignity. Hence, that no false conceit as
        to their own worthiness should be a hinderance to them, and that they
        might not confine to the Gentiles alone what applied to them in common
        with others, Paul here anticipates them, and shows, from what Scripture
        declares, that they were not only blended with the multitude, but that
        condemnation was peculiarly denounced on them. And we indeed see the
        discretion of the Apostle in undertaking to refute these objections; for
        to whom but to the Jews had the law been given, and to whose instruction
        but theirs ought it to have served? What then it states respecting
        others is as it were accidental; or as they say, parergon, an appendage;
        but it applies its teaching mainly to its own disciples.</font

        occasion for excuse. It is a metaphor taken from courts of law, where
        the accused, if he has anything to plead as a lawful defense, demands
        leave to speak, that he might clear himself from the things laid to his
        charge; but if he is convicted by his own conscience, he is silent, and
        without saying a word waits for his condemnation, being even already by
        his own silence condemned. Of the same meaning is this saying in </font

      ><font

        that though he was not altogether without some kind of excuse, he would
        yet cease to justify himself, and submit to the sentence of God. The
        next clause contains the explanation; for his mouth is stopped, who is
        so fast held by the sentence of condemnation, that he can by no means
        escape. According to another sense, to be silent before the Lord is to
        tremble at his majesty, and to stand mute, being astonished at his
        brightness. </font

        works of the law mean. Some extend them to the observance of the whole
        law, while others confine them to the ceremonies alone. The addition of
        the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>law</i></font
      ><font>
        induced Chrysostom<i>, </i>Origen<i>n</i>, and Jerome to assent to the
        latter opinion; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f106</font></sup
      ><font>
        for they thought that there is a peculiar intimation in this appendage,
        that the expression should not be understood as including all works. But
        this difficulty may be very easily removed: for seeing works are so far
        just before God as we seek by them to render to him worship and
        obedience, in order expressly to take away the power of justifying from
        all works, he has mentioned those, if there be any, which can possibly
        justify; for the law hath promises, without which there would be no
        value in our works before God. You hence see the reason why Paul
        expressly mentioned the works of the law; for it is by the law that a
        reward is apportioned to works. Nor was this unknown to the schoolmen,
        who held it as an approved and common maxim, that works have no
        intrinsic worthiness, but become meritorious by covenant. And though
        they were mistaken, inasmuch as they saw not that works are ever
        polluted with vices, which deprive them of any merit, yet this principle
        is still true, that the reward for works depends on the free promise of
        the law. Wisely then and rightly does Paul speak here; for he speaks not
        of mere works, but distinctly and expressly refers to the keeping of the
        law, the subject which he is discussing. </font

      <font
        >As to those things which have been adduced by learned men in defense of
        this opinion, they are weaker than they might have been. They think that
        by mentioning circumcision, an example is propounded, which belonged to
        ceremonies only: but why Paul mentioned circumcision, we have already
        explained; for none swell more with confidence in works than hypocrites,
        and we know that they glory only in external masks; and then
        circumcision, according to their view, was a sort of initiation into the
        righteousness of the law; and hence it seemed to them a work of primary
        excellence, and indeed the basis as it were of the righteousness of
        works. &#8212; They also allege what is said in the Epistle to the
        Galatians, where Paul handles the same subject, and refers to ceremonies
        only; but that also is not sufficiently strong to support what they wish
        to defend. It is certain that Paul had a controversy with those who
        inspired the people with a false confidence in ceremonies; that he might
        cut of this confidence, he did not confine himself to ceremonies, nor
        did he speak specifically of what value they were; but he included the
        whole law, as it is evident from those passages which are derived from
        that source. Such also was the character of the disputation held at
        Jerusalem by the disciples.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But we contend, not without reason, that Paul speaks here of the whole
        law; for we are abundantly supported by the thread of reasoning which he
        has hitherto followed and continues to follow, and there are many other
        passages which will not allow us to think otherwise. It is therefore a
        truth, which deserves to be remembered as the first in importance,
        &#8212; that by keeping the law no one can attain righteousness. He had
        before assigned the reason, and he will repeat it presently again, and
        that is, that all, being to a man guilty of transgression, are condemned
        for unrighteousness by the law. And these two things &#8212; to be
        justified by works &#8212; and to be guilty of transgressions, (as we
        shall show more at large as we proceed,) are wholly inconsistent the one
        with the other. &#8212; The word </font

        though it seems to convey a meaning somewhat more general, as it is more
        expressive to say, &#8220;All mortals,&#8221; than to say, &#8220;All
        men,&#8221; as you may see in <i>Gallius.</i></font

        that righteousness is not brought to us by the law, because it convinces
        us of sin and condemns us; for life and death proceed not from the same
        fountain. And as he reasons from the contrary effect of the law, that it
        cannot confer righteousness on us, let us know, that the argument does
        not otherwise hold good, except we hold this as an inseparable and
        unvarying circumstance, &#8212; that by showing to man his sin, it cuts
        off the hope of salvation. It is indeed by itself, as it teaches us what
        righteousness is, the way to salvation: but our depravity and corruption
        prevent it from being in this respect of any advantage to us. It is also
        necessary in the second place to add this, &#8212; that whosoever is
        found to be a sinner, is deprived of righteousness; for to devise with
        the sophisters a half kind of righteousness, so that works in part
        justify, is frivolous: but nothing is in this respect gained, on account
        of man&#8217;s corruption.</font

        the righteousness of God, which we obtain by faith; whether it be,
        because it can alone stand before God, or because the Lord in his mercy
        confers it on us. As both interpretations are suitable, we contend for

        understood as meaning works; for it is not proper to refer this to its

        gratuitous righteousness of faith. Some confine it to ceremonies; but
        this view I shall presently show to be unsound and frigid. We ought then
        to know, that the merits of works are excluded. We also see that he

        proudly adduce this sentiment, as though it were at this day revealed to

        no question to be made about this or that kind of work; but the merit of
        works being abolished, the remission of sins alone is set down as the
        cause of righteousness.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >They think that these two things well agree, &#8212; that man is
        justified by faith through the grace of Christ, &#8212; and that he is
        yet justified by the works, which proceed from spiritual regeneration;
        for God gratuitously renews us, and we also receive his gift by faith.
        But Paul takes up a very different principle, &#8212; that the
        consciences of men will never be tranquillized until they recumb on the
        mercy of God alone. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f111</font></sup
      ><font>
        Hence, in another place, after having taught us that God is in Christ
        justifying men, he expresses the manner, &#8212; &#8220;by not imputing
        to them their sins.&#8221; In like manner, in his Epistle to the
        Galatians, he puts the law in opposition to faith with regard to
        justification; for the law promises life to those who do what it
        commands, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480312&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 3:12;) and it requires not only the outward performance of
        works, but also sincere love to God. It hence follows, that in the
        righteousness of faith, no merit of works is allowed. It then appears
        evident, that it is but a frivolous sophistry to say, that we are
        justified in Christ, because we are renewed by the Spirit, inasmuch as
        we are the members of Christ, &#8212; that we are justified by faith,
        because we are united by faith to the body of Christ, &#8212; that we
        are justified freely, because God finds nothing in us but sin.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But we are <i>in Christ</i> because we are out of ourselves; and
        justified by <i>faith,</i> because we must recumb on the mercy of God
        alone, and on his gratuitous promises; and<i> freely,</i> because God
        reconciles us to himself by burying our sins. Nor can this indeed be
        confined to the commencement of justification, as they dream; for this
        definition &#8212; &#8220;Blessed are they whose iniquities are
        forgiven&#8221; &#8212; was applicable to David, after he had long
        exercised himself in the service of God; and Abraham, thirty years after
        his call, though a remarkable example of holiness, had yet no works for
        which he could glory before God, and hence his faith in the promise was
        imputed to him for righteousness; and when Paul teaches us that God
        justifies men by not imputing their sins, he quotes a passage, which is
        daily repeated in the Church. Still more, the conscience, by which we
        are disturbed on the score of works, performs its office, not for one
        day only, but continues to do so through life. It hence follows that we
        cannot remain, even to death, in a justified state, except we look to
        Christ only, in whom God has adopted us, and regards us now as accepted.
        Hence also is their sophistry confuted, who falsely accuse us of
        asserting, that according to Scripture we are justified by faith only,
        while the exclusive word <i>only,</i> is nowhere to be found in
        Scripture. But if justification depends not either on the law, or on
        ourselves, why should it not be ascribed to mercy alone? and if it be
        from mercy only, it is then by faith only.</font

    <div>
      <font>The particle </font><font color="Maroon"><i>now</i></font

      ><font>
        But if you prefer to regard it as an adverb of time, I willingly admit
        it, so that there may be no room to suspect an evasion; yet the
        abrogation of ceremonies alone is not to be understood; for it was only
        the design of the Apostle to illustrate by a comparison the grace by
        which we excel the fathers. Then the meaning is, that by the preaching
        of the gospel, after the appearance of Christ in the flesh, the
        righteousness of faith was revealed. It does not, however, hence follow,
        that it was hid before the coming of Christ; for a twofold manifestation
        is to be here noticed: the first in the Old Testament, which was by the
        word and sacraments; the other in the New, which contains the completion
        of ceremonies and promises, as exhibited in Christ himself: and we may
        add, that by the gospel it has received a fuller brightness.</font

      ><font>
        etc. He adds this, lest in the conferring of free righteousness the
        gospel should seem to militate against the law. As then he has denied
        that the righteousness of faith needs the aid of the law, so now he
        asserts that it is confirmed by its testimony. If then the law affords
        its testimony to gratuitous righteousness, it is evident that the law
        was not given for this end, to teach men how to obtain righteousness by
        works. Hence they pervert it, who turn it to answer any purpose of this
        kind. And further, if you desire a proof of this truth, examine in order
        the chief things taught by Moses, and you will find that man, being cast
        from the kingdom of God, had no other restoration from the beginning
        than that contained in the evangelical promises through the blessed
        seed, by whom, as it had been foretold, the serpent&#8217;s head was to
        be bruised, and through whom a blessing to the nations had been
        promised: you will find in the commandments a demonstration of your
        iniquity, and from the sacrifices and oblations you may learn that
        satisfaction and cleansing are to be obtained in Christ alone. </font

        He shows in few words what this justification is, even that which is
        found in Christ and is apprehended by faith. At the same time, by
        introducing again the name of God, he seems to make God the founder, (<i
          >autorem,</i
        >
        the author,) and not only the approver of the righteousness of which he
        speaks; as though he had said, that it flows from him alone, or that its
        origin is from heaven, but that it is made manifest to us in
        Christ.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >When therefore we discuss this subject, we ought to proceed in this
        way: <i>First,</i> the question respecting our justification is to be
        referred, not to the judgment of men, but to the judgment of God, before
        whom nothing is counted righteousness, but perfect and absolute
        obedience to the law; which appears clear from its promises and
        threatenings: if no one is found who has attained to such a perfect
        measure of holiness, it follows that all are in themselves destitute of
        righteousness. <i>Secondly,</i> it is necessary that Christ should come
        to our aid; who, being alone just, can render us just by transferring to
        us his own righteousness. You now see how the righteousness of faith is
        the righteousness of Christ. When therefore we are justified, the
        efficient cause is the mercy of God, the meritorious is Christ, the
        instrumental is the word in connection with faith. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f116</font></sup
      ><font>
        Hence faith is said to justify, because it is the instrument by which we
        receive Christ, in whom righteousness is conveyed to us. Having been
        made partakers of Christ, we ourselves are not only just, but our works
        also are counted just before God, and for this reason, because whatever
        imperfections there may be in them, are obliterated by the blood of
        Christ; the promises, which are conditional, are also by the same grace
        fulfilled to us; for God rewards our works as perfect, inasmuch as their
        defects are covered by free pardon.</font

      ><font>
        etc. For the sake of amplifying, he repeats the same thing in different
        forms; it was, that he might more fully express what we have already
        heard, that faith alone is required, that the faithful are not
        distinguished by external marks, and that hence it matters not whether
        they be Gentiles or Jews.</font

        etc. He urges on all, without exception, the necessity of seeking
        righteousness in Christ; as though he had said, &#8220;There is no other
        way of attaining righteousness; for some cannot be justified in this and
        others in that way; but all must alike be justified by faith, because
        all are sinners, and therefore have nothing for which they can glory
        before God.&#8221; But he takes as granted that every one, conscious of
        his sin, when he comes before the tribunal of God, is confounded and
        lost under a sense of his own shame; so that no <i>sinner</i> can bear
        the presence of God, as we see an example in the case of Adam. He again
        brings forward a reason taken from the opposite side; and hence we must
        notice what follows. Since we are all sinners, Paul concludes, that we
        are deficient in, or <i>destitute</i> of, the praise due to
        righteousness. There is then, according to what he teaches, no
        righteousness but what is perfect and absolute. Were there indeed such a
        thing as half righteousness, it would yet be necessary to deprive the
        sinner entirely of all glory: and hereby the figment of partial
        righteousness, as they call it, is sufficiently confuted; for if it were
        true that we are justified in part by works, and in part by grace, this
        argument of Paul would be of no force &#8212; that all are deprived of
        the glory of God because they are sinners. It is then certain, there is
        no righteousness where there is sin, until Christ removes the curse; and
        this very thing is what is said in </font

        usage of the Greek language. The meaning is, &#8212; that since there
        remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish, being smitten
        by the just judgment of God, they are to be justified freely through his
        mercy; for Christ comes to the aid of this misery, and communicates
        himself to believers, so that they find in him alone all those things in
        which they are wanting. There is, perhaps, no passage in the whole
        Scripture which illustrates in a more striking manner the efficacy of
        his righteousness; for it shows that God&#8217;s mercy is the efficient
        cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious cause, that the
        formal or the instumental cause is faith in the word, and that moreover,
        the final cause is the glory of the divine justice and goodness.</font
      ><br />

    <div>
      <font>With regard to the efficient cause, he says, that we are </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>justified freely,</i></font
      ><font>
        and further, by his grace; and he thus repeats the word to show that the
        whole is from God, and nothing from us. It might have been enough to
        oppose grace to merits; but lest we should imagine a half kind of grace,
        he affirms more strongly what he means by a repetition, and claims for
        God&#8217;s mercy alone the whole glory of our righteousness, which the
        sophists divide into parts and mutilate, that they may not be
        constrained to confess their own poverty. &#8212; </font

        judgment,) and by undertaking our cause he liberated us from the tyranny
        of death, by which we were held captive; as on account of the sacrifice
        which he offered is our guilt removed. Here again is fully confuted the
        gloss of those who make righteousness a quality; for if we are counted
        righteous before God, because we are redeemed by a price, we certainly
        derive from another what is not in us. And Paul immediately explains
        more clearly what this redemption is, and what is its object, which is
        to reconcile us to God; for he calls Christ a propitiation, (or, if we
        prefer an allusion to an ancient type,) a propitiatory. But what he
        means is, that we are not otherwise just than through Christ
        propitiating the Father for us. But it is necessary for us to examine
        the words. </font

        If the first meaning be taken, Paul refers to the gratuitous mercy of
        God, in having appointed Christ as our Mediator, that he might appease
        the Father by the sacrifice of his death: nor is it a small commendation
        of God&#8217;s grace that he, of his own good will, sought out a way by
        which he might remove our curse. According to this view, the passage
        fully harmonizes with that in </font

        >, as I have said, to the ancient propitiatory; for he teaches us that
        the same thing was really exhibited in Christ, which had been previously
        typified. As, however, the other view cannot be disproved, should any
        prefer it, I shall not undertake to decide the question. What Paul
        especially meant here is no doubt evident from his words; and it was
        this, &#8212; that God, without having regard to Christ, is always angry
        with us, &#8212; and that we are reconciled to him when we are accepted
        through his righteousness. God does not indeed hate in us his own
        workmanship, that is, as we are formed men; but he hates our
        uncleanness, which has extinguished the light of his image. When the
        washing of Christ cleanses this away, he then loves and embraces us as
        his own pure workmanship.</font

        for it seems indeed to me that he intended, by one single sentence, to
        declare that God is propitious to us as soon as we have our trust
        resting on the blood of Christ; for by faith we come to the possession
        of this benefit. But by mentioning </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>blood</i> </font
      ><font
        >only, he did not mean to exclude other things connected with
        redemption, but, on the contrary, to include the whole under one word:
        and he mentioned &#8220;blood,&#8221; because by it we are cleansed.
        Thus, by taking a part for the whole, he points out the whole work of
        expiation. For, as he had said before, that God is reconciled in Christ,
        so he now adds, that this reconciliation is obtained by faith,
        mentioning, at the same time, what it is that faith ought mainly to
        regard in Christ &#8212; his blood.</font

        etc. The causal preposition imports as much as though he had said,
        &#8220;for the sake of remission,&#8221; or, &#8220;to this end, that he
        might blot out sins.&#8221; And this definition or explanation again
        confirms what I have already often reminded you, &#8212; that men are
        pronounced just, not because they are such in reality, but by
        imputation: for he only uses various modes of expression, that he might
        more clearly declare, that in this righteousness there is no merit of
        ours; for if we obtain it by the remission of sins, we conclude that it
        is not from ourselves; and further, since remission itself is an act of
        God&#8217;s bounty alone, every merit falls to the ground.</font

        >It may, however, be asked, why he confines pardon to preceding sins?
        Though this passage is variously explained, yet it seems to me probable
        that Paul had regard to the legal expiations, which were indeed
        evidences of a future satisfaction, but could by no means pacify God.
        There is a similar passage in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580915&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Hebrews 9:15, where it is said, that by Christ a redemption was brought
        from sins, which remained under the former Testament. You are not,
        however, to understand that no sins but those of former times were
        expiated by the death of Christ &#8212; a delirious notion, which some
        fanatics have drawn from a distorted view of this passage. For Paul
        teaches us only this, &#8212; that until the death of Christ there was
        no way of appeasing God, and that this was not done or accomplished by
        the legal types: hence the reality was suspended until the fullness of
        time came. We may further say, that those things which involve us daily
        in guilt must be regarded in the same light; for there is but one true
        expiation for all.</font

        >Some, in order to avoid what seems inconsistent, have held that former
        sins are said to have been forgiven, lest there should seem to he a
        liberty given to sin in future. It is indeed true that no pardon is
        offered but for sins committed; not that the benefit of redemption fails
        or is lost, when we afterwards fall, as <i>Novatus</i> and his sect
        dreamed, but that it is the character of the dispensation of the gospel,
        to set before him who will sin the judgment and wrath of God, and before
        the sinner his mercy. But what I have already stated is the real
        sense.</font

        ><i>;</i> and this I take simply to mean gentleness, which has stayed
        the judgment of God, and suffered it not to burst forth to our ruin,
        until he had at length received us into favor. But there seems to be
        here also an implied anticipation of what might be said; that no one
        might object, and say that this favor had only of late appeared. Paul
        teaches us, that it was an evidence of forbearance.</font

        etc. The repetition of this clause is emphatical; and Paul resignedly
        made it, as it was very needful; for nothing is more difficult than to
        persuade man that he ought to disclaim all things as his own, and to
        ascribe them all to God. At the same time mention was intentionally made
        twice of this demonstration, that the Jews might open their eyes to
        behold it. &#8212; </font

        when Christ was revealed, and not without reason; for what was formerly
        known in an obscure manner under shadows, God openly manifested in his
        Son. So the coming of Christ was the time of his good pleasure, and the
        day of salvation. God had indeed in all ages given some evidence of his
        righteousness; but it appeared far brighter when the sun of
        righteousness shone. Noticed, then, ought to be the comparison between
        the Old and the New Testament; for then only was revealed the
        righteousness of God when Christ appeared.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>That he might be just</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> etc. This is a definition of that righteousness which he has
        declared was revealed when Christ was given, and which, as he has taught
        us in the first chapter, is made known in the gospel: and he affirms
        that it consists of two parts &#8212; The first is, that God is just,
        not indeed as one among many, but as one who contains within himself all
        fullness of righteousness; for complete and full praise, such as is due,
        is not otherwise given to him, but when he alone obtains the name and
        the honor of being just, while the whole human race is condemned for
        injustice: and then the other part refers to the communication of
        righteousness; for God by no means keeps his riches laid up in himself,
        but pours them forth upon men. Then the righteousness of God shines in
        us, whenever he justifies us by faith in Christ; for in vain were Christ
        given us for righteousness, unless there was the fruition of him by
        faith. It hence follows, that all were unjust and lost in themselves,
        until a remedy from heaven was offered to them. </font

        The Apostle, after having, with reasons abundantly strong, cast down men
        from their confidence in works, now triumphs over their folly: and this
        exulting conclusion was necessary; for on this subject, to teach us
        would not have been enough; it was necessary that the Holy Spirit should
        loudly thunder, in order to lay prostrate our loftiness. But he says
        that glorying is beyond all doubt excluded, for we cannot adduce
        anything of our own, which is worthy of being approved or commended by
        God. If the material of glorying be merit, whether you name that of
        congruity or of condignity, by which man would conciliate God, you see
        that both are here annihilated; for he treats not of the lessening or
        the modifying of merit, but Paul leaves not a particle behind. Besides,
        since by faith glorying in works is so taken away, that faith cannot be
        truly preached, without wholly depriving man of all praise by ascribing
        all to God&#8217;s mercy &#8212; it follows, that we are assisted by no
        works in obtaining righteousness.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Of works?</i></font
      ><font>
        In what sense does the Apostle deny here, that our merits are excluded
        by the law, since he has before proved that we are condemned by the law?
        for if the law delivers us over to death, what glorying can we obtain
        from it? Does it not on the contrary deprive us of all glorying and
        cover us with shame? He then indeed showed, that our sin is laid open by
        what the law declares, for the keeping of it is what we have all
        neglected: but he means here, that were righteousness to be had by the
        law of works, our glorying would not be excluded; but as it is by faith
        alone, there is nothing that we can claim for ourselves; for faith
        receives all from God, and brings nothing except an humble confession of
        want.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >This contrast between faith and works ought to be carefully noticed:
        works are here mentioned without any limitation, even works universally.
        Then he neither speaks of ceremonies only, nor specifically of any
        external work, but includes all the merits of works which can possibly
        be imagined.</font

      <font>The name of </font><font color="Maroon"><i>law</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>is here, with no strict correctness, given to faith: but this
        by no means obscures the meaning of the Apostle; for what he understands
        is, that when we come to the rule of faith, the whole glorying in works
        is laid prostrate; as though he said &#8212; &#8220;The righteousness of
        works is indeed commended by the law, but that of faith has its own law,
        which leaves to works, whatever they may be, no righteousness.&#8221; </font

        ><i> </i>etc. He now draws the main proposition, as one that is
        incontrovertible, and adds an explanation. Justification by faith is
        indeed made very clear, while works are expressly excluded. Hence, in
        nothing do our adversaries labor more in the present day than in
        attempts to blend faith with the merits of works. They indeed allow that
        man is justified by faith; but not by faith alone; yea, they place the
        efficacy of justification in love, though in words they ascribe it to
        faith. But Paul affirms in this passage that justification is so
        gratuitous, that he makes it quite evident, that it can by no means be
        associated with the merit of works. Why he names the works of the law, I
        have already explained; and I have also proved that it is quite absurd
        to confine them to ceremonies. Frigid also is the gloss, that works are
        to be taken for those which are outward, and done without the Spirit of
        Christ. On the contrary, the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>law</i></font
      ><font>
        that is added, means the same as though he called them meritorious; for
        what is referred to is the reward promised in the law. </font

      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >What, James says, that man is not justified by faith alone, but also by
        works, does not at all militate against the preceding view. The
        reconciling of the two views depends chiefly on the drift of the
        argument pursued by James. For the question with him is not, how men
        attain righteousness before God, but how they prove to others that their
        are justified, for his object was to confute hypocrites, who vainly
        boasted that they had faith. Gross then is the sophistry, not to admit
        that the word, to justify, is taken in a different sense by James, from
        that in which it is used by Paul; for they handle different subjects.
        The word, faith, is also no doubt capable of various meanings. These two
        things must be taken to the account, before a correct judgment can be
        formed on the point. We may learn from the context, that James meant no
        more than that man is not made or proved to be just by a feigned or dead
        faith, and that he must prove his righteousness by his works. See on
        this subject my Institutes.</font

        this point should be urged, in order that a free passage might be made
        for the kingdom of Christ through the whole world. He does not then ask
        simply or expressly, whether God was the Creator of the Gentiles, which
        was admitted without any dispute; but whether he designed to manifest
        himself as a Savior also to them. As he had put all mankind on a level,
        and brought them to the same condition, if there be any difference
        between them, it is from God, not from themselves, who have all things

        between themselves and the Gentiles, though on the subject of
        justification there was no difference whatever; for since men became
        partakers of this grace by faith only, and since faith in all is the

        etc. When the law is opposed to faith, the flesh immediately suspects
        that there is some contrariety, as though the one were adverse to the
        other: and this false notion prevails, especially among those who are
        imbued with wrong ideas as to the law, and leaving the promises, seek
        nothing else through it but the righteousness of works. And on this
        account, not only Paul, but our Lord himself, was evil spoken of by the
        Jews, as though in all his preaching he aimed at the abrogation of the
        law. Hence it was that he made this protest, &#8212;</font

        opposed to all those testimonies of the law, by which the Lord has
        declared, that he has thereby prescribed the way of righteousness and
        salvation. I therefore take this defense of Paul, not only as to
        ceremonies, nor as to the commandments which are called moral, but with
        regard to the whole law universally. </font

        cannot be fulfilled, and in vain will it require what ought to be done;
        nor can it do anything but irritate lust more and more, and thus finally
        increase man&#8217;s condemnation; but where there is a coming to
        Christ, there is first found in him the perfect righteousness of the
        law, which becomes ours by imputation, and then there is sanctification,
        by which our hearts are prepared to keep the law; it is indeed
        imperfectly done, but there is an aiming at the work. Similar is the
        case with<i> ceremonies,</i> which indeed cease and vanish away when
        Christ comes, but they are in reality confirmed by him; for when they
        are viewed in themselves they are vain and shadowy images, and then only
        do they attain anything real and solid, when their end is regarded. In
        this then consists their chief confirmation, when they have obtained
        their accomplishment in Christ. Let us then also bear in mind, so to
        dispense the gospel that by our mode of teaching the law may be

        strong one, since all things are alike with regard to the subject and
        the person; for he was the father of the faithful, to whom we ought all
        to be conformed; and there is also but one way and not many ways by
        which righteousness may be obtained by all. In many other things one
        example would not be sufficient to make a common rule; but as in the
        person of Abraham there was exhibited a mirror and pattern of
        righteousness, which belongs in common to the whole Church, rightly does
        Paul apply what has been written of him alone to the whole body of the
        Church, and at the same time he gives a check to the Jews, who had
        nothing more plausible to glory in than that they were the children of
        Abraham; and they could not have dared to claim to themselves more
        holiness than what they ascribed to the holy patriarch. Since it is then
        evident that he was justified freely, his posterity, who claimed a
        righteousness of their own by the law, ought to have been made silent
        even through shame.</font

        obtained according to the flesh?&#8221; If this exposition be approved,
        the words </font

        Besides, as we are wont to be more touched by domestic examples, the
        dignity of their race, in which the Jews took too much pride, is here
        again expressly mentioned. But some regard this as spoken in contempt,
        as they are elsewhere called the carnal children of Abraham, being not
        so spiritually or in a legitimate sense. But I think that it was
        expressed as a thing peculiar to the Jews; for it was a greater honor to
        be the children of Abraham by nature and descent, than by mere adoption,
        provided there was also faith. He then concedes to the Jews a closer
        bond of union, but only for this end &#8212; that he might more deeply
        impress them that they ought not to depart from the example of their
        father.</font

      ><font>
        which may be made in this form &#8212; &#8220;If Abraham was justified
        by works, he might justly glory: but he had nothing for which he could
        glory before God; then he was not justified by works.&#8221; Thus the
        clause </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>but not before God</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>,</i> is the minor proposition; and to this must be added the
        conclusion which I have stated, though it is not expressed by Paul. He
        calls that glorying when we pretend to have anything of our own to which
        a reward is supposed to be due at God&#8217;s tribunal. Since he takes
        this away from Abraham, who of us can claim for himself the least
        particle of merit?</font
      ><br /><font><b>3.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For what saith the Scripture?</i></font
      ><font>
        This is a proof of the mirlor proposition, or of what he assumed, when
        he denied that Abraham had any ground for glorying: for if Abraham was
        justified, because he embraced, by faith, the bountiful mercy of God, it
        follows, that he had nothing to glory in; for he brought nothing of his
        own, except a confession of his misery, which is a solicitation for
        mercy. He, indeed, takes it as granted, that the righteousness of faith
        is the refuge, and, as it were, the asylum of the sinner, who is
        destitute of works. For if there be any righteousness by the law or by
        works, it must be in men themselves; but by faith they derive from
        another what is wanting in themselves; and hence the righteousness of
        faith is rightly called imputative.</font

        is not to be confined to any particular expression, but it refers to the
        whole covenant of salvation, and the grace of adoption, which Abraham
        apprehended by faith. There is, indeed, mentioned there the promise of a
        future seed; but it was grounded on gratuitous adoption: </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f131</font></sup
      ><font>
        and it ought to be observed, that salvation without the grace of God is
        not promised, nor God&#8217;s grace without salvation; and again, that
        we are not called to the grace of God nor to the hope of salvation,
        without having righteousness offered to us.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >Taking this view, we cannot but see that those understand not the
        principles of theology, who think that this testimony recorded by Moses,
        is drawn aside from its obvious meaning by Paul: for as there is a
        particular promise there stated, they understand that he acted rightly
        and faithfully in believing it, and was so far approved by God. But they
        are in this mistaken; first, because they have not considered that
        <i>believing</i> extends to the whole context, and ought not to be
        confined to one clause. But the principal mistake is, that they begin
        not with the testimony of God&#8217;s favor. But God gave this, to make
        Abraham more assured of his adoption and paternal favor; and included in
        this was eternal salvation by Christ. Hence Abraham, by believing,
        embraced nothing but the favor offered to him, being persuaded that it
        would not be void. Since this was imputed to him for righteousness, it
        follows, that he was not otherwise just, than as one trusting in
        God&#8217;s goodness, and venturing to hope for all things from him.
        Moses does not, indeed, tell us what men thought of him, but how he was
        accounted before the tribunal of God. Abraham then laid hold on the
        benignity of God offered to him in the promise, through which he
        understood that righteousness was communicated to him. It is necessary,
        in order to form an opinion of righteousness, to understand this
        relation between the promise and faith; for there is in this respect the
        same connection between God and us, as there is, according to the
        lawyers, between the giver and the person to whom any thing is given,
        (<i>datorem et donatarium</i> &#8212; the donor and the donee:) for we
        can no otherwise attain righteousness, than as it is brought to us, as
        it were, by the promise of the gospel; and we realize its possession by
        faith. </font

        and integrity of life are to be separated from the gratuitous favor of
        God; but that when the reason is asked, why God loves us and owns us as

        >Galatians 3:11, where it is said, &#8220;That no man is justified by
        the law, it is evident, for the just shall by faith live: but the law is
        not by faith; but he who doeth these things shall live in them.&#8221;
        Inasmuch, then, as the law promises reward to works, he hence concludes,
        that the righteousness of faith, which is free, accords not with that
        which is operative: this could not be were faith to justify by means of
        works. &#8212; We ought carefully to observe these comparisons, by which
        every merit is entirely done away.</font

        etc. This is a very important sentence, in which he expresses the
        substance and nature both of faith and of righteousness. He indeed
        clearly shews that faith brings us righteousness, not because it is a
        meritorious act, but because it obtains for us the favor of God. </font

        Nor does he declare only that God is the giver of righteousness, but he
        also arraigns us of unrighteousness, in order that the bounty of God may
        come to aid our necessity: in short, no one will seek the righteousness
        of faith except he who feels that he is ungodly; for this sentence is to
        be applied to what is said in this passage, &#8212; that faith adorns us
        with the righteousness of another, which it seeks as a gift from God.
        And here again, God is said to justify us when he freely forgives
        sinners, and favors those, with whom he might justly be angry, with his
        love, that is, when his mercy obliterates our unrighteousness.</font

        works of the law to ceremonies; for he now simply calls those works,
        without anything added, which he had before called the works of the law.
        Since no one can deny that a simple and unrestricted mode of speaking,
        such as we find here, ought to be understood of every work without any
        difference, the same view must be held throughout the whole argument.
        There is indeed nothing less reasonable than to remove from ceremonies
        only the power of justifying, since Paul excludes all works
        indefinitely. To the same purpose is the negative clause, &#8212; that
        God justifies men by<i> not</i> imputing sin: and by these words we are
        taught that righteousness, according to Paul, is nothing else than the
        remission of sins; and further, that this remission is gratuitous,
        because it is imputed without works, which the very name of remission
        indicates; for the creditor who is paid does not remit, but he who
        Spontaneously cancels the debt through mere kindness. Away, then, with
        those who teach us to redeem pardon for our sins by satisfactions; for
        Paul borrows an argument from this pardon to prove the gratuitous gift
        of righteousness. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f134</font></sup
      ><font>
        How then is it possible for them to agree with Paul? They say, &#8220;We
        must satisfy by works the justice of God, that we may obtain the pardon
        of our sins:&#8221; but he, on the contrary, reasons thus, &#8212;
        &#8220;The righteousness of faith is gratuitous, and without works,
        because it depends on the remission of sins.&#8221; Vicious, no doubt,
        would be this reasoning, if any works interposed in the remission of
        sins.</font

        puerile fancies of the schoolmen respecting half remission. Their
        childish fiction is, &#8212; that though the fault is remitted, the
        punishment is still retained by God. But the Prophet not only declares
        that our sins are covered, that is, removed from the presence of God;
        but also adds, that they are not imputed. How can it be consistent, that
        God should punish those sins which he does not impute? Safe then does
        this most glorious declaration remain to us &#8212; &#8220;That he is
        justified by faith, who is cleared before God by a gratuitous remission
        of his sins.&#8221; We may also hence learn, the unceasing perpetuity of
        gratuitous righteousness through life: for when David, being wearied
        with the continual anguish of his own conscience, gave utterance to this
        declaration, he no doubt spoke according to his own experience; and he
        had now served God for many years. He then had found by experience,
        after having made great advances, that all are miserable when summoned
        before God&#8217;s tribunal; and he made this avowal, that there is no
        other way of obtaining blessedness, except the Lord receives us into
        favor by not imputing our sins. Thus fully refuted also is the romance
        of those who dream, that the righteousness of faith is but initial, and
        that the faithful afterwards retain by works the possession of that
        righteousness which they had first attained by no merits.</font

        lest they should come to judgment. As works, infected with no
        defilements, are alone counted just, it is quite evident that no human
        work whatever can please God, except through a favor of this kind. But
        if the righteousness of faith is the only reason why our works are

        his servants for attention to the law and to good works. Hence the
        righteousness of works is the effect of the righteousness of God, and
        the blessedness arising from works is the effect of the blessedness

        were those with whom Paul was reasoning; for we know that hypocrites,
        whilst they generally boast of meritorious works, do yet disguise
        themselves in outward masks. The Jews also had a peculiar way of their
        own, by which they departed, through a gross abuse of the law, from true
        and genuine righteousness. Paul had said, that no one is blessed but he
        whom God reconciles to himself by a gratuitous pardon; it hence follows,
        that all are accursed, whose works come to judgment. Now then this
        principle is to be held, that men are justified, not by their own
        worthiness, but by the mercy of God. But still, this is not enough,
        except remission of sins precedes all works, and of these the first was
        circumcision, which initiated the Jewish people into the service of God.

        meritorious observance of the law: and on this account it was that they
        regarded themselves better than others, as though they possessed a
        higher excellency before God. We now see that the dispute is not about
        one rite, but that under one thing is included every work of the law;
        that is, every work to which reward can be due. Circumcision then was

        circumcision, it then follows that remission of sins is not given for
        preceding merits.&#8221; You see that the argument rests on the order of

        circumcision was not unprofitable and superfluous, though it could not
        justify; but it had another very remarkable use, it had the office of
        sealing, and as it were of ratifying the righteousness of faith. And yet

        was not the cause of righteousness, it indeed tended to confirm the

        benefits of sacraments. According to the testimony of Paul, they are
        seals by which the promises of God are in a manner imprinted on our
        hearts, (<i>Dei promissiones cordibus nostris quodammodo imprimuntur</i
        >,) and the certainty of grace confirmed (<i
          >sancitur grat&#339; certitudo.</i
        >) And though by themselves they profit nothing, yet God has designed
        them to be the instruments (<i>instrumenta</i>) of his grace; and he
        effects by the secret grace of his Spirit, that they should not be
        without benefit in the elect. And though they are dead and unprofitable
        symbols to the reprobate, they yet ever retain their import and
        character (<i>vim suam et naturam:</i>) for though our unbelief may
        deprive them of their effect, yet it cannot weaken or extinguish the
        truth of God. Hence it remains a fixed principle, that sacred symbols
        are testimonies, by which God seals his grace on our hearts.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >As to the symbol of circumcision, this especially is to be said, that a
        twofold grace was represented by it. God had promised to Abraham a
        blessed seed, from whom salvation was to be expected by the whole world.
        On this depended the promise &#8212; &#8220;I will be to thee a
        God.&#8221; (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Genesis 17:7.) Then a gratuitous reconciliation with God was included
        in that symbol: and for this reason it was necessary that the faithful
        should look forward to the promised seed. On the other hand, God
        requires integrity and holiness of life; he indicated by the symbol how
        this could be attained, that is, by cutting off in man whatever is born
        of the flesh, for his whole nature had become vicious. He therefore
        reminded Abraham by the external sign, that he was spiritually to cut
        off the corruption of the flesh; and to this Moses has also alluded in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051016&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Deuteronomy 10:16. And to show that it was not the work of man, but of
        God, he commanded tender infants to be circumcised, who, on account of
        their age, could not have performed such a command. Moses has indeed
        expressly mentioned spiritual circumcision as the work of divine power,

    <div>
      <font
        >As there are two points in baptism now, so there were formerly in
        circumcision; for it was a symbol of a new life, and also of the
        remission of sins. But the fact as to Abraham himself, that
        righteousness preceded circumcision, is not always the case in
        sacraments, as it is evident from the case of Isaac and his posterity:
        but God intended to give such an instance once at the beginning, that no
        one might ascribe salvation to external signs. </font

        to gratuitous righteousness; for it was the sealing of the righteousness
        of faith, that righteousness might also be imputed to us who believe.
        And thus Paul, by a remarkable dexterity makes to recoil on his
        opponents what they might have adduced as an objection: for since the
        truth and import (<i>veritas et vis</i>) of circumcision were found in
        an uncircumcised state, there was no ground for the Jews to elevate
        themselves so much above the Gentiles.</font

        Abraham, to confirm also the same righteousness by the sign of
        circumcision, how came the Apostle to make this omission? Even because
        he thought that the question was sufficiently settled by the drift of
        his argument: for as this truth had been admitted, that circumcision
        availed only to seal the grace of God, it follows, that it is now of no
        benefit to us, who have a sign instituted in its place by our Lord. As
        then there is no necessity now for circumcision, where baptism is, he
        was not disposed to contend unnecessarily for that respecting which
        there was no doubt, that is, why the righteousness of faith was not
        sealed to the Gentiles in the same way as it was to Abraham. </font

        he touches the carnal descendants of Abraham, who, having nothing but
        outward circumcision, confidently gloried in it. The other thing, which
        was the chief matter, they neglected; for the faith of Abraham, by which
        alone he obtained salvation, they did not imitate. It hence appears, how
        carefully he distinguished between faith and the sacrament; not only
        that no one might be satisfied with the one without the other, as though
        it were sufficient for justifying; but also that faith alone might be
        set forth as accomplishing everything: for while he allows the
        circumcised Jews to be justified, he expressly makes this exception
        &#8212; provided in true faith they followed the example of Abraham; for
        why does he mention faith while in uncircumcision, except to show, that
        it is alone sufficient, without the aid of anything else? Let us then
        beware, lest any of us, by halving things, blend together the two modes
        of justification.</font

        difference between the sacraments of the Old and those of the New
        Testament; for they deny the power of justifying to the former, and
        assign it to the latter. But if Paul reasons correctly, when he argues
        that circumcision does not justify, because Abraham was justified by
        faith, the same reason holds good for us, while we deny that men are
        justified by baptism, inasmuch as they are justified by the same faith
        with that of Abraham.</font

        the one to the other, which he had before in some measure done; and this
        ought to be carefully observed: for if faith borrows nothing from the
        law in order to justify, we hence understand, that it has respect to
        nothing else but to the mercy of God. And further, the romance of those
        who would have this to have been said of ceremonies, may be easily
        disproved; for if works contributed anything towards justification, it
        ought not to have been said, through the written law, but rather,
        through the law of nature. But Paul does not oppose spiritual holiness
        of life to ceremonies, but faith and its righteousness. The meaning then
        is, that heirship was promised to Abraham, not because he deserved it by
        keeping the law, but because he had obtained righteousness by faith. And
        doubtless (as Paul will presently show) consciences can then only enjoy
        solid peace, when they know that what is not justly due is freely given
        them. </font

        favor which Abraham obtained from God, was not promised to him through
        any legal agreement, or through any regard to works; for if this
        condition had been interposed &#8212; that God would favor those only
        with adoption who deserved, or who performed the law, no one could have
        dared to feel confident that it belonged to him: for who is there so
        conscious of so much perfection that he can feel assured that the
        inheritance is due to him through the righteousness of the law? Void
        then would faith be made; for an impossible condition would not only
        hold the minds of men in suspense and anxiety, but fill them also with
        fear and trembling: and thus the fulfillment of the promises would be
        rendered void; for they avail nothing but when received by faith. If our
        adversaries had ears to hear this one reason, the contest between us

        be harassed with perpetual inquietude, and at length sink in despair;
        and the promise itself, the fulfillment of which depended on what is
        impossible, would also vanish away without producing any fruit. Away
        then with those who teach the common people to seek salvation for
        themselves by works, seeing that Paul declares expressly, that the
        promise is abolished if we depend on works. But it is especially
        necessary that this should be known, &#8212; that when there is a
        reliance on works, faith is reduced to nothing. And hence we also learn

        word is the truth; but a sure knowledge of God&#8217;s mercy, which is
        received from the gospel, and brings peace of conscience with regard to
        God, and rest to the mind. The sum of the matter then is this, &#8212;
        that if salvation depends on the keeping of the law, the soul can
        entertain no confidence respecting it, yea, that all the promises
        offered to us by God will become void: we must thus become wretched and

        etc. This is the winding up of the argument; and you may summarily
        include the whole of it in this statement, &#8212; &#8220;If the
        heirship of salvation comes to us by works, then faith in it vanishes,
        the promise of it is abolished; but it is necessary that both these
        should be sure and certain; hence it comes to us by faith, so that its
        stability being based on the goodness of God alone, may be secured. See
        how the Apostle, regarding faith as a thing firm and certain, considers
        hesitancy and doubt as unbelief, by which faith is abolished, and the
        promise abrogated. And yet this doubting is what the schoolmen call a
        moral conjecture, and which, alas! they substitute for faith.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>That it might be by grace</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Here, in the first place, the Apostle shows, that nothing is set
        before faith but mere grace; and this, as they commonly say, is its
        object: for were it to look on merits, absurdly would Paul infer, that
        whatever it obtains for us is gratuitous. I will repeat this again in
        other words, &#8212; &#8220;If grace be everything that we obtain by
        faith, then every regard for works is laid in the dust.&#8221; But what
        next follows more fully removes all ambiguity, &#8212; that the promise
        then only stands firm, when it recumbs on grace: for by this expression
        Paul confirms this truth, that as long as men depend on works, they are
        harassed with doubts; for they deprive themselves of what the promises
        contain. Hence, also, we may easily learn, that grace is not to be
        taken, as some imagine, for the gift of regeneration, but for a
        gratuitous favor: for as regeneration is never perfect, it can never
        suffice to pacify souls, nor of itself can it make the promise
        certain.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Not to that only which is of the law,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. Though these words mean in another place those who, being absurd
        zealots of the law, bind themselves to its yoke, and boast of their
        confidence in it, yet here they mean simply the Jewish nation, to whom
        the law of the Lord had been delivered. For Paul teaches us in another
        passage, that all who remain bound to the dominion of the law, are
        subject to a curse; it is then certain that they are excluded from the
        participation of grace. He does not then call them the servants of the
        law, who, adhering to the righteousness of works, renounce Christ; but
        they were those Jews who had been brought up in the law, and yet
        professed the name of Christ. But that the sentence may be made clearer,
        let it be worded thus, &#8212; &#8220;Not to those only who are of the
        law, but to all who imitate the faith of Abraham, though they had not
        the law before.&#8221;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Who is the father of us all,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. The relative has the meaning of a causative particle; for he meant
        to prove, that the Gentiles were become partakers of this grace,
        inasmuch as by the same oracle, by which the heirship was conferred on
        Abraham and his seed, were the Gentiles also constituted his seed: for
        he is said to have been made the father, not of one nation, but of many
        nations; by which was presignified the future extension of grace, then
        confined to Israel alone. For except the promised blessing had been
        extended to them, they could not have been counted as the offspring of
        Abraham. The past tense of the verb, according to the common usage of
        Scripture, denotes the certainty of the Divine counsel; for though
        nothing then was less apparent, yet as God had thus decreed, he is
        rightly said to have been made the father of many nations. Let the
        testimony of Moses be included in a parenthesis, that this clause,
        &#8220;Who is the father of us all,&#8221; may be connected with the
        other, &#8220;before God,&#8221; etc.: for it was necessary to explain
        also what that relationship was, that the Jews might not glory too much
        in their carnal descent. Hence he says, &#8220;He is our
        <i>father before</i> <i>God;</i>&#8221; which means the same as though
        he had said, &#8220;He is our spiritual father;&#8221; for he had this
        privilege, not from his own flesh, but from the promise of God </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f141</font></sup
      ><br /><font><b>17.</b><i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Whom he believed, who quickens the dead</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. In this circuitous form is expressed the very substance of
        Abraham&#8217;s faith, that by his example an opening might be made for
        the Gentiles. He had indeed to attain, in a wonderful way, the promise
        which he had heard from the Lord&#8217;s mouth, since there was then no
        token of it. A seed was promised to him as though he was in vigor and
        strength; but he was as it were dead. It was hence necessary for him to
        raise up his thoughts to the power of God, by which the dead are
        quickened. It was therefore not strange that the Gentiles, who were
        barren and dead, should be introduced into the same society. He then who
        denies them to be capable of grace, does wrong to Abraham, whose faith
        was sustained by this thought, &#8212; that it matters not whether he
        was dead or not who is called by the Lord; to whom it is an easy thing,
        even by a word, to raise the dead through his own power.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >We have here also a type and a pattern of the call of us all, by which
        our beginning is set before our eyes, not as to our first birth, but as
        to the hope of future life, &#8212; that when we are called by the Lord
        we emerge from nothing; for whatever we may seem to be we have not, no,
        not a spark of anything good, which can render us fit for the kingdom of
        God. That we may indeed on the other hand be in a suitable state to hear
        the call of God, we must be altogether dead in ourselves. The character
        of the divine calling is, that they who are dead are raised by the Lord,
        that they who are nothing begin to be something through his power. The
        word</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> call</i></font
      ><font>
        ought not to be confined to preaching, but it is to be taken, according
        to the usage of Scripture, for raising up; and it is intended to set
        forth more fully the power of God, who raises up, as it were by a nod
        only, whom he wills. </font

        reason, yea, when all things were against him, he yet continued to
        believe. And, doubtless, there is nothing more injurious to faith than
        to fasten our minds to our eyes, that we may from what we see, seek a
        reason for our hope. We may also read, &#8220;above hope,&#8221; and
        perhaps more suitably; as though he had said that by his faith he far
        surpassed all that he could conceive; for except faith flies upward on
        celestial wings so as to look down on all the perceptions of the flesh
        as on things far below, it will stick fast in the mud of the world. But
        Paul uses the word hope twice in this verse: in the first instance, he
        means a probable evidence for hoping, such as can be derived from nature
        and carnal reason; in the second he refers to faith given by God; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f144</font></sup
      ><font>
        for when he had no ground for hoping he yet in hope relied on the
        promise of God; and he thought it a sufficient reason for hoping, that
        the Lord had promised, however incredible the thing was in itself.</font

        time of Abraham; for Paul meant to say, that Abraham, when many
        temptations were drawing him to despair, that he might not fail, turned
        his thoughts to what had been promised to him, &#8220;Thy seed shall
        equal the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea;&#8221; but he
        resignedly adduced this quotation incomplete, in order to stimulate us
        to read the Scriptures. The Apostles, indeed, at all times, in quoting
        the Scriptures, took a scrupulous care to rouse us to a more diligent
        reading of them.</font

        >And that the body of Abraham was become through age incapable of
        generating, at the time he received the Lord&#8217;s blessing, is quite
        evident from this passage, and also from Genesis 17 and 18, so that the
        opinion of Augustine is by no means to be admitted, who says somewhere,
        that the impediment was in Sarah alone. Nor ought the absurdity of the
        objection to influence us, by which he was induced to have recourse to
        this solution; for he thought it inconsistent to suppose that Abraham in
        his hundredth year was incapable of generating, as he had afterwards
        many children. But by this very thing God rendered his power more
        visible, inasmuch as he, who was before like a dry and barren tree, was
        so invigorated by the celestial blessing, that he not only begot Isaac,
        but, as though he was restored to the vigor of age, he had afterwards
        strength to beget others. But some one may object and say, that it is
        not beyond the course of nature that a man should beget children at that
        age. Though I allow that such a thing is not a prodigy, it is yet very
        little short of a miracle. And then, think with how many toils, sorrows,
        wanderings, distresses, had that holy man been exercised all his life;
        and it must be confessed, that he was no more debilitated by age, than
        worn out and exhausted by toils. And lastly, his body is not called
        barren simply but comparatively; for it was not probable that he, who
        was unfit for begetting in the flower and vigor of age, should begin
        only now when nature had decayed.</font

        weakness of faith &#8212; one is that which, by succumbing to trying
        adversities, occasions a falling away from the supporting power of God
        &#8212; the other arises from imperfection, but does not extinguish
        faith itself: for the mind is never so illuminated, but that many relics
        of ignorance remain; the heart is never so strengthened, but that much
        doubting cleaves to it. Hence with these vices of the flesh, ignorance
        and doubt, the faithful have a continual conflict, and in this conflict
        their faith is often dreadfully shaken and distressed, but at length it
        comes forth victorious; so that they may be said to be strong even in
        weakness.</font

        this in view, &#8212; That Abraham did not try to find out, by weighing
        the matter in the balance of unbelief, whether the Lord was able to
        perform what he had promised. What is properly to inquire or to search
        into anything, is to examine it through diffidence or mistrust, and to
        be unwilling to admit what appears not credible, without thoroughly
        sifting it. </font

        He indeed asked, how it could come to pass, but that was the asking of
        one astonished; as the case was with the virgin Mary, when she inquired
        of the angel how could that be which he had announced; and there are
        other similar instances. The saints then, when a message is brought them
        respecting the works of God, the greatness of which exceeds their
        comprehension, do indeed burst forth into expressions of wonder; but
        from this wonder they soon pass on to lay hold on the power of God: on
        the contrary, the wicked, when they examine a message, scoff at and
        reject it as a fable. Such, as you will find, was the case with the
        Jews, when they asked Christ how he could give his flesh to be eaten.
        For this reason it was, that Abraham was not reproved when he laughed
        and asked, how could a child be born to a man an hundred years old, and
        to a woman of ninety; for in his astonishment he fully admitted the
        power of God&#8217;s word. On the other hand, a similar laughter and
        inquiry on the part of Sarah were not without reproof, because she
        regarded not the promise as valid.</font

        remember, that the condition of us all is the same with that of Abraham.
        All things around us are in opposition to the promises of God: He
        promises immortality; we are surrounded with mortality and corruption:
        He declares that he counts us just; we are covered with sins: He
        testifies that he is propitious and kind to us; outward judgments
        threaten his wrath. What then is to be done? We must with closed eyes

        No one indeed comes forth a conqueror from this contest, but he who
        borrows weapons and strength from the word Of God. From what he adds, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>giving glory to God</i></font
      ><font
        >, it must be observed, that no greater honor can be given to God, than
        by faith to seal his truth; as, on the other hand, no greater dishonor
        can be done to him, than to refuse his offered favor, or to discredit
        his word. It is hence the chief thing in honoring God, obediently to
        embrace his promises: and true religion begins with faith.</font
      ><br /><font><b>21.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>That what he had promised</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. As all men acknowledge God&#8217;s power, Paul seems to say
        nothing very extraordinary of the faith of Abraham; but experience
        proves, that nothing is more uncommon, or more difficult, than to
        ascribe to God&#8217;s power the honor which it deserves. There is in
        deed no obstacle, however small and insignificant, by which the flesh
        imagines the hand of God is restrained from working. Hence it is, that
        in the slightest trials, the promises of God slide away from us. When
        there is no contest, it is true, no one, as I have said, denies that God
        can do all things; but as soon as anything comes in the way to impede
        the course of God&#8217;s promise, we cast down God&#8217;s power from
        its eminence. Hence, that it may obtain from us its right and its honor,
        when a contest comes, we ought to de termine thus, &#8212; That it is no
        less sufficient to overcome the obstacles of the world, than the strong
        rays of the sun are to dissipate the mists. We are indeed wont ever to
        excuse ourselves, that we derogate nothing from God&#8217;s power,
        whenever we hesitate respecting his promises, and we commonly say,
        &#8220;The thought, that God promises more in his word than he can
        perform, (which would be a falsehood and blasphemy against him,) is by
        no means the cause of our hesitation; but that it is the defect which we
        feel in ourselves.&#8221; But we do not sufficiently exalt the power of
        God, unless we think it to be greater than our weakness. Faith then
        ought not to regard our weakness, misery, and defects, but to fix wholly
        its attention on the power of God alone; for if it depends on our
        righteousness or worthiness, it can never ascend to the consideration of
        God&#8217;s power. And it is a proof of the unbelief, of which he had
        before spoken, when we mete the Lord&#8217;s power with our own measure.
        For faith does not think that God can do all things, while it leaves him
        sitting still, but when, on the contrary, it regards his power in
        continual exercise, and applies it, especially, to the accomplishment of
        his word: for the hand of God is ever ready to execute whatever he has
        declared by his mouth.</font

        etc. It becomes now more clear, how and in what manner faith brought
        righteousness to Abraham; and that was, because he, leaning on
        God&#8217;s word, rejected not the promised favor. And this connection
        of faith with the word ought to be well understood and carefully
        remembered; for faith can bring us nothing more than what it receives
        from the word. Hence he does not become immediately just, who is imbued
        only with a general and confused idea that God is true, except he
        reposes on the promise of his favor.</font

        handed down by them, no one can derive from it sound instruction.
        Scripture alone justly claims to itself an office of this kind. For in
        the first place it prescribes general rules, by which we may test every
        other history, so as to render it serviceable to us: and in the second
        place, it clearly points out what things are to be followed, and what
        things are to be avoided. But as to doctrine, which it especially
        teaches, it possesses this peculiarity, &#8212; that it clearly reveals

        contempt of the world, and other virtues. What will serve to confirm
        faith is the help which God ever gave them, the protection which brought
        comfort in adversities, and the paternal care which he ever exercised
        over them. The judgments of God, and the punishments inflicted on the

        faith &#8212; of which the resurrection of Christ is not the smallest
        part; for it is the ground of our hope as to eternal life. Had he said
        only, that we believe in God, it could not have been so readily learnt
        how this could serve to obtain righteousness; but when Christ comes
        forth and presents to us in his own resurrection a sure pledge of life,
        it then appears evident from what fountain the imputation of
        righteousness flows.</font

      ><font>
        etc. He expands and illustrates more at large the doctrine to which I
        have just referred. It indeed greatly concerns us, not only to have our
        minds directed to Christ, but also to have it distinctly made known how
        he attained salvation for us. And though Scripture, when it treats of
        our salvation, dwells especially on the death of Christ, yet the Apostle
        now proceeds farther: for as his purpose was more explicitly to set
        forth the cause of our salvation, he mentions its two parts; and says,
        first, that our sins were expiated by the death of Christ, &#8212; and
        secondly, that by his resurrection was obtained our righteousness. But
        the meaning is, that when we possess the benefit of Christ&#8217;s death
        and resurrection, there is nothing wanting to the completion of perfect
        righteousness. By separating his death from his resurrection, he no
        doubt accommodates what he says to our ignorance; for it is also true
        that righteousness has been obtained for us by that obedience of Christ,
        which he exhibited in his death, as the Apostle himself teaches us in
        the following chapter. But as Christ, by rising from the dead, made
        known how much he had effected by his death, this distinction is
        calculated to teach us that our salvation was begun by the sacrifice, by
        which our sins were expiated, and was at length completed by his
        resurrection: for the beginning of righteousness is to be reconciled to
        God, and its completion is to attain life by having death abolished.
        Paul then means, that satisfaction for our sins was given on the cross:
        for it was necessary, in order that Christ might restore us to the
        Father&#8217;s favor, that our sins should be abolished by him; which
        could not have been done had he not on their account suffered the
        punishment, which we were not equal to endure. Hence Isaiah says, that
        the chastisement of our peace was upon him. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235305&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Isaiah 53:5.) But he says that he was delivered, and not, that he died;
        for expiation depended on the eternal goodwill of God, who purposed to
        be in this way pacified.</font

        As it would not have been enough for Christ to undergo the wrath and
        judgment of God, and to endure the curse due to our sins, without his
        coming forth a conqueror, and without being received into celestial
        glory, that by his intercession he might reconcile God to us, the
        efficacy of justification is ascribed to his resurrection, by which
        death was overcome; not that the sacrifice of the cross, by which we are
        reconciled to God, contributes nothing towards our justification, but
        that the completeness of his favor appears more clear by his coming to
        life again. </font

        life; for of that the Apostle has not begun to speak; and further, it is
        certain that both clauses refer to the same thing. For if justification
        means renovation, then that he died for our sins must be taken in the
        same sense, as signifying that he acquired for us grace to mortify the
        flesh; which no one admits. Then, as he is said to have died for our
        sins, because he delivered us from the evil of death by suffering death
        as a punishment for our sins; so he is now said to have been raised for
        our justification, because he fully restored life to us by his
        resurrection: for he was first smitten by the hand of God, that in the
        person of the sinner he might sustain the misery of sin; and then he was
        raised to life, that he might freely grant to his people righteousness
        and life. </font

        He therefore still speaks of imputative justification; and this will be

        has hitherto said of the righteousness of faith: and hence the whole of
        this chapter is taken up with amplifications, which are no less
        calculated to explain than to confirm. He had said before, that faith is
        abolished, if righteousness is sought by works; and in this case
        perpetual inquietude would disturb miserable souls, as they can find
        nothing substantial in themselves: but he teaches us now, that they are
        rendered quiet and tranquil, when we have obtained righteousness by
        faith, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>We have peace with God</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>;</i> and this is the peculiar fruit of the righteousness of faith.
        When any one strives to seek tranquillity of conscience by works, (which
        is the case with profane and ignorant men,) he labors for it in vain;
        for either his heart is asleep through his disregard or forgetfulness of
        God&#8217;s judgment, or else it is full of trembling and dread, until
        it reposes on Christ, who is alone our peace.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Then peace means tranquillity of conscience, which arises from this,
        &#8212; that it feels itself to be reconciled to God. This the Pharisee
        has not, who swells with false confidence in his own works; nor the
        stupid sinner, who is not disquieted, because he is inebriated with the
        sweetness of vices: for though neither of these seems to have a manifest
        disquietude, as he is who is smitten with a consciousness of sin; yet as
        they do not really approach the tribunal of God, they have no
        reconciliation with him; for insensibility of conscience is, as it were,
        a sort of retreating from God. Peace with God is opposed to the dead
        security of the flesh, and for this reason, &#8212; because the first
        thing is, that every one should become awakened as to the account he
        must render of his life; and no one can stand boldly before God, but he
        who relies on a gratuitous reconciliation; for as long as he is God, all
        must otherwise tremble and be confounded. And this is the strongest. of
        proofs, that our opponents do nothing but prate to no purpose, when they
        ascribe righteousness to works; for this conclusion of Paul is derived
        from this fact, &#8212; that miserable souls always tremble, except they
        repose on the grace of Christ.</font

        etc. Our reconciliation with God depends only on Christ; for he only is
        the beloved Son, and we are all by nature the children of wrath. But
        this favor is communicated to us by the gospel; for the gospel is the
        ministry of reconciliation, by the means of which we are in a manner
        brought into the kingdom of God. Rightly then does Paul set before our
        eyes in Christ a sure pledge of God&#8217;s favor, that he might more
        easily draw us away from every confidence in works. And as he teaches us
        by the word<i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>access,</i></font
      ><font>
        that salvation begins with Christ, he excludes those preparations by
        which foolish men imagine that they can anticipate God&#8217;s mercy; as
        though he said, &#8220;Christ comes not to you, nor helps you, on
        account of your merits.&#8221; He afterwards immediately subjoins, that
        it is through the continuance of the same favor that our salvation
        becomes certain and sure; by which he intimates, that perseverance is
        not founded on our power and diligence, but on Christ; though at the
        same time by saying, that we </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>stan</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>d</i>, he indicates that the gospel ought to strike deep roots into
        the hearts of the godly, so that being strengthened by its truth, they
        may stand firm against all the devices of Satan and of the flesh. And by
        the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>stand</i></font
      ><font
        >, he means, that faith is not a changeable persuasion, only for one
        day; but that it is immutable, and that it sinks deep into the heart, so
        that it endures through life. It is then not he, who by a sudden impulse
        is led to believe, that has faith, and is to be reckoned among the
        faithful; but he who constantly, and, so to speak, with a firm and fixed
        foot, abides in that station appointed to him by God, so as to cleave
        always to Christ.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>And glory in the hope</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. The reason that the hope of a future life exists and dares to
        exult, is this, &#8212; because we rest on God&#8217;s favor as on a
        sure foundation: for Paul&#8217;s meaning is, that though the faithful
        are now pilgrims on the earth, they yet by hope scale the heavens, so
        that they quietly enjoy in their own bosoms their future inheritance.
        And hereby are subverted two of the most pestilent dogmas of the
        sophists. What they do in the first place is, they bid Christians to be
        satisfied with moral conjecture as to the perception of God&#8217;s
        favor towards them; and secondly, they teach that all are uncertain as
        to their final perseverance. but except there be at present sure
        knowledge, and a firm and undoubting persuasion as to the future, who
        would dare to glory? The hope of the glory of God has shone upon us
        through the gospel, which testifies that we shall be participators of
        the Divine nature; for when we shall see God face to face, we shall be
        like him. (</font

        depresses and straitens for a time his people, that they can hardly
        breathe, and can hardly remember any source of consolation; but in a

        and even to curse his name. But when that inward meekness, which is
        infused by the Spirit of God, and the consolation, which is conveyed by
        the same Spirit, succeed in the place of our stubbornness, then
        tribulations become the means of generating patience; yea, those

        order; for he says, that patience proceeds from probation: but the
        different meaning of the word is what will reconcile both. Paul takes
        probation for the experience which the faithful have of the sure
        protection of God, when by relying on his aid they overcome all
        difficulties, even when they experience, whilst in patiently enduring
        they stand firm, how much avails the power of the Lord, which he has
        promised to be always present with his people. James takes the same word
        for tribulation itself, according to the common usage of Scripture; for
        by these God proves and tries his servants: and they are often called
        trials. </font

        God&#8217;s favor, which has ever succored us in our necessities, will
        never be wanting to us. Hence he subjoins, that from probation arises

        that is, it regards salvation as most certain. It hence appears, that
        the Lord tries us by adversities for this end, &#8212; that our
        salvation may thereby be gradually advanced. Those evils then cannot
        render us miserable, which do in a manner promote our happiness. And
        thus is proved what he had said, that the godly have reasons for
        glorying in the midst of their afflictions.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>For the love of God</i></font

        of the preceding passage. I therefore would say, &#8212; that by
        tribulations we are stimulated to patience, and that patience finds an
        experiment of divine help, by which we are more encouraged to entertain
        hope; for however we may be pressed and seem to be nearly consumed, we
        do not yet cease to feel God&#8217;s favor towards us, which affords the
        richest consolation, and much more abundant than when all things happen
        prosperously. For as that happiness, which is so in appearance, is
        misery itself, when God is adverse to and displeased with us; so when he
        is propitious, even calamities themselves will surely be turned to a
        prosperous and a joyful issue. Seeing all things must serve the will of
        the Creator, who, according to his paternal favor towards us, (as Paul
        declares in the eighth chapter,) overrules all the trials of the cross
        for our salvation, this knowledge of divine love towards us is instilled
        into our hearts to the Spirit of God; for the good things which God has
        prepared for his servants are hid from the ears and the eyes and the
        minds of men, and the Spirit alone is he who can reveal them. And the
        word<i> diffused</i>, is very emphatical; for it means that the
        revelation of divine love towards us is so abounding that it fills our
        hearts; and being thus spread through every part of them, it not only
        mitigates sorrow in adversities, but also, like a sweet seasoning, it
        renders tribulations to be loved by us. </font

      <font>He Says further, that the Spirit is </font

      ><font
        >, that is, bestowed through the gratuitous goodness of God, and not
        conferred for our merits; according to what Augustine<i> </i>has well
        observed, who, though he is mistaken in his view of the love of God,
        gives this explanation, &#8212; that we courageously bear adversities,
        and are thus confirmed in our hope, because we, having been regenerated
        by the Spirit, do love God. It is indeed a pious sentiment, but not what
        Paul means: for love is not to be taken here in an active but a passive
        sense. And certain it is, that no other thing is taught by Paul than
        that the true fountain of all love is, when the faithful are convinced
        that they are loved by God, and that they are not slightly touched with
        this conviction, but have their souls thoroughly imbued with it.</font

        to give this rendering, &#8220;In the time in which we were weak;&#8221;
        and yet I prefer this sense. An argument begins here, which is from the
        greater to the less, and which he afterwards pursues more at large: and
        though he has not woven the thread of his discourse so very distinctly,
        yet its irregular structure does not disturb the meaning. &#8220;If
        Christ,&#8221; he says, &#8220;had mercy on the ungodly, if he
        reconciled enemies to his Father, if he has done this by the virtue of
        his death, much more easily will he save them when justified, and keep
        those restored to favor in the possession of it, especially when the
        influence of his life is added to the virtue of his death.&#8221; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f157</font></sup
      ><font>
        The time of weakness some consider to be that, when Christ first began
        to be manifested to the world, and they think that those are called
        weak, who were like children under the tuition of the law. I apply the
        expression to every one of us, and I regard that time to be meant, which
        precedes the reconciliation of each one with God. For as we are all born
        the children of wrath, so we are kept under that curse until we become
        partakers of Christ. And he calls those weak, who have nothing in
        themselves but what is sinful; for he calls the same immediately
        afterwards ungodly. And it is nothing new, that weakness should be taken
        in this sense. He calls, in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461222&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >1 Corinthians 12:22, the covered parts of the body weak; and, in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471010&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >2 Corinthians 10:10, he designates his own bodily presence weak,
        because it had no dignity. And this meaning will soon again occur. When,
        therefore, we were weak, that is, when we were in no way worthy or fit
        that God should look on us, at this very time Christ died for the
        ungodly: for the beginning of religion is faith, from which they were
        all alienated, for whom Christ died. And this also is true as to the
        ancient fathers, who obtained righteousness before he died; for they
        derived this benefit from his future death. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f158</font></sup

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For a just man</i></font

        particle </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font
      ><font>
        as an affirmative or declarative rather than as a causative. The import
        of the sentence is this, &#8220;Most rare, indeed, is such an example to
        be found among men, that one dies for a just man, though this may
        sometimes happen: but let this be granted, yet for an ungodly man none
        will be found willing to die: this is what Christ has done.&#8221; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f159</font></sup
      ><font>
        Thus it is an illustration, derived from a comparison; for such an
        example of kindness, as Christ has exhibited towards us, does not exist
        among men.</font
      ><br /><font><b>8.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But God confirms,</i></font
      ><font> etc. The verb, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">suni&gt;dthsi</font
      ><font
        >, has various meanings; that which is most suitable to this place is
        that of confirming; for it was not the Apostle&#8217;s object to excite
        our gratitude, but to strengthen the trust and confidence of our souls.
        He then <i>confirms</i>, that is, exhibits his love to us as most
        certain and complete, inasmuch as for the sake of the ungodly he spared
        not Christ his own Son. In this, indeed, his love appears, that being
        not moved by love on our part, he of his own good will first loved us,
        as John tells us. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620316&gt;</font></sup
      ><font>1 John 3:16.) &#8212; Those are here called </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>sinners</i></font
      ><font
        >, (as in many other places,) who are wholly vicious and given up to
        sin, according to what is said in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430931&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >John 9:31, &#8220;God hears not sinners,&#8221; that is, men abandoned
        and altogether wicked. The woman called &#8220;a sinner,&#8221; was one
        of a shameful character. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420737&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Luke 7:37.) And this meaning appears more evident from the contrast
        which immediately follows, &#8212; </font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>for being now justified through his blood</i></font
      ><font
        >: for since he sets the two in opposition, the one to the other, and
        calls those justified who are delivered from the guilt of sin, it
        necessarily follows that those are sinners who, for their evil deeds,
        are condemned. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f160</font></sup
      ><font>
        The import of the whole is, &#8212; since Christ has attained
        righteousness for sinner by his death, much more shall he protect them,
        being now justified, from destruction. And in the last clause he applies
        to his own doctrine the comparison between the less and the greater: for
        it would not have been enough for salvation to have been once procured
        for us, were not Christ to render it safe and secure to the end. And
        this is what the Apostle now maintains; so that we ought not to fear,
        that Christ will cut off the current of his favor while we are in the
        middle of our course: for inasmuch as he has reconciled us to the
        Father, our condition is such, that he purposes more efficaciously to
        put forth and daily to increase his favor towards us.</font

        We hence have ample proofs to strengthen our hearts with confidence
        respecting our salvation. By saying that we were reconciled to God by
        the death of Christ, he means, that it was the sacrifice of expiation,
        by which God was pacified towards the world, as I have showed in the
        fourth chapter.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But the Apostle seems here to be inconsistent with himself; for if the
        death of Christ was a pledge of the divine love towards us, it follows
        that we were already acceptable to him; but he says now, that we were
        enemies. To this answer, that as God hates sin, we are also hated by him
        his far as we are sinners; but as in his secret counsel he chooses us
        into the body of Christ, he ceases to hate us: but restoration to favor
        is unknown to us, until we attain it by faith. Hence with regard to us,
        we are always enemies, until the death of Christ interposes in order to
        propitiate God. And this twofold aspect of things ought to be noticed;
        for we do not know the gratuitous mercy of God otherwise than as it
        appears from this &#8212; that he spared not his only-begotten Son; for
        he loved us at a time when there was discord between him and us: nor can
        we sufficiently understand the benefit brought to us by the death of
        Christ, except this be the beginning of our reconciliation with God,
        that we are persuaded that it is by the expiation that has been made,
        that he, who was before justly angry with us, is now propitious to us.
        since then our reception into favor is ascribed to the death of Christ,
        the meaning is, that guilt is thereby taken away, to which we should be
        otherwise exposed.</font

        glory that God is ours, whatever blessings can be imagined or wished,

        good things, but also possesses in himself the sum and substance of all

        of our salvation; and, secondly, that we may know that our trust must be

        it what is of an opposite character. For since Christ came to redeem us
        from the calamity into which Adam had fallen, and had precipitated all
        his posterity with him, we cannot see with so much clearness what we
        have in Christ, as by having what we have lost in Adam set before us,
        though all things on both sides are not similar: hence Paul subjoins an
        exception, which we shall notice in its place; and we shall also point
        out any other difference that may occur. The incompleteness of the
        sentence sometimes renders it obscure, as when the second clause, which
        answers to the former, is not expressed. But we shall endeavor to make
        both plain when we come to those parts. </font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>Sin entered into the world</i></font

        ><i>,</i> etc. Observe the order which he keeps here; for he says, that
        sin preceded, and that from sin death followed. There are indeed some
        who contend, that we are so lost through Adam&#8217;s sin, as though we
        perished through no fault of our own, but only, because he had sinned
        for us. But Paul distinctly affirms, that sin extends to all who suffer
        its punishment: and this he afterwards more fully declares, when
        subsequently he assigns a reason why all the posterity of Adam are
        subject to the dominion of death; and it is even this &#8212; because we
        have all, he says, sinned. But to sin in this case, is to become corrupt
        and vicious; for the natural depravity which we bring, from our
        mother&#8217;s womb, though it brings not forth immediately its own
        fruits, is yet sin before God, and deserves his vengeance: and this is
        that sin which they call original. For as Adam at his creation had
        received for us as well as for himself the gifts of God&#8217;s favor,
        so by falling away from the Lord, he in himself corrupted, vitiated,
        depraved, and ruined our nature; for having been divested of God&#8217;s
        likeness, he could not have generated seed but what was like himself.
        Hence we have all sinned; for we are all imbued with natural corruption,
        and so are become sinful and wicked. Frivolous then was the gloss, by
        which formerly the Pelagians endeavored to elude the words of Paul, and
        held, that sin descended by imitation from Adam to the whole human race;
        for Christ would in this case become only the exemplar and not the cause
        of righteousness. Besides, we may easily conclude, that he speaks not
        here of actual sin; for if everyone for himself contracted guilt, why
        did Paul form a comparison between Adam and Christ? It then follows that
        our innate and hereditary depravity is what is here referred to. </font

        be no transgression with out the law, it might have been doubted whether
        there were before the law any sin: that there was after the law admitted
        of no doubt. The question only refers to the time preceding the law. To
        this then he gives this answer, &#8212; that though God had not as yet
        denounced judgment by a written law, yet mankind were under a curse, and
        that from the womb; and hence that they who led a wicked and vicious
        life before the promulgation of the law, were by no means exempt from
        the condemnation of sin; for there had always been some notion of a God,
        to whom honor was due, and there had ever been some rule of
        righteousness. This view is so plain and so clear, that of itself it
        disproves every opposite notion.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>But sin is not imputed</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Without the law reproving us, we in a manner sleep in our sins;
        and though we are not ignorant that we do evil, we yet suppress as much
        as we can the knowledge of evil offered to us, at least we obliterate it
        by quickly forgetting it. While the law reproves and chides us, it
        awakens us as it were by its stimulating power, that we may return to
        the consideration of God&#8217;s judgment. The Apostle then intimates
        that men continue in their perverseness when not roused by the law, and
        that when the difference between good and evil is laid aside, they
        securely and joyfully indulge themselves, as if there was no judgment to
        come. But that before the law iniquities were by God imputed to men is
        evident from the punishment of Cain, from the deluge by which the whole
        world was destroyed, from the fate of Sodom, and from the plagues
        inflicted on Pharaoh and Abimelech on account of Abraham, and also from
        the plagues brought on the Egyptians. That men also imputed sin to one
        another, is clear from the many complaints and expostulations by which
        they charged one another with iniquity, and also from the defenses by
        which they labored to clear themselves from accusations of doing wrong.
        There are indeed many examples which prove that every man was of himself
        conscious of what was evil and of what was good: but that for the most
        part they connived at their own evil deeds, so that they imputed nothing
        as a sin to themselves unless they were constrained. When therefore he
        denies that sin without the law is imputed, he speaks comparatively; for
        when men are not pricked by the goads of the law, they become sunk in
        carelessness. </font

        >But Paul wisely introduced this sentence, in order that the Jews might
        hence more clearly learn how grievously they offended, inasmuch as the
        law openly condemned them; for if they were not exempted from punishment
        whom God had never summoned as guilty before his tribunal, what would
        become of the Jews to whom the law, like a herald, had proclaimed their
        guilt, yea, on whom it denounced judgment? There may be also another
        reason adduced why he expressly says, that sin reigned before the law,
        but was not imputed, and that is, that we may know that the cause of
        death proceeds not from the law, but is only made known by it. Hence he
        declares, that all became miserably lost immediately after the fall of
        Adam, though their destruction was only made manifest by the law. If you
        translate this adversative de, <i>though</i>, the text would run better;
        for the meaning is, that though men may indulge themselves, they cannot
        yet escape God&#8217;s judgment, even when there is no law to reprove
        them.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Death reigned from Adam</i></font

        Adam to the time when the law was promulgated, they led a licentious and
        careless life, while the difference between good and evil was willfully
        rejected, and thus, without the warning of the law, the remembrance of
        sin was buried; yea, that this availed them nothing, because sin did yet
        issue in their condemnation. It hence appears, that death even then
        reigned; for the blindness and obduracy of men could not stifle the
        judgment of God.</font

        guilty of no actual sin, die through original sin, I yet prefer to
        regard it as referring to all those who sinned without the law; for this
        verse is to be connected with the preceding clause, which says, that
        those who were without the law did not impute sin to themselves. Hence
        they sinned not after the similitude of Adam&#8217;s transgression; for
        they had not, like him, the will of God made known to them by a certain
        oracle: for the Lord had forbidden Adam to touch the fruit of the tree
        of the knowledge of good and evil; but to them he had given no command
        besides the testimony of conscience. The Apostle then intended to imply,
        that it did not happen through the difference between Adam and his
        posterity that they were exempt from condemnation. Infants are at the
        same time included in their number.</font

        This sentence is put instead of a second clause; for we see that one
        part only of the comparison is expressed, the other is omitted &#8212;
        an instance of what is called <i>anacoluthon</i>. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f165</font></sup
      ><font>
        You are then to take the meaning as though it was said, &#8220;as by one
        man sin entered into the whole world, and death through sin, so by one
        man righteousness returned, and life through righteousness.&#8221; But
        in saying that Adam bore a resemblance to Christ, there is nothing
        incongruous; for some likeness often appears in things wholly contrary.
        As then we are all lost through Adam&#8217;s sin, so we are restored
        through Christ&#8217;s righteousness: hence he calls Adam not inaptly
        the type of Christ. But observe, that Adam is not, said to be the type
        of sin, nor Christ the type of righteousness, as though they led the way
        only by their example, but that the one is contrasted with the other.
        Observe this, lest you should foolishly go astray with Origen, and be
        involved in a pernicious error; for he reasoned philosophically and
        profanely on the corruption of mankind, and not only diminished the
        grace of Christ, but nearly obliterated it altogether. The less
        excusable is Erasmus, who labors much in palliating a notion so grossly
        delirious.</font

        already introduced. The Apostle does not, however, very minutely state
        the points of difference between Christ and Adam, but he obviates errors
        into which we might otherwise easily fall, and what is needful for an
        explanation we shall add. Though he mentions oftentimes a difference,
        yet there are none of these repetitions in which there is not a want of
        a corresponding clause, or in which there is not at least an ellipsis.
        Such instances are indeed defects in a discourse; but they are not
        prejudicial to the majesty of that celestial wisdom which is taught us
        by the Apostle; it has, on the contrary, so happened through the
        providence of God, that the highest mysteries have been delivered to us
        in the garb of an humble style, </font

        reasoning, I know not whether it will be deemed by all sufficiently
        evident. It may indeed be justly inferred, that since the fall of Adam
        had such an effect as to produce the ruin of many, much more efficacious
        is the grace of God to the benefit of many; inasmuch as it is admitted,
        that Christ is much more powerful to save, than Adam was to destroy. But
        as they cannot be disproved, who wish to take the passage without this
        inference, I am willing that they should choose either of these views;
        though what next follows cannot be deemed an inference, yet it is of the
        same meaning. It is hence probable, that Paul rectifies, or by way of
        exception modifies, what he had said of the likeness between Christ and

        how absurdly the schoolmen have defined grace, who have taught that it
        is nothing else but a quality infused into the hearts of men: for grace,

        still further; for it was by no means his purpose to explain every part
        of the subject, but to state the main points. He had before declared,
        that the power of grace had surpassed that of sin: and by this he
        consoles and strengthens the faithful, and, at the same time, stimulates
        and encourages them to meditate on the benignity of God. Indeed the
        design of so studious a repetition was, &#8212; that the grace of God
        might be worthily set forth, that men might be led from self-confidence
        to trust in Christ, that having obtained his grace they might enjoy full
        assurance; and hence at length arises gratitude. The sum of the whole is
        this &#8212; that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by
        the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace
        of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the
        life which the other bestows.</font

        >The first is, that by Adam&#8217;s sin we are not condemned through
        imputation alone, as though we were punished only for the sin of
        another; but we suffer his punishment, because we also ourselves are
        guilty; for as our nature is vitiated in him, it is regarded by God as
        having committed sin. But through the righteousness of Christ we are
        restored in a different way to salvation; for it is not said to be
        accepted for us, because it is in us, but because we possess Christ
        himself with all his blessings, as given to us through the bountiful
        kindness of the Father. Hence the gift of righteousness is not a quality
        with which God endows us, as some absurdly explain it, but a gratuitous
        imputation of righteousness; for the Apostle plainly declares what he
        understood by the word <i>grace</i>. The other difference is, that the
        benefit of Christ does not come to all men, while Adam has involved his
        whole race in condemnation; and the reason of this is indeed evident;
        for as the curse we derive from Adam is conveyed to us by nature, it is
        no wonder that it includes the whole mass; but that we may come to a
        participation of the grace of Christ, we must be ingrafted in whim by
        faith. Hence, in order to partake of the miserable inheritance of sin,
        it is enough for thee to be man, for it dwells in flesh and blood; but
        in order to enjoy the righteousness of Christ it is necessary for thee
        to be a believer; for a participation of him is attained only by faith.

        For he shows that we are guilty through the offense of one man, in such
        a manner as not to be ourselves innocent. He had said before, that we
        are condemned; but that no one might claim for himself innocence, he
        also subjoined, that every one is condemned because he is a sinner. And
        then, as he declares that we are made righteous through the obedience of
        Christ, we hence conclude that Christ, in satisfying the Father, has
        provided a righteousness for us. It then follows, that righteousness is
        in Christ, and that it is to be received by us as what peculiarly
        belongs to him. He at the same time shows what sort of righteousness it
        is, by calling it obedience. And here let us especially observe what we
        must bring into God&#8217;s presence, if we seek to be justified by
        works, even obedience to the law, not to this or to that part, but in
        every respect perfect; for when a just man falls, all his former
        righteousness will not be remembered. We may also hence learn, how false
        are the schemes which they take to pacify God, who of themselves devise
        what they obtrude on him. For then only we truly worship him when we
        follow what he has commanded us, and render obedience to his word. Away
        then with those who confidently lay claim to the righteousness of works,
        which cannot otherwise exist than when there is a full and complete
        observance of the law; and it is certain that this is nowhere to be
        found. We also learn, that they are madly foolish who vaunt before God
        of works invented by themselves, which he regards as the filthiest
        things; for obedience is better than sacrifices.</font

        there was sin before the law was published. This being the case, then
        follows immediately this question &#8212; For what purpose was the law
        given? It was therefore necessary to solve this difficulty; but as a
        longer digression was not suitable, he deferred the subject and handled
        it in another place: and now by the way he only says, that the law
        entered, </font

        that sin might abound; for he describes not here the whole office and
        use of the law, but only touches on one part, which served his present
        purpose. He indeed teaches us, that it was needful that men&#8217;s ruin
        should be more fully discovered to them, in order that a passage might
        be opened for the favor of God. They were indeed shipwrecked before the
        law was given; as however they seemed to themselves to swim, while in
        their destruction, they were thrust down into the deep, that their
        deliverance might appear more evident, when they thence emerge beyond
        all human expectation. Nor was it unreasonable, that the law should be
        partly introduced for this end &#8212; that it might again condemn men
        already condemned; for nothing is more reasonable than that men should,
        through all means be brought, nay, forced, by being proved guilty, to
        know their own evils.</font

        this passage, &#8212; that lust is irritated the more, while it is
        checked by the restraints of the law; for it is man&#8217;s nature to
        strive for what is forbidden. But I understand no other increase to be
        intended here than that of knowledge and of obstinacy; for sin is set by
        the law before the eyes of man, that he may be continually forced to see
        that condemnation is prepared for him. Thus sin disturbs the conscience,
        which, when cast behind them, men forget. And farther, he who before
        only passed over the bounds of justice, becomes now, when the law is
        introduced, a despiser of God&#8217;s authority, since the will of God
        is made known to him, which he now wantonly tramples under feet. It
        hence follows, that sin is increased by the law, since now the authority
        of the lawgiver is despised and his majesty degraded. </font

        After sin has held men sunk in ruin, grace then comes to their help: for
        he teaches us, that the abundance of grace becomes for this reason more
        illustrious. &#8212; that while sin is overflowing, it pours itself
        forth so exuberantly, that it not only overcomes the flood of sin, but
        wholly absorbs it. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f179</font></sup
      ><font>
        And we may hence learn, that our condemnation is not set before us in
        the law, that we may abide in it; but that having fully known our
        misery, we may be led to Christ, who is sent to be a physician to the
        sick, a deliverer to the captives, a comforter to the afflicted, a
        defender to the oppressed. (</font

        power over men, except on account of sin; so sin executes its power by
        death: it is hence said to exercise thereby its dominion. In the last
        clause the order of the words is deranged, but yet not without reason.
        The simple contrast might have been thus formed, &#8212; &#8220;That
        righteousness may reign through Christ.&#8221; But Paul was not content
        to oppose what is contrary to what is contrary, but adds the word </font

        He had previously said, that death reigned; he now ascribes reigning to
        sin; but its end or, effect is death. And he says, that it has reigned,
        in the past tense; not that it has ceased to reign in those who are born
        only of flesh, and he thus distinguishes between Adam and Christ, and
        assigns to each his own time. Hence as soon as the grace of Christ
        begins to prevail in any one, the reign of sin and death ceases. </font

        imagine that gratuitous righteousness is given us by him, apart from
        newness of life, shamefully rend Christ asunder: nay, he goes further,
        and refers to this objection, &#8212; that there seems in this case to
        be an opportunity for the display of grace, if men continued fixed in
        sin. We indeed know that nothing is more natural than that the flesh
        should indulge itself under any excuse, and also that Satan should
        invent all kinds of slander, in order to discredit the doctrine of
        grace; which to him is by no means difficult. For since everything that
        is announced concerning Christ seems very paradoxical to human judgment,
        it ought not to be deemed a new thing, that the flesh, hearing of
        justification by faith, should so often strike, as it were, against so
        many stumbling-stones. Let us, however, go on in our course; nor let
        Christ be suppressed, because he is to many a stone of offense, and a
        rock of stumbling; for as he is for ruin to the ungodly, so he is to the
        godly for a resurrection. We ought, at the same time, ever to obviate
        unreasonable questions, lest the Christian faith should appear to
        contain anything absurd.</font

        true, that the more bountifully and abundantly will the grace of God aid
        us, the more completely we are overwhelmed with the mass of sin; then
        nothing is better for us than to be sunk into the depth of sin, and
        often to provoke God&#8217;s wrath with new offenses; for then at length
        we shall find more abounding grace; than which nothing better can be
        desired.&#8221; The refutation of this we shall here after meet

        To some the Apostle seems to have only intended indignantly to reprove a
        madness so outrageous; but it appears from other places that he commonly
        used an answer of this kind, even while carrying on a long argument; as
        indeed he does here, for he proceeds carefully to disprove the
        propounded slander. He, however, first rejects it by an indignant
        negative, in order to impress it on the minds of his readers, that
        nothing can be more inconsistent than that the grace of Christ, the
        repairer of our righteousness, should nourish our vices.</font

        etc. An argument derived from what is of an opposite character.
        &#8220;He who sins certainly lives to sin; we have died to sin through
        the grace of Christ; then it is false, that what abolishes sin gives
        vigor to it.&#8221; The state of the case is really this, &#8212; that
        the faithful are never reconciled to God without the gift of
        regeneration; nay, we are for this end justified, &#8212; that we may
        afterwards serve God in holiness of life. Christ indeed does not cleanse
        us by his blood, nor render God propitious to us by his expiation, in
        any other way than by making us partakers of his Spirit, who renews us
        to a holy life. It would then be a most strange inversion of the work of
        God were sin to gather strength on account of the grace which is offered
        to us in Christ; for medicine is not a feeder of the disease, which it
        destroys. </font

        We must further bear in mind, what I have already referred to &#8212;
        that Paul does not state here what God finds us to be, when he calls us
        to an union with his Son, but what it behoves us to be, after he has had
        mercy on us, and has freely adopted us; for by an adverb, denoting a
        future time, he shows what kind of change ought to follow
        righteousness.</font

        sin in his people, he proves here by mentioning the effect of baptism,
        by which we are initiated into his faith; for it is beyond any question,
        that we put on Christ in baptism, and that we are baptized for this end
        &#8212; that we may be one with him. But Paul takes up another principle
        &#8212; that we are then really united to the body of Christ, when his
        death brings forth in us its fruit; yea, he teaches us, that this
        fellowship as to death is what is to be mainly regarded in baptism; for
        not washing alone is set forth in it, but also the putting to death and
        the dying of the old man. It is hence evident, that when we become
        partakers of the grace of Christ, immediately the efficacy of his death
        appears. But the benefit of this fellowship as to the death of Christ is
        described in what follows. </font

        etc. He now begins to indicate the object of our having been baptized
        into the death of Christ, though he does not yet completely unfold it;
        and the object is &#8212; that we, being dead to ourselves, may become
        new creatures. He rightly makes a transition from a fellowship in death
        to a fellowship in life; for these two things are connected together by
        an indissoluble knot &#8212; that the old man is destroyed by the death
        of Christ, and that his resurrection brings righteousness, and renders
        us new creatures. And surely, since Christ has been given to us for
        life, to what purpose is it that we die with him except that we may rise
        to a better life? And hence for no other reason does he slay what is
        mortal in us, but that he may give us life again.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Let us know, that the Apostle does not simply exhort us to imitate
        Christ, as though he had said that the death of Christ is a pattern
        which all Christians are to follow; for no doubt he ascends higher, as
        he announces a doctrine, with which he connects, as it is evident, an
        exhortation; and his doctrine is this &#8212; that the death of Christ
        is efficacious to destroy and demolish the depravity of our flesh, and
        his resurrection, to effect the renovation of a better nature, and that
        by baptism we are admitted into a participation of this grace. This
        foundation being laid, Christians may very suitably be exhorted to
        strive to respond to their calling. Farther, it is not to the point to
        say, that this power is not apparent in all the baptized; for Paul,
        according to his usual manner, where he speaks of the faithful, connects
        the reality and the effect with the outward sign; for we know that
        whatever the Lord offers by the visible symbol is confirmed and ratified
        by their faith. In short, he teaches what is the real character of
        baptism when rightly received. So he testifies to the Galatians, that
        all who have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480327&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 3:27.) Thus indeed must we speak, as long as the institution
        of the Lord and the faith of the godly unite together; for we never have
        naked and empty symbols, except when our ingratitude and wickedness
        hinder the working of divine beneficence. </font

        that is, by that illustrious power by which he exhibited himself as
        really glorious, and as it were manifested the greatness of his glory.
        Thus often is the power of God, which was exercised in the resurrection
        of Christ, set forth in Scripture in sublime terms, and not without
        reason; for it is of great importance, that by so explicit a record of
        the ineffable power of God, not only faith in the last resurrection,
        which far exceeds the perception of the flesh, but also as to other
        benefits which we receive from the resurrection of Christ, should be
        highly commended to us. </font

        stated; for the similitude which he mentions leaves now nothing
        doubtful, inasmuch as grafting designates not only a conformity of
        example, but a secret union, by which we are joined to him; so that he,
        reviving us by his Spirit, transfers his own virtue to us. Hence as the
        graft has the same life or death in common with the tree into which it
        is ingrafted, so it is reasonable that we should be partakers of the
        life no less than of the death of Christ; for if we are ingrafted
        according to the likeness of Christ&#8217;s death, which was not without
        a resurrection, then our death shall not be without a resurrection. But
        the words admit of a twofold explanation, &#8212; either that we are
        ingrafted in Christ into the likeness of his death, or, that we are
        simply ingrafted in its likeness. The first reading would require the
        Greek dative </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJmoiw&gt;mati</font
      ><font
        >, to be understood as pointing out the manner; nor do I deny but that
        it has a fuller meaning: but as the other harmonizes more with
        simplicity of expression, I have preferred it; though it signifies but
        little, as both come to the same meaning. Chrysostom<i> </i>thought that
        Paul used the expression, &#8220;likeness of death,&#8221; for death, as
        he says in another place, &#8220;being made in the likeness of
        men.&#8221; But it seems to me that there is something more significant
        in the expression; for it not only serves to intimate a resurrection,
        but it seems also to indicate this &#8212; that we die not like Christ a
        natural death, but that there is a similarity between our and his death;
        for as he by death died in the flesh, which he had assumed from us, so
        we also die in ourselves, that we may live in him. It is not then the
        same, but a similar death; for we are to notice the connection between
        the death of our present life and spiritual renovation.</font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>Ingrafted</i></font

        the Apostle does not exhort, but rather teach us what benefit we derive
        from Christ; for he requires nothing from us, which is to be done by our
        attention and diligence, but speaks of the grafting made by the hand of
        God. But there is no reason why you should seek to apply the metaphor or
        comparison in every particular; for between the grafting of trees, and
        this which is spiritual, a disparity will soon meet us: in the former
        the graft draws its aliment from the root, but retains its own nature in
        the fruit; but in the latter not only we derive the vigor and
        nourishment of life from Christ, but we also pass from our own to his
        nature. The Apostle, however, meant to express nothing else but the
        efficacy of the death of Christ, which manifests itself in putting to
        death our flesh, and also the efficacy of his resurrection, in renewing
        within us a spiritual nature. </font

        death. For I do not agree with those who think that he used the word
        crucified, rather than dead, because he still lives, and is in some
        respects vigorous. It is indeed a correct sentiment, but not suitable to
        this passage. </font

        its effect. For if death destroys all the actions of life, we who have
        died to sin ought to cease from those actions which it exercised during
        its life. Take <i>justified</i> for freed or reclaimed from bondage; for
        as he is freed from the bond of a charge, who is absolved by the
        sentence of a judge; so death, by freeing us from this life, sets us
        free from all its functions. </font

        this work of God is not completed in the day in which it is begun in us;
        but it gradually goes on, and by daily advances is brought by degrees to
        its end. So then take this as the sum of the whole, &#8212; &#8220;If
        thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a
        fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy
        flesh is crucified together with all its lusts; but this fellowship is
        not to be considered as not existing, because thou findest that the
        relics of the flesh still live in thee; but its increase ought to be
        diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal.&#8221; It is
        indeed well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a
        small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is
        wielded by the Holy Spirit. There is another fellowship as to the death
        of Christ, of which the Apostle often speaks, as he does in 2
        Corinthians 4., that is, the bearing of the cross, which is followed by
        a joint-participation also of eternal life.</font

        explanation which follows, that Christ, having once risen, dies no more.
        And hereby he teaches us that newness of life is to be pursued by
        Christians as long as they live; for since they ought to represent in
        themselves an image of Christ, both by crucifying the flesh and by a
        spiritual life, it is necessary that the former should be done once for
        all, and that the latter should be carried on continually: not that the
        flesh, as we have already said, dies in us in a moment, but that we
        ought not to retrograde in the work of crucifying it. For if we roll
        again in our own filth, we deny Christ; of whom we cannot be the
        participators except through newness of life, inasmuch as he lives an
        incorruptible life.</font
      ><br /><font><b>9.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Death no more rules over him,</i></font

        etc. He seems to imply that death once ruled over Christ; and indeed
        when he gave himself up to death for us, he in a manner surrendered and
        subjected himself to its power; it was however in such a way that it was
        impossible that he should be kept bound by its pangs, so as to succumb
        to or to be swallowed up by them. He, therefore, by submitting to its
        dominion, as it were, for a moment, destroyed it for ever. Yet, to speak
        more simply, the dominion of death is to be referred to the state of
        death voluntarily undergone, which the resurrection terminated. The
        meaning is, that Christ, who now vivifies the faithful by his Spirit, or
        breathes his own life into them by his secret power from heaven, was
        freed from the dominion of death when he arose, that by virtue of the
        same dominion he might render free all his people.</font
      ><br /><font><b>10.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>He died once to sin,</i></font

        etc. What he had said &#8212; that we, according to the example of
        Christ, are for ever freed from the yoke of death, he now applies to his
        present purpose, and that is this &#8212; that we are no more subject to
        the tyranny of sin, and this he proves from the designed object of
        Christ&#8217;s death; for he died that he might destroy sin.</font

        the words must be taken when applied to us, but that he underwent death
        on account of sin, that having made himself </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;lutron</font

        offering, and by having made an expiation for sin by his blood,
        sanctified the faithful for ever; but also in order that a mutual
        likeness may exist between us. For though spiritual death makes
        continual advances in us, we are yet said properly to die only once,
        that is, when Christ, reconciling us by his blood to the Father,
        regenerates us at the same time by the power of his Spirit.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>But that he lives</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Whether you add<i> with</i> or <i>in </i>God, it comes to the
        same meaning; for he shows that Christ lives a life subject to no
        mortality in the immortal and incorruptible kingdom of God; a type of
        which ought to appear in the regeneration of the godly. We must here
        remember the particle of likeness,<i> so;</i> for he says not that we
        shall now live in heaven, as Christ lives there; but he makes the new
        life, which after regeneration we live on earth, similar to his
        celestial life. When he says that we ought to </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>die to sin</i></font
      ><font
        >, according to his example, we are not to suppose it to be the same
        kind of death; for we die to sin, when sin dies in us, but it was
        otherwise with Christ; by dying it was that he conquered sin. But he had
        just said before, that we believe that we shall have life in common with
        him, he fully shows by the word believing that he speaks of the grace of
        Christ: for if he only reminded us of a duty, his mode of speaking would
        have been this, &#8220;Since we die with Christ, we ought also to live
        with him.&#8221; But the word believing denotes that he treats here of
        doctrine which is based on the promises; as though he had said, that the
        faithful ought to feel assured that they are through the kindness of
        Christ dead as to the flesh, and that the same Christ will preserve them
        in newness of life to the end. But the future time of the verb
        <i>live</i>, refers not to the last resurrection, but simply denotes the
        continued course of a new life, as long as we peregrinate on the
        earth.</font
      ><br /><font><b>11.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>So count ye also yourselves</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Now is added a definition of that analogy to which I have
        referred. For having stated that Christ once died to sin and lives for
        ever to God, he now, applying both to us, reminds us how we now die
        while living, that is, when we renounce sin. But he omits not the other
        part, that is, how we are to live after having by faith received the
        grace of Christ: for though the mortifying of the flesh is only begun in
        us, yet the life of sin is destroyed, so that afterwards spiritual
        newness, which is divine, continues perpetually. For except Christ were
        to slay sin in us at once to the end, his grace would by no means be
        sure and durable.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The meaning, then, of the words may be thus expressed, &#8220;Take this
        view of your case, &#8212; that as Christ once died for the purpose of
        destroying sin, so you have once died, that in future you may cease from
        sin; yea, you must daily proceed with that work of mortifying, which is
        begun in you, till sin be wholly destroyed: as Christ is raised to an
        incorruptible life, so you are regenerated by the grace of God, that you
        may lead a life of holiness and righteousness, inasmuch as the power of
        the Holy Spirit, by which ye have been renewed, is eternal, and shall
        ever continue the same.&#8221; But I prefer to retain the words of
        Paul,<i> in Christ Jesus</i>, rather than to translate with Erasmus,
        <i>through Christ Jesus;</i> for thus the grafting, which makes us one
        with Christ, is better expressed.</font

        doctrine which he had delivered respecting our fellowship with Christ.
        Though sin dwells in us, it is inconsistent that it should be so
        vigorous as to exercise its reigning power; for the power of
        sanctification ought to be superior to it, so that our life may testify
        that we are really the members of Christ. I have already reminded you
        that the word <i>body </i>is not to be taken for flesh, and skin, and
        bones, but, so to speak, for the whole of what man is. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f190</font></sup
      ><font>
        This may undoubtedly be inferred from the passage; for the other clause,
        which he immediately subjoins respecting the members of the body,
        includes the soul also: and thus in a disparaging manner does Paul
        designate earthly man, for owing to the corruption of our nature we
        aspire to nothing worthy of our original. So also does God say in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010603&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Genesis 6:3; where he complains that man was become flesh like the
        brute animals, and thus allows him nothing but what is earthly. To the
        same purpose is the declaration of Christ, &#8220;What is born of the
        flesh is flesh.&#8221; (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430306&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >John 3:6.) But if any makes this objection &#8212; that the case with
        the soul is different; to this the ready answer is &#8212; that in our
        present degenerate state our souls are fixed to the earth, and so
        enslaved to our bodies, that they have fallen from their own
        superiority. In a word, the nature of man is said to be corporeal,
        because he is destitute of celestial grace, and is only a sort of empty
        shadow or image. We may add, that the body, by way of contempt, is said
        by Paul to be <i>mortal</i>, and this to teach us, that the whole nature
        of man tends to death and ruin. Still further, he gives the name of sin
        to the original depravity which dwells in our hearts, and which leads us
        to sin, and from which indeed all evil deeds and abominations stream
        forth. In the middle, between sin and us, he places lusts, as the former
        has the office of a king, while lusts are its edicts and commands.</font

        faculties are continually applied to its service. He therefore describes
        here the reign of sin by what follows it, that he might more clearly
        show what must be done by us, if we would shake off its yoke. But he
        borrows a similitude from the military office, when he calls our members

        as though he said, &#8220;As the soldier has ever his arms ready, that
        he may use them whenever he is ordered by his general, and as he never
        uses them but at his command; so Christians ought to regard all their
        faculties to be the weapons of the spiritual warfare: if then they
        employ any of their members in the indulgence of depravity, they are in
        the service of sin. But they have made the oath of soldiers to God and
        to Christ, and by this they are held bound: it hence behoves them to be
        far away from any intercourse with the camps of sin.&#8221; &#8212;
        Those may also here see by what right they proudly lay claim to the
        Christian name, who have all their members, as though they were the

        etc. It is not necessary to continue long in repeating and confuting
        expositions, which have little or no appearance of truth. There is one
        which has more probability in its favor than the rest, and it is this
        &#8212; that by<i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>law</i></font
      ><font>
        we are to understand the letter of the law, which cannot renovate the
        soul, and by </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>grace</i></font
      ><font
        >, the grace of the Spirit, by which we are freed from depraved lusts.
        But this I do not wholly approve of; for if we take this meaning, what
        is the object of the question which immediately follows, &#8220;Shall we
        sin because we are not under the law?&#8221; Certainly the Apostle would
        never have put this question, had he not understood, that we are freed
        from the strictness of the law, so that God no more deals with us
        according to the high demands of justice. There is then no doubt but
        that he meant here to indicate some freedom from the very law of God.
        But laying aside controversy, I will briefly explain my view.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It seems to me, that there is here especially a consolation offered, by
        which the faithful are to be strengthened, lest they should faint in
        their efforts after holiness, through a consciousness of their own
        weakness. He had exhorted them to devote all their faculties to the
        service of righteousness; but as they carry about them the relics of the
        flesh, they cannot do otherwise than walk somewhat lamely. Hence, lest
        being broken down by a consciousness of their infirmity they should
        despond, he seasonably comes to their aid, by interposing a consolation,
        derived from this circumstance &#8212; that their works are not now
        tested by the strict rule of the law, but that God, remitting their
        impurity, does kindly and mercifully accept them. The yoke of the law
        cannot do otherwise than tear and bruise those who carry it. It hence
        follows, that the faithful must flee to Christ, and implore him to be
        the defender of their freedom: and as such he exhibits himself; for he
        underwent the bondage of the law, to which he was himself no debtor, for
        this end &#8212; that he might, as the Apostle says, redeem those who
        were under the law.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>Hence,</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> not to be under the law</i></font
      ><font>
        means, not only that we are not under the letter which prescribes what
        involves us in guilt, as we are not able to perform it, but also that we
        are no longer subject to the law, as requiring perfect righteousness,
        and pronouncing death on all who deviate from it in any part. In like
        manner, by the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>grace</i></font
      ><font
        >, we are to understand both parts of redemption &#8212; the remission
        of sins, by which God imputes righteousness to us, &#8212; and the
        sanctification of the Spirit, by whom he forms us anew unto good works.
        The adversative particle, [</font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajlla&lt;</font
      ><font
        >, but,] I take in the sense of alleging a reason, which is not
        unfrequently the case; as though it was said &#8212; &#8220;We who are
        under grace, are not therefore under the law.&#8221;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The sense now is clear; for the Apostle intended to comfort us, lest we
        should be wearied in our minds, while striving to do what is right,
        because we still find in ourselves many imperfections. For how much
        soever we may be harassed by the stings of sin, it cannot yet overcome
        us, for we are enabled to conquer it by the Spirit of God; and then,
        being under grace, we are freed from the rigorous requirements of the
        law. We must further understand, that the Apostle assumes it as granted,
        that all who are without the grace of God, being bound under the yoke of
        the law, are under condemnation. And so we may on the other hand
        conclude, that as long as they are under the law, they are subject to
        the dominion of sin. </font

      ><br /><font><b>15.</b> </font><font color="Maroon"><i>What then</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>?</i> As the wisdom of the flesh is ever clamorous against the
        mysteries of God, it was necessary for the Apostle to subjoin what might
        anticipate an objection: for since the law is the rule of life, and has
        been given to guide men, we think that when it is removed all discipline
        immediately falls to the ground, that restraints are taken away, in a
        word, that there remains no distinction or difference between good and
        evil. But we are much deceived if we think, that the righteousness which
        God approves of in his law is abolished, when the law is abrogated; for
        the abrogation is by no means to be applied to the precepts which teach
        the right way of living, as Christ confirms and sanctions these and does
        not abrogate them; but the right view is, that nothing is taken away but
        the curse, to which all men without grace are subject. But though Paul
        does not distinctly express this, yet he indirectly intimates it.</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b><i>16.</i></b></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> By no means: know ye not?</i></font
      ><font>
        This is not a bare denial as some think, as though he preferred to
        express his abhorrence of such a question rather than to disprove it:
        for a confutation immediately follows, derived from a contrary
        supposition, and to this purpose, &#8220;Between the yoke of Christ and
        that of sin there is so much contrariety, that no one can bear them
        both; if we sin, we give ourselves up to the service of sin; but the
        faithful, on the contrary have been redeemed from the tyranny of sin,
        that they may serve Christ: it is therefore impossible for them to
        remain bound to sin.&#8221; But it will be better to examine more
        closely the course of reasoning, as pursued by Paul.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>To whom we obey</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. This relative may be taken in a causative sense, as it often is;
        as when one says, &#8212; there is no kind of crime which a parricide
        will not do, who has not hesitated to commit the greatest crime of all,
        and so barbarous as to be almost abhorred even by wild beasts. And Paul
        adduces his reason partly from the effects, and partly from the nature
        of correlatives. For first, if they obey, he concludes that they are
        servants, for obedience proves that he, who thus brings one into
        subjection to himself, has the power of commanding. This reason as to
        service is from the effect, and from this the other arises. &#8220;If
        you be servants, then of course sin has the dominion.&#8221;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Or of obedience</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. The language is not strictly correct; for if he wished to have
        the clauses correspondent, he would have said, &#8220;or of
        righteousness unto life&#8221; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f194</font></sup
      ><font>
        But as the change in the words does not prevent the understanding of the
        subject, he preferred to express what righteousness is by the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>obedience;</i></font
      ><font>
        in which however there is a metonymy, for it is to be taken for the very
        commandments of God; and by mentioning this without addition, he
        intimated that it is God alone, to whose authority consciences ought to
        be subject. Obedience then, though the name of God is suppressed, is yet
        to be referred to him, for it cannot be a divided obedience.</font
      ><br /><font><b>17.</b><i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But thanks be to God</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. This is an application of the similitude of the present subject.
        Though they were only to be reminded that they were not now the servants
        of sin, he yet adds a thanksgiving; first, that he might teach them,
        that this was not through their own merit, but through the special mercy
        of God; and secondly, that by this thanksgiving, they might learn how
        great was the kindness of God, and that they might thereby be more
        stimulated to hate sin. And he gives thanks, not as to that time during
        which they were the servants of sin, but for the liberation which
        followed, when they ceased to be what they were before. But this implied
        comparison between their former and present state is very emphatical;
        for the Apostle touches the calumniators of the grace of Christ, when he
        shows, that without grace the whole race of man is held captive under
        the dominion of sin; but that the kingdom of sin comes to an end, as
        soon as grace puts forth its power. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f195</font></sup
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >We may hence learn, that we are not freed from the bondage of the law
        that we may sin; for the law does not lose its dominion, until the grace
        of God restores us to him, in order to renew us in righteousness: and it
        is hence impossible that we should be subject to sin, when the grace of
        God reigns in us: for we have before stated, that under this term grace,
        is included the spirit of regeneration.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>You have obeyed from the heart</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Paul compares here the hidden power of the Spirit with the
        external letter of the law, as though he had said, &#8220;Christ
        inwardly forms our souls in a better way, than when the law constrains
        them by threatening and terrifying us.&#8221; Thus is dissipated the
        following calumny, &#8220;If Christ frees us from subjection to the law,
        he brings liberty to sin.&#8221; He does not indeed allow his people
        unbridled freedom, that they might frisk about without any restraint,
        like horses let loose in the fields; but he brings them to a regular
        course of life. &#8212; Though Erasmus, following the old version, has
        chosen to translate it the &#8220;form&#8221; (formam) </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>of doctrine</i></font
      ><font
        >, I have felt constrained to retain<i> type</i>, the word which Paul
        uses: some may perhaps prefer the word pattern. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f196</font></sup
      ><font>
        It seems indeed to me to denote the formed image or impress of that
        righteousness which Christ engraves on our hearts: and this corresponds
        with the prescribed rule of the law, according to which all our actions
        ought to be framed, so that they deviate not either to the right or to
        the left hand.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i> And having been made free from sin,</i></font

        etc. The meaning is, &#8220;It is unreasonable that any one, after
        having been made free, should continue in a state of bondage; for he
        ought to maintain the freedom which he has received: it is not then
        befitting, that you should be brought again under the dominion of sin,
        from which you have been set at liberty by Christ.&#8221; It is an
        argument derived from the efficient cause; another also follows, taken
        from the final cause, Ye have been liberated from the bondage of sin,
        that ye might pass into the kingdom of righteousness; it is hence right
        that you should wholly turn away from sin, and turn your minds wholly to
        righteousness, into the service of which you leave been
        transferred.&#8221;</font

        >John 3:12, that he announced earthly things, while yet he spoke of
        heavenly mysteries, though not so magnificently as the dignity of the
        things required, because he accommodated himself to the capacities of a
        people ignorant and simple. And thus the Apostle says, by way of
        preface, that he might more fully show how gross and wicked is the
        calumny, when it is imagined, that the freedom obtained by Christ gives
        liberty to sin. He reminds the faithful at the same time, that nothing
        is more unreasonable, nay, base and disgraceful, than that the spiritual
        grace of Christ should have less influence over them than earthly
        freedom; as though he had said, &#8220;I might, by comparing sin and
        righteousness, show how much more ardently ye ought to be led to render
        obedience to the latter, than to serve the former; but from regard to
        your infirmity I omit this comparison: nevertheless, though I treat you
        with great indulgence, I may yet surely make this just demand &#8212;
        that you should not at least obey righteousness more coldly or
        negligently than you served sin.&#8221; It is a sort of reticence or
        silence, a withholding of something when we wish more to be understood
        than what we express. He does yet exhort them to render obedience to
        righteousness with so much more diligence, as that which they served is
        more worthy than sin, though be seems not to require this in so many
        words. </font

        etc. He still repeats the difference, which he had before mentioned,
        between the yoke of righteousness and that of sin; for these two things,
        sin and righteousness, are so contrary, that he who devotes himself to
        the one, necessarily departs from the other. And he thus represents
        both, that by viewing them apart we may see more clearly what is to be
        expected from each; for to set things thus apart enables us to
        understand better their distinctive character. He then sets sin on one
        side, and righteousness on the other; and having stated this
        distinction, he afterwards shows what results from each of them.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >Let us then remember that the Apostle still reasons on the principle of

        sin, ye were freed from righteousness; but now a change having taken
        place, it behoves you to serve righteousness; for you have been
        liberated from the yoke of sin. He calls those<i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>free from righteousness</i></font

        who are held by no bridle to obey righteousness. This is the liberty of
        the flesh, which so frees us from obedience to God, that it makes us
        slaves to the devil. Wretched then and accursed is this liberty, which
        with unbridled or rather mad frenzy, leads us exultingly to our
        destruction.</font

        appealing to their conscience, and by confessing shame as it were in
        their person. Indeed the godly, as soon as they begin to be illuminated
        by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel, do freely
        acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without Christ, to
        have been worthy of condemnation; and so far are they from endeavouring
        to excuse it, that, on the contrary, they feel ashamed of themselves.
        Yea, further, they call to mind the remembrance of their own disgrace,
        that being thus ashamed, they may more truly and more readily be humbled
        before God.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Of which ye are now ashamed</i></font

        ><i>;</i> for he intimates that we are possessed with extreme blind love
        for ourselves, when we are involved in the darkness of our sins, and
        think not that there is so much filth in us. The light of the Lord alone
        can open our eyes to behold the filthiness which lies hid in our flesh.
        He only then is imbued with the principles of Christian philosophy, who
        has well learnt to be really displeased with himself, and to be
        confounded with shame for his own wretchedness. He shows at last still
        more plainly from what was to follow, how much they ought to have been
        ashamed, that is, when they came to understand that they had been
        standing on the very precipice of death, and had been nigh destruction;
        yea, that they would have already entered the gates of death, had they
        not been reclaimed by God&#8217;s mercy.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Ye have your fruit unto holiness</i></font
      ><font

        as to righteousness. Sin in this life brings the torments of an accusing
        conscience, and in the next eternal death. We now gather the fruit of
        righteousness, even holiness; we hope in future to gain eternal life.
        These things, unless we are beyond measure stupid, ought to generate in
        our minds a hatred and horror of sin, and also a love and desire for
        righteousness. Some render </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">telov</font
      ><font
        >, &#8220;tribute&#8221; or reward, and not &#8220;end,&#8221; but not,
        as I think, according to the meaning of the Apostle; for though it is
        true that we bear the punish- ment of death on account of sin, yet this
        word is not suitable to the other clause, to which it is applied by
        Paul, inasmuch as life cannot be said to be the tribute or reward of
        righteousness.</font
      ><br /><font><b>23.</b></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> For the wages of sin</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. There are those who think that, Paul, by comparing death to
        allowances of meat, (<i>obsoniis</i>,) points out in a disparaging
        manner the kind of wretched reward that is allotted to sinners, as this
        word is taken by the Greeks sometimes for portions allowed to soldiers.
        But he seems rather indirectly to condemn the blind appetites of those
        who are ruinously allured by the enticements of sin, as the fish are by
        the hook. It will however be more simple to render the word
        &#8220;wages,&#8221; for surely death is a sufficiently ample reward to
        the wicked. This verse is a conclusion to the former, and as it were an
        epilogue to it. He does not, however, in vain repeat the same thing
        again; but by doubling the terror, he intended to render sin an object
        of still greater hatred.</font

        They are mistaken who thus render the sentence, &#8220;Eternal life is
        the gift of God,&#8221; as though eternal life were the subject, and the
        gift of God the predicate; for this does not preserve the contrast. But
        as he has already taught us, that sin produces nothing but death; so now
        he subjoins, that this gift of God, even our justification and
        sanctification, brings to us the happiness of eternal life. Or, if you
        prefer, it may be thus stated, &#8212; &#8220;As the cause of death is
        sin, so righteousness, which we obtain through Christ, restores to us
        eternal life.&#8221;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It may however be hence inferred with certainty, that our salvation is
        altogether through the grace and mere beneficence of God. He might
        indeed have used other words &#8212; that the wages of righteousness is
        eternal life; and then the two clauses would correspond: but he knew
        that it is through God&#8217;s gift we obtain it, and not through our
        own merits; and that it is not one or a single gift; for being clothed
        with the righteousness of the Son, we are reconciled to God, and we are
        by the power of the Spirit renewed unto holiness. And he adds,
        <i>in Christ Jesus</i>, and for this reason, that he might call us away
        from every conceit respecting our own worthiness.</font

        respecting the abrogation of the law; yet as it was a difficult one, and
        might have given rise to many other questions, he now shows more at
        large how the law, with regard to us, is become abrogated; and then he
        sets forth what good is thereby done to us: for while it holds us
        separated from Christ and bound to itself, it can do nothing but condemn
        us. And lest any one should on this account blame the law itself, he
        takes up and confutes the objections of the flesh, and handles, in a
        striking manner, the great question respecting the use of the law. </font

        etc. Let the general proposition be that the law was given to men for no
        other end but to regulate the present life, and that it belongs not to
        those who are dead: to this he afterwards subjoins this truth &#8212;
        that we are dead to it through the body of Christ. Some understand, that
        the dominion of the law continues so long to bind us as it remains in
        force. But as this view is rather obscure, and does not harmonize so
        well with the proposition which immediately follows, I prefer to follow
        those who regard what is said as referring to the life of man, and not
        to the law. The question has indeed a peculiar force, as it affirms the
        certainty of what is spoken; for it shows that it was not a thing new or
        unknown to any of them, but acknowledged equally by them all.</font

        This parenthesis is to be taken in the same sense with the question, as
        though he had said &#8212; that he knew that they were not so unskilful
        in the law as to entertain any doubt on the subject. And though both
        sentences might be understood of all laws, it is yet better to take them
        as referring to the law of God, which is the subject that is discussed.
        There are some who think that he ascribes knowledge of the law to the
        Romans, because the largest part of the world was under their power and
        government; but this is puerile: for he addressed in part the Jews or
        other strangers, and in part common and obscure individuals; nay, he
        mainly regarded the Jews, with whom he had to do respecting the
        abrogation of the law: and lest they should think that he was dealing
        captiously with them, he declares that he took up a common principle,
        known to them all, of which they could by no means be ignorant, who had
        from their childhood been brought up in the teaching of the law.</font

        etc. He brings a similitude, by which he proves, that we are so loosed
        from the law, that it does not any longer, properly and by its own
        right, retain over us any authority: and though he could have proved
        this by other reasons, yet as the example of marriage was very suitable
        to illustrate the subject, he introduced this comparison instead of
        evidence to prove his point. But that no one may be puzzled, because the
        different parts of the comparison do not altogether correspond, we are
        to be reminded, that the Apostle designedly intended, by a little
        change, to avoid the invidiousness of a stronger expression. He might
        have said, in order to make the comparison complete, &#8220;A woman
        after the death of her husband is loosed from the bond of marriage: the
        law, which is in the place of a husband to us, is to us dead; then we
        are freed from its power.&#8221; But that he might not offend the Jews
        by the asperity of his expressions, had he said that the law was dead,
        he adopted a digression, and said, that we are dead to the law </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f201</font></sup
      ><font>
        To some indeed he appears to reason from the less to the greater:
        however, as I fear that this is too strained, I approve more of the
        first meaning, which is simpler. The whole argument then is formed in
        this manner &#8220;The woman is bound to her living husband by the law,
        so that she cannot be the wife of another; but after the death of her
        husband she is loosed from the bond of his law so, that she is free to
        marry whom she pleases.&#8221;</font

        >But further, the word law is not mentioned here in every part in the
        same sense: for in one place it means the bond of marriage; in another,
        the authority of a husband over his wife; and in another, the law of
        Moses: but we must remember, that Paul refers here only to that office
        of the law which was peculiar to the dispensation of Moses; for as far
        as God has in the ten commandments taught what is just and right, and
        given directions for guiding our life, no abrogation of the law is to be
        dreamt of; for the will of God must stand the same forever. We ought
        carefully to remember that this is not a release from the righteousness
        which is taught in the law, but from its rigid requirements, and from
        the curse which thence follows. The law, then, as a rule of life, is not
        abrogated; but what belongs to it as opposed to the liberty obtained
        through Christ, that is, as it requires absolute perfection: for as we
        render not this perfection, it binds to under the sentence of eternal
        death. But as it was not his purpose to decide here the character of the
        bond of marriage, he was not anxious to mention the causes which
        releases a woman from her husband. It is therefore unreasonable that
        anything decisive on this point should be sought here.</font
      ><br /><font><b>4.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Through the body of Christ.</i></font
      ><font>
        Christ, by the glorious victory of the cross, first triumphed over sin;
        and that he might do this, it was necessary that the handwriting, by
        which we were held bound, should be cancelled. This handwriting was the
        law, which, while it continued in force, rendered us bound to serve </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f202</font></sup
      ><font>
        sin; and hence it is called the power of sin. It was then by cancelling
        this handwriting that we were delivered through the body of Christ
        &#8212; through his body as fixed to the cross. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f203</font></sup
      ><font>
        But the Apostle goes farther, and says, that the bond of the law was
        destroyed; not that we may live according to our own will, like a widow,
        who lives as she pleases while single; but that we may be now bound to
        another husband; nay, that we may pass from hand to hand, as they say,
        that is, from the law to Christ. He at the same time softens the
        asperity of the expression, by saying that Christ, in order to join us
        to his own body, made us free from the yoke of the law. For though
        Christ subjected himself for a time of his own accord to the law, it is
        not yet right to say that the law ruled over him. Moreover, he conveys
        to his own members the liberty which he himself possesses. It is then no
        wonder that he exempts those from the yoke of the law, whom he unites by
        a sacred bond to himself, that they may be one body in him.</font

        lest any freedom should be pretended without him, or lest any, being not
        yet dead to the law, should dare to divorce himself from it. But he
        adopts here a periphrastic sentence to denote the eternity of that life
        which Christ attained by his resurrection, that Christians might know
        that this connection is to be perpetual. But of the spiritual marriage
        between Christ and his Church he speaks more fully in Ephesians 6.</font

        He ever annexes the final cause, lest any should indulge the liberty of
        their flesh and their own lusts, under the pretense that Christ has
        delivered them from the bondage of the law; for he has offered us,
        together with himself, as a sacrifice to the Father, and he regenerates
        us for this end &#8212; that by newness of life we may bring forth fruit
        unto God: and we know that the fruits which our heavenly Father requires
        from us are those of holiness and righteousness. It is indeed no
        abatement to our liberty that we serve God; nay, if we desire to enjoy
        so great a benefit as there is in Christ, it will not henceforth be
        right in us to entertain any other thought but that of promoting the
        glory of God; for which purpose Christ has connected us with himself. We
        shall otherwise remain tle bond-slaves, not only of the law, but also of
        sin and of death.</font

        etc. He shows still more clearly by stating the contrary effect, how
        unreasonably the zealots of the law acted, who would still detain the
        faithful under it dominion; for as long as the literal teaching of the
        law, unconnected with the Spirit of Christ, rules and bears sway, the
        wantonness of the flesh is not restrained, but, on the contrary, breaks
        out and prevails. It hence follows, that the kingdom of righteousness is
        not established, except when Christ emancipates us from the law. Paul at
        the same time reminds us of the works which it becomes us to do, when
        set free from the law. As long, then, as man is kept under the yoke of
        the law, he can, as he is sinning continually, procure nothing for
        himself but death. Since bondage to the law produces sin only, then
        freedom, its opposite, must tend to righteousness; if the former leads
        to death, then the latter leads to life. But let us consider the very
        words of Paul.</font

      ><font
        >. We hence understand, that all those who are under the law attain
        nothing else but this &#8212; that their ears are struck by its external
        sound without any fruit or effect, while they are inwardly destitute of
        the Spirit of God. They must therefore necessarily remain altogether
        sinful and perverse, until a better remedy succeeds to heal their
        diseases. Observe also this usual phrase of Scripture, to
        <i>be in the flesh;</i> it means to be endued only with the gifts of
        nature, without that peculiar grace with which God favors his chosen
        people. But if this state of life is altogether sinful, it is evident
        that no part of our soul is naturally sound, and that the power of free
        will is no other than the power of casting evil emotions as darts into
        all the faculties of the soul. </font

        their influence through all our faculties; for there is no part which is
        not subject to these depraved passions. What the law does, in the
        absence of the inward teacher, the Spirit, is increasingly to inflame
        our hearts, so that they boil up with lusts. But observe here, that the
        law is connected with the vicious nature of man, the perversity of
        which, and its lusts, break forth with greater fury, the more they are
        checked by the restraints of righteousness. He further adds, that as
        long as the emotions of the flesh were under the dominion of the law
        they brought forth fruit to death; and he adds this to show that the law
        by itself is destructive. It hence follows, that they are infatuated,
        who so much desire this bondage which issues in death.</font

        things, &#8212; &#8220;If the restraint of the law availed so little to
        bridle the flesh, that it became rather the exciter of sin; then, that
        we may cease from sin, we must necessarily be freed from the law.&#8221;
        Again, &#8220;If we are freed from the bondage of the law for this end,
        that we may serve God; then, perversely do they act who hence take the
        liberty to indulge in sin; and falsely do they speak who teach, that by
        this means loose reins are given to lusts.&#8221; Observe, then, that we

        exactions and curse, and endues us with his Spirit, through whom we walk

        order that we may serve God in newness of spirit, it seemed as though
        this evil belonged to the law, &#8212; that it leads us to sin. But as
        this would be above measure inconsistent, the Apostle rightly undertook
        to disprove it. Now when he adds, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Is the law sin?</i></font
      ><font>
        what he means is, &#8220;Does it so produce sin that its guilt ought to
        be imputed to the law?&#8221; &#8212; </font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>But sin I knew not, except through the law</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>;</i> sin then dwells in us, and not in the law; for the cause of it
        is the depraved lust of our flesh, and we come to know it by the
        knowledge of God&#8217;s righteousness, which is revealed to us in the
        law. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f208</font></sup
      ><font>
        You are not indeed to understand, that no difference whatever can be
        known between right and wrong without the law; but that without the law
        we are either too dull of apprehension to discern our depravity, or that
        we are made wholly insensible through self-flattery, according to what
        follows, &#8212;</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>For coveting I had not known,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. This is then an explanation of the former sentence, by which he
        proves that ignorance of sin, of which he had spoken, consisted in this
        &#8212; that he perceived not his own coveting. And he designedly
        referred to this one kind of sin, in which hypocrisy especially
        prevails, which has ever connected with itself supine self-indulgence
        and false assurance. For men are never so destitute of judgment, but
        that they retain a distinction in external works; nay, they are
        constrained even to condemn wicked counsels and sinister purposes: and
        this they cannot do, without ascribing to a right object its own praise.
        But coveting is more hidden and lies deeper; hence no account is made of
        it, as long as men judge according to their perceptions of what is
        outward. He does not indeed boast that he was free from it; but he so
        flattered himself, that he did not think that this sin was lurking in
        his heart. For thou do for a time he was deceived, and believed not that
        righteousness would be violated by coveting, he yet, at length,
        understood that he was a sinner, when he saw that coveting, from which
        no one is free, was prohibited by the law.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Augustine says, that Paul included in this expression the whole law;
        which, when rightly understood, is true: for when Moses had stated the
        things from which we must abstain, that we may not wrong our neighbor,
        he subjoined this prohibition as to coveting, which must be referred to
        all the things previously forbidden. There is no doubt but that he had
        in the former precepts condemned all the evil desires which our hearts
        conceive; but there is much difference between a deliberate purpose, and
        the desires by which we are tempted. God then, in this last command,
        requires so much integrity from us, that no vicious lust is to move us
        to evil, even when no consent succeeds. Hence it was, that I have said,
        that Paul here ascends higher than where the understanding of men can
        carry them. But civil laws do indeed declare, that intentions and not
        issues are to be punished. Philosophers also, with greater refinement,
        place vices as well as virtues in the soul. But God, by this precept,
        goes deeper and notices coveting, which is more hidden than the will;
        and this is not deemed a vice. It was pardoned not only by philosophers,
        but at this day the Papists fiercely contend, that it is no sin in the
        regenerate. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f209</font></sup
      ><font>
        But Paul says, that he had found out his guilt from this hidden disease:
        it hence follows, that all those who labor under it, are by no means
        free from guilt, except God pardons their sin. We ought, at the same
        time, to remember the difference between evil lustings or covetings
        which gain consent, and the lusting which tempts and moves our hearts,
        but stops in the midst of its course.</font
      ><br /><font><b>8.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But an occasion being taken</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. From sin, then, and the corruption of the flesh, proceeds every
        evil; the law is only the occasion. And though he may seem to speak only
        of that excitement, by which our lusting is instigated through the law,
        so that it boils out with greater fury; yet I refer this chiefly to the
        knowledge the law conveys; as though he had said, &#8220;It has
        discovered to me every lust or coveting which, being hid, seemed somehow
        to have no existence.&#8221; I do not yet deny, but that the flesh is
        more sharply stimulated to lusting by the law, and also by this means
        more clearly shows itself; which may have been also the case with Paul:
        but what I have said of the knowledge it brings, seems to harmonize
        better with the context; </font

        etc. He expresses most clearly the meaning of his former words; for it
        is the same as though he had said, that the knowledge of sin without the
        law is buried. It is a general truth, which he presently applies to his
        own case. I hence wonder what could have come into the minds of
        interpreters to render the passage in the preterimperfect tense, as
        though Paul was speaking of himself; for it is easy to see that his
        purpose was to begin with a general proposition, and then to explain the
        subject by his own example.</font
      ><br /><font><b>9.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For I was alive,</i></font

        etc. He means to intimate that there had been a time when sin was dead
        to him or in him. But he is not to be understood as though he had been
        without law at any time, but this word</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> I was alive</i></font
      ><font>
        has a peculiar import; for it was the absence of the law that was the
        reason why he was alive; that is, why he being inflated with a conceit
        as to his own righteousness, claimed life to himself while he was yet
        dead. That the sentence may be more clear, state it thus, &#8220;When I
        was formerly without the law, I was alive.&#8221; But I have said that
        this expression is emphatic; for by imagining himself great, he also
        laid claim to life. The meaning then is this, &#8220;When I sinned,
        having not the knowledge of the law, the sin, which I did not observe,
        was so laid to sleep, that it seemed to be dead; on the other hand, as I
        seemed not to myself to be a sinner, I was satisfied with myself,
        thinking that I had a life of mine own.&#8221; But the death of sin is
        the life of man, and again the life of sin is the death of man.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It may be here asked, what time was that when through his ignorance of
        the law, or as he himself says, through the absence of it, he
        confidently laid claim to life. It is indeed certain, that he had been
        taught the doctrine of the law from his childhood; but it was the
        theology of the letter, which does not humble its disciples, for as he
        says elsewhere, the veil interposed so that the Jews could not see the
        light of life in the law; so also he himself, while he had his eyes
        veiled, being destitute of the Spirit of Christ, was satisfied with the
        outward mask of righteousness. Hence he represents the law as absent,
        though before his eyes, while it did not really impress him with the
        consciousness of God&#8217;s judgment. Thus the eyes of hypocrites are
        covered with a veil, that they see not how much that command requires,
        in which we are forbidden to lust or covet.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>But when the commandment came,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. So now, on the other hand, he sets forth the law as coming when it
        began to be really understood. It then raised sin as it were from be
        dead; for it discovered to Paul how great depravity abounded in the
        recesses of his heart, and at the same time it slew him. We must ever
        remember that he speaks of that inebriating confidence in which
        hypocrites settle, while they flatter themselves, because they overlook
        their sins.</font
      ><br /><font><b>10.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Was found by me,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. Two things are stated here &#8212; that the commandment shows to us
        a way of life in the righteousness of God, and that it was given in
        order that we by keeping the law of the Lord might obtain eternal life,
        except our corruption stood in the way. But as none of us obey the law,
        but, on the contrary, are carried headlong on our feet and hands into
        that kind of life from which it recalls us, it can bring us nothing but
        death. We must thus distinguish between the character of the law and our
        own wickedness. It hence follows, that it is incidental that the law
        inflicts on us a deadly wound, as when an incurable disease is more
        exasperated by a healing remedy. I indeed allow that it is an
        inseparable incident, and hence the law, as compared with the gospel, is
        called in another place the ministration of death; but still this
        remains unaltered, that it is not in its own nature hurtful to us, but
        it is so because our corruption provokes and draws upon us its
        curse.</font
      ><br /><font><b>11.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Led me out of the way,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. It is indeed true, that while the will of God is hid from us, and
        no truth shines on us, the life of men goes wholly astray and is full of
        errors; nay, we do nothing but wander from the right course, until the
        law shows to us the way of living rightly: but as we begin then only to
        perceive our erroneous course, when the Lord loudly reproves us, Paul
        says rightly, that we are led out of the way, when sin is made evident
        by the law. Hence the verb, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejxapata~|n</font
      ><font
        >, must be understood, not of the thing itself, but of our knowledge;
        that is, that it is made manifest by the law how much we have departed
        from the right course. It must then be necessarily rendered, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>led me out of the way</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>;</i> for hence sinners, who before went on heedlessly, loathe and
        abominate themselves, when they perceive, through the light which the
        law throws on the turpitude of sin, that they had been hastening to
        death. But he away introduces the word occasion, and for this purpose
        &#8212; that we may know that the law of itself does not bring death,
        but that this happens through something else, and that this is as it
        were adventitious. </font

        says, that the law itself and whatever is commanded in the law, is </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>holy</i></font
      ><font
        >, and therefore to be regarded with the highest reverence, &#8212; that

        is </font

      ><font>
        and hence pure and free from everything that can do harm. He thus
        defends the law against every charge of blame, that no one should
        ascribe to it what is contrary to goodness, justice, and holiness.</font

        etc. He had hitherto defended the law from calumnies, but in such a
        manner, that it still remained doubtful whether it was the cause of
        death; nay, the minds of men were on this point perplexed, &#8212; how
        could it be that nothing but death was gained from singular a gift of
        God. To this objection then he now gives an answer; and he denies, that
        death proceeds from the law, though death through its means is brought
        on us by sin. And though this answer seems to militate in appearance
        against what he had said before &#8212; that he had found the
        commandment, which was given for life, to be unto death, there is yet no
        contrariety. He had indeed said before, that it is through our
        wickedness that the law is turned to our destruction, and that contrary
        to its own character; but here he denies, that it is in such a sense the
        cause of death, that death is to be imputed to it. In 2 Corinthians 3 he
        treats more fully of the law. He there calls it the ministration of
        death; but he so calls it according to what is commonly done in a
        dispute, and represents, not the real character of the law, but the
        false opinion of his opponents. </font

        etc. With no intention to offend others, I must state it as my opinion,
        that this passage ought to be read as I have rendered it, and the
        meaning is this, &#8212; &#8220;Sin is in a manner regarded as just
        before it is discovered by the law; but when it is by the law made
        known, then it really obtains its own name of sin; and hence it appears
        the more wicked, and, so to speak, the more sinful, because it turns the
        goodness of the law, by perverting it, to our destruction; for that must
        be very pestiferous, which makes what is in its own nature salutary to
        be hurtful to us.&#8221; The import of the whole is &#8212; that it was
        necessary for the atrocity of sin to be discovered by the law; for
        except sin had burst forth into outrageous, or, as they say, into
        enormous excess, it would not have been acknowledged as sin; and the
        more outrageous does its enormity appear, when it converts life into
        death; and thus every excuse is taken away from it. </font

        etc. He now begins more closely to compare the law with what man is,
        that it may be more clearly understood whence the evil of death
        proceeds. He then sets before us an example in a regenerate man, in whom
        the remnants of the flesh are wholly contrary to the law of the Lord,
        while the spirit would gladly obey it. But first, as we have said, he
        makes only a comparison between nature and the law. Since in human
        things there is no greater discord than between spirit and flesh, the
        law being spiritual and man carnal, what agreement can there be between
        the natural man and the law? Even the same as between darkness and
        light. But by calling the law </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>spiritual</i></font
      ><font
        >, he not only means, as some expound the passage, that it requires the
        inward affections of the heart; but that, by way of contrast, it has a

      ><font>. </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f217</font></sup
      ><font>
        These interpreters give this explanation, &#8220;The law is spiritual,
        that is, it binds not only the feet and hands as to external works, but
        regards the feelings of the heart, and requires the real fear of
        God.&#8221;</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But here a contrast is evidently set forth between the flesh and the
        spirit. And further, it is sufficiently clear from the context, and it
        has been in fact already shown, that under the term flesh is included
        whatever men bring from the womb; and flesh is what men are called, as
        they are born, and as long as they retain their natural character; for
        as they are corrupt, so they neither taste nor desire anything but what
        is gross and earthly. Spirit, on the contrary, is renewed nature, which
        God forms anew after his own image. And this mode of speaking is adopted
        on this account &#8212; because the newness which is wrought in us is
        the gift of the Spirit.</font

        But the exposition of Origen, which indeed has been approved by many
        before our time, is not worthy of being refuted; he says, that the law
        is called spiritual by Paul, because the Scripture is not to be
        understood literally. What has this to do with the present
        subject?</font

    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Sold under sin.</i></font
      ><font>
        By this clause he shows what flesh is in itself; for man by nature is no
        less the slave of sin, than those bondmen, bought with money, whom their
        masters ill treat at their pleasure, as they do their oxen and their
        asses. We are so entirely controlled by the power of sin, that the whole
        mind, the whole heart, and all our actions are under its influence.
        Compulsion I always except, for we sin spontaneously, as it would be no
        sin, were it not voluntary. But we are so given up to sin, that we can
        do willingly nothing but sin; for the corruption which bears rule within
        us thus drives us onward. Hence this comparison does not import, as they
        say, a forced service, but a voluntary obedience, which an inbred
        bondage inclines us to render.</font
      ><br /><font><b>15.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For what I do I know not</i></font

        regenerated; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f219</font></sup
      ><font>
        in whom both the things which he had in view appear more clearly; and
        these were, &#8212; the great discord there is between the Law of God
        and the natural man, &#8212; and how the law does not of itself produce
        death. For since the carnal man rushes into sin with the whole
        propensity of his mind, he seems to sin with such a free choice, as
        though it were in his power to govern himself; so that a most pernicious
        opinion has prevailed almost among all men &#8212; that man, by his own
        natural strength, without the aid of Divine grace, can choose what he
        pleases. But though the will of a faithful man is led to good by the
        Spirit of God, yet in him the corruption of nature appears
        conspicuously; for it obstinately resists and leads to what is contrary.
        Hence the case of a regenerated man is the most suitable; for by this
        you may know how much is the contrariety between our nature and the
        righteousness of the law. From this case, also, a proof as to the other
        clause may more fitly be sought, than from the mere consideration of
        human nature; for the law, as it produces only death in a man wholly
        carnal, is in him more easily impeached, for it is doubtful whence the
        evil proceeds. In a regenerate man it brings forth salutary fruits; and
        hence it appears, that it is the flesh only that prevents it from giving
        life: so far it is from producing death of itself.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >That the whole, then, of this reasoning may be more fully and more
        distinctly understood, we must observe, that this conflict, of which the
        Apostle speaks, does not exist in man before he is renewed by the Spirit
        of God: for man, left to his own nature, is wholly borne along by his
        lusts without any resistance; for though the ungodly are tormented by
        the stings of conscience, and cannot take such delight in their vices,
        but that they have some taste of bitterness; yet you cannot hence
        conclude, either that evil is hated, or that good is loved by them; only
        the Lord permits them to be thus tormented, in order to show to them in
        a measure his judgment; but not to imbue them either with the love of
        righteousness or with the hatred of sin.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >There is then this difference between them and the faithful &#8212;
        that they are never so blinded and hardened, but that when they are
        reminded of their crimes, they condemn them in their own conscience; for
        knowledge is not so utterly extinguished in them, but that they still
        retain the difference between right and wrong; and sometimes they are
        shaken with such dread under a sense of their sin, that they bear a kind
        of condemnation even in this life: nevertheless they approve of sin with
        all their heart, and hence give themselves up to it without any feeling
        of genuine repugnance; for those stings of conscience, by which they are
        harassed, proceed from opposition in the judgment, rather than from any
        contrary inclination in the will. The godly, on the other hand, in whom
        the regeneration of God is begun, are so divided, that with the chief
        desire of the heart they aspire to God, seek celestial righteousness,
        hate sin, and yet they are drawn down to the earth by the relics of
        their flesh: and thus, while pulled in two ways, they fight against
        their own nature, and nature fights against them; and they condemn their
        sins, not only as being constrained by the judgment of reason, but
        because they really in their hearts abominate them, and on their account
        loathe themselves. This is the Christian conflict between the flesh and
        the spirit of which Paul speaks in </font

        division then immediately begins for the first time, when he is called

        this life; the relics of the flesh which remain, always follow their own
        corrupt propensities, and thus carry on a contest against the
        Spirit.</font

        man by nature is here described; and indeed there is a similar
        description of human nature given to us by the Philosophers: but
        Scripture philosophizes much deeper; for it finds that nothing has
        remained in the heart of man but corruption, since the time in which
        Adam lost the image of God. So when the Sophisters wish to define
        free-will, or to form an estimate of what the power of nature can do,
        they fix on this passage. But Paul, as I have said already, does not
        here set before us simply the natural man, but in his own person
        describes what is the weakness of the faithful, and how great it is.
        Augustine<i> </i>was for a time involved in the common error; but after
        having more clearly examined the passage, he not only retracted what he
        had falsely taught, but in his first book to Boniface, he proves, by
        many strong reasons, that what is said cannot be applied to any but to
        the regenerate. And we shall now endeavor to make our readers clearly to
        see that such is the case.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>I know not.</i></font

        He means that he acknowledges not as his own the works which he did
        through the weakness of the flesh, for he hated them. And so Erasmus has
        not unsuitably given this rendering, &#8220;I approve not,&#8221; (<i
          >non probo</i
        >.) </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f220</font></sup
      ><font>
        We hence conclude, that the doctrine of the law is so consentaneous to
        right judgment, that the faithful repudiate the transgression of it as a
        thing wholly unreasonable. But as Paul seems to allow that he teaches
        otherwise than what the law prescribes, many interpreters have been led
        a astray, and have thought that he had assumed the person of another;
        hence has arisen the common error, that the character of an unregenerate
        man is described throughout this portion of the chapter. But Paul, under
        the idea of transgressing the law, includes all the defects of the
        godly, which are not inconsistent with the fear of God or with the
        endeavor of acting uprightly. And he denies that he did what the law
        demanded, for this reason, because he did not perfectly fulfil it, but
        somewhat failed in his effort.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>For not what 1 desire,</i></font

        etc. You must not understand that it was always the case with him, that
        he could not do good; but what he complains of is only this &#8212; that
        he could not perform what he wished, so that he pursued not what was
        good with that alacrity which was meet, because he was held in a manner
        bound, and that he also failed in what he wished to do, because he
        halted through the weakness of the flesh. Hence the pious mind performs
        not the good it desires to do, because it proceeds not with due
        activity, and doeth the evil which it would not; for while it desires to
        stand, it falls, or at least it staggers. But the expressions to will
        and not to will must be applied to the Spirit, which ought to hold the
        first place in all the faithful. The flesh indeed has also its own will,
        but Paul calls that the will which is the chief desire of the heart; and
        that which militates with it he represents as being contrary to his
        will.</font

        being our teacher, that no evil ought to be imputed to the law; nay,
        that it would be salutary to men, were it to meet with upright and pure
        hearts.&#8221; But this consent is not to be understood to be the same

        of this kind, &#8220;I see better things and approve of them; I follow
        the worse.&#8221; Again, &#8220;What is hurtful I follow; I shun what I
        believe would be profitable.&#8221; For these act under a constraint
        when they subscribe to the righteousness of God, as their will is wholly
        alienated from it, but the godly man consents to the law with the real

        the blame on the flesh; but it is a declaration, by which he shows how
        very far he dissented from his own flesh in his spiritual feeling; for
        the faithful are carried along in their obedience to God with such
        fervour of spirit that they deny the flesh.</font

        the godly, who have been already born again; for as long as man remains
        like himself, whatsoever he may be, he is justly deemed corrupt; but
        Paul here denies that he is wholly possessed by sin; nay, he declares
        himself to be exempt from its bondage, as though he had said, that sin
        only dwelt in some part of his soul, while with an earnest feeling of
        heart he strove for and aspired after the righteousness of God, and
        clearly proved that he had the law of God engraven within him. </font

        myself.&#8221; In the first part he indeed arraigns himself as being
        wholly depraved, for he confesses that no good dwelt in him; and then he
        subjoins a modification, lest he should slight the grace of God which
        also dwelt in him, but was no part of his flesh. And here again he
        confirms the fact, that he did not speak of men in general, but of the
        faithful, who are divided into two parts &#8212; the relics of the
        flesh, and grace. For why was the modification made, except some part
        was exempt from depravity, and therefore not flesh? Under the term
        <i>flesh</i>, he ever includes all that human nature is, everything in
        man, except the sanctification of the Spirit. In the same manner, by the
        term <i>spirit</i>, which is commonly opposed to the flesh, he means
        that part of the soul which the Spirit of God has so re-formed, and
        purified from corruption, that God&#8217;s image shines forth in it.
        Then both terms, flesh as well as spirit, belong to the soul; but the
        latter to that part which is renewed, and the former to that which still
        retains its natural character. </font

        swiftly, but it sets also before them many obstacles at which they
        stumble. Hence they do not, because they accomplish not, what they
        would, with the alacrity that is meet. This, <i>to will</i>, then, which
        he mentions, is the readiness of faith, when the Holy Spirit so prepares
        the godly that they are ready and strive to render obedience to God; but
        as their ability is not equal to what they wish, Paul says, that he
        found not what he desired, even the accomplishment of the good he aimed
        at.</font

        some of the faults of the godly, but delineates in general the whole
        course of their life, we conclude that their best works are always

        which alone is properly so called, which is the rule of righteousness,
        by which our life is rightly formed. To this he joins the law of the
        mind, and by this he means the prompt readiness of the faithful mind to
        render obedience to the divine law, it being a certain conformity on our
        part with the law of God. On the other hand, he sets in opposition to
        this the law of unrighteousness; and according to a certain kind of
        similarity, he gives this name to that dominion which iniquity exercises
        over a man not yet regenerated, as well as over the flesh of a
        regenerated man; for the laws even of tyrants, however iniquitous they
        may be, are called laws, though not properly. To correspond with this
        law of sin he makes the law of the members, that is, the lust which is
        in the members, on account of the concord it has with iniquity.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>As to the first clause, many interpreters take the word </font

      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;</font><font> or </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt;</font
      ><font>
        to be understood; and so Erasmus renders it, &#8220;by the law;&#8221;
        as though Paul had said, that he, by the law of God as his teacher and
        guide, had found out that his sin was innate. But without supplying
        anything, the sentence would run better thus, &#8220;While the faithful
        strive after what is good, they find in themselves a certain law which
        exercises a tyrannical power; for a vicious propensity, adverse to and
        resisting the law of God, is implanted in their very marrow and
        bones.&#8221;</font

      ><font><i> </i></font><font color="Maroon"><i>to the law of God</i></font

        >, etc. Here then you see what sort of division there is in pious souls,
        from which arises that contest between the spirit and the flesh, which
        Augustine in some place calls the Christian struggle (<i
          >luctam Christianam</i
        >.) The law calls man to the rule of righteousness; iniquity, which is,
        as it were, the tyrannical law of Satan, instigates him to wickedness:
        the Spirit leads him to render obedience to the divine law; the flesh
        draws him back to what is of an opposite character. Man, thus impelled
        by contrary desires, is now in a manner a twofold being; but as the
        Spirit ought to possess the sovereignty, he deems and judges himself to
        be especially on that side. Paul says, that he was bound a captive by
        his flesh for this reason, because as he was still tempted and incited
        by evil lusts; he deemed this a coercion with respect to the spiritual
        desire, which was wholly opposed to them. </font

      <font>But we ought to notice carefully the meaning of the </font

      ><font
        ><i>;</i> which many have not rightly understood, and have therefore
        stumbled at this stone. The inner man then is not simply the soul, but
        that spiritual part which has been regenerated by God; and the members
        signify the other remaining part; for as the soul is the superior, and
        the body the inferior part of man, so the spirit is superior to the
        flesh. Then as the spirit takes the place of the soul in man, and the
        flesh, which is the corrupt and polluted soul, that of the body, the
        former has the name of the inner man, and the latter has the name of
        members. The inner man has indeed a different meaning in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470416&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >2 Corinthians 4:16; but the circumstances of this passage require the
        interpretation which I have given: and it is called the inner by way of
        excellency; for it possesses the heart and the secret feelings, while
        the desires of the flesh are vagrant, and are, as it were, on the
        outside of man. Doubtless it is the same thing as though one compared
        heaven to earth; for Paul by way of contempt designates whatever appears
        to be in man by the term members, that he might clearly show that the
        hidden renovation is concealed from and escapes our observation, except
        it be apprehended by faith.</font

        become degenerated from reason.</font

        teaches us that we are not only to struggle with our flesh, but also
        with continual groaning to bewail within ourselves and before God our
        unhappy condition. But he asks not by whom he was to be delivered, as
        one in doubt, like unbelievers, who understand not that there is but one
        real deliverer: but it is the voice of one panting and almost fainting,
        because he does not find immediate help, </font

        he means the whole mass of sin, or those ingredients of which the whole
        man is composed; except that in him there remained only relics, by the
        captive bonds of which he was held. The pronoun </font

      ><font>
        <i>this</i>, which I apply, as<i> </i>Erasmus does, to the body, may
        also be fitly referred to death, and almost in the same sense; for Paul
        meant to teach us, that the eyes of God&#8217;s children are opened, so
        that through the law of God they wisely discern the corruption of their
        nature and the death which from it proceeds. But the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>body </i></font
      ><font
        >means the same as the<i> external man</i> and <i>members;</i> for Paul
        points out this as the origin of evil, that man has departed from the
        law of his creation, and has become thus carnal and earthly. For though
        he still excels brute beasts, yet his true excellency has departed from
        him, and what remains in him is full of numberless corruptions so that
        his soul, being degenerated, may be justly said to have passed into a
        body. So God says by Moses,</font

    <div>
      <font
        >This passage is indeed remarkably fitted for the purpose of beating
        down all the glory of the flesh; for Paul teaches us, that the most
        perfect, as long as they dwell in the flesh, are exposed to misery, for
        they are subject to death; nay, when they thoroughly examine themselves,
        they find in their own nature nothing but misery. And further, lest they
        should indulge their torpor, Paul, by his own example, stimulates them
        to anxious groanings, and bids them, as long as they sojourn on earth,
        to desire death, as the only true remedy to their evils; and this is the
        right object in desiring death. Despair does indeed drive the profane
        often to such a wish; but they strangely desire death, because they are
        weary of the present life, and not because they loathe their iniquity.
        But it must be added, that though the faithful level at the true mark,
        they are not yet carried away by an unbridled desire in wishing for
        death, but submit themselves to the will of God, to whom it behoves us
        both to live and to die: hence they clamor not with displeasure against
        God, but humbly deposit their anxieties in his bosom; for they do not so
        dwell on the thoughts of their misery, but that being mindful of grace
        received, they blend their grief with joy, as we find in what
        follows.</font

        should think that in his complaint he perversely murmured against God;
        for we know how easy even in legitimate grief is the transition to
        discontent and impatience. Though Paul then bewailed his lot, and sighed
        for his departure, he yet confesses that he acquiesced in the good
        pleasure of God; for it does not become the saints, while examining
        their own defects, to forget what they have already received from God. </font

        the eternal inheritance. Though they enjoy not as yet the promised glory
        of heaven, at the same time, being content with the measure which they

        never reach the goal of righteousness as long as they dwell in the
        flesh, but that they are running their course, until they put off the
        body. He again gives the name of </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>mind</i></font
      ><font

        that which is illuminated by the Spirit of God, so that it understands
        and wills aright: for there is a mention made not of the understanding
        alone, but connected with it is the earnest desire of the heart.
        However, by the exception he makes, he confesses, that he was devoted to
        God in such a manner, that while creeping on the earth he was defiled
        with many corruptions. This is a suitable passage to disprove the most
        pernicious dogma of the Purists, (<i>Catharorum</i>,) which some
        turbulent spirits attempt to revive at the present day. </font

        perpetually with their own flesh, he returns to the consolation, which
        was very needful for them, and which he had before mentioned; and it was
        this, &#8212; That though they were still beset by sin, they were yet
        exempt fiom the power of death, and from every curse, provided they
        lived not in the flesh but in the Spirit: for he joins together these
        three things, &#8212; the imperfection under which the faithful always
        labor, &#8212; the mercy of God in pardoning and forgiving it,
        &#8212;and the regeneration of the Spirit; and this indeed in the last
        place, that no one should flatter himself with a vain notion, as though
        he were freed from the curse, while securely indulging in the meantime
        his own flesh. As then the carnal man flatters himself in vain, when in
        no way solicitous to reform his life, he promises to himself impunity
        under the pretense of having this grace; so the trembling consciences of
        the godly have an invincible fortress, for they know that while they
        abide in Christ they are beyond every danger of condemnation. We shall

        Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have wholly put off all
        the emotions of the flesh, so that their whole life is redolent with
        nothing but celestial perfection; but they are those who sedulously
        labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love of true religion
        seems to reign in them. He declares that such walk not after the flesh;
        for wherever the real fear of God is vigorous, it takes away from the
        flesh its sovereignty, though it does not abolish all its
        corruptions.</font

      ><font>
        etc. This is a confirmation of the former sentence; and that it may be
        understood, the meaning of the words must be noticed. Using a language
        not strictly correct, by the</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> law of the Spirit</i></font
      ><font>
        he designates the Spirit of God, who sprinkles our souls with the blood
        of Christ, not only to cleanse us from the stain of sin with respect to
        its guilt, but also to sanctify us that we may be really purified. He
        adds that it is life-giving, (for the genitive case, after the manner of
        the Hebrew, is to be taken as an adjective,) it hence follows, that they
        who detain man in the letter of the law, expose him to death. On the
        other hand, he gives the name of the <i>law of sin</i> and
        <i>death</i> to the dominion of the flesh and to the tyranny of death,
        which thence follows: the law of God is set as it were in the middle,
        which by teaching righteousness cannot confer it, but on the contrary
        binds us with the strongest chains in bondage to sin and to death.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The meaning then is, &#8212; that the law of God condemns men, and that
        this happens, because as long as they remain under the bond of the law,
        they are oppressed with the bondage of sin, and are thus exposed to
        death; but that the Spirit of Christ, while it abolishes the law of sin
        in us by destroying the prevailing desires of the flesh, does at the
        same time deliver us from the peril of death. If any one objects and
        says, that then pardon, by which our transgressions are buried, depends
        on regeneration; to this it may be easily answered, that the reason is
        not here assigned by Paul, but that the manner only is specified, in
        which we are delivered from guilt; and Paul denies that we obtain
        deliverance by the external teaching of the law, but intimates that when
        we are renewed by the Spirit of God, we are at the same time justified
        by a gratuitous pardon, that the curse of sin may no longer abide on us.
        The sentence then has the same meaning, as though Paul had said, that
        the grace of regeneration is never disjoined from the imputation of
        righteousness.</font

        for the law of God, because it seems a harsh expression. For though by
        increasing sin it generates death, yet Paul before turned aside
        designedly from this invidious language. At the same time I no more
        agree in opinion with those who explain the law of sin as being the lust
        of the flesh, as though Paul had said, that he had become the conqueror
        of it. But it will appear very evident shortly, as 1 think, that he
        speaks of a gratuitous absolution, which brings to us tranquillizing
        peace with God. I prefer retaining the word <i>law</i>, rather than with
        Erasmus to render it <i>right</i> or <i>power:</i> for Paul did not
        without reason allude to the law of God. </font

        which it was impossible for the law to do. But as this is a very
        remarkable sentence, let us examine every part of it.</font

        faith, and turn not the mercy of God so as to promote the licentiousness
        of the flesh. And then the state of the case must be noticed; for the
        Apostle teaches us here how the grace of Christ absolves us from
        guilt.</font

        The particle, </font

        in which;&#8221; but as I think it to be causal, I prefer rendering it,
        &#8220;eo quod &#8212; because:&#8221; and though perhaps such a phrase
        does not occur among good authors in the Greek language, yet as the
        Apostles everywhere adopt Hebrew modes of expression, this
        interpretation ought not to be deemed improper. </font

        No doubt intelligent readers will allow, that the cause of defect is
        what is here expressed, as we shall shortly prove again. Now though
        Erasmus supplies the principal verb, yet the text seems to me to flow
        better without it. The copulative </font

        used for the sake of emphasis; except it may be, that some will approve
        of the conjecture of a Grecian scholiast, who connects the clause thus
        with the preceding words, &#8220;God sent his own Son in the likeness of
        the flesh of sin and on account of sin,&#8221; etc. I have however
        followed what I have thought to be the real meaning of Paul. I come now

        have been no need to seek a remedy elsewhere. It is therefore absurd to

        that this defect was not owing to any fault in the law, but to the
        corruption of our flesh; for it must be allowed that if any one really
        satisfies the divine law, he will be deemed just before God. He does not
        then deny that the law is sufficient to justify us as to doctrine,
        inasmuch as it contains a perfect rule of righteousness: but as our
        flesh does not attain that righteousness, the whole power of the law
        fails and vanishes away. Thus condemned is the error or rather the
        delirious notion of those who imagine that the power of justifying is
        only taken away from ceremonies; for Paul, by laying the blame expressly

        You then see that we are wholly excluded from the righteousness of
        works, and must therefore flee to Christ for righteousness, for in us
        there can be none, and to know this is especially necessary; for we
        shall never be clothed with the righteousness of Christ except we first
        know assuredly that we have no righteousness of our own. The word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>is to be taken still in the same sense, as meaning ourselves.
        The corruption then of our nature renders the law of God in this respect
        useless to us; for whiles it shows the way of life, it does not bring us
        back who are running headlong into death.</font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>God having sent his own Son,</i></font

        etc. He now points out the way in which our heavenly Father has restored
        righteousness to us by his Son, even by condemning sin in the very flesh
        of Christ; who by cancelling as it were the handwriting, abolished sin,
        which held us bound before God; for the condemnation of sin made us free
        and brought us righteousness, for sin being blotted out we are absolved,
        so that God counts us as just. But he declares first that Christ was </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>sent</i></font
      ><font
        >, in order to remind us that righteousness by no means dwells in us,
        for it is to be sought from him, and that men in vain confide in their
        own merits, who become not just but at the pleasure of another, or who
        borrow righteousness from that expiation which Christ accomplished in
        his own flesh. But he says, that he came in</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> the likeness of the flesh of sin</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>; </i>for though the flesh of Christ was polluted by no stains, yet
        it seemed apparently to be sinful, inasmuch as it sustained the
        punishment due to our sins, and doubtless death exercised all its power
        over it as though it was subject to itself. And as it behoved our
        High-priest to learn by his own experience how to aid the weak, Christ
        underwent our infirmities, that he might be more inclined to sympathy,
        and in this respect also there appeared some resemblance of a sinful
        nature.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Even for sin</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. I have already said that this is explained by some as the cause
        or the end for which God sent his own Son, that is, to give satisfaction
        for sin. Chrysostom and many after him understood it in a still harsher
        sense, even that sin was condemned for sin, and for this reason, because
        it assailed Christ unjustly and beyond what was right. I indeed allow
        that though he was just and innocent, he yet underwent punishment for
        sinners, and that the price of redemption was thus paid; but I cannot be
        brought to think that the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font
      ><font>
        is put here in any other sense than that of an expiatory sacrifice,
        which is called </font

      <font>But the preposition </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">peri&lt;</font
      ><font>
        <i>peri</i>, is to be taken here in a causative sense, as though he had
        said, &#8220;On account of that sacrifice, or through the burden of sin
        being laid on Christ, sin was cast down from its power, so that it does
        not hold us now subject to itself.&#8221; For using a metaphor, he says
        that it was </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>condemned</i></font
      ><font
        >, like those who fail in their cause; for God no longer deals with
        those as guilty who have obtained absolution through the sacrifice of
        Christ. If we say that the kingdom of sin, in which it held us, was
        demolished, the meaning would be the same. And thus what was ours Christ
        took as his own, that he might transfer his own to us; for he took our
        curse, and has freely granted us his blessing.</font
      ><br />

    <div>
      <font>Paul adds here, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>In the flesh</i></font
      ><font
        >, and for this end, &#8212; that be seeing sin conquered and abolished
        in our very nature, our confidence might be more certain: for it thus
        follows, that our nature is really become a partaker of his victory; and
        this is what he presently declares.</font
      ><br /><font><b>4.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>That the justification of the law might be fulfilled</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. They who understand that the renewed, by the Spirit of Christ,
        fulfil the law, introduce a gloss wholly alien to the meaning of Paul;
        for the faithful, while they sojourn in this world, never make such a
        proficiency, as that the justification of the law becomes in them full
        or complete. This then must be applied to forgiveness; for when the
        obedience of Christ is accepted for us, the law is satisfied, so that we
        are counted just. For the perfection which the law demands was exhibited
        in our flesh, and for this reason &#8212; that its rigor should no
        longer have the power to condemn us. But as Christ communicates his
        righteousness to none but to those whom he joins to himself by the bond
        of his Spirit, the work of renewal is again mentioned, lest Christ
        should be thought to be the minister of sin: for it is the inclination
        of many so to apply whatever is taught respecting the paternal kindness
        of God, as to encourage the lasciviousness of the flesh; and some
        malignantly slander this doctrine, as though it extinquished the desire
        to live uprightly. </font

        etc. He introduces this difference between the flesh and the Spirit, not
        only to confirm, by an argument derived from what is of an opposite
        character, what he has before mentioned, &#8212; that the grace of
        Christ belongs to none but to those who, having been regenerated by the
        Spirit, strive after purity; but also to relieve the faithful with a
        seasonable consolation, lest being conscious of many infirmities, they
        should despair: for as he had exempted none from the curse, but those
        who lead a spiritual life, he might seem to cut off from all mortals the
        hope of salvation; for who in this world can be found adorned with so
        much angelic purity so as to be wholly freed from the flesh? It was
        therefore necessary to define what it is to<i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>be in the flesh</i></font
      ><font>, and to </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>walk after the flesh</i></font
      ><font
        >. At first, indeed, Paul does not define the distinction so very
        precisely; but yet we shall see as we proceed, that his object is to
        afford good hope to the faithful, though they are bound to their flesh;
        only let them not give loose reins to its lusts, but give themselves up
        to be guided by the Holy Spirit.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >By saying that<i> carnal</i> men care for, or think upon, the things of
        the flesh, he shows that he did not count those as carnal who aspire
        after celestial righteousness, but those who wholly devote themselves to

        <i>cogitant</i> &#8212; think, that readers may understand that those
        only are excluded from being the children of God who, being given to the

        Now, in the second clause he encourages the faithful to entertain good
        hope, provided they find that they are raised up by the Spirit to the
        meditation of righteousness: for wherever the Spirit reigns, it is an
        evidence of the saving grace of God; as the grace of God does not exist
        where the Spirit being extinguished the reign of the flesh prevails. But
        I will briefly repeat here what I have reminded you of before, &#8212;
        That to be </font

        there is here a kind of concession; for after having briefly defined
        what it is to be in the flesh, he now subjoins the end that awaits all
        who are slaves to the flesh. Thus by stating the contrary effect, he
        proves, that they cannot be partakers of the favor of Christ, who abide
        in the flesh, for through the whole course of their life they proceed
        and hasten unto death.</font

        account attribute salvation to works; for though God begins our
        salvation, and at length completes it by renewing us after his own
        image; yet the only cause is his good pleasure, whereby he makes us
        partakers of Christ.</font

        proceeds from the efforts of our flesh but death, because it contends as
        an enemy against the will of God. Now the will of God is the rule of
        righteousness; it hence follows, that whatever is unjust is contrary to
        it; and what is unjust at the same time brings death. But while God is
        adverse, and is offended, in vain does any one expect life; for his
        wrath must be necessarily followed by death, which is the avenging of
        his wrath. But let us observe here, that the will of man is in all
        things opposed to the divine will; for, as much as what is crooked
        differs from what is straight, so much must be the difference between us
        and God.</font

        all the thinkings (<i>meditationes</i>) of the flesh carry on war
        against the will of God; for his will cannot be assailed but where he
        has revealed it. In the law God shows what pleases him: hence they who
        wish really to find out how far they agree with God must test all their
        purposes and practices by this rule. For though nothing is done in this
        world, except by the secret governing providence of God; yet to say,
        under this pretext, that nothing is done but what he approves, (<i
          >nihil nisi eo approbante fieri,)</i
        >
        is intolerable blasphemy; and on this subject some fanatics are
        wrangling at this day. The law has set the difference between right and
        wrong plainly and distinctly before our eyes, and to seek it in a deep
        labyrinth, what sottishness is it! The Lord has indeed, as I have said,
        his hidden counsel, by which he regulates all things as he pleases; but
        as it is incomprehensible to us, let us know that we are to refrain from
        too curious an investigation of it. Let this in the mean time remain as
        a fixed principle, &#8212; that nothing pleases him but righteousness,
        and also, that no right estimate can be made of our works but by the
        law, in which he has faithfully testified what he approves and
        disapproves.</font

        subject to the law. They boast that the heart can turn to either side,
        provide it be aided by the influence of the Spirit, and that a free
        choice of good or evil is in our power, when the Spirit only brings
        help; but it is ours to choose or refuse. They also imagine some good
        emotions, by which we become of ourselves prepared. Paul, on the
        contrary, declares, that the heart is full of hardness and indomitable
        contumacy, so that it is never moved naturally to undertake the yoke of
        God; nor does he speak of this or of that faculty, but speaking

        all of them abominable before God; and he has thus far confirmed this
        truth, &#8212; that all who walk not after the Spirit are alienated from
        Christ, for they are without any spiritual life.</font

        was writing; not only that by directing his discourse to them
        particularly he might more powerfully affect them, but also that they
        might with certainty gather from the description already given, that
        they were of the number of those, from whom Christ had taken away the
        curse of the law. Yet, at the same time, by explaining what the Spirit

        children of God are distinguished from the children of the world, when
        by the Spirit of God they are renewed unto purity and holiness. It seems
        at the same time to have been his purpose, not so much to detect
        hypocrisy, as to suggest reasons for glorying against the absurd zealots

        he shows that those are spiritual, not such as obey reason through their
        own will, but such as God rules by his Spirit. Nor are they yet said to
        be according to the Spirit, because they are filled with God&#8217;s
        Spirit, (which is now the case with none,) but because they have the
        Spirit dwelling in them, though they find some remains of the flesh
        still remaining in them: at the same time it cannot dwell in them
        without having the superiority; for it must be observed that man&#8217;s

        denial of the flesh. The reign of the Spirit is the abolition of the
        flesh. Those in whom the Spirit reigns not, belong not to Christ; then
        they are not Christians who serve the flesh; for they who separate
        Christ from his own Spirit make him like a dead image or a carcase. And
        we must always bear in mind what the Apostle has intimated, that
        gratuitous remission of sins can never be separated from the Spirit of
        regeneration; for this would be as it were to rend Christ asunder.</font

        become Christians through his Spirit. It is indeed dreadful to hear that
        men have so departed from the word of the Lord, that they not only vaunt
        that they are Christians without God&#8217;s Spirit, but also ridicule
        the faith of others: but such is the philosophy of the Papists.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >But let readers observe here, that the Spirit is, without any
        distinction, called sometimes the Spirit of God the Father, and
        sometimes the Spirit of Christ; and thus called, not only because his
        whole fulness was poured on Christ as our Mediator and head, so that
        from him a portion might descend on each of us, but also because he is
        equally the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, who have one essence,
        and the same eternal divinity. As, however, we have no intercourse with
        God except through Christ, the Apostle wisely descends to Christ from
        the Father, who seems to be far off:</font
      ><br /><font><b>10.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But if Christ be in us</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. What he had before said of the Spirit he says now of Christ, in
        order that the mode of Christ&#8217;s dwelling in us might be intimated;
        for as by the Spirit he consecrates us as temples to himself, so by the
        same he dwells in us. But what we have before referred to, he now
        explains more fully &#8212; that the children of God are counted
        spiritual, not on the ground of a full and complete perfection, but only
        on account of the newness of life that is begun in them. And he
        anticipates here an occasion of doubt, which might have otherwise
        disturbed us; for though the Spirit possesses a part of us, we yet see
        another part still under the power of death. He then gives this answer
        &#8212; that the power of quickening is in the Spirit of Christ, which
        will be effectual in swallowing up our mortality. He hence concludes
        that we must patiently wait until the relics of sin be entirely
        abolished.</font

        >Readers have been already reminded, that by the word Spirit they are
        not to understand the soul, but the Spirit of regeneration; and Paul
        calls the Spirit life, not only because he lives and reigns in us, but
        also because he quickens us by his power, until at length, having
        destroyed the mortal fesh, he perfectly renews us. So, on the other
        hand, the word <i>body</i> signifies that gross mass which is not yet
        purified by the Spirit of God from earthly dregs, which delight in
        nothing but what is gross; for it would be otherwise absurd to ascribe
        to the body the fault of sin: besides the soul is so far from being life
        that it does not of itself live. The meaning of Paul then is &#8212;
        that although sin adjudges us to death as far as the corruption of our
        first nature remains in us, yet that the Spirit of God is its conqueror:
        nor is it any hindrance, that we are only favored with the first-fruits,
        for even one spark of the Spirit is the seed of life. </font

        efficient cause, and according to this sense, &#8212; &#8220;Since by
        the power of God&#8217;s Spirit Christ was raised, and since the Spirit
        possesses eternal power, he will also exert the same with regard to
        us.&#8221; And he takes it as granted, that in the person of Christ was
        exhibited a specimen of the power which belongs to the whole body of the
        Church: and as he makes God the author of the resurrection, he assigns
        to him a life-giving Spirit.</font

        with his present object, than if he had called him simply by his own
        name. For the same reason he assigns to the Father the glory of raising
        Christ; for it more clearly proved what he had in view, than if he had
        ascribed the act to Christ himself. For it might have been objected,
        &#8220;That Christ was able by his own power to raise up himself, and
        this is what no man can do.&#8221; But when he says, that God raised up
        Christ by his Spirit, and that he also communicated his Spirit to us,
        there is nothing that can be alleged to the contrary; so that he thus
        makes sure to us the hope of resurrection. Nor is there anything here
        that derogates from that declaration in John,</font

        he understands all those things which still remain in us, that are
        subject to death; for his usual practice is to give this name to the
        grosser part of us. We hence conclude, that he speaks not of the last
        resurrection, which shall be in a moment, but of the continued working
        of the Spirit, by which he gradually mortifies the relics of the flesh
        and renews in us a celestial life.</font

        any reason assume the title; and the faithful are thus encouraged with
        unhesitating confidence to expect salvation. The import of the whole is

        already bidden the faithful to rest secure; and he does this by
        mentioning the special effect produced by the Spirit; for he has not
        been given for the purpose of harassing us with trembling or of
        tormenting us with anxiety; but on the contrary, for this end &#8212;
        that having calmed every perturbation, and restoring our minds to a
        tranquil state, he may stir us up to call on God with confidence and
        freedom. He does not then pursue only the argument which he had before
        stated, but dwells more on another clause, which he had connected with
        it, even the paternal mercy of God, by which he forgives his people the
        infirmities of the flesh and the sins which still remain in them. He
        teaches us that our confidence in this respect is made certain by the
        Spirit of adoption, who could not inspire us with confidence in prayer
        without sealing to us a gratuitous pardon: and that he might make this
        more evident, he mentions a twofold spirit; he calls one the spirit of
        bondage, which we receive from the law; and the other, the spirit of
        adoption, which proceeds from the gospel. The first, he says, was given
        formerly to produce fear; the other is given now to afford assurance. By
        such a comparison of contrary things the certainty of our salvation,

        The same comparison is used by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews,
        where he says, that we have not come to Mount Sinai, where all thing
        were so terrible, that the people, being alarmed as it were by an
        immediate apprehension of death, implored that the word should be no
        more spoken to them, and Moses himself confessed that he was

        >By the adverb again, we learn, that the law is here compared with the
        gospel: for the Son of God by his coming has brought to us this
        invaluable benefit, &#8212; that we are no longer bound by the servile
        condition of the law. You are not however to infer from this, either
        that no one before the coming of Christ was endued with the spirit of
        adoption, or that all who received the law were servants and not sons:
        for he compares the ministration of the law with the dispensation of the
        gospel rather than persons with persons. I indeed allow that the
        faithful are here reminded how much more bountifully God now deals with
        them than he did formerly with the fathers under the Old Testament; he
        yet regards the outward dispensation, in respect of which only we excel
        them: for though the faith of Abraham, of Moses, and of David, was
        superior to ours, yet as God kept them apparently under a schoolmaster,
        they had not advanced into that liberty which has been revealed to
        us.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But it must at the same time be noticed, that it was designedly, on
        account of false apostles, that a contrast was made between the literal
        disciples of the law, and the faithful whom Christ, the heavenly
        Teacher, not only addresses by words, but also teaches inwardly and
        effectually by his Spirit.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >And though the covenant of grace is included under the law, it is yet
        far different from it; for in setting up the gospel in opposition to it,
        he regards nothing but what was peculiar to the law itself, as it
        commands and forbids, and restrains transgressors by the denunciation of
        death: and thus he gives the law its own character, in which it differs
        from the gospel; or this statement may be preferred by some, &#8212;
        &#8220;He sets forth the law only, as that by which God covenants with
        us on the ground of works.&#8221; So then persons only must be regarded
        as to the Jewish people; for when the law was published, and also after
        it was published, the godly were illuminated by the same Spirit of
        faith; and thus the hope of eternal life, of which the Spirit is the
        earnest and seal, was sealed on their hearts. The only difference is,
        that the Spirit is more largely and abundantly poured forth in the
        kingdom of Christ. But if you regard only the dispensation of the law,
        it will then appear, that salvation was first clearly revealed at that
        time, when Christ was manifested in the flesh. All things under the Old
        Testament were involved in great obscurity, when compared with the clear
        light of the gospel.</font

        >And then, if the law be viewed in itself, it can do nothing but
        restrain those, devoted to its miserable bondage, by the horror of
        death; for it promises no good except under condition, and denounces
        death on all transgressors. Hence, as there is the spirit of bondage
        under the law, which oppresses the conscience with fear; so under the
        gospel there is the spirit of adoption, which exhilarates our souls by
        bearing a testimony as to our salvation. But observe, that
        <i>fear </i>is connected with bondage, as it cannot be otherwise, but
        that the law will harass and torment souls with miserable disquietness,
        as long as it exercises its dominion. There is then no other remedy for
        quieting them, except God forgives us our sin and deals kindly with us
        as a father with his children.</font

        privilege of all the saints; as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Ye
        have the spirit, through whom you and all we, the rest of the faithful,
        cry,&#8221; etc. The imitation of their language is very significant;
        when he introduces the word Father, in the person of the faithful. The
        repetition of the name is for the sake of amplification; for Paul
        intimates, that God&#8217;s mercy was so published through the whole
        world, that he was invoked, as<i> </i>Augustine observes,
        indiscriminately in all languages. </font

        His object then was to express the consent which existed among all
        nations. It hence follows, that there is now no difference between the
        Jew and the Greek, as they are united together. Isaiah speaks
        differently when he declares, that the language of Canaan would be
        common to all, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231918&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Isaiah 19:18;) yet the meaning is the same; for he had no respect to
        the external idiom, but to the harmony of heart in serving God, and to
        the same undisguised zeal in professing his true and pure worship. The
        word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>cry</i></font
      ><font>
        is set down for the purpose of expressing confidence; as though he said,
        &#8220;We pray not doubtingly, but we confidently raise up a loud voice
        to heaven.&#8221;</font

        blood of Christ, we may rejoice fully and openly that we are the
        children of God; hence arises this crying. In short, thus is fulfilled
        the prophecy of Hosea,</font

      ><font
        >, etc. He does not simply say, that God&#8217;s Spirit is a witness to
        our spirit, but he adopts a compound verb, which might be rendered
        &#8220;contest,&#8221; (<i>contestatur</i>,) were it not that
        contestation (<i>contestatio</i>) has a different meaning in Latin. But
        Paul means, that the Spirit of God gives us such a testimony, that when
        he is our guide and teacher, our spirit is made assured of the adoption
        of God: for our mind of its own self, without the preceding testimony of
        the Spirit, could not convey to us this assurance. There is also here an
        explanation of the former verse; for when the Spirit testifies to us,
        that we are the children of God, he at the same time pours into our
        hearts such confidence, that we venture to call God our Father. And
        doubtless, since the confidence of the heart alone opens our mouth,
        except the Spirit testifies to our heart respecting the paternal love of
        God, our tongues would be dumb, so that they could utter no prayers. For
        we must ever hold fast this principle, &#8212; that we do not rightly
        pray to God, unless we are surely persuaded in our hearts, that he is
        our Father, when we so call him with our lips. To this there is a
        corresponding part, &#8212; that our faith has no true evidence, except
        we call upon God. It is not then without reason that Paul, bringing us
        to this test, shows that it then only appears how truly any one
        believes, when they who have embraced the promise of grace, exercise
        themselves in prayers. </font

        There is also an answer given here to their objection, for they ask,
        &#8220;How can a man fully know the will of God?&#8221; This certainly
        is not within the reach of man, but it is the testimony of God&#8217;s
        Spirit; and this subject he treats more at large in the First Epistle to
        the Corinthians, from which we may derive a fuller explanation of a
        passage. Let this truth then stand sure, &#8212; that no one can be
        called a son of God, who does not know himself to be such; and this is
        called knowledge by John, in order to set forth its certainty. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620519&gt;</font></sup

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>And if children</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. By an argument, taken from what is annexed or what follows, he
        proves that our salvation consists in having God as our Father. It is
        for children that inheritance is appointed: since God then has adopted
        us as his children, he has at the same time ordained an inheritance for
        us. He then intimates what sort of inheritance it is &#8212; that it is
        heavenly, and therefore incorruptible and eternal, such as Christ
        possesses; and his possession of it takes away all uncertainty: and it
        is a commendation of the exellency of this inheritance, that we shall
        partake of it in common with the only-begotten Son of God. It is however
        the design of Paul, as it will presently appear more fully, highly to
        extol this inheritance promised to us, that we may be contented with it,
        and manfully despise the allurements of the world, and patiently bear
        whatever troubles may press on us in this life.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>If so be that we suffer together</i></font

        of the following in preference to any other, &#8220;We are co-heirs with
        Christ, provided, in entering on our inheritance, we follow him in the
        same way in which he has gone before.&#8221; And he thus made mention of
        Christ, because he designed to pass over by these steps to an
        encouraging strain, &#8212; &#8220;God&#8217;s inheritance is ours,
        because we have by his grace been adopted as his children; and that it
        may not be doubtful, its possession as been already conferred on Christ,
        whose partners we are become: but Christ came to it by the cross; then
        we must come to it in the same manner.&#8221; </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f255</font></sup
      ><font>
        Nor is that to be dreaded which some fear, that Paul thus ascribes the
        cause of our eternal glory to our labours; for this mode of speaking is
        not unusual in Scripture. He denotes the order, which the Lord follows
        in dispensing salvation to us, rather than the cause; for he has already
        sufficiently defended the gratuitous mercy of God against the merits of
        works. When now exhorting us to patience, he does not show whence
        salvation proceeds, but how God governs his people.</font

        etc. Though they take not altogether an unsuitable view who understand
        this as a kind of modification; yet I prefer to regard it in the light
        of an encouragement, for the purpose of anticipating an objection,
        according to this import, &#8212; &#8220;It ought not indeed to be
        grievous to us, if we must pass through various afflictions into
        celestial glory, since these, when compared with the greatness of that
        glory, are of the least moment.&#8221; He has mentioned

        he had exhorted us, even in mute creatures. For, to omit various
        interpretations, I understand the passage to have this meaning &#8212;
        that there is no element and no part of the world which, being touched,
        as it were, with a sense of its present misery, does not intensely hope
        for a resurrection. He indeed lays down two things, &#8212; that all are
        creatures in distress, &#8212; and yet that they are sustained by hope.
        And it hence also appears how immense is the value of eternal glory,
        that it can excite and draw all things to desire it.</font

        meaning; for he meant to intimate, that all creatures, seized with great
        anxiety and held in suspense with great desire, look for that day which
        shall openly exhibit the glory of the children of God.

        the version of Erasmus, &#8220;Until the sons of God shall be

        Apostle; for he means not, that the sons of God shall be manifested in
        the last day, but that it shall be then made known how desirable and
        blessed their condition will be, when they shall put off corruption and
        put on celestial glory. But he ascribes hope to creatures void of reason
        for this end, &#8212; that the faithful may open their eyes to behold
        the invisible life, though as yet it lies hid under a mean garb.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For to vanity has the creation, </i></font
      ><font
        >etc. He shows the object of expectation from what is of an opposite
        character; for as creatures, being now subject to corruption, cannot be
        restored until the sons of God shall be wholly restore; hence they,
        longing for their renewal, look forward to the manifestation of the
        celestial kingdom. He says, that they have been </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>subjected to vanity</i></font
      ><font
        >, and for this reason, because they abide not in a constant and durable
        state, but being as it were evanescent and unstable, they pass away
        swiftly; for no doubt he sets vanity in opposition to a perfect
        state.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Not willingly</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Since there is no reason in such creatures, their will is to be
        taken no doubt for their natural inclination, according to which the
        whole nature of things tends to its own preservation and perfection:
        whatever then is detained under corruption suffers violence, nature
        being unwilling and repugnant. But he introduces all parts of the world,
        by a sort of personification, as being endued with reason; and he does
        this in order to shame our stupidity, when the uncertain fluctuation of
        this world, which we see, does not raise our minds to higher
        things.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>But on account of him,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. He sets before us an example of obedience in all created things,
        and adds, that it springs from hope; for hence comes the alacrity of the
        sun and moon, and of all the stars in their constant courses, hence is
        the sedulity of the earth&#8217;s obedience in bringing forth fruits,
        hence is the unwearied motion of the air, hence is the prompt tendency
        to flow in water. God has given to everything its charge; and he has not
        only by a distinct order commanded what he would to be done, but also
        implanted inwardly the hope of renovation. For in the sad disorder which
        followed the fall of Adam, the whole machinery of the world would have
        instantly becomne deranged, and all its parts would have failed had not
        some hidden strength supported them. It would have been then wholly
        inconsistent that the earnest of the Spirit should be less efficacious
        in the children of God than hidden instinct in the lifeless parts of
        creation. How much soever then created things do naturally incline
        another way; yet as it has pleased God to bring them under vanity, they
        obey his order; and as he has given them a hope of a better condition,
        with this they sustain themselves, deferring their desire, until the
        incorruption promised to them shall be revealed. He now, by a kind of
        personification, ascribes </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font
      ><font> to them, as he did </font><font color="Maroon"><i>will</i></font
      ><font><i> </i>before.</font><br /><font><b>21.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Because the creation itself</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. He shows how the creation has in hope been made subject to
        vanity; that is, inasmuch as it shall some time be made free, according
        to what Isaiah testifies, and what Peter confirms still more clearly. It
        is then indeed meet for us to consider what a dreadful curse we have
        deserved, since all created things in themselves blameless, both on
        earth and in the visible heaven, undergo punishment for our sins; for it
        has not happened through their own fault, that they are liable to
        corruption. Thus the condemnation of mankind is imprinted on the
        heavens, and on the earth, and on all creatures. It hence also appears
        to what excelling glory the sons of God shall be exalted; for all
        creatures shall be renewed in order to amplify it, and to render it
        illustrious.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But he means not that all creatures shall be partakers of the same
        glory with the sons of God; but that they, according to their nature,
        shall be participators of a better condition; for God will restore to a
        perfect state the world, now fallen, together with mankind. But what
        that perfection will be, as to beasts as well as plants and metals, it
        is not meet nor right in us to inquire more curiously; for the chief
        effect of corruption is decay. Some subtle men, but hardly sober-minded,
        inquire whether all kinds of animals will be immortal; but if reins be
        given to speculations where will they at length lead us? Let us then be
        content with this simple doctrine, &#8212; that such will be the
        constitution and the complete order of things, that nothing will be
        deformed or fading.</font
      ><br /><font><b>22.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For we know</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. He repeats the same sentiment, that he might pass over to us,
        though what is now said has the effect and the form of a conclusion; for
        as ereatures are subject to corruption, not through their natural
        desire, but through the appointment of God, and then, as they have a
        hope of being hereafter freed from corruption, it hence follows, that
        they groan like a woman in travail until they shall be delivered. But it
        is a most suitable similitude; it shows that the groaning of which he
        speaks will not be in vain and without effect; for it will at length
        bring forth a joyful and blessed fruit. The meaning is, that creatures
        are not content in their present state, and yet that they are not so
        distressed that they pine away without a prospect of a remedy, but that
        they are as it were in travail; for a restoration to a better state
        awaits them. By saying that they <i>groan together</i>, he does not mean
        that they are united together by mutual anxiety, but he joins them as
        companions to us. The particle <i>hitherto</i>, or, to this day, serves
        to alleviate the weariness of daily languor; for if creatures have
        continued for so many ages in their groaning, how inexcusable will our
        softness or sloth be if we faint during the short course of a shadowy
        life. </font

        exalt the dignity of our future blessedness, and by this proof, because
        all things look for it with ardent desire; not only the irrational parts
        of creation, but we also who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God.
        This view is indeed capable of being defended, but there seems to me to
        be a comparison here between the greater and the less; as though he
        said, &#8220;The excellency of our glory is of such importance even to
        the very elements, which are destitute of mind and reason, that they
        burn with a certain kind of desire for it; how much more it behoves us,
        who have been illuminated by the Spirit of God, to aspire and strive
        with firmness of hope and with ardour of desire, after the attainment of
        so great a benefit.&#8221; And he requires that there should be a
        feeling of two kinds in the faithful: that being burdened with the sense
        of their present misery, they are to </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>groan</i></font
      ><font><i>;</i> and that notwithstanding they are to </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>wait</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>patiently for their deliverance; for he would have them to be
        raised up with the expectation of their future blessedness, and by an
        elevation of mind to overcome all their present miseries, while they
        consider not what they are now, but what they are to be.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Who have the beginnings,</i></font
      ><font>
        etc. Some render the word first-fruits, (<i>primitias</i>,) and as
        meaning a rare and uncommon excellency; but of this view I by no means
        approve. To avoid, therefore, any ambiguity, I have rendered the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>beginnings</i></font
      ><font
        >, (<i>primordia</i>, the elements,) for I do not apply the expression,
        as they do, to the Apostles only, but to all the faithful who in this
        world are besprinkled only with a few drops by the Spirit; and indeed
        when they make the greatest proficiency, being endued with a
        considerable measure of it, they are still far off from perfection.
        These, then, in the view of the Apostle, are beginnings or first-fruits,
        to which is opposed the complete ingathering; for as we are not yet
        endued with fullness, it is no wonder that we feel disquietude. By
        repeating <i>ourselves </i>and adding <i>in ourselves</i>, he renders
        the sentence more emphatical, and expresses a more ardent desire, nor
        does he call it only a desire, but groaning: for in groaning there is a
        deep feeling of misery.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Waiting for the adoption,</i></font

        etc. Improperly indeed, but not without the best reason, is adoption
        employed here to designate the fruition of the inheritance to which we
        are adopted; for Paul means this, that the eternal decree of God, by
        which he has chosen us to himself as sons before the foundation of the
        world, of which he testifies to us in the gospel, the assurance of which
        he seals on our hearts by his Spirit, would be void, except the promised
        resurrection were certain, which is its consummation. </font

      ><font>
        For to what end is God our Father, except he receives us after we have
        finished our earthly pilgrimage into his celestial inheritance? To the
        same purpose is what he immediately subjoins, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>the redemption of the body</i></font
      ><font
        >. For the price of our redemption was in such a way paid by Christ,
        that death should notwithstanding hold us tied by its chains, yea, that
        we should carry it within us; it hence follows, that the sacrifice of
        the death of Christ would be in vain and fruitless, except its fruit
        appeared in our heavenly renovation.</font
      ><br /><font><b>24.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For by hope</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. Paul strengthens his exhortation by another argument; for our
        salvation cannot be separated from some kind of death, and this he
        proves by the nature of hope. Since hope extends to things not yet
        obtained, and represents to our minds the form of things hidden and far
        remote, whatever is either openly seen or really possessed, is not an
        object of hope. But Paul takes it as granted, and what cannot be denied,
        that as long as we are in the world, salvation is what is hoped for; it
        hence follows, that it is laid up with God far beyond what we can see.
        By saying, that hope is not what is seen, he uses a concise expression,
        but the meaning is not obscure; for he means simply to teach us, that
        since hope regards some future and not present good, it can never be
        connected with what we have in possession. If then it be grievous to any
        to groan, they necessarily subvert the order laid down by God, who does
        not call his people to victory before he exercises them in the warfare
        of patience. But since it has pleased God to lay up our salvation, as it
        were, in his closed bosom, it is expedient for us to toil on earth, to
        be oppressed, to mourn, to be afflicted, yea, to lie down as half-dead
        and to be like the dead; for they who seek a visible salvation reject
        it, as they renounce hope which has been appointed by God as its
        guardian. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f259</font></sup
      ><br /><font><b>25.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>If then what we see not</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. This is an argument derived from what the antecedent implies;
        for patience necessarily follows hope. For when it is grievous to be
        without the good you may desire, unless you sustain and comfort
        yourselves with patience, you must necessarily faint through despair.
        Hope then ever draws patience with it. Thus it is a most apt conclusion
        &#8212; that whatever the gospel promises respecting the glory of the
        resurrection, vanishes away, except we spend our present life in
        patiently bearing the cross and tribulations. For if life be invisible,
        we must have death before our eyes: if glory be invisible, then our
        present state is that of degradation. And hence if you wish to include
        in a few words the meaning of the whole passage, arrange Paul&#8217;s
        arguments in this way, &#8220;To all the godly there is salvation laid
        up in hope; it is the character of hope to look forward to future and
        absent benefits: then the salvation of the faithful is not visible. Now
        hope is not otherwise sustained than by patience; then the salvation of
        the faithful is not to be consummated except by patience.&#8221;</font

        mitigated, so that they are borne with less difficulty. </font

        are so weak as not to be able to bear so many and so heavy burdens, he
        brings before them the aid of the Spirit, which is abundantly sufficient
        to overcome all difficulties. There is then no reason for any one to
        complain, that the bearing of the cross is beyond their own strength,

        experience shows, that except we are supported by God&#8217;s hands, we
        are soon overwhelmed by innumerable evils, Paul reminds us, that though
        we are in every respect weak, and various infirmities threaten our fall,
        there is yet sufficient protection in God&#8217;s Spirit to preserve us
        from falling, and to keep us from being overwhelmed by any mass of
        evils. At the same time these supplies of the Spirt more clearly prove
        to us, that it is by God&#8217;s appointment that we strive, by
        groanings and sighings, for our redemption.</font

        know that God is our Father, and on which relying, we dare to call on
        him as our Father. He now again refers to the second part, invocation,
        and says, that we are taught by the same Spirit how to pray, and what to
        ask in our prayers. And appropriately has he annexed prayers to the
        anxious desires of the faithful; for God does not afflict them with
        miseries, that they may inwardly feed on hidden grief, but that they may
        disburden themselves by prayer, and thus exercise their faith.</font

        but Paul seems to me to have simple meant this, &#8212; That we are
        blind in our addresses to God; for though we feel our evils, yet our
        minds are more disturbed and confused than that they can rightly choose
        what is meet and expedient. If any one makes this objection &#8212; that
        a rule is prescribed to us in God&#8217;s word; to this I answer, that
        our thoughts nevertheless continue oppressed with darkness, until the
        Spirit guides them by his light.</font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>But the Spirit himself intercedes</i></font
      ><font>, </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f264</font></sup
      ><font>
        etc. Though really or by the event it does not appear that our prayers
        have been heard by God, yet Paul concludes, that the presence of the
        celestial favor does already shine forth in the desire for prayer; for
        no one can of himself give birth to devout and godly aspirations. The
        unbelieving do indeed blab out their prayers, but they only trifle with
        God; for there is in them nothing sincere, or serious, or rightly
        formed. Hence the manner of praying aright must be suggested by the
        Spirit: and he calls those groanings <i>unutterable</i>, into which we
        break forth by the impulse of the Spirit, for this reason &#8212;
        because they far exceed the capability of our own minds. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f265</font></sup
      ><font>
        And the Spirit is said to <i>intercede</i>, not because he really
        humbles himself to pray or to groan, but because he stirs up in our
        hearts those desires which we ought to entertain; and he also affects
        our hearts in such a way that these desires by their fervency penetrate
        into heaven itself. And Paul has thus spoken, that he might more
        significantly ascribe the whole to the grace of the Spirit. We are
        indeed bidden to knock; but no one can of himself premeditate even one
        syllable, except God by the secret impulse of his Spirit knocks at our
        door, and thus opens for himself our hearts.</font
      ><br /><font><b>27.</b><i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>But he who searches hearts</i></font
      ><font
        >, etc. This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence,
        that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he
        thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit.
        And here must be noticed the suitableness of the word to </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>know</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>;</i> for it intimates that God regards not these emotions of the
        Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but
        that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as
        allowed and approved by him. As then Paul had before testified, that God
        then aids us when he draws us as it were into his own bosom, so now he
        adds another consolation, that our prayers, of which he is the director,
        shall by no means be disappointed. The reason also is immediately added,
        because he thus conforms us to his own will. It hence follows, that in
        vain can never be what is agreeable to his will, by which all things are
        ruled. Let us also hence learn, that what holds the first place in
        prayer is consent with the will of the Lord, whom our wishes do by no
        means hold under obligation. If then we would have our prayers to be
        acceptable to God, we must pray that he may regulate them according to
        his will.</font

        far are the troubles of this life from hindering our salvation, that, on
        the contrary, they are helps to it. It is no objection that he sets down
        an illative particle, for it is no new thing with him to make somewhat
        an indiscriminate use of adverbs, and yet this conclusion includes what
        anticipates an objection. For the judgment of the flesh in this case
        exclaims, that it by no means appears that God hears our prayers, since
        our afflictions continue the same. Hence the Apostle anticipates this
        and says, that though God does not immediately succour his people, he
        yet does not forsake them, for by a wonderful contrivance he turns those
        things which seem to be evils in such a way as to promote their
        salvation. If any one prefers to read this verse by itself, as though
        Paul proceeded to a new argument in order to show that adversities which
        assist our salvation, ought not to be borne as hard and grievous things,
        I do not object. At the same time, the design of Paul is not doubtful:
        &#8220;Though the elect and the reprobate are indiscriminately exposed
        to similar evils, there is yet a great, difference; for God trains up
        the faithful by afflictions, and thereby promotes their
        salvation.&#8221;</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But we must remember that Paul speaks here only of adversities, as
        though he had said, &#8220;All things which happen to the saints are so
        overruled by God, that what the world regards as evil, the issue shows
        to be good.&#8221; For though what<i> </i>Augustine says is true, that
        even the sins of the saints are, through the guiding providence of God,
        so far from doing harm to them, that, on the contrary, they serve to
        advance their salvation; yet this belongs not to this passage, the
        subject of which is the cross.</font

        etc. This clause seems to have been added as a modification, lest any
        one should think that the faithful, because they love God, obtain by
        their own merit the advantage of deriving such fruit from their
        adversities. We indeed know that when salvation is the subject, men are
        disposed to begin with themselves, and to imagine certain preparations
        by which they would anticipate the favor of God. Hence Paul teaches us,
        that those whom he had spoken of as loving God, had been previously
        chosen by him. For it is certain that the order is thus pointed out,
        that we may know that it proceeds from the gratuitous adoption of God,
        as from the first cause, that all things happen to the saints for their
        salvation. Nay, Paul shows that the faithful do not love God before they
        are called by him, as in another place he reminds us that the Galatians
        were known of God before they knew him. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480409&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 4:9.) It is indeed true what Paul intimates, that afflictions
        avail not to advance the salvation of any but of those who love God; but
        that saying of John is equally true, that then only he is begun to be
        loved by us, when he anticipates us by his gratuitous love.</font

        pursued by men; as though Paul had said, &#8212; &#8220;The faithful
        attain not religion by their own efforts, but are, on the contrary led
        by the hand of God, inasmuch as he has chosen them to be a peculiar

        subject is more fully handled in the first chapter to the Ephesians, and
        in the first of the Second Epistle to Timothy; where also the contrast

        Paul, however, no doubt made here this express declaration, &#8212; that
        our salvation is based on the election of God, in order that he might
        make a transition to that which he immediately subjoined, namely, that
        by the same celestial decree, the afflictions, which conform us to
        Christ, have been appointed; and he did this for the purpose of
        connecting, as by a kind of necessary chain, our salvation with the

        afflictions of the faithful are nothing else than the manner by which
        they are conformed to the image of Christ; and that this was necessary,
        he had before declared. There is therefore no reason for us to be
        grieved, or to think it hard and grievous, that we are afflicted, unless
        we disapprove of the Lord&#8217;s election, by which we have been
        foreordained to life, and unless we are unwilling to bear the image of
        the Son of God, by which we are to be prepared for celestial
        glory.</font

        >But the foreknowledge of God, which Paul mentions, is not a bare

        In the same sense Peter says, that the faithful had been elected to the
        sanctification of the Spirit according to the foreknowledge of God.
        Hence those, to whom I have alluded, foolishly draw this inference,
        &#8212; That God has elected none but those whom he foresaw would be
        worthy of his grace. Peter does not in deed flatter the faithful, as
        though every one had been elected on account of his merit; but by
        reminding them of the eternal counsel of God, he wholly deprives them of
        all worthiness. So Paul does in this passage, who repeats by another
        word what he had said before of God&#8217;s purpose. It hence follows,
        that this knowledge is connected with God&#8217;s good pleasure; for he
        foreknew nothing out of himself, in adopting those whom he was pleased
        to adopt; but only marked out those whom he had purposed to elect.</font

      <font>The verb </font

      ><font
        >, which some translate, to <i>predestinate</i>, is to be understood
        according to what this passage requires; for Paul only meant, that God
        had so determined that all whom he has adopted should bear the image of
        Christ; nor has he simply said, that they were to be conformed to
        Christ, but to </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>the image of Christ</i></font
      ><font
        >, that he might teach us that there is in Christ a living and
        conspicuous exemplar, which is exhibited to God&#8217;s children for
        imitation. The meaning then is, that gratuitous adoption, in which our
        salvation consists, is inseparable from the other decree, which
        determines that we are to bear the cross; for no one can be an heir of
        heaven without being conformed to the image of the only-begotten Son of
        God.</font

      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ei+nai</font
      ><font
        >, may be rendered in these two ways; but I prefer the first rendering.
        But in mentioning Christ&#8217;s primogeniture, Paul meant only to
        express this, &#8212; that since Christ possesses a pre-eminence among
        the Children of God, he is rightly given to us as a pattern, so that we
        ought to refuse nothing which he has been pleased to undergo. Hence,
        that the celestial Father may in every way bear testimony to the
        authority and honor which he has conferred on his own Son, he will have
        all those whom he adopts to be the heirs of his kingdom, to be conformed
        to his example. Though indeed the condition of the godly is apparently
        various, as there is a difference between the members of the same body,
        there is yet a connection between every one and his own head. As then
        the first-born sustains the name of the family, so Christ is placed in a
        State of pre-eminence not only that he might excel in honor among the
        faithful, but also that he might include all under him himself under the
        common name of brotherhood.</font

      ><font
        >, etc. That he might now by a clearer proof show how true it is that a
        conformity with the humiliating state of Christ is for our good, he
        adopts a graduating process, by which he teaches us, that a
        participation of the cross is so connected with our vocation,
        justification, and, in short, with our future glory, that they can by no
        means be separated.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >But that readers may better understand the Apostle&#8217;s meaning, it
        may be well to repeat what I have already said, &#8212; that the word
        <i>foredetermine</i> does not refer to election, but to that purpose or
        decree of God by which he has ordained that the cross is to be borne by
        his people; and by declaring that they are now called, he intimates,
        that God had not kept concealed what he had determined respecting them,
        but had made it known, that they might resignedly and humbly submit to
        the condition allotted to them; for calling here is to be distinguished
        from secret election, as being posterior to it. That none then may make
        this objection &#8212; that it appears to no one what lot God has
        appointed for him, the Apostle says, that God by his calling bears an
        evident testimony respecting his hidden purpose. But this testimony is
        not only found in the outward preaching of the gospel, but it has also
        the power of the Spirit connected with it; for the elect are there
        spoken of, whom God not only addresses by the outward word, but whom he
        also inwardly draws.</font

        God&#8217;s favor, from the time of our calling to the hour of death;
        but as Paul uses this word throughout the Epistle, for gratuitous
        imputation of righteousness, there is no necessity for us to deviate
        from this meaning. What Paul indeed had in view was to show that a more
        precious compensation is offered to us, than what ought to allow us to
        shun afflictions; for what is more desirable than to be reconciled to
        God, so that our miseries may no longer be tokens of a curse, nor lead
        us to ruin?</font

        cross shall be</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> glorified</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>;</i> so that their sorrows and reproaches shall bring them no loss.
        Though glorification is not yet exhibited except in our Head, yet as we
        in a manner behold in him our inheritance of eternal life, his glory
        brings to us such assurance respecting our own glory, that our hope may
        be justly compared to a present possession.</font

        A continued act is no doubt what is meant, according to this import,
        &#8220;Those whom God now, consistently with his purpose, exercises
        under the cross, are called and justified, that they may have a hope of
        salvation, so that nothing of their glory decays during their
        humiliation; for though their present miseries deform it before the
        world, yet before God and angels it always shines forth as
        perfect.&#8221; What Paul then means by this gradation is, That the
        afflictions of the faithful, by which they are now humbled, are intended
        for this end &#8212; that the faithful, having obtained the glory of the
        celestial kingdom, may reach the glory of Christ&#8217;s resurrection,
        with whom they are now crucified.</font

        breaks out into exclamations, by which he sets forth the magnanimity
        with which the faithful ought to be furnished when adversities urge them
        to despond. And he teaches us in these words that with the paternal
        favor of God is connected that invincible courage which overcomes all
        temptations. We indeed know, that judgment is usually formed of the love
        or of the hatred of God, in no other way than by a view of our present
        state; hence when things fall out untowardly, sorrow takes possession of
        our minds, and drives away all confidence and consolation. But Paul
        loudly exclaims, that a deeper principle ought to be inquired after, and
        that they reason absurdly who confine themselves to the sad spectacle of
        our present warfare. I indeed allow, that the scourges of God are in
        themselves justly deemed to be tokens of God&#8217;s wrath; but as they
        are consecrated in Christ, Paul bids the saints to lay hold, above all
        things, on the paternal love of God, that relying on this shield they
        may boldly triumph over all evils; for this is a brazen wall to us, so
        that while God is propitious to us we shall be safe against all dangers.
        He does not, however, mean, that nothing shall oppose us; but he
        promises a victory over all kinds of enemies.</font

        every temptation. For except we have God propitious to us, though all
        things should smile on us, yet no sure confidence can be attained: but,
        on the other hand, his favor alone is a sufficient solace in every
        sorrow, a protection sufficiently strong against all the storms of
        adversities. And on this subject there are many testimonies of
        Scripture, which show that when the saints rely on the power of God
        alone, they dare to despise whatever is opposed to them in the
        world.</font

        In short, the Apostle&#8217;s object was to show, that the godly soul

        paternal love of God, as to be able to retain our rejoicing on its
        account, Paul brings forward the price of our redemption in order to
        prove that God favors us: and doubtless it is a remarkable and clear
        evidence of inappreciable love, that the Father refused not to bestow
        his Son for our salvation. And so Paul draws an argument from the
        greater to the less, that as he had nothing dearer, or more precious, or
        more excellent than his Son, he will neglect nothing of what he foresees
        will be profitable to us. </font

        of blessings or empty, but filled with all celestial treasures, so that
        they who possess him may not want anything necessary for their perfect
        felicity. To <i>deliver</i> up means here to expose to death.</font

        etc. The first and the chief consolation of the godly in adversities, is
        to be fully persuaded of the paternal kindness of God; for hence arises
        the certainty of their salvation, and that calm quietness of the soul
        through which it comes that adversities are sweetened, or at least the
        bitterness of sorrow mitigated. Hardly then a more suitable
        encouragement to patience could be adduced than this, a conviction that
        God is propitious to us; and hence Paul makes this confidence the main
        ground of that consolation, by which it behoves the faithful to be
        strengthened against all evils. And as the salvation of man is first
        assailed by accusation, and then subverted by condemnation, he in the
        first place averts the danger of accusation. There is indeed but one
        God, at whose tribunal we must Stand; then there is no room for
        accusation when he justifies us. The antithetic clauses seem not indeed
        to be exactly arranged; for the two parts which ought rather to have
        been set in opposition to each other are these: &#8220;Who shall accuse?
        Christ is he who intercedes:&#8221; and then these two might have been
        connected, &#8220;Who shall condemn? God is he who justifies;&#8221; for
        God&#8217;s absolution answers to condemnation, and Christ&#8217;s
        intercession to accusation. But Paul has not without reason made another
        arrangement, as he was anxious to arm the children of God, as they say,
        from head to foot, with that confidence which banishes all anxieties and
        fears. He then more emphatically concludes, that the children of God are
        not subject to an accusation, because God justifies, than if he had said
        that Christ is our advocate; for he more fully expresses that the way to
        a trial is more completely closed up when the judge himself pronounces
        him wholly exempt from guilt, whom the accuser would bring in as
        deserving of punishment. There is also a similar reason for the second
        clause; for he shows that the faithful are very far from being involved
        in the danger of condemnation, since Christ by expiating their sins has
        anticipated the judgment of God, and by his intercession not only
        abolishes death, but also covers our sins in oblivion, so that they come
        not to an account.</font

    <div>
      <font

        God, and to be counted just; and it is not difficult to prove this from
        the present passage, in which he reasons by affirming one thing which
        nullifies its opposite; for to absolve and to regard persons as guilty,
        are contrary things. Hence God will allow no accusation against us,
        because he has absolved us from all sins. The devil no doubt is an
        accuser of all the godly: the very law of God and their own conscience
        convict them; but all these prevail nothing with the judge, who
        justifies them. Therefore no adversary can shake or endanger our

        some sophists falsely imagine,) but by a perception

        of the elect, every one of the godly, according to the example of Paul,
        may apply to himself; for this doctrine would have been not only frigid,
        but wholly lifeless had he buried election in the secret purpose of God.
        But when we know, that there is here designedly set before us what every
        one of the godly ought to appropriate to himself, there is no doubt but
        that we are all encouraged to examine our calling, so that we may become

        there remains no condemnation, when satisfaction is given to the laws,
        and the penalty is already paid. Now Christ is he, who, having once for
        all suffered the punishment due to us, thereby declared that he
        undertook our cause, in order to deliver us: he then who seeks hereafter
        to condemn us, must bring back Christ himself to death again. But he has
        not only died, but also came forth, by a resurrection, as the conqueror

        render void the death of Christ, but also contends with that unequalled
        power with which the Father has honored him, and who with that power
        conferred on him supreme authority. This so great an assurance; which
        dares to triumph over the devil, death, sin, and the gates of hell,
        ought to lodge deep in the hearts of all the godly; for our faith is
        nothing, except we feel assured that Christ is ours, and that the Father

        holds all things in subjection under his feet, yet Paul represents him
        as a Mediator; whose presence it would be strange for us to dread, since
        he not only kindly invites us to himself, but also appears an

        humbly supplicates the Father with bended knees and expanded hands; but
        as he appears continually, as one who died and rose again, and as his
        death and resurrection stand in the place of eternal intercession, and

        lower things; for he who is persuaded of God&#8217;s kindness towards
        him, is able to stand firm in the heaviest afflictions. These usually
        harass men in no small degree, and for various reasons, &#8212; because
        they interpret them as tokens of God&#8217;s wrath, or think themselves
        to be forsaken by God, or see no end to them, or neglect to meditate on
        a better life, or for other similar reasons; but when the mind is purged
        from such mistakes, it becomes calm, and quietly rests. But the import
        of the words is, &#8212; That whatever happens, we ought to stand firm
        in this faith, &#8212; that God, who once in his love embraced us, never
        ceases to care for us. For he does not simply say that there is nothing
        which can tear God away from his love to us; but he means, that the
        knowledge and lively sense of the love which he testifies to us is so
        vigorous in our hearts, that it always shines in the darkness of
        afflictions: for as clouds, though they obscure the clear brightness of
        the sun, do not yet wholly deprive us of its light; so God, in
        adversities, sends forth through the darkness the rays of his favor,
        lest temptations should overwhelm us with despair; nay, our faith,
        supported by God&#8217;s promises as by wings, makes its way upward to
        heaven through all the intervening obstacles. It is indeed true, that
        adversities are tokens of God&#8217;s wrath, when viewed in themselves;
        but when pardon and reconciliation precede, we ought to be assured that
        God, though he chastises us, yet never forgets his mercy: he indeed thus
        reminds us of what we have deserved; but he no less testifies, that our
        salvation is an object of his care, while he leads us to
        repentance.</font

      ><font

        opened his compassions to us in him. As then the love of God is not to
        be sought out of Christ, Paul rightly directs to him our attention, so
        that our faith may behold, in the rays of Christ&#8217;s favor, the
        serene countenance of the Father. The meaning is, &#8212; that in no
        adversities ought our confidence to be shaken as to this truth &#8212;
        that when God is propitious, nothing can be adverse to us. Some take
        this love in a passive sense, for that by which he is loved by us, as
        though Paul would have us armed with invincible courage </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f273</font></sup
      ><font>
        but this comment may be easily disproved by the whole tenor of
        Paul&#8217;s reasoning; and Paul himself will presently remove all doubt

        etc. The pronoun masculine which he used at the beginning of the verse,
        contains a hidden power: for when he might have adopted the neuter
        gender and said &#8212; &#8220;What shall separate us?&#8221; etc., he
        preferred ascribing personality to things without life, and for this
        end, &#8212; that he might send forth with us into the contest as many
        champions as there are of temptations to try our faith.</font

        feeling, when difficulties reduce us to such an extremity, so that we
        know not what course to pursue. Such was the anxiety of Abraham and of
        Lot, when one was constrained to expose his wife to the danger of
        prostitution, and the other, his daughters; for being brought to straits
        and being perplexed, they found no way of escape.
        <i>Persecution</i> properly denotes the tyrannical violence by which the
        children of God were undeservedly harassed by the ungodly. Now though

        them to be exempt from anxious solicitude, but he means that they are
        delivered from it, as also the examples of Abraham and Lot
        testify.</font

        intimates, that the dread of death is so far from being a reason to us
        for falling away, that it has been almost ever the lot of God&#8217;s
        servants to have death as it were present before their eyes. It is
        indeed probable, that in that Psalm the miserable oppression of the
        people under the tyranny of Antiochus is described; for it is expressly
        said, that the worshippers of God were cruelly treated, for no other
        reason but through hatred to true religion. There is also added a
        remarkable protestation, that they had not departed from the covenant of
        God; which Paul, I think, had especially in view. It is no objection
        that the saints there complain of a calamity which then unusually
        pressed on them; for since they show, that they were oppressed with so
        many evils, having before testified their innocence, an argument is
        hence fitly drawn, that it is no new thing for the Lord to permit his
        saints to be undeservedly exposed to the cruelty of the ungodly. But
        this is not done except for their good; for the Scripture teaches us,
        that it is alien to the righteousness of God to destroy the just with
        the wicked, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011823&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Genesis 18:23); but that, on the contrary, it is meet for him to
        requite affliction to those who afflict, and rest to those who are
        afflicted. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530106&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >2 Thessalonians 1:6, 9.) And then they affirm that they suffer for the
        Lord; and Christ pronounces them blessed who suffer for the sake of
        righteousness. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400510&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Matthew 5:10.) By saying that they <i>died daily</i>, they intimated
        that death was so suspended over them, that their life differed but
        little from death.</font

        word used by Paul, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f274</font></sup
      ><font>
        though not commonly used by the Latins. It indeed sometimes happens that
        the faithful seem to succumb and to lie forlorn; and thus the Lord not
        only tries, but also humbles them. This issue is however given to them,
        &#8212; that they obtain the victory.</font

        here of the fervency of that love which we have towards God, but of the
        paternal kindness of God and of Christ towards us, the assurance of
        which, being thoroughly fixed in our hearts, will always draw us from
        the gates of hell into the light of life, and will sufficiently avail

        >In this chapter he begins to remove the offences which might have
        diverted the minds of men from Christ: for the Jews, for whom he was
        appointed according to the covenant of the law, not only rejected him,
        but regarded him with contempt, and for the most part bated him. Hence
        one of two things seemed to follow, &#8212; either that there was no
        truth in the Divine promise, &#8212; or that Jesus, whom Paul preached,
        was not the Lord&#8217;s anointed, who had been especially promised to
        the Jews. This twofold knot Paul fully unties in what follows. He,
        however, so handles this subject, as to abstain from all bitterness
        against the Jews, that he might not exasperate their minds; and yet he
        concedes to them nothing to the injury of the gospel; for he allows to
        them their privileges in such a way, as not to detract anything from
        Christ. But he passes, as it were abruptly, to the mention of this
        subject, so that there appears to be no connection in the discourse. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f281</font></sup
      ><font>
        He, however, so enters on this new subject, as though he had before
        referred to it. It so happened in this way, &#8212; Having finished the
        doctrine he discussed, he turned his attention to the Jews, and being
        astonished at their unbelief as at something monstrous, he burst forth
        into this sudden protestation, in the same way as though it was a
        subject which he had previously handled; for there was no one to whom
        this thought would not of itself immediately
        <i>occur, &#8212; </i>&#8220;If this be the doctrine of the law and the
        Prophets, how comes it that the Jews so pertinaciously reject it?&#8221;
        And further, it was everywhere known, that all that he had hitherto
        spoken of the law of Moses, and of the grace of Christ, was more
        disliked by the Jews, than that the faith of the Gentiles should be
        assisted by their consent. It was therefore necessary to remove this
        obstacle, lest it should impede the course of the gospel.</font

        it were, a sworn enemy to his own nation, and as it was suspected
        somewhat even by the household of faith, as though he had taught them to
        forsake Moses, he adopts a preface to prepare the minds of his readers,
        before he proceeds to his subject, and in this preface he frees himself
        from the false suspicion of evil will towards the Jews. And as the
        matter was not unworthy of an oath, and as he perceived that his
        affirmation would hardly be otherwise believed against a prejudice
        already entertained, he declares by an oath that he speaks the truth. By
        this example and the like, (as I reminded you in the first chapter,) we
        ought to learn that oaths are lawful, that is, when they render that
        truth credible which is necessary to be known, and which would not be
        otherwise believed.</font

        ><i> </i>me, etc. By these words he calls his own conscience before the
        tribunal of God, for he brings in the Spirit as a witness to his
        feeling. He adduced the Spit!it for this end, that he might more fully
        testify that he was free and pure from an evil disposition, and that he
        pleaded the cause of Christ under the guidance and direction of the
        Spirit of God. It often happens that a person, blinded by the passions
        of the flesh, (though not purposing to deceive,) knowingly and wilfully
        obscures the light of truth. But to swear by the name of God, in a
        proper sense of the word, is to call him as a witness for the purpose of
        confirming what is doubtful, and at the same time to bind ourselves over
        to his judgment, in case we say what is false.</font

        not yet to express what he was going to say; for it was not as yet
        seasonable openly to mention the destruction of the Jewish nation. It
        may be added, that he thus intimates a greater measure of sorrow, as
        imperfect sentences are for the most part full of pathos. But he will
        presently express the cause of his sorrow, after having more fully
        testified his sincerity.</font

        not prevent us from grieving at the destruction of lost men, though we
        know that they are thus doomed by the just judgment of God; for the same
        mind is capable of being influenced by these two feelings: that when it
        looks to God it can willingly bear the ruin of those whom he has decreed
        to destroy; and that when it turns its thoughts to men, it condoles with
        their evils. They are then much deceived, who say that godly men ought:
        to have apathy and insensibility, (</font

      ><font
        ><i> </i>etc. He could not have expressed a greater ardour of love than
        by what he testifies here; for that is surely perfect love which refuses
        not to die for the salvation of a friend. But there is another word
        added, <i>anathema, </i>which proves that he speaks not only of temporal
        but of eternal death; and he explains its meaning when he says, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>from Christ</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>for it signifies a separation. And what is to be separated
        from Christ, but to be excluded from the hope of salvation? It was then
        a proof of the most ardent love, that Paul. hesitated not-to wish for
        himself that condemnation which he saw impending over the Jews, in order
        that he might deliver them. It is no objection that he knew that his
        salvation was based on the election of God, which could by no means
        fail; for as those ardent feelings hurry us on impetuously, so they see
        and regard nothing but the object in view. So Paul did not connect
        God&#8217;s election with his wish, but the remembrance of that being
        passed by, he was wholly intent on the salvation of the Jews.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Many indeed doubt whether this was a lawful desire; but this doubt may

      ><font>
        if then we love in God and not without God&#8217;s authority, our love
        can never be too much. And such was the love of Paul; for seeing his own
        nation endued with so many of God&#8217;s benefits, he loved God&#8217;s
        gifts in them, and them on account; of God&#8217;s gifts; and he deemed
        it a great evil that those gifts should perish, hence it was that his
        mind being overwhelmed, he burst forth into this extreme wish. </font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Thus I consent not to the opinion of those who think that Paul spoke
        these words from regard to God only, and not to men; nor do I agree with
        others, who say, that without any thought of&#8217; God, he was
        influenced, only by love to men: but I connect the love of men with a

    <div>
      <font
        >I have not, however, as yet explained that which is the chief thing,
        &#8212; that the Jews are here regarded as they were adorned with those
        singular tokens, by which they were distinguished from the rest of
        mankind. For God had by his covenant so highly exalted them, that by
        their fall, the faithfulness and truth of God himself seemed also to
        fail in the world: for that covenant would have thus become void, the
        stability of which was promised to be perpetual, as long&#8217; as the
        sun and moon should shine in heaven. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197207&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Psalm 72:7.) So that the abolition of this would have been more
        strange, than the sad and ruinous confusion of the whole world. It was
        not therefore a simple and exclusive regard for men: for though it is
        better that one member should perish than the whole body; it was yet for
        this reason that Paul had such a high regard for the Jews, because he
        viewed them as bearing the character, and, as they commonly say, the
        quality of an elect people; and this will appear more evident, as we
        shall soon see, from what follows.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font>The words, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>my kinsmen according to the flesh,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>though they contain nothing new, do yet serve much for
        amplification. For first, lest any one should think that he willingly,
        or of his own accord, sought cause of quarrel with the <i>Jews, </i>he
        intimates, that he had not put off the feeling of kindred, so as not to
        be affected with the destruction of his own flesh. And secondly, since
        it was necessary that the gospel, of which he was the preacher, should
        go forth from Sion, he does not in vain pronounce an eulogy in so many
        words on his own kindred. For the qualifying expression, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>according to the flesh,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>is not in :my view added for the sake of extenuation, as in
        other places, but, on the contrary, for the sake of expressing his
        faith: for though the Jews had disowned Paul, he yet concealed not the
        fact, that he had sprung from that nation, the election of whom was
        still strong in the root, though the branches had withered. What
        <i>Budoeus </i>says of the word <i>anathema, </i>is inconsistent with
        the opinion of Chrysostom<i>, </i>who makes </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;qema</font
      ><font><i> </i>and </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;qhma</font
      ><font><i>, </i>to be the same.</font><br /><font><b>4.</b><i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Who are Israelites,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>etc. Here the reason is now more plainly given, why the
        destruction of that people caused him so much anguish, thai; he was
        prepared to redeem them by his own death, namely<sub> </sub>because they
        were Israelites; for the relative pronoun is put here instead of a
        causative adverb. In like manner this anxiety took hold on Moses, when
        he desired that he should be blotted out of the book of life, rather
        than that the holy and chosen race of Abraham should be reduced to
        nothing. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023232&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Exodus 32:32.) Then in addition to his kind feeling&#8217;, he mentions
        also other reasons, and those of a higher kind, which made him to favor
        the Jews, even because the Lord had, as it were, by a kind of privilege,
        so raised them, that they were separated from the common order of men:
        and these titles of dignity were testimonies of love; for we are not
        wont to speak thus favorably, but of those whom we love. And though by
        their ingratitude they rendered themselves unworthy to be esteemed on
        account of these gifts of God, yet Paul continued justly to respect
        them, that he might teach us that the ungodly cannot so contaminate the
        good endowments of God, but that they always deserve to be praised and
        admired: at the same time, those who abuse them acquire thereby nothing
        but a greater obloquy. But as we are not to act in such a manner as to
        contemn, through a detestation of the ungodly, the gifts of God in them;
        so, on the other hand, we must use prudence, lest by our kind esteem and
        regard for them we make them proud, and especially lest our praises bear
        the appearance of flattery. But let us imitate Paul, who conceded to the
        Jews their privileges in such a manner, that he afterwards declared that
        they were all of no worth without Christ. But it was not in vain that he
        mentioned this as one of their praises, &#8212; that they were </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Israelites;</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>for Jacob prayed for this as a great favor, that they should be
        called by his name. (</font

    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Whose are the adoption,</i></font

        purpose, &#8212; that though the Jews by their defection had produced an
        ungodly divorce between God and themselves, yet the light of God&#8217;s
        favor was not wholly extinguished, according to what he had also said in </font

        >Romans 3:3. They had indeed become unbelievers and had broken his
        covenant; but still their perfidy lind not rendered void the
        faithfulness of God; for he had not only reserved for himself some
        remnant seed from the whole multitude, but had as yet continued,
        according to their hereditary right, the mime of a Church among

        as there was a danger, lest through their fault the majesty of the

        what they deserved, but covers their baseness and disgraceful conduct by
        throwing vails over them, until the Gentiles were fully persuaded, that
        the gospel had flowed to them from the celestial fountain, from the
        sanctuary of God, from an elect nation. For the Lord, passing by other
        nations, had selected them as a people peculiar to himself, and had
        adopted them as his children, as he often testifies by Moses and the
        prophets; and not content simply to give them the name of children, he
        calls them sometimes his first-begotten, and sometimes his beloved. So

        is that which is expressed in distinct and accustomed words, and
        contains a mutual stipulation, as that which was made with Abraham; but
        promises are what we meet with everywhere in Scripture; for when God had
        once made a covenant with his ancient people, he continued to offer,
        often by new promises, his favor to them. It hence follows, that
        promises are to be traced up to the covenant as to their true source; in
        the same manner as the special helps of God, by which he testifies his
        love towards the faithful, may be said to flow from the true fountain of
        election. And as the law was nothing more than a renewal of the
        covenant, and more fully sanctioned the remembrance of it,
        <i>legislation,<sub> </sub></i>or the giving of the law, seems to be
        here peculiarly applied to the things which the law decreed: for it was
        no common honor conferred on the Jewish people, that they had God as
        their lawgiver. For if some gloried in their Solons and Lycurguses, how
        much more reason was there to glory in the Lord? of this you have an

        only to say that Christ had <i>descended </i>from the fathers, have no
        reason to allege: for his object was to close his account of the
        pre-eminence of the Jews by this encomium, &#8212; that Christ proceeded
        from them; for it was not a thing to be lightly esteemed, to have been
        united by a natural relationship with the Redeemer of the world; for if
        he had honored the whole human race, in joining himself to us by a
        community of nature, much more did he honor them, with whom he had a
        closer bond of union. It must at the same time be always maintained,
        that when this favor of being allied by kindred is unconnected with
        godliness, it is so far from being an advantage, that on the contrary it
        leads to a greater condemnation.</font

      ><font
        ><i>, </i>which are added, imply that he had something superior to
        flesh; and here seems to be an evident distinction made between humanity
        and divinity. But he at last connects both together, where he
        <i>says, </i>that the Christ, who had descended from the Jew&#8217;s

        they may take away from Christ so clear a testimony to his divinity,
        most presumptuously attempt, to introduce darkness in the midst of the

        urged against him, did designedly raise up his own mind to the
        contemplation of the eternal glory of Christ; nor did he do this so much
        for his own sake individually, as for the purpose of encouraging&#8217;

      <font
        >But that it may be more evident on what condition the Lord adopted the
        posterity of Abraham as a peculiar people to himself, two things are to
        be here considered. The first is, That the promise of salvation given to
        Abraham belongs to all who can trace their natural descent to him; for
        it is offered to all without exception, and for this reason they are
        rightly called the heirs of the covenant made with Abraham; and in this
        respect they are his successors, or, as Scripture calls them, the
        children of the promise. For since it was the Lord&#8217;s will that his
        covenant should be sealed, no less in Ishmael and Esau, than in Isaac
        and Jacob, it appears that they were not wholly alienated from him;
        except,, it may be, you make no account of the circumcision, which was
        conferred on them by God&#8217;s command; but it cannot be so regarded
        without dishonor to God. But this belonged to them, according to what
        the Apostle had said before, &#8220;whose are the covenants,&#8221;
        though they were unbelieving; and in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440325&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Acts 3:25, they are called by Peter, the children of the covenants,
        because they were the descendants of the Prophets. The second point to
        be considered is, That the children of the promise are strictly those in
        whom its power and effect are found.. On this account Paul denies here
        that all the children of Abraham were the children of God, though a
        covenant had been made with them by the Lord, for few continued in the
        faith of the covenant; and yet God himself testifies, in the sixth
        chapter of Ezekiel, that they were all regarded by him as children. In
        short, when a whole people are called the heritage and the peculiar
        people of God, what is meant is, that they have been chosen by the Lord,
        the promise of salvation having been offered them and confirmed by the
        symbol of circumcision; but as many by their ingratitude reject this
        adoption, and thus enjoy in no degree its benefits, there arises among
        them another difference with regard to the fulfilment of the promise.
        That it might not then<i> </i>appear strange to any one, that this
        fulfilment of the promise was not evident in many of the Jews, Paul
        denies that they were included in the true election of God.</font

        is indeed an illustrious example of gratuitous mercy, when God deigns to
        make a covenant of life with a nation: but his hidden favor appears more

        inconsistent with it, but., on the contrary, that. it tends to its
        confirmation and completion. That he might then in due order prove both,
        he in the first place assumes, that the election of God is not tied to
        the natural descendants of Abraham, and that it is not a thing that is
        included in the conditions of the covenant: and this is what he now
        confirms by a most suitable example. For if there ought to have been any
        natural progeny, which fell not away from the covenant; this ought to
        have been especially the case with those who obtained the privilege at
        first: but when we find, that of the first sons of Abraham, while he was
        yet alive, and the promise new, one of them was separated as the seed,
        how much more might the same thing have taken place in his distant

        includes the whole of what he had in view. For if Isaac, and not
        Ishmael, was the seed, though the one as well as the other was
        Abraham&#8217;s son, it must be that all natural sons are not to be
        regarded as the seed, but that the promise is specially fulfilled only
        in some, and that it does not belong commonly and equally to all. He
        calls those </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>the children of the flesh,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>who have nothing superior to a natural descent; as they are the </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>children of the promise,</i></font
      ><font><i> </i>who are peculiarly selected by the Lord.</font><br /><font
        ><b>9.</b><i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For the word of promise is this,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> He adds another divine testimony; and we see, by the
        application made of it, with what care and skill he explains Scripture.
        When he says, the Lord said that he would come, and that a son would be
        born to Abraham of Sarah, he intimated that his blessing was not yet
        <i>conferred, </i>but that it was as yet suspended. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f288</font></sup
      ><font>
        But Ishmael was already born when this was said: then God&#8217;s
        blessing had no regard to Ishmael. We may also observe, by the way, the
        great caution with which he proceeds here, lest he should exasperate the
        Jews. The cause being passed over, he first simply states the fact; he
        will hereafter open the fountain.</font

        Abraham, but that there is a much more evident example in Jacob and
        Esau: for in the former instance some might allege that their condition
        was unequal, the one being the son of an handmaid; but these were of the
        same mother, and were even twins: yet one was rejected, and the other

        this difference, which he teaches us is nowhere else to be found except
        in the election of God. He had indeed before briefly noticed, that there
        was a difference between the natural children of Abraham, that though
        all were adopted by circumcision into a participation of the covenant,
        yet the grace of God was not effectual in them all; and hence that they,
        who enjoy the favor of God, are the children of the promise. But how it
        thus happened, he has been either silent or has obscurely hinted. Now
        indeed he openly ascribes the whole cause to the election of God, and
        that gratuitous, and in no way depending on men; so that in the
        salvation of the godly nothing higher <i>(nihil superius) </i>must be
        sought than the goodness of God, and nothing higher in the perdition of
        the reprobate than his just severity.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Then the first proposition is, &#8212; &#8220;As the blessing of the
        covenant separates the Israelitic nation from all other people, so the
        election of God makes a distinction between men in that nation, while he
        predestinates some to salvation, and others to eternal
        condenmation.&#8221; The second proposition is, &#8212; &#8220;There is
        no other basis for this election than the good-hess of God alone, and
        also since the fall of Adam, his mercy; which embraces whom he pleases,
        without any regard whatever to their works.&#8221; The third is, &#8212;
        &#8220;The Lord in his gratuitous election is free and exempt from the
        necessity of imparting&#8217; equally the same. grace to all; but, on
        the contrary, he passes by whom he wills, and whom he wills he
        chooses.&#8221; .All these things Paul briefly includes in one sentence:
        he then goes on to other things.</font

        ><i> </i>he shows, that God in making a difference could not have had
        any regard to works, for they were not yet done. Now they who argue on
        the other side, and say, that this is no reason why the election of God
        should not make a difference between men according to the merits of
        works, for God foresees who those are who by future works would be
        worthy or unworthy of his grace, are not more clear-sighted than Paul,
        but stumble at a principle in theology, which ought to be well known to
        all Christians, namely, that God can see nothing in the corrupt nature
        ,of man, such as was in Esau and Jacob, to induce him to manifest his
        favor. When therefore he says, that neither of them had then done any
        good or evil, what he took as granted must also be added , &#8212; that
        they<i> </i>were both the children of Adam, by nature sinful, and endued
        with no particle of righteousness.</font

        those things which they allege.</font

    <div>

        that Esau was justly rejected, for he was naturally a child of wrath, it
        was yet necessary, lest any doubt should remain, as though his condition
        became worse through any vice or fault, that sins no less than virtues
        should be excluded. It is indeed true, that the proximate cause of
        reprobation is the curse we all inherit from Adam; yet, that we may
        learn to acquiesce in the bare and simple good pleasure of God, Paul
        withdraws us from this view, until he has established this doctrine,
        &#8212; That God has a sufficiently just reason for electing and for
        reprobating, in his own will. </font

        every instance. If works had any place, he ought to have said, &#8212;
        &#8220;That<i> </i>his reward might stand through works ;&#8221; but he
        mentions the purpose of God, which is included, so to speak, in his own
        good pleasure alone. And that no ground of dispute might remain on the
        subject,, he has removed all doubt by adding another clause</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>, according to election,</i></font
      ><font><i> </i>and then a third, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>not through works, but through him who calls.</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>Let us now then apply our minds more closely to this passage:
        Since the purpose of God according to election is established in this
        way, &#8212; that before the brothers were born, and had done either
        good or evil, one was rejected and the other chosen; it hence follows,
        that when any one ascribes the cause of the difference to their works,
        he thereby subverts the purpose of God. Now, by adding,</font
      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i> not through works, but through him who calls</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>he means, not on account of works, but of the calling only;
        for he wishes to exclude works altogether. We have then the whole
        stability of our election inclosed in the purpose of God alone: here
        merits avail nothing, as they issue in nothing but death; no worthiness
        is regarded, for there is none; but the goodness of God reigns alone.
        False then is the dogma, and contrary to God&#8217;s word, &#8212; -that
        God elects or rejects, as he foresees each to be worthy or unworthy of
        his favor. </font

        Isaac, while they were as yet in their mother&#8217;s womb; for this was
        the heavenly answer, by which it appeared that God designed to show to
        the younger peculiar favor, which he denied to the elder. Though this
        indeed had reference to the right of primogeniture, yet in this, as the
        symbol of something greater, was manifested the will of God: and that
        this was the case we may easily perceive, when we consider what little
        benefit, according to the flesh, Jacob derived from his primogeniture.
        For he was, on its account, exposed to great danger; and to avoid this
        danger, he was obliged to quit his home and his country, and was
        unkindly treated in his exile: when he returned, he tremblingly, and in
        doubt of his life, prostrated himself at the feet of his brother, humbly
        asked forgiveness for his offence, and lived through the indulgence
        shown to him. Where was his dominion over his brother, from whom he was
        constrained to seek by entreaty his life? There was then something
        greater than the primogeniture promised in the answer given by the
        Lord.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i> As it is written, Jacob I loved,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> He confirms, by a still stronger testimony, how much the
        heavenly answer, given to Rebecca, availed to his present purpose, that
        is, that the spiritual condition of both was intimated by the dominion
        of Jacob and servitude of Esau, and also that .Jacob obtained this favor
        through the kindness of God, and not through his own merit. Then this
        testimony of the prophet shows the reason why the Lord conferred on
        Jacob the primogeniture: and it is taken from the first, chapter of
        Malachi, where the Lord, reproaching the Jews for their ingratitude,
        mentions his former kindness to them, &#8212; &#8220;I have loved
        you,&#8221; he says; and then he refers to the origin of his love,
        &#8212; &#8220;Was not Esau the brother of Jacob?&#8221; as though he
        said, &#8212; &#8220;What privilege had he, that I should prefer him to
        his brother? None whatever. It was indeed an equal right, except that by
        the law of nature the younger ought to have served the elder; I yet
        chose the one, and rejected the other; and I was thus lied by my mercy
        alone, and by no worthiness as to works. I therefore chose you for my
        people, that I might show the same kindness to the seed of Jacob; but I
        rejected the Edomites, the progeny of Esau. Ye are then so much the
        worse, inasmuch as the remembrance of so great a favor cannot stimulate
        you to adore my majesty.&#8221; </font

        Now, though earthly blessings are there recorded, which God had
        conferred on the Israelites, it is not yet right to view them but as
        symbols of his benevolence: for where the wrath of God is, there death
        follows; but where his love is, there is life.</font

        instantly disturbed by numberless questions, and without attempting in a
        manner to call God to an account. We hence find that the Apostle,
        whenever he treats of some high mystery, obviates the many absurdities
        by which he knew the minds of men would be otherwise possessed; for when

        Lord closes his holy mouth, let us also stop the way, that we may not go

        for blindness. Paul indeed had no wish to go out of his way to find out
        things by which he might confound his readers; but he took up as it were
        from what was common the wicked suggestion, which immediately enters the
        minds of many, when they hear that God determines respecting every

        mercy of God, and in the other to acknowledge<i> </i>his righteous
        judgment. His first reply is, that the thought that there is injustice
        with God deserves to be abhorred, and then he shows that with regard to

        clearly proves, that inasmuch as God elects some and passes by others,
        the cause is not to be found in anything else but in his own purpose;
        for if the difference had been based on works, Paul would have to no
        purpose mentioned this question respecting the unrighteousness of God,
        no suspicion could have been entertained concerning it if&#8217; God
        dealt with every one according to his merit. It may also, in the second
        place, be noticed, that though he saw that this doctrine could not be
        touched without exciting instant clamours and dreadful blasphemies, he
        yet freely and openly brought it forward; nay, he does not conceal how
        much occasion for murmuring and clamour is given to us, when we hear
        that before men are born their lot is assigned to each by the secret
        will of God; and yet,<i> </i>notwithstanding all this, he proceeds, and
        without any subterfuges, declares<i> </i>what he had learned from the
        Holy Spirit. It hence follows, that their fancies are by no means to be
        endured, who aim to appear wiser than the Holy Spirit, in removing and.
        pacifying offences. That they may not criminate God, they ought honestly
        to confess that the salvation or the perdition of men depends on. his
        free election. Were they to restrain their minds from unholy curiosity,
        and to bridle their tongues from immoderate liberty, their modesty and
        sobriety would be deserving of approbation; but to put a restraint on
        the Holy Spirit and on Paul, what audacity it is! Let then such
        magnanimity ever prevail in the Church of God, as that godly teachers
        may not be ashamed to make an honest profession of the true doctrine,
        however hated it may be, and also to refute whatever calumnies the
        ungodly may bring forward.</font

        With regard to the elect,, God cannot be charged with any
        unrighteousness; for according to his good pleasure he favors them with
        mercy: and yet even in this case the flesh finds reasons for murmuring,
        for it cannot concede to God the right of showing favor to one and not
        to another, except the cause be made evident. As then it seems
        unreasonable that some should without merit be preferred to others, the
        petulancy of men quarrels with God, as though he deferred to persons
        more than what is right. Let us now see how Paul defends the
        righteousness of God.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >In the first place, he does by no means conceal or hide what he saw
        would be disliked, but proceeds to maintain it with inflexible firmness.
        And in the second place, he labours not to seek out reasons to soften
        its asperity, but considers it enough to check vile barkings by the
        testimonies of Scripture.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It may indeed appear a frigid defence that God is not unjust, because
        he is merciful to whom he pleases; but as God regards his own authority
        alone as abundantly sufficient, so that he needs the defence of none,
        Paul thought it enough to appoint him the vindicator of his own right.
        Now Paul brings forward here the answer which Moses received from the
        Lord, when he prayed for the salvation of the whole people, &#8220;I<i
        > </i>will show mercy,&#8221; was God&#8217;s answer, &#8220;on<i
        > </i>whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will
        have compassion.&#8221; By this oracle the Lord declared that he is a
        debtor to none of mankind, and that whatever he gives is a gratuitous
        benefit, and then that his kindness is free, so that he can confer it on
        whom he pleases; and lastly, that no cause higher than his own will can
        be thought of, why he does good and shows favor to some men but not to
        all. The words indeed mean as much as though he had said, &#8220;From
        him to whom I have once purposed to show mercy, I will never take it
        away; and with perpetual kindness will I follow him to whom I have
        determined to be kind.&#8221; And thus he assigns the highest reason for
        imparting grace, even his own voluntary purpose, and also intimates that
        he has designed his mercy peculiarly :for some; for it is a way of
        speaking which excludes all outward causes, as when we claim to
        ourselves the free power of acting, we say, &#8220;I will do what I mean
        to do.&#8221; The relative pronoun also expressly intimates, that mercy
        is not to all indiscriminately. His freedom is taken away from God, when
        his election is bound to external causes</font

    </div>

        beyond all controversy our election is not to be ascribed to our
        diligence, nor to our striving, nor to our efforts, but that it is
        wholly to be referred to the counsel of God. That none of you may think
        that they who are elected are elected because they are deserving, or
        because they had in any way procured for themselves the favor of God,
        or, in short, because they had in them a particle of worthiness by which
        God might be moved, take, simply this view of the matter, that it is
        neither by our will nor efforts, (for he has put <i>running </i>for
        striving or endeavour,) that we are counted among the elect, but that it
        wholly depends on the divine goodness, which of itself chooses those who
        neither will, nor strive, nor even think of such a thing&#8217;. And
        they who reason from this passage, that there is in us some power to
        strive, but that it effects nothing of itself unless assisted by
        God&#8217;s mercy, maintain what is absurd; for the Apostle shows not
        what is in us, but excludes all our efforts. It is therefore a mere
        sophistry to say that we will and run, because Paul denies that it is of
        him who wills or runs, since he meant nothing else than that neither
        willing nor running can do anything.</font

        ineffectual. These things, then, are not said that we may quench the

        sloth; but that we may understand that everything we have is from him,
        and that we may hence learn to ask all things of him, to hope for all

        of him who wills and runs, for where there is a mutual co-operation,
        there ought to be a reciprocal commendation: but unquestionably the
        latter sentiment falls through its own absurdity.&#8221; Let us then

        to make known the name of God; and on this does Paul primarily dwell:

        Absurdly then do some render this passage, &#8212; that Pharaoh was
        <i>preserved </i>for a time; for his beginning is what is spoken of
        here. For, seeing many tilings from various quarters happen to men,
        which retard their purposes and impede the course of their actions, God
        says, that Pharaoh proceeded from him, and that his condition was by
        himself assigned to him: and with this view agrees the verb, </font

        been said, &#8212; that God not only knew what Pharaoh would do, but
        also designedly ordained him for this purpose. It hence follows, that it
        is in vain to contend with him, as though he were bound to give a
        reason; for he of himself comes forth before us, and anticipates the
        objection, by declaring, that the reprobate, through whom he designs his
        name to be made known, proceed from the hidden fountain of his
        providence.</font

        his judgment against whomsoever it seemeth him good. That our mind may
        be satisfied with the difference which exists between the elect and the
        reprobate, and may not inquire for any cause higher than the divine
        will, his purpose was to convince us of this &#8212; that it seems good

        hears that they who perish have been destined by the will of God to
        destruction. Hence the Apostle adopts again the words of an opponent;
        for he saw that the mouths of the ungodly could not be restrained from
        boldly clamouring against the righteousness of God: and he very fitly
        expresses their mind; for being not content with defending themselves,
        they make God guilty instead of themselves; and then, after having
        devolved on him the blame of their own condemnation, they become
        indignant against his great power. </font

        They are indeed constrained to yield; but they storm, because they
        cannot resist; and ascribing dominion to him, they in a manner charge
        him with tyranny. In the same manner the Sophists in their schools
        foolishly dispute on what they call his absolute justice, as though
        forgetful of his own righteousness, he would try the power of his
        authority by throwing all things into confusion. Thus then speak the
        ungodly in this passage, &#8212; &#8220;What cause has he to be
        angry<sub> </sub>with us? Since he has formed us such as we are, since
        he leads us at his will where he pleases, what else does he :in
        destroying us but punish his own work in us? For it is not in our power
        to contend with him; how much soever we may resist, he will yet have the
        upper hand. Then unjust will be his judgment, if he condemns us; and
        unrestrainable is the power which he now employs towards us.&#8221; What

        In this first answer, he does nothing else but beat down impious

        God. Since there was a ready answer, that the difference depends on just
        reasons, why did not Paul adopt such a brief reply? But he placed the
        will of God in the highest rank for this reason, &#8212; that it alone
        may suffice us for all other causes. No doubt, if the objection had been
        false, that God according to his own will rejects those whom he honors
        not with his favor, and chooses those whom he gratuitously loves, a
        refutation would not have been neglected by Paul. The ungodly object and
        say, that men are exempted from blame, if the will of God holds the
        first place in their salvation, or in their perdition. Does Paul deny
        this? Nay, by his answer he confirms it, that is, that God determines
        concerning men, as it seems good to him, and that, men in vain and madly
        rise up to contend with God; for he assigns, by his own right, whatever
        lot he pleases to what he forms.</font

        unwilling&#8217; to adduce, for they could not have been comprehended;
        yea, he so modifies his second reason, that he does not undertake a full
        defence, but in such a manner as to give a sufficient demonstration of

        contend with the Lord about that which thou art not able to
        understand?&#8221; In a word, the Apostle did not bring forward what
        might have been said, but what is suitable to our ignorance. Proud men
        clamour, because Paul, admitting that men are rejected or chosen by the
        secret counsel of God, alleges no cause; as though the Spirit of God
        were silent for want of reason, and not rather, that by his silence he
        reminds us, that a mystery which our minds cannot, comprehend ought to
        be reverently adored, and that he thus checks the wantonness of human
        curiosity. Let us then know, that God does for no other reason refrain
        from speaking, but that he sees that we cannot contain his immense
        wisdom in our small measure; and thus regarding our weakness, he leads
        us to moderation and sobriety.</font

        We see that Paul dwells continually on this, &#8212; that the will of
        God, though its reason is hid from us, is to be counted just; for he
        shows that he is deprived of his right, if he is not at liberty to
        determine what he sees meet concerning his creatures. This seems
        unpleasant to the ears of many. There are also those who pretend that
        God is exposed to great reproach were such a power ascribed to him, as
        though they in their fastidiousness were better divines than Paul, who
        has laid down this as the rule of humility to the faithful, that they
        are to admire the sovereignty of God, and not to estimate it by their
        own judgment.</font

        think himself better than earthen vessel, when he compares himself with
        God. We are not however to be over-particular in applying this testimony
        to our present subject, since Paul only meant to allude to the words of

        also vessels of wrath, that is, made and formed for this end, that they

        bears patiently for a time with these, not destroying them at the first
        moment, but deferring the judgment prepared for them, and this in order
        to set forth the decisions of his severity, that others may be terrified

        reprehended in this dispensation? But that he is silent as to the
        reason, why they are vessels appointed to destruction, is no matter of

        ><i> etc.</i> From the reasoning which he has been hitherto carrying on
        respecting the freedom of divine election, two things follow, &#8212;
        that the grace of God is not so confined to the Jewish people that it
        does not also flow to other nations, and diffuse itself through the
        whole world, &#8212; and then, that it is not even so tied to the Jews
        that it comes without exception to all the children of Abraham according
        to the flesh; for if God&#8217;s election is based on his own good
        pleasure alone, wherever his will turns itself, there his election
        exists. Election being then established, the way is now in a manner
        prepared for him to proceed to those things which he designed to say
        respecting the calling of the Gentiles, and also respecting the
        rejection of the Jews; the first of which seemed strange for its
        novelty, and the other wholly unbecoming. As, however, the last had more
        in it to offend, he speaks in the first place of that which was less
        disliked. Itc says then, that the vessels of God&#8217;s mercy, whom he
        selects for the glory of his name, are taken from every people, from the
        Gentiles no less than from the Jews.</font

        yet his object was, by making as it were a transition, to subjoin that
        we are the vessels of God&#8217;s glory, who have been taken in part
        from the Jews and in part from the Gentiles; and he proves from the
        calling of God, that there is no difference between nations made in
        election. For if to be descended from the Gentiles was no hinderance
        that God should not call us, it is evident that the Gentiles are by no
        means to be excluded from the kingdom of God and the covenant of eternal
        salvation.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>As he says in Hosea, </i><sup>f307</sup></font

        <i>etc. </i>He proves now that the calling of the Gentiles ought not to
        have been deemed a new thing, as it had long before been testified by
        the prediction of the prophet. The meaning is evident; but there is some
        difficulty in thee application of this testimony; for no one can deny
        but that the prophet in that passage speaks of the Israelites. For the
        Lord, having been offended with their wickedness, declared that they
        should be no longer his people: he afterwards subjoined a consolation,
        and said, that of those who were not beloved he would make some beloved,
        and from those who were not a people he would make a people. But Paul
        applies to the Gentiles what was expressly spoken to the
        Israelites.</font

      <font
        >They who have hitherto been most successful in untying this knot have
        supposed that Paul meant to adopt this kind of reasoning, &#8212;
        &#8221; What. may seem to be an hinderance to the Gentiles to become
        partakers of salvation did also exist as to the Jewish nation: as then
        God did formerly receive into favor the Jews, whom he had cast away and
        exterminated, so also now he exercises the same kindness towards the
        Gentiles.&#8221; But as this interpretation, though it. may be
        supported, yet seems to me to be somewhat strained, let the readers
        consider this, &#8212; Whether it would not be a more suitable view to
        regard the consolation given by the prophet, as intended, not only for
        the Jews, but also for the Gentiles: for it was not a new or an unusual
        thing with the prophets, after having pronounced on the Jews God&#8217;s
        vengeance on account of their sins, to turn themselves to the kingdom of
        Christ., which was to be propagated through the whole world. And this
        they did, not without reason; for since the Jews so provoked God&#8217;s
        wrath by their sins, that they deserved to be rejected by him, no hope
        of salvation remained, except they turned to Christ, through whom the
        covenant of grace was to be restored: and as it was based on him, so it
        was then renewed, when he interposed. And doubtless, as Christ was the
        only refuge in great extremities, no solid comfort could have been
        brought to miserable sinners, and such as saw God&#8217;s wrath
        impending over them, except by setting&#8217; Christ before their eyes.
        lyes, it was usual with the prophets, as we have reminded you, after
        having humbled the people by pronouncing on them divine vengeance, to
        call their attention to Christ, as the only true asylum of those in
        despair. And where the kingdom of Christ is erected there also is raised
        up that celestial Jerusalem, into which citizens from all parts of the
        world assemble. And this is what is chiefly included in the present
        prophecy: for when the Jews were banished from God&#8217;s family, they
        were thus reduced to a common class, and put on a level with the
        Gentiles. The difference being taken away, God&#8217;s mercy is now
        indiscriminately extended to all the Gentiles. We hence see that the
        prophet&#8217;s prediction is; fitly applied to the present subject; in
        which God declares, that after having equalized the Jews and the
        Gentiles, he would gather a Church for himself from aliens, so that they
        who were not a people would begin to be so.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"
        ><i>I will call them my people which are not a people</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>. </i>This is said with respect to the divorce, which God had
        already made with the people, by depriving them of all honor, so that
        they did not excel other nations. Though they indeed, whom God in his
        eternal counsel has destined as sons to himself, are perpetually his
        sons, yet Scripture in many parts counts none to be God&#8217;s children
        but those, the election of whom has been proved by their calling&#8217;:
        and hence he teaches us not to judge, much less to decide, respecting
        God&#8217;s election, except as far as it manifests itself by its own
        evidences. Thus Paul, after having&#8217; shown to the Ephesians that
        their election and adoption had been determined by God before the
        creation of the world, shortly after declares, that they were once
        alienated from God, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490212&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Ephesians 2:12,) that is, during that time when the Lord. had not
        manifested his love towards them; though he had embraced them in his
        eternal mercy. Hence, in this passage, they are said not to be beloved,
        to whom God declares wrath rather than love: for until adoption
        reconciles men to God, we know that his wrath abides on them.</font

      ><font
        ><i> </i>in order that the people might know that they were hated by
        God. Now as rejection was the reason for hatred, so the beginning of
        love, as the prophet; teaches, is, when God adopts those who had been
        for a time strangers. </font

      ><font
        ><i>, etc.</i> He proceeds now to the second part, with which he was
        unwilling&#8217; to begin, lest He should too much exasperate their
        minds. And it is not without a wise contrivance, that he adduces Isaiah
        as exclaiming&#8217;, not, speaking, in order thai; he might excite more
        attention. But the words of the Prophet were evidently intended to keep
        the Jews from glorying too much in the flesh: for it was a thing
        dreadful to be heard, that of so large a multitude, a small number only
        would obtain salvation. For though the Prophet, after having described
        the devastation of the people, lest the faithful should think that the
        covenant of God was wholly abolished, gave some remaining hope of favor;
        yet he confined it to a few. But as the Prophet predicted of his own
        time, let us see how could Paul rightly apply this to his purpose. It
        must be in this sense, &#8212; When the Lord resolved to deliver his
        people from the Babylonian, captivity, his purpose was, that this
        benefit of deliverance should come only to a very few of thai vast
        multitude; which might have been arid to be the remnant of that
        destruction, when compared with the great number which he suffered to
        perish in exile, Now that temporal restoration was typical of the real
        renovation of the Church of God; yea, it was only its commencement. What
        therefore happened then, is to be now much more completely fulfilled as
        the. very progress and completion of that deliverance.</font

        Omitting various interpretations, I will state what appears to me to be
        the real meaning: The Lord will so cut short, and cut off his people,
        that the residue may seem as it. were a consumption, that is, may have
        the appearance and the vestige of a very great ruin. However, the few
        who shall remain from the consumption shall be a proof of the work of
        God&#8217;s righteousness, or, what I prefer, shall serve to testify the
        righteousness of God throughout the world. As <i>word </i>often in
        Scripture means a thing, the consummated word is put for consumption.
        Many interpreters have here been grossly mistaken, who have attempted to
        philosophize with too much refinement; for they have :imagined, that the
        doctrine of the gospel is thus called, because it is, when the
        ceremonies are cut off, a brief compendium of the law; though the word
        means on the contrary a consumption. </font

        be further added, that Isaiah speaks here hyperbolically; for by

        He brings another testimony from the first chapter, where the Prophet
        deplores the devastation of Israel in his time: and as this had happened
        once, it was no new thing. The people of Israel had indeed no
        pre-eminence, except what they had derived from their ancestors; who had
        yet been in such a manner treated, that the Prophet complained that they
        had been so afflicted, that they were not far from having been
        destroyed, as Sodom and Gomorrah had been. There was, however, this
        difference, that a few were preserved for a seed, to raise up the name,
        that they might not wholly perish, and be consigned to eternal oblivion.
        For it behoved God to be ever mindful of his promise, so as to manifest
        his mercy in the midst of the severest judgments.</font

        partake of salvation, and to obtain righteousness; and that, on the
        other hand, the Jews, who assiduously laboured in the works of the law,
        should be excluded from the reward of righteousness. Paul brings forward
        this, which was so singular a paradox, in such a manner, that by adding
        a reason he softens whatever asperity there might be in it; for he says,
        that the righteousness which the Gentiles attained was by faith; and
        that it hence depends on the Lord&#8217;s mercy, and not on man&#8217;s
        own worthiness; and that a zeal for the law, by which the Jews were
        actuated, was absurd; for they sought to be justified by works, and thus
        laboured for what no man could attain to; and still further, they
        stumbled at Christ, through whom alone a way is open to the attainment

        be.cause they had by faith obtained the Spirit of regeneration, he
        departs far from the meaning of Paul; it would not indeed have been
        true, that they had attained what they sought not, except God had freely
        embraced them while they were straying and wandering, and had offered
        them righteousness, for which, being unknown, they could have had no
        desire. It must also be observed, that the Gentiles could not have
        obtained righteousness by faith, except God had anticipated their faith
        by his grace; for they followed it when they first by faith aspired to
        righteousness; and so faith itself is a portion of his favor.</font

        shows that they are deservedly rejected, who attempt to attain salvation
        by trusting in their own works; for they, as far as they can, abolish
        faith, without which no salvation can be expected. Hence, were they to
        gain their object, such a success would be the annihilation of true
        righteousness. You farther see how faith and the merits of works are
        contrasted, as things altogether contrary to each other. As then trust
        in works is the chief hinderance, by which our way to obtain
        righteousness is closed up, it is necessary that we should wholly
        renounce it:. in order that we may depend on God&#8217;s goodness alone.
        This example of the Jews ought indeed justly to terrify all those who
        strive to obtain the kingdom of God by works. Nor does he understand by
        the works of the law, ceremonial observances, as it has been before
        shown, but the merits of those works to which faith is opposed, which
        looks, as I may say, with both eyes on the mercy of God alone, without
        casting one glance on any worthiness of its own.</font

        There is indeed nothing more inconsistent than that they should obtain
        righteousness who strive to destroy it. Christ has been given to us for
        righteousness, whosoever obtrudes on God the righteousness of works,
        attempts to rob him of his own office. And hence it appears that
        whenever men, under the empty pretence of being zealous for
        righteousness, put confidence in their works, they do in their furious
        madness carry on war with God himself.</font

        difficult to understand; for except we own ourselves to be sinners, void
        and destitute of any righteousness of our own, we obscure the dignity of
        Christ, which consists in this, that to us all he is light, life,
        resurrection, righteousness, and healing&#8217;. But how is he all these
        things, except that he illuminates the blind, restores the, lost,
        quickens the dead, raises up those who are reduced to nothing, cleanses
        those who are full of tilth, cures and heals those infected with
        diseases? Nay, when we claim for ourselves any righteousness we in a
        manner contend with the power of Christ; for his office is no less to
        beat down all the pride of the flesh, than to relieve and comfort those
        who labour and are wearied under their burden.</font

        would be to the people of Judah and of Israel for a rock of offence, at
        which they should stumble and fall. Since Christ is that God who spoke
        by the Prophets, it is no wonder that this also should be fulfilled in
        him. And by calling Christ the <i>stone of stumb1ing, </i>he reminds us
        that it is not to be wondered at if they made no progress in the way of
        righteousness, who through their wilful stubbornness stumbled at the
        rock of offence, when God had showed to them the way so plainly. </font

        But we must observe, that this stumbling does not properly belong to
        Christ viewed in himself; but, on the contrary, it is what happens
        through the wickedness of men, according to what immediately
        follows.</font

        is called the stone of stumbling, there is no reason that we should
        dread him, or entertain fear instead of confidence; for he is appointed
        for ruin to the unbelieving, but for life and resurrection to the
        godly.&#8221; As then the former prophecy, concerning the stumbling and
        offence, is fulfilled in the rebellious and unbelieving, so there is
        another which is intended for the godly, and that is, that he is a firm
        stone, precious, a corner-stone, most firmly fixed, and whosoever builds

        indeed a just cause why he should regard them with compassion rather
        than hatred, since he perceived that they had fallen only through
        ignorance, and not through malignancy of mind, and especially as he saw
        that they were not led except by some regard for God to persecute the
        kingdom of Christ. Let us hence learn where our good intentions may
        guide us, if we yield to them. It is commonly thought a good and a very
        fit excuse, when he who is reproved pretends that he meant no harm. And
        this pretext is held good by many at this day, so that they apply not
        their minds to find out the truth of God, because they think that
        whatever they do amiss through ignorance, without any designed
        maliciousness, but with good intention, is excusable. But no one of us
        would excuse the Jews for having crucified Christ, for having cruelly
        raged against the Apostles, and for having attempted to destroy and
        extinguish the gospel; and yet<i> </i>they had the same defense as that
        in which we confidently glory. Away then with these vain evasions as to
        good intention; if we seek God sincerely, let us follow the way by which
        alone we can come to him. For it is better, as Augustine<i> </i>says,
        even to go limping in the right way than to run with all our might out
        of the way. If we would be really religious, let us remember that what
        <i>Lactantius </i>teaches is true, that true religion is alone that
        which is connected with the word of God. </font

        Notice the contrast between the righteousness of God and that of men. We
        first see, that they are opposed to one another, as things wholly
        contrary, and cannot stand together. It hence follows, that God&#8217;s
        righteousness is subverted, as soon as men set up their own. And again,
        as there is a correspondence between the things contrasted, the

        righteousness of men is that which they derive from themselves, or
        believe that they bring before God. Then he who seeks to be justified
        through himself, submits not to God&#8217;s righteousness; for the first
        step towards obtaining the righteousness of God is to renounce our own
        righteousness: for why is it, that we seek righteousness from another,
        except that necessity constrains us?</font

        righteousness of God by faith, that is, when the righteousness of Christ
        is imputed to them. But Paul grievously dishonors the pride by which
        hypocrites are inflated, when they cover it with the specious mask of
        zeal; for he says, that all such, by shaking off as it were the yoke,
        are adverse to and rebel against the righteousness of God.</font

        >The Apostle obviates here an objection which might have been made
        against him; for the Jews might have appeared to have kept the right way
        by depending on the righteousness of the law. It was necessary for him
        to disprove this false opinion; and this is what he does here. He shows
        that he is a false interpreter of the law, who seeks to be justified by
        his own works; because the law had been given for this end, &#8212; to
        lead us as by the hand to another righteousness: nay, whatever the law
        teaches, whatever it commands, whatever it promises, has always a
        reference to Christ as its main object; and hence all its parts ought to
        be applied to him. But this cannot be done, except we, being stripped of
        all righteousness, and confounded with the knowledge of our sin, seek
        gratuitous righteousness from him alone.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It hence follows, that the wicked abuse of the law was justly
        reprehended in the Jews, who absurdly made an obstacle of that which was
        to be their help: nay, it appears that they had shamefully mutilated the
        law of God; for they rejected its soul, and seized on the dead body of
        the letter. For though the law promises reward to those who observe its
        righteousness, it yet substitutes, after having proved all guilty,
        another righteousness in Christ, which is not attained by works, but is
        received by faith as a free gift. Thus the righteousness of faith, (as
        we have seen in the first chapter,) receives a testimony from the law.
        We have then here a remarkable passage, which proves that the law in all
        its parts had a reference to Christ; and hence no one can rightly
        understand it, who does not continually level at this mark.</font

        righteousness of faith and that of works, he now compares them; for by
        comparison the opposition between contrary things appears more clear.
        But he refers not now to the oracles of the Prophets, but to the
        testimony of Moses, and for this reason, &#8212; that the Jews might
        understand that the law was not given by Moses in order to detain them
        in a dependence on works, but, on the contrary, to lead them to Christ.
        He might have indeed referred to the Prophets as witnesses; but still
        this doubt must have remained, &#8220;How was it that the law prescribed
        another rule of righteousness?&#8221; He then removes this, and in the
        best manner, when by the teaching of the law itself he confirms the
        righteousness of faith.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But we ought to understand the reason why Paul harmonizes the law with
        faith, and yet sets the righteousness of one in opposition to that of
        the other: &#8212; The law has a twofold meaning; it sometimes includes
        the whole of what has been taught by Moses, and sometimes that part only
        which was peculiar to his ministration, which consisted of precepts,
        rewards, and punishments. But Moses had this common office &#8212; to
        teach the people the true rule of religion. Since it was so, it behooved
        him to preach repentance and faith; but faith is not taught, except by
        propounding promises of divine mercy, and those gratuitous: and thus it
        behooved him to be a preacher of the gospel; which office he faithfully
        performed, as it appears from many passages. In order to instruct the
        people in the doctrine of repentance, it was necessary for him to teach
        what manner of life was acceptable to God; and this he included in the
        precepts of the law. That he might also instill into the minds of the
        people the love of righteousness, and implant in them the hatred of
        iniquity, promises and threatening were added; which proposed rewards to
        the just, and denounced dreadful punishments on sinners. It was now the
        duty of the people to consider in how many ways they drew curses on
        themselves, and how far they were from deserving anything at God&#8217;s
        hands by their works, that being thus led to despair as to their own
        righteousness, they might flee to the haven of divine goodness, and so
        to Christ himself. This was the end or design of the Mosaic
        dispensation.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But as evangelic promises are only found scattered in the writings of
        Moses, and these also somewhat obscure, and as the precepts and rewards,
        allotted to the observers of the law, frequently occur, it rightly
        appertained to Moses as his own and peculiar office, to teach what is
        the real righteousness of works, and then to show what remuneration
        awaits the observance of it, and what punishment awaits those who come
        short of it. For this reason Moses is by John compared with Christ, when
        it is said,</font

      ><font
        >Leviticus 18:5,<i> </i>where the Lord promises eternal life to those
        who would keep his law; for in this sense, as you see, Paul has taken
        the passage, and not only of temporal life, as some think. Paul indeed
        thus reasons, &#8212; &#8220;Since no man can attain the righteousness
        prescribed in the law, except he fulfills strictly every part of it, and
        since of this perfection all men have always come far short, it is in
        vain for any one to strive in this way for salvation: Israel then were
        very foolish, who expected to attain the righteousness of the law, from
        which we are all excluded.&#8221; See how from the promise itself he
        proves, that it can avail us nothing, and for this reason, because the
        condition is impossible. What a futile device it is then to allege legal
        promises, in order to establish the righteousness of the law! For with
        these an unavoidable curse comes to us; so far is it, that salvation
        should thence proceed. The more detestable on this account is the
        stupidity of the Papists, who think it enough to prove merits by
        adducing bare promises. &#8220;It is not in vain,&#8221; they say,
        &#8220;that God has promised life to his servants.&#8221; But at the
        same time they see not that it has been promised, in order that a
        consciousness of their own transgressions may strike all with the fear
        of death, and that being thus constrained by their own deficiency, they
        may learn to flee to Christ.</font

        reader, and for two reasons &#8212; for it seems to be improperly
        applied by Paul &#8212; and the words are also turned to a different
        meaning. Of the words we shall hereafter see what may be said: we shall
        first notice the application. It is a passage taken from </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Deuteronomy 30:12, where, as in the former passage, Moses speaks of the
        doctrine of the law, and Paul applies it to evangelic promises. This
        knot may be thus untied: &#8212; Moses shows, that the way to life was
        made plain: for the will of God was not now hid from the Jews, nor set
        far off from them, but placed before their eyes. If he had spoken of the
        law only, his reasoning would have been frivolous, since the law of God
        being set before their eyes, it was not easier to do it, than if it was
        afar off. He then means not the law only, but generally the whole of
        God&#8217;s truth, which includes in it the gospel: for the word of the
        law by itself is never in our heart, no, not the least syllable of it,
        until it is implanted in us by the faith of the gospel. And then, even
        after regeneration, the word of the law cannot properly be said to be in
        our heart; for it demands perfection, from which even the faithful are
        far distant: but the word of the gospel has a seat in the heart, though
        it does not fill the heart; for it offers pardon for imperfection and
        defect. And Moses throughout that chapter, as also in the fourth,
        endeavors to commend to the people the remarkable kindness of God,
        because he had taken them under his own tuition and government, which
        commendation could not have belonged to the law only. It is no objection
        that Moses there speaks of forming the life according to the rule of the
        law; for the spirit of regeneration is connected with the gratuitous
        righteousness of faith. Nor is there a doubt but that this verse depends
        on that main truth, &#8220;the Lord shall circumcise thine heart,&#8221;
        which he had recorded shortly before in the same chapter. They may
        therefore be easily disproved, who say that Moses speaks only in that
        passage of good works. That he speaks of works I indeed allow; but I
        deny it to be unreasonable, that the keeping of the law should be traced
        from its own fountain, even from the righteousness of faith. The
        explanation of the words must now follow. </font

      ><font
        ><i> </i>and the <i>sea, </i>as places remote and difficult of access to
        men. But Paul, as though there was some spiritual mystery concealed
        under these words, applies them to the death and resurrection of Christ.
        If any one thinks that this interpretation is too strained and too
        refined, let him understand that it was not the object of the Apostle
        strictly to explain this passage, but to apply it to the explanation of
        his present subject. He does not, therefore, repeat verbally what Moses
        has said, but makes alterations, by which he accommodates more suitably
        to his own purpose the testimony of Moses. He spoke of inaccessible
        places; Paul refers to those, which are<sup> </sup>indeed hid from the
        sight of us all, and may yet be seen by our faith. If then<sub
        > </sub>you take these things as spoken for illustration, or by way of
        improvement, you cannot say<sub> </sub>that Paul has violently or
        inaptly changed the words of Moses; but you will, on the contrary,
        allow, that without loss of meaning, he has, in a striking manner,
        alluded to the words <i>heaven </i>and the <i>sea.</i></font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >Let us now then simply explain the words of Paul: As the assurance of
        our salvation lies on two foundations, that is, when we understand, that
        life has been obtained for us, and death has been conquered for us, he
        teaches us that faith through the word of the gospel is sustained by
        both these; for Christ, by dying, destroyed death, and by rising again
        he obtained life in his own power. The benefit of Christ&#8217;s death
        and resurrection is now communicated to us by the gospel: there is then
        no reason for us to seek anything farther. That it may thus appear, that
        the righteousness of faith is abundantly sufficient for salvation, he
        teaches us, that included in it are these two things, which are alone
        necessary for salvation. The import then of the words, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Who shall ascend into heaven?</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>is the same, as though you should say, &#8220;Who knows whether
        the inheritance of eternal and celestial life remains for us?&#8221; And
        the words, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Who shall descend into the deep?</i></font
      ><font

        whether the everlasting destruction of the soul follows the death of the
        body?&#8221;<i> </i>He teaches us, that doubt on those two points is
        removed by the righteousness of faith; for the one would draw down
        Christ from heaven, and the other would bring him up again from death.
        Christ&#8217;s ascension into heaven ought indeed fully to confirm our
        faith as to eternal life; for he in a manner removes Christ himself from
        the possession of heaven, who doubts whether the inheritance of heaven
        is prepared for the faithful, in whose name, and on whose account he has
        entered thither. Since in like manner he underwent the horrors of hell
        to deliver us from them, to doubt whether the faithful are still exposed
        to this misery, is to render void, and, as it were, to deny his
        death.</font

        For the purpose of removing the impediments of faith, he has hitherto
        spoken negatively: but now in order to show the way of obtaining
        righteousness, he adopts an affirmative mode of speaking. Though the
        whole might have been announced in one continuous sentence,<i> </i>yet<i
        > </i>a question is interposed for the sake of exciting attention: and
        his object at the same time was to show how great is the difference
        between the righteousness of the law and that of the gospel; for the
        one, showing itself at a distance, restrains all men from coming nigh;
        but the other, offering itself at hand, kindly invites us to a fruition
        of itself, </font

      <font
        >It must be further observed, that lest the minds of men, being led away
        by crafts, should wander from the way of salvation, the limits of the
        word are prescribed to them, within which they are to keep themselves:
        for it is the same as though he had bidden them to be satisfied with the
        word only, and reminded them, that in this mirror those secrets of
        heaven are to be seen, which would otherwise by their brightness dazzle
        their eyes, and would also stun their ears and overpower the mind
        itself.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font

        regard to the certainty of the word; for they may no less safely rest on
        it, than on what is actually present. It must also be noticed, that the

        law does by no means render the conscience quiet and calm, nor supply it
        with what ought to satisfy it. He does not, however, exclude other parts
        of the word, no, not even the precepts of the law; but his design is, to
        show that remission of sins stands for righteousness, even apart from
        that strict obedience which the law demands. Sufficient then for
        pacifying minds, and for rendering certain our salvation, is the word of
        the gospel; in which we are not commanded to earn righteousness by
        works, but to embrace<i> </i>it, when offered gratuitously, by

        The contrast, by which the difference between the law and the gospel
        appears, is indeed to be understood: and from this distinction we learn,
        &#8212; that as the law demands works, so the gospel requires nothing
        else, but that men bring faith to receive the grace of God. The words, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>which we preach</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>are added, that no one might have the suspicion that Paul
        differed from Moses; for he testifies, that in the ministration of the
        gospel there was complete consent between him and Moses; inasmuch as
        even Moses placed our felicity in nothing else but in the gratuitous
        promise of divine favor.</font

        for the order would have been more regular if the faith of the heart had

        But he rightly confesses the Lord Jesus, who adorns him with his own
        power, acknowledging him to be such an one as he is given by the Father,
        and described in the gospel.</font

      <font

        not be so taken, as though his death was of no moment, but because
        Christ, by rising again, completed the whole work of our salvation: for
        though redemption and satisfaction were effected by his death, through
        which we are reconciled to God; yet the victory over sin, death, and
        Satan was attained by his resurrection; and hence also came
        righteousness, newness of life, and the hope of a blessed immortality.
        And thus is resurrection alone often set before us as the assurance of
        our salvation, not to draw away our attention from his death, but
        because it bears witness to the efficacy and fruit of his death: in
        short, his resurrection includes his death. On this subject we have
        briefly touched in the sixth chapter.</font

    <div>

        purpose for which Christ rose again; &#8212; it was the Father&#8217;s
        design in raising him, to restore us all to life: for though Christ had
        power of himself to reassume his soul, yet this work is for the most
        part ascribed in Scripture to God the Father.</font

      ><font
        ><i> etc. </i>This passage may help us to understand what justification
        by faith is; for it shows that righteousness then comes to us, when we
        embrace God&#8217;s goodness offered to us in the gospel. We are then
        for this reason just, because we believe that God is propitious to us in
        Christ. But let us observe this, &#8212; that the seat of faith is not
        in the head, <i>(in cerebro</i> &#8212; in the brain,) but in the heart.
        Yet I would not contend about the part of the body in which faith is
        located: but as the word </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>is often taken for a serious and sincere feeling, I would say

        ><i>. </i>It may seem strange, that he ascribes no part of our salvation
        to faith, as he had before so often testified, that we are saved by
        faith alone. But we ought not on this account to conclude that
        confession is the cause of our salvation. His design was only to show
        how God completes our salvation, even when he makes faith, which he
        implants in our hearts, to show itself by confession: nay, his simple
        object was, to mark out true faith, as that from which this fruit
        proceeds, lest any one should otherwise lay claim to the empty name of
        faith alone: for it ought so to kindle the heart with zeal for
        God&#8217;s glory, as to force out its own flame. And surely, he who is
        justified has already obtained salvation: hence he no less believes with
        the heart unto salvation, than with the mouth makes a confession. You
        see that he has made this distinction, &#8212; that he refers the cause
        of justification to faith, &#8212; and that he then shows what is
        necessary to complete salvation; for no one can believe with the heart
        without confessing with the mouth: it is indeed a necessary consequence,
        but not that which assigns salvation to confession.</font

        matter superfluous and vain; for it is extremely puerile to say, that
        there is fire, when there is neither flame nor heat.</font

        design of this gradation, bear in mind first, that there was a mutual
        connection between the calling of the Gentiles and the ministry of Paul,
        which he exercised among them; so that on the evidence for the one
        depended the evidence for the other. It was now necessary for Paul to
        prove, beyond a doubt, the calling of the Gentiles, and, at the same
        time, to give a reason for his own ministry, lest he should seem to
        extend the favor of God without authority, to withhold from the children
        the bread intended for them by God, and to bestow it on dogs. But these
        things he therefore clears up at the same time.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >But how he connects the thread of his discourse, will not be fully
        understood, until every part be in order explained. The import of what
        he advances is the same as though he had said, &#8220;Both Jews and
        Gentiles, by calling on the name of God, do thereby declare that they
        believe on him; for a true calling on God&#8217;s name cannot be except
        a right knowledge of him were first had. Moreover, faith is produced by
        the word of God, but the word of God is nowhere preached, except through
        God&#8217;s special providence and appointment. Where then there is a
        calling on God, there is faith; and where faith is, the seed of the word
        has preceded; where there is preaching there is the calling of God. Now
        where his calling is thus efficacious and fruitful, there is there a
        clear and indubitable proof of the divine goodness. It will hence at
        last appear, that the Gentiles are not to be excluded from the kingdom
        of God, for God has admitted them into a participation of his salvation.
        For as the cause of faith among them is the preaching of the gospel, so
        the cause of preaching is the mission of God, by which it had pleased
        him in this manner to provide for their salvation.&#8221; We shall now
        consider each portion by itself.</font

        are indeed things most closely connected, for he who calls on God
        betakes himself, as it were, to the only true haven of salvation, and to
        a most secure refuge; he acts like the son, who commits himself into the
        bosom of the best and the most loving of fathers, that he may be
        protected by his care, cherished by his kindness and love, relieved by
        his bounty, and supported by his power. This is what no man can do who
        has not previously entertained in his mind such a persuasion of
        God&#8217;s paternal kindness towards him, that he dares to expect
        everything from him.</font

        protection laid up for him; for Paul speaks here of that calling which
        is approved by God. Hypocrites also pray, but not unto salvation; for it
        is with no conviction of faith. It hence appears how completely ignorant
        are all the schoolmen, who doubtingly present themselves before God,
        being sustained by no confidence. Paul thought far otherwise; for he
        assumes this as an acknowledged axiom, that we cannot rightly pray
        unless we are surely persuaded of success. For he does not refer here to
        hesitating faith, but to that certainty which our minds entertain
        respecting his paternal kindness, when by the gospel he reconciles us to
        himself, and adopts us for his children. By this confidence only we have
        access to him, as we are also taught in </font

        he points out by the Prophet, when he says, &#8220;I<i> </i>will say to

        to what we may fancy; we ought to possess a right knowledge of him, such
        as is set forth in his word. And when any one forms an idea of God as
        good, according to his own understanding, it is not a sure nor a solid
        faith which he has, but an uncertain and evanescent imagination; it is
        therefore necessary to have the word, that we may have a right knowledge
        of God. No other word has he mentioned here but that which is preached,
        because it is the ordinary mode which the Lord has appointed for
        conveying his word. But were any on this account to contend that God
        cannot transfer to men the knowledge of himself, except by the
        instrumentality of preaching, we deny that to teach this was the
        Apostle&#8217;s intention; for he had only in view the ordinary
        dispensation of God, and did not intend to prescribe a law for the
        distribution of his grace.</font

        love when any nation is favored with the preaching of the gospel; and
        that no one is a preacher of it, but he whom God has raised up in his
        special providence, and that hence there is no doubt but that he visits
        that nation to whom the gospel is proclaimed. But as Paul does not treat
        here of the lawful call of any one, it would be superfluous to speak at
        large on the subject. It is enough for us to bear this only in mind,
        that the gospel does not fall like rain from the clouds, but is brought
        by the hands of men wherever it is sent from above.</font

        commended the advent of those who brought the glad tidings of peace, by
        a remarkable eulogy; by this very circumstance he has made it evident
        that the apostolic ministry was to be held in no less esteem, by which
        the message of eternal life is brought to us. And it hence follows, that
        it is from God, since there is nothing in the world that is an object of
        desire and worthy of praise, which does not proceed from his hand. </font

        follow in the gradation he lays down; nor does he refer to it in the
        conclusion which immediately follows. It was yet expedient for Paul to
        introduce the sentence here, in order to anticipate an objection, lest
        any one should build an argument on what he had said, &#8212; that the
        word in order always precedes faith, as the seed the corn, &#8212; and
        draw this inference, that faith everywhere follows the word: for Israel,
        who had never been without the word, might have made a boast of this
        kind. It was therefore necessary, that, in passing, he should give them
        this intimation, &#8212; that many are called, who are yet not

        speaks with astonishment of the few number of believers, who appeared to
        him in the Spirit to be so few, that he was constrained to exclaim,
        &#8220;O Lord, who has believed our report?&#8221; that is, the word

      <font
        >We now see why this exception was by the way introduced; it was, that
        no one might suppose that faith necessarily follows where there is
        preaching. He however does afterwards point out the reason, by saying,
        &#8220;To<i> </i>whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#8221; by
        which he intimates that there is no benefit from the word, except when
        God shines in us by the light of his Spirit; and thus the inward
        calling, which alone is efficacious and peculiar to the elect, is
        distinguished from the outward voice of men. It is hence evident, how
        foolishly some maintain, that all are indiscriminately the elect,
        because the doctrine of salvation is universal, and because God invites
        all indiscriminately to himself. But the generality of the promises does
        not alone and by itself make salvation common to all: on the contrary,
        the peculiar revelation, mentioned by the Prophet, confines it to the

        gradation which he formed; it was to show, that wherever faith is, God
        has there already given an evidence of his <i>election; </i>and then,
        that he, by pouring his blessing on the ministration of the gospel, to
        illuminate the minds of men by faith, and thereby to lead them to call
        on his name, had thus testified, that the Gentiles were admitted by him
        into a participation of the eternal inheritance.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >And this is a remarkable passage with regard to the efficacy of
        preaching; for he testifies, that by it faith is produced. He had indeed
        before declared, that of itself it is of no avail; but that when it
        pleases the Lord to work, it becomes the instrument of his power. And
        indeed the voice of man can by no means penetrate into the soul; and
        mortal man would be too much exalted, were he said to have the power to
        regenerate us; the light also of faith is something sublimer than what
        can be conveyed by man: but all these things are no hindrances, that God
        should not work effectually through the voice of man, so as to create
        faith in us through his ministry.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It must be further noticed, that faith is grounded on nothing else but
        the truth of God; for Paul does not teach us that faith springs from any
        other kind of doctrine, but he expressly restricts it. to the word of
        God; and this restriction would have been improper if faith could rest
        on the decrees of men. Away then with all the devices of men when we
        speak of the certainty of faith. Hence also the Papal conceit respecting
        implicit faith falls to the ground, because it tears away faith from the
        word; and more detestable still is that blasphemy, that the truth of the
        word remains suspended until the authority of the Church establishes
        it.</font

        knowledge of God, which leads them to call on God, it remained a
        question whether the truth of God had been proclaimed to the Gentiles;
        for that Paul had suddenly betaken himself to the Gentiles, there was by
        that novelty no small offense given. He then asks, whether God had ever
        before directed his voice to the Gentiles, and performed the office of a
        teacher towards the whole world. But in order that he might show that
        the school, into which God collects scholars to himself from any part,
        is open in common to all, he brings forward a Prophet&#8217;s testimony

        material works of God; in which he says the glory of God shines forth so
        evidently, that they may be said to have a sort of tongue of their own

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >This passage of Paul gave occasion to the ancients to explain the whole
        Psalm allegorically, and posterity have followed them: so that, without
        doubt, the sun going forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, was Christ,
        and the heavens were the Apostles. They who had most piety, and showed a
        greater modesty in interpreting Scripture, thought that what was
        properly said of the celestial architecture, has been transferred by
        Paul to the Apostles by way of allusion. But as I find that the
        Lord&#8217;s servants have everywhere with great reverence explained
        Scripture, and have not turned them at pleasure in all directions, I
        cannot be persuaded, that Paul has in this manner misconstrued this
        passage. I then take his quotation according to the proper and genuine
        meaning of the Prophet; so that the argument will be something of this
        kind, &#8212; God has already from the beginning manifested his divinity
        to the Gentiles, though not by the preaching of men, yet by the
        testimony of his creatures; for though the gospel was then silent among
        them, yet the whole workmanship of heaven and earth did speak and make
        known its author by its preaching. It hence appears, that the Lord, even
        during the time in which he confined the favor of his covenant to
        Israel, did not yet so withdraw from the Gentiles the knowledge of
        himself, but that he ever kept alive some sparks of it among them. He
        indeed manifested himself then more particularly to his chosen people,
        so that the Jews might be justly compared to domestic hearers, whom he
        familiarly taught as it were by his own mouth; yet as he spoke to the

        As it is certain that the same thing is mentioned twice in this passage,
        it seems to me probable, that the heavens are introduced as declaring by
        what is written as it were on them, as well as by voice, the power of
        God; for by the word <i>going forth </i>the Prophet reminds us, that the
        doctrine, of which the heavens are the preachers, is not included within
        the narrow limits of one land, but is proclaimed to the utmost regions
        of the world.</font

        ><i> </i>This objection of an opponent is taken from the comparison of
        the less with the greater. Paul had argued, that the Gentiles were not
        to be excluded from the knowledge of God, since he had from the
        beginning manifested himself to them, though only obscurely and through
        shadows, or had at least given them some knowledge of his truth. What
        then is to be said of Israel, who had been illuminated by a far
        different light of truth? for how comes it that aliens and the profane
        should run to the light manifested to them afar off, and that the holy
        race of Abraham should reject it when familiarly seen by them? For this
        distinction must be ever borne in mind, &#8220;What nation is so
        renowned, that it has gods coming nigh to it, as thy God at this day
        descends to thee?&#8221; It was not then without reason asked, why
        knowledge had not followed the doctrine of the law, with which Israel
        was favored.</font

    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>First, Moses saith,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc. </i>He proves by the testimony of Moses, that there was
        nothing inconsistent in God in preferring the Gentiles to the Jews. The
        passage is taken from that celebrated song, in which God, upbraiding the
        Jews with their perfidiousness, declares, that he would execute
        vengeance on them, and provoke them to jealousy by taking the Gentiles
        into covenant with himself, because they had departed to fictitious
        gods. &#8220;Ye<i> </i>have,&#8221; he says, &#8220;by despising and
        rejecting me, transferred my right and honor to idols: to avenge this
        wrong, I will also substitute the Gentiles in your place, and I will
        transfer to them what I have hitherto given to you.&#8221; Now this
        could not have been without repudiating the Jewish nation: for the
        emulation, which Moses mentions, arose from this, &#8212; that God
        formed for himself a nation from that which was not a nation, and raised
        up from nothing a new people, who were to occupy the place from which
        the Jews had been driven away, inasmuch as they had forsaken the true
        God and prostituted themselves to idols. For though, at the coming of
        Christ, the Jews were not gone astray to gross and external idolatry,
        they had yet no excuse, since they had profaned the whole worship of God
        by their inventions; yea, they at length denied God the Father, as
        revealed in Christ, his only-begotten Son, which was an extreme kind of
        impiety.</font

        eternal life men have properly no existence. Besides, the beginning or
        origin of life is from the light of faith: hence spiritual existence
        flows from the new creation; and in this sense Paul calls the faithful
        the work of God, as they are regenerated by his Spirit, and renewed
        after his image. Now from the word <i>foolish, </i>we learn that all the
        wisdom of men, apart from the word of God, is mere vanity. </font

        then, the Prophet declares it as what would take place, that those who

        general representation of the calling of all the faithful; for there is
        no one who anticipates the Lord; but we are all, without exception,
        delivered by his free mercy from the deepest abyss of death, when there

        call men, as he thus proves his goodwill towards them. However, he
        chiefly complains of the contempt shown to his truth; which is the more
        abominable, as the more remarkable is the manner by which God manifests

        of the Jews, might seem to import that Christ at his coming had
        transferred elsewhere the promises of God, and deprived the Jews of
        every hope of salvation. This objection is what he anticipates in this
        passage, and he so modifies what he had previously said respecting the
        repudiation of the Jews, that no one might think that the covenant
        formerly made with Abraham is now abrogated, or that God had so
        forgotten it that the Jews were now so entirely alienated from his
        kingdom, as the Gentiles were before the coming of Christ. All this he
        denies, and he will presently show that it is altogether false. But the
        question is not whether God had justly or unjustly rejected the people;
        for it was proved in the last chapter that when the people, through
        false zeal, had rejected the righteousness of God, they suffered a just
        punishment for their presumption, were deservedly blinded, and were at
        last cut off from the covenant.</font

        deserved such a punishment from God, whether yet the covenant which God
        made formerly with the fathers was abolished. That it should fail
        through any perfidiousness of men, was wholly unreasonable; for Paul
        holds this as a fixed principle, that since adoption is gratuitous and
        based on God alone and not on men, it stands firm and inviolable,
        howsoever great the unfaithfulness of men may be, which may tend to
        abolish it. It was necessary that this knot should be untied, lest the

        by his own example, how unreasonable it was to think that the nation was
        utterly forsaken by God; for he himself was in his origin an Israelite,
        not a proselyte, or one lately introduced into the commonwealth of
        Israel. As then he was justly deemed to be one of God&#8217;s special
        servants, it was an evidence that God&#8217;s favor rested on Israel. He

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>God has not cast away,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> This is a negative answer, accompanied with a qualifying
        clause; for had the Apostle unreservedly denied that the people were
        rejected, he would have been inconsistent with himself; but by adding a
        modification, he shows it to be such a rejection, as that God&#8217;s
        promise is not thereby made void. So the answer may be divided into two
        parts, &#8212; that God has by no means cast away the whole race of
        Abraham, contrary to the tenor of his own covenant, &#8212; and that yet
        the fruit of adoption does not exist in all the children of the flesh,
        for secret election precedes. Thus general rejection could not have
        caused that no seed should be saved; for the visible body of the people
        was in such a manner rejected, that no member of the spiritual body of
        Christ was cut off.</font

        >If any one asks, &#8220;Was not circumcision a common symbol of
        God&#8217;s favor to all the Jews, so that they ought to have been all
        counted his people?&#8221; To this the obvious answer is, &#8212; That
        as outward calling is of itself ineffectual without faith, the honor
        which the unbelieving refuse when offered, is justly taken from them.
        Thus a special people remain, in whom God exhibits an evidence of his
        faithfulness; and Paul derives the origin of constancy from secret
        election. For it is not said here that God regards faith, but that he
        stands to his own purpose, so as not to <i>reject </i>the people whom he
        has foreknown.</font

        ><i>, </i>is not to be understood a foresight, I know not what, by which
        God foresees what sort of being any one will be, but that good pleasure,
        according to which he has chosen those as sons to himself, who, being

        So he says to the Galatians, that they<i> </i>had been known by God,

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480409&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Galatians 4:9); for he had anticipated them with his favor, so as to
        call them to the knowledge of Christ. We now perceive, that though
        universal calling may not bring forth fruit, yet the faithfulness of God
        does not fail, inasmuch as he always preserves a Church, as long as
        there are elect remaining; for though God invites all people
        indiscriminately to himself, yet he does not inwardly draw any but those
        whom he knows to be his people, and whom he has given to his Son, and of
        whom also he will be the faithful keeper to the end.</font

    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Know ye not,</i></font

        ><i> etc.</i> As there were so few of the Jews who had believed in
        Christ, hardly another conclusion could have been drawn from this small
        number, but that the whole race of Abraham had been rejected; and creep
        in might this thought, &#8212; that in so vast a ruin no sign of
        God&#8217;s favor appeared: for since adoption was the sacred bond by
        which the children of Abraham were kept collected under the protection
        of God, it was by no means probable, unless that had ceased, that the
        people should be miserably and wretchedly dispersed. To remove this
        offense, Paul adopts a most suitable example; for he relates, that in
        the time of Elias there was such a desolation, that there remained no
        appearance of a Church, and yet, that when no vestige of God&#8217;s
        favor appeared, the Church of God was, as it were, hid in the grave, and
        was thus wonderfully preserved.</font

        God&#8217;s people, what shall be the case with us, whose highest
        perspicuity, when compared with his, is mere dullness? Let us not then
        determine any thing rashly on this point; but rather let this truth
        remain fixed in our hearts &#8212; that the Church, though it may not
        appear to our eyes, is sustained by the secret providence of God. Let it
        also be remembered by us, that they are foolish and presumptuous who
        calculate the number of the elect according to the extent of their own
        perception: for God has a way, easy to himself, hidden from us, by which
        he wonderfully preserves his elect, even when all things seem to us past

        confirm our faith, when we bear in mind, that nothing happens to us, at
        this day, which the holy Fathers had not formerly experienced: for

        mode of speaking; for </font

      ><font>
        It was certainly a proof how much Elias honored the Lord, that for the
        glory of his name he hesitated not to make himself an enemy to his own
        nation, and to pray for their utter ruin, because he thought that the
        religion and worship of God had perished among them: but he was mistaken
        in charging the whole nation, himself alone <i>excepted, </i>with that
        impiety, for which he wished them to be severely visited. There is
        however in this passage, which Paul quotes, no imprecation, but a
        complaint only: but as he complains in such a way as to despair of the
        whole people, there is no doubt but that he gave them up to destruction.
        Let us then especially notice what is said of Elias, which was this,
        &#8212; that when impiety had everywhere prevailed, and overspread
        almost the whole land, he thought, that he was left alone.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"
        ><i>I have reserved for myself seven thousand,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> Though you may take this finite for an indefinite number,
        it was yet the Lord&#8217;s design to specify a large multitude. Since
        then the grace of God prevails so much in an extreme state of things,
        let us not lightly give over to the devil all those whose piety does not
        openly appear to us. It also ought to be fully imprinted on our minds,
        &#8212; that however impiety may everywhere prevail, and dreadful
        confusion spread on every side, yet the salvation of many remains
        secured under the seal of God. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f338</font></sup
      ><font>
        But that no one may under this error indulge his own sloth, as many seek
        hiding-places for their vices in the hidden providences of God, it is
        right to observe again, &#8212; that they only are said to be saved who
        continue sound and unpolluted in the faith of God. This circumstance in
        the case ought also to be noticed, &#8212; that those only remained safe
        who did not prostitute their body, no, not even by an external act of
        dissimulation, to the worship of idols; for he not only ascribes to them
        a purity of mind, but that they had also kept their body from being
        polluted by any filthiness of superstition. </font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>So then also at this time,</i></font

        things alike, he calls God&#8217;s people a remnant, that is, in
        comparison with the vast number in whom impiety prevailed: and alluding
        at the same time to the prophecy he had quoted from Isaiah, he shows,
        that in the midst of a miserable and confused desolation the
        faithfulness of God yet shone forth, for there was still some remnant:
        and in order more fully to confirm this, he expressly calls them a
        remnant that survived through the grace of God: and thus he bore witness
        that God&#8217;s election is unchangeable, according to what the Lord
        said to Elias, &#8212; that where the whole people had fallen away to
        idolatry, he had reserved for himself seven thousand: and hence we
        conclude, that through his kindness they were delivered from
        destruction. Nor does he simply speak of grace; but he now calls our
        attention also to election, that we may learn reverently to rely on the
        hidden purpose of God.</font

        the cause of election to be that worthiness in us which God has
        foreseen? For whether you introduce works future or past, this
        declaration of Paul opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing
        to works. Paul speaks not here of our reconciliation with God, nor of
        the means, nor of the proximate causes of our salvation; but he ascends
        higher, even to this, &#8212; why God, before the foundation of the
        world, chose only some and passed by others: and he declares, that God
        was led to make this difference by nothing else, but by his own good
        pleasure; for if any place is given to works, so much, he maintains, is
        taken away from grace.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It hence follows, that it is absurd to blend foreknowledge of works
        with election. For if God chooses some and rejects others, as he has
        foreseen them to be worthy or unworthy of salvation, then the grace of
        God, the reward of works being established, cannot reign alone, but must
        be only in part the cause of our election. For as Paul has reasoned
        before concerning the justification of Abraham, that where reward is
        paid, there grace is not freely bestowed; so now he draws his argument
        from the same fountain, &#8212; that if works come to the account, when
        God adopts a certain number of men unto salvation, reward is a matter of
        debt, and that therefore it is not a free gift. </font

        there are no merits of works, our salvation is ascribed to the grace of
        God, or rather, that we may believe that the righteousness of works is

        question, as though he was in doubt. He intended, however, by expressing
        this doubt, to render the answer, which immediately follows, more
        evident; for he intimates, that no other can be given; and the answer
        is, &#8212; that Israel in vain labored to seek salvation, because his
        attempt was absurd. Though he mentions here no cause, yet as he had
        expressed it before, he certainly meant it to be understood in this
        place. For his words are the same, as though he had said, &#8212; that
        it ought not to seem strange, that Israel gained nothing in striving
        after righteousness. And hence is proved what he presently subjoins
        concerning election, &#8212; For if Israel has obtained nothing by
        merit, what have others obtained whose case or condition was not better?

        taken in a collective sense, for the elect themselves, that there may be
        a correspondence between the two clauses. Of this opinion I do not
        disapprove, provided it be allowed that there is something more in the
        word than if he had said, the elect, even this, that he intimates that
        there was no other reason for obtaining their election, as though he
        said, &#8212; &#8220;They are not those who strive by relying on merits,
        but those whose salvation depends on the gratuitous election of
        God.&#8221; For he distinctly compares with the whole of Israel, or body
        of the people, the remnant which was to be saved by God&#8217;s grace.
        It hence follows, that the cause of salvation exists not in men, but

        As the elect alone are delivered by God&#8217;s grace from destruction,

        contexts; for you will find that in every passage, blindness and
        hardening are mentioned as scourges, by which God punished crimes
        already committed by the ungodly; but Paul labors to prove here, that

        eternal reprobation, has not without reason referred to those things
        which proceed from it, as fruit from the tree or river from the
        fountain. The ungodly are indeed, for their sins, visited by God&#8217;s
        judgment with blindness; but if we seek<i> </i>for the source of their

        they cannot by all their deeds, sayings, and purposes, get and obtain
        any thing but a curse. Yet the cause of eternal reprobation is so hidden
        from us, that nothing remains for us but to wonder at the
        incomprehensible purpose of God, as we shall at length see by the
        conclusion. But they reason absurdly who, whenever a word is said of the
        proximate causes, strive, by bringing forward these, to cover the first,
        which is hid from our view; as though God had not, before the fall of
        Adam, freely determined to do what seemed good to him with respect to
        the whole human race on this account, &#8212; because he condemns his
        corrupt and depraved seed, and also, because he repays to individuals
        the reward which their sins have deserved. </font

        here from Isaiah is that which Luke refers to in Acts, as quoted from
        him, only the words are somewhat altered. Nor does he record here what
        we find in the Prophet, but only collects from him this sentiment,
        &#8212; that they were imbued from above with the spirit of
        maliciousness, so that they continued dull in seeing and hearing. The
        Prophet was indeed bidden to harden the heart of the people: but Paul
        penetrates to the very fountain, &#8212; that brutal stupor seizes on
        all the senses of men, after they are given up to this madness, so that
        they excite themselves by virulent stimulants against the truth. For he
        does not call it the spirit of giddiness, but of compunction, when the
        bitterness of gall shows itself; yea, when there is also a fury in
        rejecting the truth. And he declares, that by the secret judgment of God
        the reprobate are so demented, that being stupified, they are incapable
        of forming a judgment; for when it is said, that by seeing they see
        nothing, the dullness of their senses is thereby intimated. </font

        been formerly fulfilled, and that it was therefore absurd to apply it to
        the time of the gospel: this objection he anticipates, by subjoining,
        that it was not only a blindness of one day, which is
        <i>described, </i>but that it had continued, together with the
        unhealable obstinacy of the people, to the coming of Christ. </font

        in the words, but it is not what changes the meaning. For he thus
        speaks, &#8220;Let their table before them become a snare, and their
        peaceful things a trap;&#8221;<i> </i>there is no mention of
        retribution. As to the main point there is sufficient agreement. The
        Prophet prays, that whatever is desirable and happy in life might turn
        out to the ruin and destruction of the ungodly; and this is what he
        means by <i>table </i>and <i>peaceful things. </i></font

        He then gives them up to blindness of spirit and weakening of strength;
        the one of which he expresses by the darkening of the eyes, and the
        other by the incurvation of the back. But that this should be extended
        almost to the whole nation, is not to be wondered at; for we know, that
        not only the chief men were incensed against David, but that the common
        people were also opposed to him. It appears plain, that what is read in
        that passage was not applied to a few, but to a large number; yea, when
        we consider of whom David was a type, there appears to be a spiritual
        import in the opposite clause. </font

        embrace with humility and trembling the grace of God. We may add, that

        argument, except you take notice, that the Apostle speaks sometimes of
        the whole nation of the Jews, and sometimes of single individuals; for
        hence arises the diversity, that onewhile he speaks of the Jews as being
        banished from the kingdom of God, cut off from the tree and precipitated
        by God&#8217;s judgment into destruction, and that at another he denies
        that they had fallen from grace, but that on the contrary they continued
        in the possession of the covenant, and had a place in the Church of
        God.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >It is then in conformity with this difference that he now speaks; for
        since the Jews for the most part rejected Christ, so that perverseness
        had taken hold almost on the whole nation, and few among them seemed to
        be of a sane mind, he asks the question, whether the Jewish nation had
        so stumbled at Christ, that it was all over with them universally, and
        that no hope of repentance remained. Here he justly denies that the
        salvation of the Jews was to be despaired of, or that they were so
        rejected by God, that there was to be no future restoration, or that the
        covenant of grace, which he had once made with them, was entirely
        abolished, since there had ever remained in that nation the seed of
        blessing. That we are so to understand his meaning is evident from this,
        &#8212; that having before connected a sure ruin with blindness, he now
        gives a hope of rising again; which two things are wholly different.
        They then, who perversely stumbled at Christ, fell and fell into
        destruction; yet the nation itself had not fallen, so that he who is a
        Jew must necessarily perish or be alienated from God.</font

        that the fall of the Jews had turned out for salvation to the Gentiles;
        but to this end &#8212; that they might be kindled by a sort of
        jealousy, and be thus led to repentance. He no doubt had an eye to the
        testimony of Moses, which he had already quoted, where the Lord
        threatened Israel, &#8212; that as he had been provoked by them to
        emulation through their false gods; so he also, according to the law of
        retaliation, would provoke them by a foolish nation.</font

        then it was the Lord&#8217;s purpose that Israel should be provoked to
        emulation, they were not so fallen as to be precipitated into eternal
        ruin; but that God&#8217;s blessing, despised by them, might come to the
        Gentiles, in order that they might at length be also stirred up to seek
        the Lord, from whom they had fallen away.</font

        application of this testimony: for Paul does not dwell on the strict
        meaning of the word, but alludes only to a common and well-known
        practice. For as emulation stimulates a wife, who for her fault has been
        rejected by her husband, so that she strives to be reconciled again; so
        it may be now, he says, that the Jews, seeing the Gentiles introduced
        into their place, will be touched with grief for their divorce, and seek
        reconciliation.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>And if their fall,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> As he had taught us that after the Jews were repudiated,
        the Gentiles were introduced in their place, that he might not make the
        salvation of the Jews to be disliked by the Gentiles, as though their
        salvation depended on the ruin of the Jews, he anticipates this false
        notion, and lays down a sentiment of an opposite kind, that nothing
        would conduce more to advance the salvation of the Gentiles, than that
        the grace of God should flourish and abound among the Jews. To prove
        this, he derives an argument from the less, &#8212; &#8220;If their fall
        had raised the Gentiles, and their diminution had enriched them, how
        much more their fullness?&#8221; for the first was done contrary to
        nature, and the last will be done according to a natural order of
        things. And it is no objection to this reasoning, that the word of God
        had flowed to the Gentiles, after the Jews had rejected, and, as it
        were, cast it from them; for if they had received it, their faith would
        have brought forth much more fruit than their unbelief had occasioned;
        for the truth of God would have been thereby confirmed by being
        accomplished in them, and they also themselves would have led many by
        their teaching, whom they, on the contrary, by their perverseness, had
        turned aside.</font

        lost by the Gentiles, were the Jews to return again to favor with God;
        for he shows, that the salvation of both is so connected, that it can by
        the same means be promoted. For he thus addresses the Gentiles, &#8212;
        &#8220;Though I am peculiarly destined to be your Apostle, and ought
        therefore with special care to seek your salvation, with which I am
        charged, and to omit as it were all other things, and to labor for that
        only, I shall yet be faithfully discharging my office, by gaining to
        Christ any of my own nation; and this will be for the glory of my

        indeed ought to be the ministry of our salvation, as that we may feel
        that the whole power and efficacy of it depends on God, and that we may
        give him his due praise: we ought at the same time to understand that
        preaching is an instrument for effecting the salvation of the faithful,
        and though it can do nothing without the Spirit of God, yet through his
        inward operation it produces the most powerful effects.</font

        pervert, ought, in my view, to be understood as another argument,
        derived from a comparison of the less with the greater, according to
        this import, &#8220;Since<i> </i>the rejection of the Jews has availed
        so much as to occasion the reconciling of the Gentiles, how much more
        effectual will be their resumption? Will it not be to raise them even
        from the dead?&#8221; For Paul ever insists on this, that the Gentiles
        have no cause for envy, as though the restoration of the Jews to favor
        were to render their condition worse. Since then God has wonderfully
        drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how much more ought
        we to hope, he reasons, that the resurrection of a people, as it were,

        the kingdom of death to the kingdom of life, for though the thing is the

        any prerogative of honor of their own, did in no respect excel the Jews,
        nay, that if they came to a contest, they should be left far behind. Let
        us remember that in this comparison man is not compared with man, but
        nation with nation. If then a comparison be made between them, they
        shall be found equal in this respect, that they are both equally the
        children of Adam; the only difference is that the Jews had been
        separated from the Gentiles, that they might be a peculiar people to the
        Lord. </font

        Gentiles; but as the efficacy of the covenant appeared then but small,
        he bids us to look back to Abraham and the patriarchs, in whom the
        blessing of God was not indeed either empty or void. He hence concludes,
        that from them an heredity<sub> </sub>holiness had passed to all their
        posterity. But this conclusion would not have been right had he spoken
        of persons, or rather had he not regarded the promise; for when the
        father is just, he cannot yet transmit his own uprightness to his son:
        but as the Lord had sanctified Abraham for himself for this end, that
        his seed might also be holy, and as he thus conferred holiness not only
        on his person but also on his whole race, the Apostle does not
        unsuitably draw this conclusion, that all the Jews were sanctified in
        their father Abraham. </font

        from the ceremonies of the law, and the other borrowed from nature. The
        first-fruits which were offered sanctified the whole lump, in like
        manner the goodness of the juice diffuses itself from the root to the
        branches; and posterity hold the same connection with their parents from
        whom they proceed as the lump has with the first-fruits, and the
        branches with the tree. It is not then a strange thing that the Jews
        were sanctified in their father. There is here no difficulty if you
        understand by holiness the spiritual nobility of the nation, and that
        indeed not belonging to nature, but what proceeded from the covenant. It
        may be truly said, I allow, that the Jews were naturally holy, for their
        adoption was hereditary; but I now speak of our first nature, according
        to which we are all, as we know, accursed in Adam. Therefore the dignity
        of an elect people, to speak correctly, is a supernatural
        privilege.</font

        which is no other than to be of the branches; which, being taken from
        another, are set in some noble tree: for the origin of the Gentiles was
        as it were from some wild and unfruitful olive, as nothing but a curse
        was to be found in their whole race. Whatever glory then they had was
        from their new insition, not from their old stock. There was then no
        reason for the Gentiles to glory in their own dignity in comparison with
        the Jews. We may also add, that Paul wisely mitigates the severity of
        the case, by not saying that the whole top of the tree was cut off, but
        that some of the branches were broken, and also that God took some here
        and there from among the Gentiles, whom he set in the holy and blessed
        trunk. </font

        ><i>But if thou gloriest, thou bearest not the root,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> The Gentiles could not contend with the Jews respecting
        the excellency of their race without contending with Abraham himself;
        which would have been extremely unbecoming, since he was like a root by
        which they were borne and nourished. As unreasonable as it would be for
        the branches to boast against the root, so unreasonable would it have
        been for the Gentiles to glory against the Jews, that is, with respect
        to the excellency of their race; for Paul would have them ever to
        consider whence was the origin of their salvation. And we know that
        after Christ by his coming has pulled down the partition-wall, the whole
        world partook of the favor which God had previously conferred on the
        chosen people. It hence follows, that the calling of the Gentiles was
        like an ingrafting, and that they did not otherwise grow up as
        God&#8217;s people than as they were grafted in the stock of
        Abraham.</font

        might have pleaded for themselves; but that was of such a nature as
        ought not to have filled them with pride, but, on the contrary, to have
        made them humble. For if the cutting off of the Jews was through
        unbelief, and if the ingrafting of the Gentiles was by faith, what was
        their duty but to acknowledge the favor of God, and also to cherish
        modesty and humbleness of mind? For it is the nature of faith, and what
        properly belongs to it, to generate humility and fear. </font

        But by fear understand that which is in no way inconsistent with the
        assurance of faith; for Paul would not have our faith to vacillate or to
        alternate with doubt, much less would he have us to be frightened or to
        quake with fear. </font

        >Of what kind then is this fear? As the Lord bids us to take into our
        consideration two things, so two kinds of feeling must thereby be
        produced. For he would have us ever to bear in mind the miserable
        condition of our nature; and this can produce nothing but dread,
        weariness, anxiety, and despair; and it is indeed expedient that we
        should thus be thoroughly laid prostrate and broken down, that we may at
        length groan to him; but this dread, derived from the knowledge of
        ourselves, keeps not our minds while relying on his goodness, from
        continuing calm; this weariness hinders us not from enjoying full
        consolation in him; this anxiety, this despair, does not prevent us from
        obtaining in him real joy and hope. Hence the fear, of which he speaks,
        is set up as an antidote to proud contempt; for as every one claims for
        himself more than what is right, and becomes too secure and at length
        insolent towards others, we ought then so far to fear, that our heart
        may not swell with pride and elate itself.</font

        reminds them to beware lest they also should not be spared. To this I
        answer, &#8212; that as this exhortation refers to the subduing of the
        flesh, which is ever insolent even in the children of God, he derogates
        nothing from the certainty of faith. And we must especially notice and
        remember what I have before said, &#8212; that Paul&#8217;s address is
        not so much to individuals as to the whole body of the Gentiles, among
        whom there might have been many, who were vainly inflated, professing
        rather than having faith. On account of these Paul threatens the
        Gentiles, not without reason, with excision, as we shall hereafter find
        again.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"

      ><font
        ><i> etc. </i>This is a most powerful reason to beat down all
        self-confidence: for the rejection of the Jews should never come across
        our minds without striking and shaking us with dread. For what ruined
        them, but that through supine dependence on the dignity which they had
        obtained, they despised what God had appointed? They were not spared,
        though they were natural branches; what then shall be done to us, who
        are the wild olive and aliens, if we become beyond measure arrogant? But
        this thought, as it leads us to distrust ourselves, so it tends to make
        us to cleave more firmly and steadfastly to the goodness of God.</font

        generally to the body of the Gentiles, for the excision, of which he
        speaks, could not apply to individuals, whose election is unchangeable,
        based on the eternal purpose of God. Paul therefore declares to the
        Gentiles, that if they exulted over the Jews,<i> </i>a reward for their
        pride would be prepared for them; for God will again reconcile to
        himself the first people whom he has divorced.</font

      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But as he speaks not of the elect individually, but of the whole body,
        a condition is added, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>If they continued in his kindness</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>. </i>I indeed allow, that as soon as any one abuses God&#8217;s
        goodness, he deserves to be deprived of the offered favor; but it would
        be improper to say of any one of the godly particularly, that God had
        mercy on him, when he chose him, provided he would continue in his
        mercy; for the perseverance of faith, which completes in us the effect
        of God&#8217;s grace, flows from election itself. Paul then teaches us,
        that the Gentiles were admitted into the hope of eternal life on the
        condition, that they by their gratitude retained possession of it. And
        dreadful indeed was the defection of the whole world, which afterwards
        happened; and this dearly proves, that this exhortation was not
        superfluous; for when God had almost in a moment watered it with his
        grace, so that religion flourished everywhere, soon after the truth of
        the gospel vanished, and the treasure of salvation was taken away. And
        whence came so sudden a change, except that the Gentiles had fallen away
        from their calling?</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> We now understand in what sense Paul threatens them with
        excision, whom he has already allowed to have been grafted into the hope
        of life through God&#8217;s election. For, first, though this cannot
        happen to the elect, they have yet need of such warning, in order to
        subdue the pride of the flesh; which being really opposed to their
        salvation, ought justly to be terrified with the dread of perdition. As
        far then as Christians are illuminated by faith, they hear, for their
        assurance, that the calling of God is without repentance; but as far as
        they carry about them the flesh, which wantonly resists the grace of
        God, they are taught humility by this warning, &#8220;Take<i> </i>heed
        lest thou be cut off.&#8221; Secondly, we must bear in mind the solution
        which I have before mentioned, &#8212; that Paul speaks not here of the
        special election of individuals, but sets the Gentiles and Jews in
        opposition the one to the other; and that therefore the elect are not so
        much addressed in these words, as those who falsely gloried that they
        had obtained the place of the Jews: nay, he speaks to the Gentiles
        generally, and addresses the whole body in common, among whom there were
        many who were faithful, and those who were members of Christ in name
        only.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But if it be asked respecting individuals, &#8220;How<i> </i>any one
        could be cut off from the grafting, and how, after excision, he could be
        grafted again,&#8221; &#8212; bear in mind, that there are three modes
        of insition, and two modes of excision. For instance, the children of
        the faithful are ingrafted, to whom the promise belongs according to the
        covenant made with the fathers; ingrafted are also they who indeed
        receive the seed of the gospel, but it strikes no root, or it is choked
        before it brings any fruit; and thirdly, the elect are ingrafted, who
        are illuminated unto eternal life according to the immutable purpose of
        God. The first are cut off, when they refuse the promise given to their
        fathers, or do not receive it on account of their ingratitude; the
        second are cut off, when the seed is withered and destroyed; and as the
        danger of this impends over all, with regard to their own nature, it
        must be allowed that this warning which Paul gives belongs in a certain
        way to the faithful, lest they indulge themselves in the sloth of the
        flesh. But with regard to the present passage, it is enough for us to
        know, that the vengeance which God had executed on the Jews, is
        pronounced on the Gentiles, in case they become like them.</font
      ><br /><font><b>23.</b></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> For God is able,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc</i>. Frigid would this argument be to the profane; for however
        they may concede power to God, yet as they view it at a distance, shut
        up as it were in heaven, they do for the most part rob it of its effect.
        But as the faithful, whenever they hear God&#8217;s power named, look on
        it as in present operation, he thought that this reason was sufficient
        to strike their minds. We may add, that he assumes this as an
        acknowledged axiom, &#8212; that God had so punished the unbelief of his
        people as not to forget his mercy; according to what he had done before,
        having often restored the Jews, after he had apparently banished them
        from his kingdom. And he shows at the same time by the comparison, how
        much more easy it would be to reverse the present state of things than
        to have introduced it; that is, how much easier it would be for the
        natural branches, if they were again put in the place from which they
        had been cut off, to draw substance from their own root, than for the
        wild and the unfruitful, from a foreign stock: for such is the
        comparison made between the Jews and the Gentiles.</font

        he avows that he is going to declare something that was secret. Nor did
        he do this without reason; for he wished to conclude, by a brief or
        plain sentence, a very perplexed question; and yet he declares what no
        one could have expected. But the words, </font

        was also necessary, lest the defection of that people should
        immoderately disturb the minds of the weak, as though the salvation of
        them all was to be for ever despaired of. The same is still not less
        useful to us at this day, so that we may know, that the salvation of the
        remnant, whom the Lord will at length gather to himself, is hid, sealed
        as it were by his signet. And whenever a long delay tempts us to
        despair, let us remember this word <i>mystery; </i>by which Paul clearly
        reminds us, that the mode of their conversion will neither be common nor
        usual; and hence they act absurdly who attempt to measure it by their
        own judgment; for what can be more unreasonable than to regard that as
        incredible which is far removed from our view? It is called a mystery,

        gospel, it might be transferred to the Gentiles, and that these might
        occupy, as it were, the vacated possession. And so this blindness served
        the providence of God in furthering the salvation of the Gentiles, which
        he had designed. And the </font

        ><i> </i>of the Gentiles is to be taken for a great number: for it was
        not to be, as before, when a few proselytes connected themselves with
        the Jews; but such was to be the change, that the Gentiles would form
        almost the entire body of the Church. </font

        God&#8217;s family.&#8221; This interpretation seems to me the most
        suitable, because Paul intended here to set forth the completion of the
        kingdom of Christ, which is by no means to be confined to the Jews, but
        is to include the whole world. The same manner of speaking we find in </font

      ><font
        >Galatians 6:16. The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered

        &#8212; that Christ had been promised and offered to them, but that as
        they rejected him, they were deprived of his grace; yet the

        to the fountain itself.</font

      <font
        >But though in this prophecy deliverance to the spiritual people of God
        is promised, among whom even Gentiles are included; yet as the Jews are
        the first-born, what the Prophet declares must be fulfilled, especially
        in them: for that Scripture calls all the people of God Israelites, is
        to be ascribed to the pre-eminence of that nation, whom God had
        preferred to all other nations. And then, from a regard to the ancient
        covenant, he says expressly, that a Redeemer shall come to Sion; and he
        adds, that he will redeem those in Jacob who shall return from their
        transgression. </font

      ><font>
        By these words God distinctly claims for himself a certain seed, so that
        his redemption may be effectual in his elect and peculiar nation. And
        though fitter for his purpose would have been the expression used by the
        Prophet, &#8220;shall<i> </i>come to Sion;&#8221;<i> </i>yet Paul made
        no scruple to follow the commonly received translation, which reads,
        &#8220;The Redeemer shall come forth from Mount Sion.&#8221; And similar
        is the case as to the second part, &#8220;He shall turn away iniquities
        from Jacob:&#8221; for Paul thought it enough to regard this point only,
        &#8212; that as it is Christ&#8217;s peculiar office to reconcile to<i
        > </i>God an apostate and faithless people, some change was surely to be
        looked for, lest they should all perish together.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>And, This is my covenant with them,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> Though Paul, by the last prophecy of Isaiah, briefly
        touched on the office of the Messiah, in order to remind the Jews what
        was to be expected especially from him, he further adds these few words
        from Jeremiah, expressly for the same purpose; for what is added is not
        found in the former passage. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f362</font></sup
      ><font>
        This also tends to confirm the subject in hand; for what he said of the
        conversion of a people who were so stubborn and obstinate, might have
        appeared incredible: he therefore removes this stumblingblock, by
        declaring that the covenant included a gratuitous remission of sins. For
        we may gather front the words of the Prophet, &#8212; that God would
        have no more to do with his apostate people, until he should remit the
        crime of perfidy, as well as their other sins.</font

        not unmindful of the covenant which he had made with their fathers, and
        by which he testified that according to his eternal purpose he loved
        that nation: and this he confirms by this remarkable declaration,

        as meaning the gift of calling: and this is not to be taken for any sort
        of calling but of that, by which God had adopted the posterity of
        Abraham into covenant; since this is especially the subject here, as he
        has previously, by the word, election, designated the secret purpose of

        have failed, but had not been cut up by the roots. As the Jews had
        fallen from their privilege and the salvation promised them, that some
        hope might remain to the remnant, Paul maintains that the purpose of God
        stands firm and immovable, by which he had once deigned to choose them

        the Jews, has been before stated, namely, that God, being angry with the
        Jews for their unbelief, turned his kindness to them. What immediately
        follows, that they became unbelievers through the mercy manifested to
        the Gentiles, seems rather strange; and yet there is in it nothing
        unreasonable; for Paul assigns not the cause of blindness, but only
        declares, that what God transferred to the Gentiles had been taken away
        from the Jews. But lest what. they had lost through unbelief, should be
        thought by the Gentiles to have been gained by them through the merit of
        faith, mention is made only of mercy. What is substantially said then
        is, &#8212; that as God purposed to show mercy to the Gentiles, the Jews
        were on this account deprived of the light of faith.</font

        A remarkable conclusion, by which he shows that there is no reason why
        they who have a hope of salvation should despair of others; for whatever
        they may now be, they have been like all the rest. If they have emerged
        from unbelief through God&#8217;s mercy alone, they ought to leave place
        for it as to others also. For he makes the Jews equal in guilt with the
        Gentiles, that both might understand that the avenue to salvation is no
        less open to others than to them. For it is the mercy of God alone which
        saves; and this offers itself to both. This sentence then corresponds
        with the testimony of Hosea, which he had before quoted, &#8220;I<i
        > </i>will call those my people who were not my people.&#8221; But he
        does not mean, that God so blinds all men that their unbelief is to be
        imputed to him; but that he hath so arranged by his providence, that all
        should be guilty of unbelief, in order that he might have them subject
        to his judgment, and for this end, &#8212; that all merits being buried,
        salvation might proceed from his goodness alone. </font

        Paul simply means that both Jews<i> </i>and Gentiles do not otherwise
        obtain salvation than through the mercy of God, and thus he leaves to
        none any reason for complaint. It is indeed true that this mercy<i

        the curiosity of investigating it. Let us then learn to make no
        searchings respecting the Lord, except as far as he has revealed himself
        in the Scriptures; for otherwise we shall enter a labyrinth, from which
        the retreat is not easy. It must however be noticed, that he speaks not

        are too blind to take a view of God&#8217;s predestination by their own
        understanding, and to reason on a thing unknown is presumptuous and
        absurd; the other is, that we can have no cause of complaint against
        God, since no mortal can boast that God is a debtor to him; but that, on
        the contrary, all are under obligations to him for his bounty. </font

        predestination, since we hear that man can distinguish nothing in this
        case, any more than a blind man in darkness. This caution, however, is
        not to be so applied as to weaken the certainty of faith, which proceeds
        not from the acumen of the human mind, but solely from the illumination
        of the Spirit; for Paul himself in another place, after having testified
        that all the mysteries of God far exceed the comprehension of our minds,
        immediately subjoins that the faithful understand the mind of the Lord,
        because they have not received the spirit of this world, but the Spirit
        which has been given them by God, by whom they are instructed as to his

        our standing. If any one will seek to know more than what God has
        revealed, he shall be overwhelmed with the immeasurable brightness of
        inaccessible light. But we must bear in mind the distinction, which I
        have before mentioned, between the secret counsel of God, and his will
        made known in Scripture; for though the whole doctrine of Scripture
        surpasses in its height the mind of man, yet an access to it is not
        closed against the faithful, who reverently and soberly follow the

        effectually defended against all the accusations of the ungodly: for if
        no one retains him bound to himself by his own merits, no one can justly
        expostulate with him for not having received his reward; as he, who
        would constrain another to do him good, must necessarily adduce those
        deeds by which he has deserved a reward. The import then of Paul&#8217;s
        words is this &#8212; &#8220;God cannot be charged with unrighteousness,
        except it can be proved, that he renders not to every one his due: but
        it is evident, that no one is deprived by him of his right, since he is

        >Now this is a remarkable passage; for we are here taught, that it is
        not in our power to constrain God by our good works to bestow salvation
        on us, but that he anticipates the undeserving by his gratuitous
        goodness. But if we desire to make an honest examination, we shall not
        only find, that God is in no way a debtor to us, but that we are all
        subject to his judgment, &#8212; that we not only deserve no layout, but
        that we are worthy of eternal death. And Paul not only concludes, that
        God owes us nothing, on account of our corrupt and sinful nature; but he
        denies, that if man were perfect, he could bring anything before God, by
        which he could gain his favor; for as soon as he begins to exist, he is
        already by the right of creation so much indebted to his Maker, that he
        has nothing of his own. In vain then shall we try to take from him his
        own right, that he should not, as he pleases, freely determine
        respecting his own creatures, as though there was mutual debt and
        credit.</font

        very far from being the case, that we can glory<sub> </sub>in any good
        thing of our own against God, since we have been created by him from
        nothing, and now exist through him. He hence infers, that our being
        should be employed for his glory: for how unreasonable would it be for
        creatures, whom he has formed and whom he sustains, to live for any
        other purpose than for making his glory known? It has not escaped my
        notice, that the phrase, </font

        more suitable to the present subject, it is better to retain it, than to
        adopt that which is improper. The import of what is said is, &#8212;
        That the whole order of nature would be strangely subverted, were not
        God, who is the beginning of all things, the end also.</font

        confidently assumes it as indubitable, &#8212; That the Lord&#8217;s own
        glory ought everywhere to continue to him unchangeably: for the sentence
        would be frigid were it taken generally; but its emphasis depends on the
        context, that. God justly claims for himself absolute supremacy, and
        that in the condition of mankind and of the whole world nothing is to be
        sought beyond his own glory. It hence follows, that absurd and
        contrary<sub> </sub>to reason, and even insane, are all those sentiments
        which tend to diminish his glory.</font

        Christ, the soul is, as it were, regenerated into a celestial life, and
        that the life is in a manner formed and regulated by holy exhortations
        and precepts; it is then in vain that you show a desire to form the life

        foundation; for by omitting principles, they offer a mutilated doctrine,
        like a body without a head. Not very unlike this is the mode of teaching
        under the Papacy: for though they mention, by the way, faith in Christ
        and the grace of the Holy Spirit, it yet appears quite evident, that

        flow, even this, &#8212; that we are redeemed by the Lord for this end
        &#8212; that we may consecrate to him ourselves and all our members. But

        audacity the door of sin. But this exhortation teaches us, that until
        men really apprehend how much they owe to the mercy of God, they will
        never with a right feeling worship him, nor be effectually stimulated to
        fear and obey him. It is enough for the Papists, if they can extort by
        terror some sort of forced obedience, I know not what. But Paul, that he
        might bind us to God, not by servile fear, but by the voluntary and
        cheerful love of righteousness, allures us by the sweetness of that
        favor, by which our salvation is effected; and at the same time he

        he means the Apostleship, with respect to which he exalts God&#8217;s
        kindness, and at the same time intimates, that he had not crept in
        through his own presumption, but, that he was chosen by the calling of
        God. Having then by this preface secured authority to himself, he laid
        the Romans under the necessity of obeying, unless they were prepared to

        exhorts us to think and meditate on those things which may render us
        sober-minded and modest. For so I understand the words, rather than in
        the sense given by Erasmus<i>, </i>who thus renders them, &#8220;Let no

        there is an immoderate affectation of wisdom, not only in empty things

        things which are otherwise useful, when we regard not what has been
        given to us, but through rashness and presumption go beyond the measure

        ><i> etc.</i> The very thing which he had previously said of limiting
        the wisdom of each according to the measure of faith, he now confirms by
        a reference to the vocation of the faithful; for we are called for this
        end, that we may unite together in one body, since Christ has ordained a
        fellowship and connection between the faithful similar to that which
        exists between the members of the human body; and as men could not of
        themselves come together into such an union, he himself becomes the bond
        of this connection. As then the case is with the human body, so it ought
        to be with the society of the faithful. By applying this similitude he
        proves how necessary<sub> </sub>it is for each to consider what is
        suitable to his own nature, capacity, and vocation. But though this
        similitude has various parts, it is yet to be chiefly thus applied to
        our present subject, &#8212; that as the members of the same body have
        distinct offices, and all of them are distinct, for no member possesses
        all powers, nor does it appropriate to itself the offices<i> </i>of
        others; so God has distributed various gifts to us, by which diversity
        he has determined the order which he would have to be observed among us,
        so that every one is to conduct himself according to the measure of his
        capacity, and not to thrust himself into what peculiarly<i> </i>belongs
        to others; nor is any one to seek to have all things himself, but to be
        content with his lot, and willingly to abstain from usurping the offices
        of others. When, however, he points out in express words the communion
        which is between us, he at the same time intimates, how much diligence
        there ought to be in all, so that they may contribute to the common good
        of the body according to the faculties they possess. </font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Having gifts</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, etc.</i> Paul speaks not now simply of cherishing among ourselves
        brotherly love, but commends humility, which is the best moderator of
        our whole life. Every one desires to have so much himself, so as not to
        need any help from others; but the bond of mutual communication is this,
        that no one has sufficient for himself, but is constrained to borrow
        from others. I admit, then that the society of the godly cannot exist,
        except when each one is content with his own measure, and imparts to
        others the gifts which he has received, and allows himself by turns to
        be assisted by the gifts of others.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But Paul especially intended to beat down the pride which he knew to be
        innate in men; and that no one might be dissatisfied that all things
        have not been bestowed on him, he reminds us that according to the wise
        counsel of God every one has his own portion given to him; for it is
        necessary to the common benefit of the body that no one should be
        furnished with fullness of gifts, lest he should heedlessly despise his
        brethren. Here then we have the main design which the Apostle had in
        view, that all things do not meet in all, but that the gifts of God are
        so distributed that each has a limited portion, and that
        <i>each </i>ought to be so attentive in imparting his own gifts to the
        edification of the Church, that no one, by leaving his own function, may
        trespass on that of another. By this most beautiful order, and as it
        were symmetry, is the safety of the Church indeed preserved; that is,
        when every one imparts to all in common what he has received from the
        Lord, in such a way as not to impede others. He who inverts this order
        fights with God, by whose ordinance it is appointed; for the difference
        of gifts proceeds not from the will of man, but because it has pleased
        the Lord to distribute his grace in this manner.</font

        one in his place, or as it were in occupying his station, ought to be
        engaged. For all gifts have their own defined limits, and to depart from
        them is to mar the gifts themselves. But the passage appears somewhat
        confused; we may yet arrange it in this manner, &#8220;Let him who has
        prophecy, test it by the analogy of faith; let him in the ministry
        discharge it in teaching,&#8221; </font

      <font

        that by </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>prophecy</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>is meant the gift of predicting, which prevailed at the
        commencement of the gospel in the Church; as the Lord then designed in
        every way to commend the dignity and excellency of his Church; and they
        think that what is added, <i>according to the analogy of faith, </i>is
        to be applied to all the clauses. But I prefer to follow those who
        extend this word wider, even to the peculiar gift of revelation, by
        which any one skillfully and wisely performed the office of an
        interpreter in explaining the will of God. Hence prophecy at this day in
        the Christian Church is hardly anything else than the right
        understanding of the Scripture, and the peculiar faculty of explaining
        it, inasmuch as all the ancient prophecies and all the oracles of God
        have been completed in Christ and in his gospel. For in</font

        (and they were the elders, who presided over and ruled others and

        universally to all kinds of governors: for no small solicitude is
        required from those who provide for the safety of all, and no small
        diligence is needful for them who ought to watch day and night for the
        wellbeing of the whole community. Yet the state of things at that time
        proves that Paul does not speak of all kinds of rulers, for there were
        then no pious magistrates; but of the elders who were the correctors of
        morals.</font

      ><font
        ><i>, etc. </i>Proceeding now to speak of particular duties, he fitly
        begins with love, which is the bond of perfection. And respecting this
        he enjoins what is especially necessary, that all disguises are to be
        cast aside, and that love is to arise from pure sincerity of mind. It is
        indeed difficult to express how ingenious almost all men are to pretend
        a love which they really have not, for they not only deceive others, but
        impose also on themselves, while they persuade themselves that those are
        not loved amiss by them, whom they not only neglect, but really slight.
        Hence Paul declares here, that love is no other but that which is free
        from all dissimulation: and any one may easily be a witness to himself,
        whether he has anything in the recesses of his heart which is opposed to
        love. </font

        The words <i>good </i>and <i>evil, </i>which immediately follow in the
        context, have not here a general meaning; but <i>evil </i>is to be taken
        for that malicious wickedness by which an injury is done to men; and
        <i>good </i>for that kindness, by which help is rendered to them; and
        there is here an antithesis usual in Scripture, when vices are first
        forbidden and then virtues enjoined.</font

        >for in my judgment Paul intended to express something more; and the
        meaning of the term &#8220;turning away,&#8221; corresponds better with
        the opposite clause; for he not only bids us to exercise kindness, but
        even to cleave to it.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>With brotherly love,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> By no words could he satisfy himself in setting forth the
        ardor of that love, with which we ought to embrace one another: for he
        calls it </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>brotherly</i></font
      ><font><i>, </i>and its emotion </font

      ><font>
        That this may be the case,<i> </i>he subjoins a precept very necessary
        for the preservation of benevolence, &#8212; that every one is to give
        honor to his brethren and not to himself; for there is no poison more
        effectual in alienating the minds of men than the thought, that one is
        despised. But if by honor you are disposed to understand every act of
        friendly kindness, I do not much object: I however approve more of the
        former interpretation. For as there is nothing more opposed to brotherly
        concord than contempt, arising from haughtiness, when each one,
        neglecting others, advances himself; so the best fomenter of love is
        humility, when every one honors others.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Not slothful in business</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, etc. </i>This precept is given to us, not only because a Christian
        life ought to be an active life; but because it often becomes us to
        overlook our own benefit, and to spend our labors in behalf of our
        brethren. In a word, we ought in many things to forget ourselves; for
        except we be in earnest, and diligently strive to shake off all sloth,
        we shall never be rightly prepared for the service of Christ. </font

      ><font
        ><i> </i>he shows how we are to attain the former; for our flesh, like
        the ass, is always torpid, and has therefore need of goals; and it is
        only the fervency of the Spirit that can correct our slothfulness. Hence
        diligence in doing good requires that zeal which the Spirit of God
        kindles in our hearts. Why then, some one may say, does Paul exhort us
        to cultivate this fervency? To this I answer, &#8212; that though it
        be<i> </i>the gift of God, it is yet a duty enjoined the faithful to
        shake off sloth, and to cherish the flame kindled by heaven, as it for
        the most part happens, that the Spirit is suppressed and extinguished
        through our fault.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >To the same purpose is the third particular,

        opportunity of doing good soon passes away; it hence<i> </i>becomes us
        to show more alacrity in the performance of our duty. So Paul bids us in
        another place to redeem the time, because<i> </i>the days are evil. The
        meaning may also be, that we ought to know how to accommodate ourselves
        to the time, which is a matter of great importance. But Paul seems to me
        to set in opposition to idleness what he commands as to the serving of
        time. But as </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kuri&gt;w|</font
      ><font
        ><i>, the Lord, </i>is read in many old copies, though it may seem at
        first sight foreign to this passage, I yet dare not wholly to reject
        this reading. And if it be approved, Paul, I have no doubt, meant to
        refer the duties to be performed towards brethren, and whatever served
        to cherish love, to a service done to God, that he might add greater
        encouragement to the faithful. </font

        ><i> etc.</i> Three things are here connected together, and seem in a
        manner to belong to the clause &#8220;serving<i> </i>the time;&#8221;<i
        > </i>for the person who accommodates himself best to the time, and
        avails himself of the opportunity of actively renewing his course, is he
        who derives his joy from the hope of future life, and patiently bears
        tribulations. However this may be, (for it matters not much whether you
        regard them as connected or separated,) he first; forbids us to
        acquiesce in present blessings, and to ground our joy on earth and on
        earthly things, as though our happiness were based on them; and he bids
        us to raise our minds up to heaven, that we may possess solid and full
        joy. If our joy is derived from the hope of future life, then patience
        will grow up in adversities; for no kind of sorrow will be able to
        overwhelm this joy. Hence these two things are closely connected
        together, that is, joy derived from hope, and patience in adversities.
        No man will indeed calmly and quietly submit to bear the cross, but he
        who has learnt to seek his happiness beyond this world, so as to
        mitigate and allay the bitterness of the cross with the consolation of
        hope.</font

        in prayer, and continually call on God, that he may not suffer our
        hearts to faint and to be pressed down, or to be broken by adverse
        events. But Paul not only stimulates us to prayer, but expressly
        requires perseverance; for we have a continual warfare, and new
        conflicts daily arise, to sustain which, even the strongest are not
        equal, unless they frequently gather new rigor. That we may not then be
        wearied, the best remedy is diligence in prayer.</font

        but to wish and to pray God to render all things prosperous to them, how
        much soever they may harass and cruelly treat us: and this kindness, the
        more difficult it is to be practiced, so with the more intense desire we
        ought to strive for it; for the Lord commands nothing, with respect to
        which he does not require our obedience; nor is any excuse to be
        allowed, if we are destitute of that disposition, by which the Lord
        would have his people to differ from the ungodly and the children of
        this world.</font

        And though you can hardly find one who has made such advances in the law
        of the Lord that he fulfills this precept, yet no one can claim to be
        the child of God or glory in the name of a Christian, who has not in

        so pacified that they wish no evil, there is yet hardly one in a hundred
        who wishes well to him from whom he has received an injury; nay, most
        men daringly burst forth into imprecations. But God by his word not only
        restrains our hands from doing evil, but also subdues the bitter
        feelings within; and not only so, but he would have us to be solicitous

        to bless; for he did not perceive that it stands opposed to curses and
        maledictions: for Paul would have God in both instances to be a witness
        of our patience, and to see that we not only bridle in our prayers the
        violence of our wrath, but also show by praying for pardon that we
        grieve at the lot of our enemies when they willfully ruin

        that the faithful, regarding each other with mutual affection, are to
        consider the condition of others as their own. He first specifies two
        particular things, &#8212; That they were to &#8220;rejoice<i> </i>with
        the joyful, and to weep with the weeping.&#8221; For such is the nature
        of true love, that one prefers to weep with his brother, rather than to
        look at a distance on his grief, and to live in pleasure or ease. What
        is meant then is, &#8212; that we, as much as possible, ought to
        sympathize with one another, and that, whatever our lot may be, each
        should transfer to himself the feeling of another, whether of grief in
        adversity, or of joy in prosperity. And, doubtless, not to regard with
        joy the happiness of a brother is envy; and not to grieve for his
        misfortunes is inhumanity. Let there be such a sympathy among us as may
        at the same time adapt us to all kinds of feelings.</font

        the Lord, and not by pride and contempt of the brethren. A precept is
        fitly added to the preceding; for nothing tends more to break that unity
        which has been mentioned, than when we elevate ourselves, and aspire to
        something higher, so that we may rise to a higher situation. I take the

        except that revenge is more than the kind of repaying of which he speaks
        here; for we render evil for evil sometimes, even when we exact not the
        requiting of an injury, as when we treat unkindly those who do us no
        good. We are indeed wont to form an estimate of the deserts of each, or
        of what they merit at our hands, so that we may confer our benefits on
        those, by whom we have been already obliged, or from whom we expect
        something: and again, when any one denies help to us when we need it,
        we, by returning like for like, as they say, do not help him in time of
        need, any more than he assisted us. There are also other instances of
        the same kind, in which evil is rendered for evil, when there is no open
        revenge.</font

        prefer a literal rendering. As every one is more than justly devoted to
        his own advantage, and provident in avoiding losses, Paul seems to
        require a care and an attention of another kind. What is meant is, that
        we ought diligently to labor, that all may be edified by our honest
        dealings. For as purity of conscience is necessary for us before God, so
        uprightness of character before men is not to be neglected: for since it
        is meet that God should be glorified by our good deeds, even so much is
        wanting to his glory, as there is a deficiency of what is praiseworthy
        in us; and not only the glory of God is thus obscured, but he is branded
        with reproach; for whatever sin we commit, the ignorant employ it for
        the purpose of calumniating the gospel.</font

      <font>But when we are bidden to prepare good things before men, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f393</font></sup
      ><font>
        we must at the same time notice for what purpose: it is not indeed that
        men may admire and praise us, as this is a desire which Christ carefully
        forbids us to indulge, since he bids us to admit God alone as the
        witness of our good deeds, to the exclusion of all men; but that their
        minds being elevated to God, they may give praise to him, that by our
        example they may be stirred up to the practice of righteousness, that
        they may, in a word, perceive the good and the sweet odor of our life,
        by which they may be allured to the love of God. But if we are evil
        spoken of for the name of Christ, we are by no means to neglect to
        provide good things before men: for fulfilled then shall be that saying,
        that we are counted as false, and are yet true. (</font

        beloved by all, is no common gift in a Christian. If we desire to attain
        this, we must not only be endued with perfect uprightness, but also with
        very courteous and kind manners, which may not only conciliate the just
        and the good, but produce also a favorable impression on the hearts of
        the ungodly.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But here two cautions must be stated: We are not to seek to be in such
        esteem as to refuse to undergo the hatred of any for Christ, whenever it
        may be necessary. And indeed we see that there are some who, though they
        render themselves amicable to all by the sweetness of their manners and
        peaceableness of their minds, are yet hated even by their nearest
        connections on account of the gospel. The second caution is, &#8212;
        that courteousness should not degenerate into compliance, so as to lead
        us to flatter the vices of men for the sake of preserving peace. Since
        then it cannot always be, that we can have peace with all men, he has
        annexed two particulars by way of exception, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>If it be possible</i></font
      ><font><i>, </i>and, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>as far as you can.</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>But we are to conclude from what piety and love require, that
        we are not to violate peace, except when constrained by either of these
        two things. For we ought, for the sake of cherishing peace, to bear many
        things, to pardon offenses, and kindly to remit the full rigor of the
        law; and yet in such a way, that we may be prepared, whenever necessity
        requires, to fight courageously: for it is impossible that the soldiers
        of Christ should have perpetual peace with the world, whose prince is
        Satan.</font

        is more grievous than the preceding,<i> </i>which he has just stated;
        and yet both of them arise from the same fountain, even from an
        inordinate love of self and innate pride, which makes us very indulgent
        to our own faults and inexorable to those of others. As then this
        disease begets almost in all men a furious passion for revenge, whenever
        they are in the least degree touched, he commands here, that however
        grievously we may be injured, we are not to seek revenge, but to commit
        it to the Lord. And inasmuch as they do not easily admit the bridle, who
        are once seized with this wild passion, he lays, as it were, his hand

        to commit to the Lord the right of judging, which they take away from
        him who attempt revenge. Hence, as it is not lawful to usurp the office
        of God, it is not lawful to revenge; for we thus anticipate the judgment
        of God, who will have this office reserved for himself. He at the same
        time intimates, that they shall have God as their defender, who
        patiently wait for his help; but that those who anticipate him leave no

        mind and desirous of revenge, seeks the help of a magistrate, has no
        more excuse than when he devises means for self-revenge. Nay, revenge,
        as we shall presently see, is not indeed at all times to be sought from
        God: for if our petitions arise from a private feeling, and not from
        pure zeal produced by the Spirit, we do not make God so much our judge

        enduring, shall not make ourselves more subject or open to the injuries

        are injured, and according to the impulse of our flesh, to ask in our
        prayers that God may become the avenger of our injuries; but he first
        teaches us that it belongs not to us to revenge, except we would assume
        to ourselves the office of God; and secondly, he intimates, that we are

        our kindness from those by whom we have been injured. Understand as

        kindness. Whatsoever then may be thine ability, in whatever business thy
        enemy may want either thy wealth, or thy counsel, or thy efforts, thou
        oughtest to help him. But he calls him our enemy, not whom we regard
        with hatred, but him who entertains enmity towards us. And if they are

        view, that his mind shall be turned to one side or another; for
        doubtless our enemy shall either be softened by our benefits, or if he
        be so savage that nothing can tame him, he shall yet be burnt and

        return good for evil, by that very deed we show the invincible firmness

        which is not only apprehended by the mind, but really perceived, while
        the Lord is giving success to their patience, than which they can wish
        nothing better. On the other hand, he who attempts to overcome evil with
        evil, may perhaps surpass his enemy in doing injury, but it is to his
        own ruin; for by acting thus he carries on war for the devil.</font

        connection with what forms the Christian life, it appears that he was
        constrained to do so by some great necessity which existed especially in
        that age, though the preaching of the gospel at all times renders this
        necessary. There are indeed always some tumultuous spirits who believe
        that the kingdom of Christ cannot be sufficiently elevated, unless all
        earthly powers be abolished, and that they cannot enjoy the liberty
        given by him, except they shake off every yoke of human subjection. This
        error, however, possessed the minds of the Jews above all others; for it
        seemed to them disgraceful that the offspring of Abraham, whose kingdom
        flourished before the Redeemer&#8217;s coming, should now, after his
        appearance, continue in submission to another power. There was also
        another thing which alienated the Jews no less than the Gentiles from
        their rulers, because they all not only hated piety, but also persecuted
        religion with the most hostile feelings. Hence it seemed unreasonable to
        acknowledge them for legitimate princes and rulers, who were attempting
        to take away the kingdom from Christ, the only Lord of heaven and
        earth.</font

        not the supreme, who possess the chief authority, but such as excel
        other men. Magistrates are then thus called with regard to their
        subjects, and not as compared with each other. And it seems indeed to
        me, that the Apostle intended by this word to take away the frivolous
        curiosity of men, who are wont often to inquire by what right they who
        rule have obtained their authority; but it ought to be enough for us,
        that they <i>do rule; </i>for they have not ascended by their own power
        into this high station, but have been placed there by the Lord&#8217;s
        hand. And by mentioning </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>every soul</i></font

        because they are constituted by God&#8217;s ordination. For since it
        pleases God thus to govern the world, he who attempts to invert the
        order of God, and thus to resist God himself, despises his power; since
        to despise the providence of him who is the founder of civil power, is
        to carry on war with him. Understand further, that powers are from God,
        not as pestilence, and famine, and wars, and other visitations for sin,
        are said to be from him; but because he has appointed them for the
        legitimate and just government of the world. For though tyrannies and
        unjust exercise of power, as they are full of disorder, (</font

      ><font
        >)<i> </i>are not an ordained government; yet the right of government is
        ordained by God for the wellbeing of mankind. As it is lawful to repel
        wars and to seek remedies for other evils, hence the Apostle commands us
        willingly and cheerfully to respect and honor the right and authority of
        magistrates, as useful to men: for the punishment which God inflicts on
        men for their sins, we cannot properly call ordinations, but they are
        the means which he designedly appoints for the preservation of
        legitimate order.</font

        punished who resisted authority; but also the vengeance of God, however
        it may at length be executed: for he teaches us in general what end

        the native duty of the magistrate, from which however they who hold
        power often degenerate; yet the obedience due to princes ought to be
        rendered to them. For since a <i>wicked </i>prince is the Lord&#8217;s
        scourge to punish the sins of the people, let us remember, that it

        At the same time, princes do never so far abuse their power, by

        wellbeing of their subjects; in short, they are responsible to God and
        to men in the exercise of their power. For as they are deputed by God
        and do his business, they must give an account to him: and then the

        a remarkable passage for the purpose of proving the right of the sword;

        use of the sword, whenever he visits the guilty with death, by executing

        obedience to magistrates, he now briefly repeats, but with some
        addition, and that is, &#8212; that we ought to obey them, not only on
        the ground of necessity arising from man, but that we thereby obey God;
        for by <i>wrath </i>he means the punishment which the magistrates
        inflict for the contempt of their dignity; as though he had said,
        &#8220;We must not only obey, because we cannot with impunity resist the
        powerful and those armed with authority, as injuries are wont to be
        borne with which cannot be repelled; but we ought to obey willingly, as
        conscience through God&#8217;s word thus binds us.&#8221; Though then
        the magistrate were disarmed, so that we could with impunity provoke and
        despise him, yet such a thing ought to be no more attempted than if we
        were to see punishment suspended over us; for it belongs not to a
        private individual to take away authority from him whom the Lord has in
        power set over us. This whole discourse is concerning civil government;
        it is therefore to no purpose that they who would exercise dominion over
        consciences do hence attempt to establish their sacrilegious
        tyranny.</font

        the reason for which he deduces from the office of magistrates; for if
        it be their duty to defend and safely preserve the peace of the good,
        and to resist the mischievous attempts of the wicked, this they cannot
        do unless they are aided by sufficient force. Tributes then are justly
        paid to support such necessary expenses. </font

        But respecting the proportion of taxes or tributes, this is not the
        place to discuss the subject; nor does it belong to us either to
        prescribe to princes how much they ought to expend in every affair, or
        to call them to an account. It yet behooves them to remember, that
        whatever they receive from the people, is as it were public property,
        and not to be spent in the gratification of private indulgence. For we
        see the use for which Paul appoints these tributes which are to be paid
        &#8212; even that kings may be furnished with means to defend their
        subjects.</font

        particulars in which the duties of subjects towards magistrates consist,
        &#8212; that they are to hold them in esteem and honor, that they are to
        obey their edicts, laws, and judgments, &#8212; that they are to pay
        tributes and customs. By the word </font

        a taunt, as though Paul was answering the objection of those who
        <i>contended </i>that Christians were burdened in having other precepts
        than that of love enjoined them. And indeed I do not deny, but that it
        may be taken ironically, as though he conceded to those who allowed no
        other law but that of love, what they required, but in another sense.
        And <i>yet </i>I prefer to take the words simply as they are; for I
        think that Paul meant to refer the <i>precept </i>respecting the power
        of magistrates to the law of love, lest it should seem to any one too
        feeble; as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;When I require you to obey
        princes, I require nothing more than what all the faithful ought to do,
        as demanded by the law of love: for if ye wish well to the good, (and
        not to wish this is inhuman,) ye ought to strive, that the laws and
        judgments may prevail, that the administrators of the laws may have an
        obedient people, so that through them peace may be secured to
        all.&#8221; He then who introduces anarchy, violates love; for what
        immediately follows anarchy, is the confusion of all things. </font

      <font color="Maroon"><i>For he who loves another</i></font

        law to love, so that we may know that we then rightly obey the
        commandments, when we observe the law of love, and when we refuse to
        undergo no burden in order to keep it. He thus fully confirms what he
        has commanded respecting obedience to magistrates, in which consists no
        small portion of love.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >But some are here impeded, and they cannot well extricate<i
        > </i>themselves from this difficulty, &#8212; that Paul teaches us that
        the law is fulfilled when we love our neighbor, for no mention is here
        made of what is due to God, which ought not by any means to have been
        omitted. But Paul refers not to the whole law, but speaks only of what
        the law requires from us as to our neighbor. And it is doubtless true,
        that the whole law is fulfilled when we love our neighbors; for true
        love towards man does not flow except from the love of God, and it is
        its evidence, and as it were its effects. But Paul records here only the
        precepts of the second table, and of these only he speaks, as though he
        had said, &#8212; &#8220;He who loves his neighbor as himself, performs
        his duty towards the whole world.&#8221; Puerile then is the gloss of
        the Sophists, who attempt to elicit from this passage what may favor
        justification by works: for Paul declares not what men do or do not, but
        he speaks hypothetically of that which you will find nowhere
        accomplished. And when we say, that men are not justified by works, we
        deny not that the keeping of the law is true righteousness: but as no
        one performs it, and never has performed it, we say, that all are
        excluded from it, and that hence the only refuge is in the grace of
        Christ.</font

        ><i>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery,</i></font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>and if there be any other precept</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>. </i>He indeed omits the command respecting the honoring of
        parents; and it may seem strange, that what especially belonged to his
        subject should have been passed by. But what if he had left it out, lest
        he should obscure his argument? Though I dare not to affirm this, yet I
        see here nothing wanting to answer the purpose he had in view, which was
        to show, &#8212; that since God intended nothing else by all his
        commandments than to teach us the duty of love, we ought by all means to
        strive to perform it. And yet the uncontentious reader will readily
        acknowledge, that Paul intended to prove, by things of a like nature,
        that the import of the whole law is, that love towards one another ought
        to be exercised by us, and that what he left to be implied is to be
        understood, and that is, &#8212; that obedience to magistrates is not
        the least thing which tends to nourish peace, to preserve brotherly
        love.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Love doeth no evil to a neighbor,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> He demonstrates by the effect, that under the word love
        are contained those things which are taught us in all the commandments;
        for he who is endued with true love will never entertain the thought of
        injuring others. What else does the whole law forbid, but that we do no
        harm to our neighbor? This, however, ought to be applied to the present
        subject; for since magistrates are the guardians of peace and justice,
        he who desires that his own right should be secured to every one, and
        that all may live free from wrong, ought to defend, as far as he can,
        the power of magistrates. But the enemies of government show a
        disposition to do harm. And when he repeats that the fulfilling of the
        law is love, understand this, as before, of that part of the law which
        refers to mankind; for the first table of the law, which contains what
        we owe to God, is not here referred to at all.</font

        the rays of celestial life had begun to shine on us as it were at the

        in the sight of men, who take diligent care lest they should commit
        anything that is base or unbecoming; for if they do anything amiss, they
        see that they are exposed to the view of many witnesses. But we, who
        always stand in the sight of God and of angels, and whom Christ, the
        true sun of righteousness, invites to his presence, we indeed ought to
        be much more careful to beware of every kind of pollution.</font

        which he wrote, how few were Jews? Then this declaration could not have

        is nigh at hand, ought to stimulate us, so that we may not grow torpid
        on the earth. But afterwards, when he bids us to walk in the light, as
        it were during the day time, he does not continue the same metaphor; for
        he compares to the day our present state, while Christ shines on us. His
        purpose was in various ways to exhort us, &#8212; at one time to
        meditate on our future life; at another, to contemplate the present
        favor of God.</font

        given two names, &#8212; intemperante and excess in living, &#8212;
        carnal lust and uncleanness, which is connected with it, &#8212; and
        envy and contention. If these have in them so much filthiness, that even
        carnal men are ashamed to commit them before the eyes of men, it
        behooves us, who are in the light of God, at all times to abstain from
        them; yea, even when we are withdrawn from the presence of men. As to
        the third vice, though contention is put before envying, there is yet.
        no doubt but that Paul intended to remind us, that strifes and contests
        arise from this fountain; for when any one seeks to excel, there is
        envying of one another; but ambition is the source of both evils. </font

        to what tends to adorn or to deform man; both of which may be seen in
        his clothing: for a filthy and torn garment dis-honors a man; but what
        is becoming and clean recommends him. Now to <i>put on </i>Christ, means
        here to be on every side fortified by the power of his Spirit, and be
        thereby prepared to discharge all the duties of holiness; for thus is
        the image of God renewed in us, which is the only true ornament of the
        soul. For Paul had in view the end of our calling; inasmuch as God, by
        adopting us, unites us to the body of his only-begotten Son, and for
        this purpose, &#8212; that we, renouncing our former life, may

        pilgrimage, and not that they may make us to forget our country. Even
        heathens have said, that a few things suffice nature, but that the
        appetites of men are insatiable. Every one then who wishes to satisfy

        necessary for the instruction of the Church, &#8212; that they who have
        made the most progress in Christian doctrine should accommodate
        themselves to the more ignorant, and employ their own strength to
        sustain their weakness; for among the people of God there are some
        weaker than others, and who, except they are treated with great
        tenderness and kindness, will be discouraged, and become at length
        alienated from religion. And it is very probable that this happened
        especially at that time; for the Churches were formed of both Jews and
        Gentiles; some of whom, having been long accustomed to the rites of the
        Mosaic law, having been brought up in them from childhood, were not
        easily drawn away from them; and there were others who, having never
        learnt such things, refused a yoke to which they had not been
        accustomed. </font

        opinion to quarrels and contentions, the Apostle shows how they who thus
        vary in their opinions may live together without any discord; and he
        prescribes this as the best mode, &#8212; that they who are strong
        should spend their labor in assisting the weak, and that they who have
        made the greatest advances should bear with the more ignorant. For God,
        by making us stronger than others, does not bestow strength that we may
        oppress the weak; nor is it the part of Christian wisdom to be above
        measure insolent, and to despise others. The import then of what he
        addresses to the more intelligent and the already confirmed, is this,
        &#8212; that the ampler the grace which they had received from the Lord,
        the more bound they were to help their neighbors.</font

        This is a defective sentence, as the word which is necessary to complete
        the sense is wanting. It appears, however, evident, that he meant
        nothing else than that the weak should not be wearied with fruitless
        disputes. But we must remember the subject he now handles: for as many
        of the Jews still clave to the shadows of the law, he indeed admits,
        that this was a fault in them; he yet requires that they should be for a
        time excused; for to press the matter urgently on them might have shaken
        their faith. </font

        may be disquieted and disturbed. We ought then to consider what

        He then calls those believers who were endued with a conscience fully
        satisfied; to these he allowed the use of all things without any
        difference. In the mean time the weak did eat herbs, and abstained from
        those things, the use of which he thought was not lawful. If the common
        version be more approved, the meaning then will be, &#8212; that it is
        not right that he who freely eats all things, as he believes them to be
        lawful, should require those, who are yet tender and weak in faith, to
        walk by the same rule. But to render the word <i>sick, </i>as some have

        They who were strong had this fault, &#8212; that they despised those as
        superstitious who were scrupulous about insignificant things, and also
        derided them: these, on the other hand, were hardly able to refrain from
        rash judgments, so as not to condemn what they did not follow; for
        whatever they perceived to be contrary to their own sentiments, they
        thought was evil. Hence he exhorts the former to refrain from contempt,
        and the latter from excessive moroseness. And the reason which he adds,
        as it belongs to both parties, ought to be applied to the two clauses,
        &#8212; &#8220;When you see,&#8221; he says, &#8220;a man illuminated
        with the knowledge of God, you have evidence enough that he is received

        to him what to do and what not to do, nor is it necessary for him to

        God; but as to his deeds we may indeed form a decisive opinion, though
        not according to our own views, but according to the word of God; and
        the judgment, derived from his word, is neither human, nor another
        man&#8217;s judgment. Paul then intended here to restrain us from
        presumption in judging; into which they fall, who dare to pronounce

        he now adds another example of difference, that is, as to days; and both
        these arose from Judaism. For as the Lord in his law made a difference
        between meats and pronounced some to be unclean, the use of which he
        prohibited, and as he had also appointed festal and solemn days and
        commanded them to be observed, the Jews, who had been brought up from
        their childhood in the doctrine of the law, would not lay aside that
        reverence for days which they had entertained from the beginning, and to
        which through life they had been accustomed; nor could they have dared
        to touch these meats from which they had so long abstained. That they
        were imbued with these notions, was an evidence of their weakness; they
        would have thought otherwise, had they possessed a certain and a clear
        knowledge of Christian liberty. But in abstaining from what they thought
        to be unlawful, they evidenced piety, as it would have been a proof of
        presumption and contempt, had they done anything contrary to the
        dictates of conscience.</font

        And this ought to be thoroughly borne in mind, that it is the first
        principle of a right conduct, that men should be dependent on the will
        of God, and never allow themselves to move even a finger, while the mind
        is doubtful and vacillating; for it cannot be otherwise, but that
        rashness will soon pass over into obstinacy when we dare to proceed
        further than what we are persuaded is lawful for us. If any object and
        say, that infirmity is ever perplexing, and that hence such certainty as
        Paul requires cannot exist in the weak: to this the plain answer is,
        &#8212; That such are to be pardoned, if they keep themselves within
        their own limits. For Paul&#8217;s purpose was none other than to
        restrain undue liberty, by which it happens, that many thrust
        themselves, as it were, at random, into matters which are doubtful and
        undetermined. Hence Paul requires this to be adopted, &#8212; that the
        will of God is to preside over all our actions.</font
      ><br /><font><b>6.</b><i> </i></font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>He who regards a day,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> Since Paul well knew that a respect for days proceeded
        from ignorance of Christ, it is not probable that such a corruption was
        altogether defended by him; and yet his words seem to imply, that he who
        regarded days committed no sin; for nothing but good can be accepted by
        God. Hence,<i> </i>that you may understand his purpose, it is necessary
        to distinguish between the notion, which any one may have entertained as
        to the observance of days, and the observance itself to which he felt
        himself bound. The notion was indeed superstitious, nor does Paul deny
        this; for he has already condemned it by calling it infirmity, and he
        will again condemn it still more plainly. Now, that he who was held fast
        by this superstition, dared not to violate the solemnity of a particular
        day; this was approved by God, because he dared not to do any thing with
        a doubtful conscience. What indeed could the Jew do, who had not yet
        made such progress, as to be delivered from scruples about days? He had
        the word of God, in which the keeping of days was commended; there was a
        necessity laid on him by the law; and its abrogation was not clearly
        seen by him. Nothing then remained, but that he, waiting for a fuller
        revelation, should keep himself within the limits of his own knowledge,
        and not to avail himself of the benefit of liberty, before he embraced
        it by faith. </font

      <font
        >The same also must be thought of him who refrained from unclean meats:
        for if he ate in a doubtful state of mind, it would not have been to
        receive any benefit, from God&#8217;s hand, but to lay his own hand on
        forbidden things. Let him then use other things, which he thinks is
        allowed to him, and follow the measure of his knowledge: he will thus
        give thanks to God; which he could not do, except he was persuaded that
        he is fed by God&#8217;s kindness. He is not then to be despised, as
        though he offended the Lord by this his temperance and pious timidity:
        and there is nothing unreasonable in the matter, if we say, that the
        modesty of the weak is approved by God, not on the ground of merit, but
        through indulgence.</font

    <div>
      <font
        >But as he had before required an assurance of mind, so that no one
        ought rashly of his own will to do this or that, we ought to consider

        better flow in this strain, &#8212; &#8220;Let a reason for what he does
        be dear to every one; as an account must be given before the celestial
        tribunal; for whether one eats meat or abstains, he ought in both
        instances to have regard to God.&#8221; And doubtless there is nothing
        more fitted to restrain licentiousness in judging and to correct
        superstitions, than to be summoned before the tribunal of God: and hence
        Paul wisely sets the judge before all, to whose will they are to refer
        whatever they do. It is no objection that the sentence is affirmative;
        for he immediately subjoins, that no one lives or dies for himself;
        where he declares, not what men do, but commands what they ought to
        do.</font

        but also to die; that is, our death as well as our life is to be
        referred to his will. He adds the best of reasons, for </font

        borne by every one as a yoke laid on him; for it is but just that he
        should assign to every one his station and his course of life. And thus
        we are not only forbidden rashly to attempt this or that without
        God&#8217;s command, but we are also commanded to be patient under all
        troubles and losses. If at any time the flesh draws back in adversities,
        let it come to our minds, that he who is not free nor has authority over
        himself, perverts right and order if he depends not on the will of his
        lord. Thus also is taught us the rule by which we are to live and to
        die, so that if he extends our life in continual sorrows and miseries,
        we are not yet to seek to depart before our time; but if he should
        suddenly call us hence in the flower of our age, we ought ever to be
        ready for our departure.</font

        mentioned; for in order to prove that we ought to live and to die to the
        Lord, he had said, that whether we live or die we are under the power of
        Christ. He now shows how rightly Christ claims this power over us, since
        he has obtained it by so great a price; for by undergoing death for our
        salvation, he has acquired authority over us which cannot be destroyed
        by death, and by rising again, he has received our whole life as his
        peculiar property. He has then by his death and resurrection deserved
        that we should, in death as well as in life, advance the glory of his
        name. The words </font

        Christ, he now proceeds to mention the authority to judge, which the
        Father has conferred on him, together with the dominion over heaven and
        earth. He hence concludes, that it is an unreasonable boldness in any
        one to assume the power to judge his brother, since by taking such a
        liberty he robs Christ the Lord of the power which he alone has received
        from the Father.</font

      <font>But first, by the term </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>brother</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>he checks this lust for judging; for since the Lord has
        established among us the right of a fraternal alliance, an equality
        ought to be preserved; every one then who assumes the character of a
        judge acts unreasonably. Secondly, he calls us before the only true
        judge, from whom no one can take away his power, and whose tribunal none
        can escape. As then it would be absurd among men for a criminal, who
        ought to occupy a humble place in the court, to ascend the tribunal of
        the judge; so it is absurd for a Christian to take to himself the
        liberty of judging the conscience of his brother. A similar argument is
        mentioned by James, when he says, that &#8220;he<i> </i>who judges his
        brother, judges the law,&#8221; and that &#8220;he<i> </i>who judges the
        law, is not an observer of the law but a president ;&#8221; and, on the
        other hand, he says, that &#8220;there is but one lawgiver, who can save
        and destroy.&#8221; (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590412&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >James 4:12.) He has ascribed <i>tribunal </i>to Christ, which means his
        power to judge, as the voice of the archangel, by which we shall be
        summoned, is called, in another place, a trumpet; for it will pierce, as
        it were with its sound, into the minds and ears of all. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f419</font></sup
      ><br /><font><b>11.</b> </font><font color="Maroon"><i>As I live</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, etc.</i> He seems to me to have quoted this testimony of the
        Prophet, not so much to prove what he had said of the judgment-seat of
        Christ, which was not doubted among Christians, as to show that judgment
        ought to be looked for by all with the greatest humility and lowliness
        of mind; and this is what the words import. He had first then testified
        by his own words, that the power to judge all men is vested in Christ
        alone; he now demonstrates by the words of the Prophet, that all flesh
        ought to be humbled while expecting that judgment; and this is expressed
        by the bending of the knee. But though in this passage of the Prophet
        the Lord in general foreshows that his glory should be known among all
        nations, and that his majesty should everywhere shine forth, which was
        then hid among very<sub> </sub>few, and as it were in an obscure corner
        of the world; yet if we examine it more closely, it will be evident that
        its complete fulfillment is not now taking place, nor has it ever taken
        place, nor is it to be hoped for in future ages. God does not now rule
        otherwise in the world than by his gospel; nor is his majesty otherwise
        rightly honored but when it is adored as known from his word. But the
        word of God has ever had its enemies, who have been perversely resisting
        it, and its despisers, who have ever treated it with ridicule, as though
        it were absurd and fabulous. Even at this day there are many such, and
        ever will be. It hence appears, that this prophecy is indeed begun to be
        fulfilled in this life, but is far from being completed, and will not be
        so until the day of the last resurrection shall shine forth, when
        Christ&#8217;s enemies shall be laid prostrate, that they may become his
        footstool. But this cannot be except the Lord shall ascend his tribunal:
        he has therefore suitably applied this testimony to the judgment-seat of
        Christ.</font

    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >This is also a remarkable passage for the purpose of confirming our
        faith in the eternal divinity of Christ: for it is God who speaks here,
        and the God who has once for all declared, that he will not give his
        glory to another. (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234208&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Isaiah 42:8.) Now if what he claims here to himself alone is
        accomplished in Christ, then doubtless he in Christ manifests himself
        And unquestionably the truth of this prophecy then openly appeared, when
        Christ gathered a people to himself from the whole world, and restored
        them to the worship of his majesty and to the obedience of his gospel.
        To this purpose are the words of Paul, when he says that God gave a name
        to his Christ, at which every knee should bow, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Philippians 2:10:) and it shall then still more fully appear, when he
        shall ascend his tribunal to judge the living and the dead; for all
        judgment in heaven and on earth has been given to him by the
        Father.</font

        for the Lord intended simply to declare, that all men should not only
        acknowledge his majesty, but also make a confession of obedience, both
        by the mouth and by the external gesture of the body, which he has
        designated by the bowing of the knee.</font

        usurp the office of judging, who must ourselves submit to be judged and

        that is, to exercise judgment, so as not to give offense. He indeed
        indirectly reproves those malignant censors, who employ all their
        acuteness in finding out something faulty in the life of their brethren:
        he therefore bids them to exercise wariness themselves; for by their
        neglect they often precipitate, or drive their brethren against some
        stumblingblock or another. </font

        the gospel of Christ as to make no distinction between meats, he first
        shows what must be thought of meats when viewed in themselves; and then
        he subjoins how sin is committed in the use of them. He then declares,
        that no meat is impure to a right and pure conscience, and that there is
        no hindrance to a pure use of meats, except ignorance and infirmity; for
        when any imagines an impurity in them, he is not at liberty to use them.
        But he afterwards adds, that we are not only to regard meats themselves,
        but also the brethren before whom we eat: for we ought not to view the
        use of God&#8217;s bounty with so much indifference as to disregard
        love. His words then have the same meaning as though he had said,
        &#8212; &#8220;I<i> </i>know that all meats are clean, and therefore I
        leave to thee the free use of them; I allow thy conscience to be freed
        from all scruples: in short, I do not simply restrain thee from meats;
        but laying aside all regard for them, I still wish thee not to neglect
        thy neighbor.&#8221;</font

        indiscriminately by the ungodly; and it is opposed to those things which
        had been especially set apart for the use of the faithful people. He
        says that he knew, and was fully convinced, that all meats are pure, in
        order to remove all doubts. He adds</font

      ><font

        He intended, however, at the same time, to set the liberty given by
        Christ in opposition to the bondage of the law, lest they thought that
        they were bound to observe those rites from which Christ had made them
        free. By the exception which he has laid down, we learn that there is
        nothing so pure but what may be contaminated by a corrupt conscience:
        for it is faith alone and godliness which sanctify all things to us. The
        unbelieving, being polluted within, defile all things by their very
        touch. (</font

        ><i>But if through meat thy brother is grieved,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> He now explains how the offending of our brethren may
        vitiate the use of good things. And the first thing is, &#8212; that
        love is violated, when our brother is made to grieve by what is so
        trifling; for it is contrary to love to occasion grief to any one. The
        next thing is, &#8212; that when the weak conscience is wounded, the
        price of Christ&#8217;s blood is wasted; for the most abject brother has
        been redeemed by the blood of Christ: it is then a heinous crime to
        destroy him by gratifying the stomach; and we must be basely given up to
        our own lusts, if we prefer meat, a worthless thing, to Christ. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f424</font></sup
      ><font>
        The third reason is, &#8212; that since the liberty attained for us by
        Christ is a blessing, we ought to take care, lest it should be evil
        spoken of by men and justly blamed, which is the case, when we
        unseasonably use God&#8217;s gifts. These reasons then ought to
        influence us, lest by using our liberty, we thoughtlessly cause
        offenses. </font

        ><i>, etc.</i> He now, on the other hand, teaches us, that we can
        without loss abstain from the use of our liberty, because the kingdom of
        God does not consist in such things. Those things indeed, which are
        necessary either to build up or preserve the kingdom of God, are by no
        means to be neglected, whatever offenses may hence follow: but if for
        love&#8217;s sake it be lawful to abstain from meat, while God&#8217;s
        honor is uninjured, while Christ&#8217;s kingdom suffers no harm, while
        religion is not hindered, then they are not to be borne with, who for
        meat&#8217;s sake disturb the Church. He uses similar arguments in his
        first Epistle to the Corinthians: </font

    <div align="center">

        drink; not for the purpose of enumerating all the things which
        constitute the kingdom of Christ, but of showing, that it consists of
        spiritual things. He has at the same time no doubt included in few words
        a summary of what it is; namely, that we, being well assured, have peace
        with God, and possess real joy of heart through the Holy Spirit dwelling
        in us. But as I have said, these few things he has accommodated to his
        present subject. He indeed who is become partaker of true righteousness,
        enjoys a great and an invaluable good, even a calm joy of conscience;
        and he who has</font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i> peace</i></font

        for however torpid the reprobate may be, or however they may elevate
        themselves, yet the conscience is not rendered calm and joyful, except
        when it feels God to be pacified and propitious to it; and there is no
        solid joy but what proceeds from this peace. And though it was
        necessary, when mention was made of these things, that the Spirit should
        have been declared as the author; yet he meant in this place indirectly
        to oppose the Spirit to external things, that we might know, that the
        things which belong to the kingdom of God continue complete to us
        without the use of meats.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For he who in these things</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, etc.</i> An argument drawn from the effect: for it is impossible,
        but that when any one is acceptable to God and approved by men, the
        kingdom of God fully prevails and flourishes in him: he, who with a
        quiet and peaceful conscience serves Christ in righteousness, renders
        himself approved by men as well as by God. Wherever then there is
        righteousness and peace and spiritual joy, there the kingdom of God is
        complete in all its parts: it does not then consist of material things.
        But he says, that man is acceptable to God, because he obeys his will;
        he testifies that he is approved by men, because they cannot do
        otherwise than bear testimony to that excellency which they see with
        their eyes: not that the ungodly always favor the children of God; nay,
        when there is no cause, they often pour forth against them many
        reproaches, and with forged calumnies defame the innocent, and in a
        word, turn into vices things rightly done, by putting on them a
        malignant construction. But Paul speaks here of honest judgment, blended
        with no moroseness, no hatred, no superstition.</font

        meats, to consider those greater things which ought to have the first
        place in all our actions, and so to have the precedence. We must indeed
        eat, that we may live; we ought to live, that we may serve the Lord; and
        he serves the Lord, who by benevolence and kindness edifies his
        neighbor; for in order to promote these two things, concord and
        edification, all the duties of love ought to be exercised. Lest this
        should be thought of little moment, he repeats the sentence he had
        before announced, &#8212; that corruptible meat is not of such
        consequence that for its sake the Lord&#8217;s building should be
        destroyed. For wherever there is even a spark of godliness, there the
        work of God is to be seen; which they demolish, who by their unfeeling

        another, discretion ought to be exercised, and utility regarded, so that
        we may willingly grant to our brother whatever may be useful to further
        his salvation. So Paul reminds us in another place: &#8220;All
        things,&#8221; he says, &#8220;are<i> </i>lawful to me; but all things
        are not expedient;&#8221; and immediately he adds the reason,

        would be, according to what he had said before, any loss to piety:
        though we eat not anything we please, but abstain from the use of meats
        for the sake of our brethren; yet the kingdom of God continues entire
        and complete.</font

        declaration; and by adding, that it is evil for man to eat with offense,
        he makes an exception; as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Meat is
        indeed good, but to give offense is bad.&#8221; Now meat has been given
        to us, that we may eat it, provided love be observed: he then pollutes
        the use of pure meat, who by it violates love. Hence he concludes, that

        to stumble is less than to fall. He may be said to be weakened whose

        to be satisfied with peace of conscience before God; nor is it needful
        for him to show before men that, he possesses it. It hence follows, that

        then who tear off faith from confession, take away from the sun its own

        the gifts of God; and, secondly, how great an impediment ignorance is;

        examines his own deeds.&#8221; For it happens, that many commit the
        worst of crimes without any scruple of conscience; but this happens,
        because they rashly abandon themselves, with closed eyes, to any course
        to which the blind and violent intemperance of the flesh may lead them;
        for there is much difference between insensibility and a right judgment.
        He then who examines things is happy, provided he is not bitten by an
        accusing conscience, after having honestly considered and weighed
        matters; for this assurance alone can render our works pleasing to God.
        Thus is removed that vain excuse which many allege on the ground of<sup
        > </sup>ignorance; inasmuch as their error is connected with
        insensibility and sloth: for if what they call good intention is
        sufficient, their examination, according to which the Spirit of God<sup

        which vacillates and is uncertain as to what ought to be done; for he
        who is undecided undergoes alternate changes, and in the midst of his
        various deliberations is held suspended by uncertainty. As then the main
        thing in a good work is the persuasion of a mind conscious of being
        right before God, and as it were a calm assurance, nothing is more

        And, oh! that this truth were fixed in the minds of men, that nothing
        ought to be attempted except what the mind feels assured is acceptable
        to God, men would not then make such an uproar, as they often do now,
        nor waver, nor blindly hurry onward wherever their own imagination may
        lead them. For if our way of living is to be confined to this
        moderation, that no one is to touch a morsel of meat with a doubting
        conscience, how much greater caution is to be exercised in the greatest

    <div>
      <font color="Maroon"><i>And whatever is not from faith,</i></font

        ><i> etc.</i> The reason for this condemnation is, that every work,
        however splendid and excellent in appearance, is counted as sin, except
        it be founded on a right conscience; for God regards not the outward
        display, but the inward obedience of the heart, by this alone is an
        estimate made of our works. Besides, how can that be obedience, when any
        one undertakes what he is not persuaded is approved by God? Where then
        such a doubt; exists, the individual is justly charged with
        prevarication; for he proceeds in opposition to the testimony of his,
        own conscience.</font

      <font>The word</font><font color="Maroon"><i> faith</i></font
      ><font

        to speak, for a firm assurance, and not that of any kind, but what is
        derived from the truth of God. Hence doubt or uncertainty vitiates all
        our actions, however specious they may otherwise be. Now, since a pious
        mind can never acquiesce with certainty in anything but the word of God,
        all fictitious modes of worship do in this case vanish away, and
        whatever works there may be which originate in the brains of men; for
        while everything which is not from faith is condemned, rejected is
        whatever is not supported and approved by God&#8217;s word. It is at the
        same time by no means sufficient that what we do is approved by the word
        of God, except the mind, relying on this persuasion, prepares itself
        cheerfully to do its work. Hence the first thing in a right conduct, in

        is also vigorous in our hearts, so that whatever derogates from the

        ourselves. Away then with those whose highest wish is to gain honors
        from them who treat God&#8217;s name with all kinds of reproaches, tread
        Christ under foot, contumeliously rend, and with the sword and the flame
        persecute his gospel. It is not indeed safe to be so much honored by
        those by whom Christ is not only despised but also reproachfully

        though he speaks of the Old Testament, the same thing is also true of
        the writings of the Apostles; for since the Spirit of Christ is
        everywhere like itself, there is no doubt but that he has adapted his
        teaching by the Apostles, as formerly by the Prophets, to the
        edification of his people. Moreover, we find here a most striking
        condemnation of those fanatics who vaunt that the Old Testament is

        he does not include the whole of that benefit which is to be derived
        from God&#8217;s word; but he briefly points out the main end; for the
        Scriptures are especially serviceable for this purpose &#8212; to raise
        up those who are prepared by patience, and strengthened by consolations,
        to the hope of eternal life, and to keep them in the contemplation of

        The word <i>consolation </i>some render exhortation; and of this I do
        not disapprove, only that consolation is more suitable to patience, for
        this arises from it; because then only we are prepared to bear
        adversities with patience, when God blends them with consolation. The
        patience of the faithful is not indeed that hardihood which philosophers
        recommend, but that meekness, by which we willingly submit to God, while
        a taste of his goodness and paternal love renders all things sweet to
        us: this nourishes and sustains hope in us, so that it fails not.</font

        has been before very fitly ascribed to the Scriptures, but in a
        different sense: God alone is doubtless the author of patience and of
        consolation; for he conveys both to our hearts by his Spirit: yet he
        employs his word as the instrument; for he first teaches us what is true

        Spirit what he spoke by the mouth of man. The sum of his prayer is,
        &#8212; that he would bring their minds to real unanimity, and make them

        harmony. There is then no reason for any to boast that he will give
        glory to God after his own manner; for the unity of his servants is so
        much esteemed by God, that he will not have his glory sounded forth
        amidst discords and contentions. This one thought ought to be sufficient

        leaves no difference between the Jews and the Gentiles, except that in
        the first place he was promised to the Jewish nation, and was in a
        manner peculiarly destined for them, before he was revealed to the
        Gentiles. But he shows, that with respect to that which was the seed of
        all contentions, there was no difference between them; for he had
        gathered them both from a miserable dispersion, and brought them, when
        gathered, into the Father&#8217;s kingdom, that they<i> </i>might be one
        flock, in one sheepfold, under one shepherd. It is hence right, he
        declares, that they should continue united together, and not despise one
        another; for Christ despised neither of them. </font

        >He then speaks first of the Jews, and says, that Christ was sent to
        them, in order to accomplish the truth of God by performing the promises
        given to the Fathers: and it was no common honor, that Christ, the Lord
        of heaven and earth, put on flesh, that he might procure salvation for
        them; for the more he humbled himself for their sake, the greater was
        the honor he conferred on them. But this point he evidently assumes as a
        thing indubitable. The more strange it is, that there is such effrontery
        in some fanatical heads, that they hesitate not to regard the promises
        of the Old Testament as temporal, and to confine them to the present
        world. And lest the Gentiles should claim any <i>excellency </i>above
        the Jews, Paul <i>expressly </i>declares, that the salvation which
        Christ has brought, belonged by covenant to the Jews; for by his coming
        he fulfilled what the Father had formerly promised to Abraham, and thus
        he became the minister of that people. It hence follows that the old
        covenant was in reality spiritual, though it was annexed to earthly
        types; for the fulfillment, of which Paul now speaks, must necessarily
        relate to eternal salvation. And further, lest any one should cavil, and
        say, that so great a salvation was promised to posterity, when the
        covenant was deposited in the hand of Abraham, he expressly declares
        that the promises were made to the Fathers. Either then the benefits of
        Christ must be confined to temporal things, or the covenant made with
        Abraham must be extended beyond the things of this world.</font

        <i>etc.</i> This is the second point, on proving which he dwells longer,
        because it was not so evident. The first testimony he quotes is taken
        from Psalm 18; which psalm is recorded also in 2 Samuel 22, where no
        doubt a prophecy is mentioned concerning the kingdom of Christ; and from
        it Paul proves the calling of the Gentiles, because it is there
        promised, that a confession to the glory of God should be made among the
        Gentiles; for we cannot really make God known, except among those who
        hear his praises while they are sung by us. Hence that God&#8217;s name
        may be known among the Gentiles, they must be favored with the knowledge
        of him, and come into communion with his people: for you may observe
        this everywhere in Scripture, that God&#8217;s praises cannot be
        declared, except in the assembly of the faithful, who have ears capable
        of hearing his praise.</font

        song of Moses; but with this I cannot agree; for Moses&#8217; design
        there was to terrify the adversaries of Israel by setting forth his
        greatness, rather than to invite them to a common joy. I hence think

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>with his people</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>and he did this by way of explanation; for the Prophet in that
        psalm no doubt connects the Gentiles with Israel, and invites both alike
        to rejoice; and there is no joy without the knowledge of God. </font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>Praise God, all ye Gentiles</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, etc.</i> This passage is not inaptly applied; for how can they,
        who know not God&#8217;s greatness, praise him? They could no more do
        this than to call on his name, when unknown. It is then a prophecy most
        suitable to prove the calling of the Gentiles; and this appears still
        more evident from the reason which is there added; for he bids them to
        give thanks for God&#8217;s truth and mercy. (</font

      ><font>Psalm 117:1.)</font><br /><font><b>12.</b> </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>And again, Isaiah,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.,</i> This prophecy is the most illustrious of them all: for in
        that passage, the Prophet, when things were almost past hope, comforted
        the small remnant of the faithful, even by this, &#8212; that there
        would arise a shoot from the dry and the dying trunk of David&#8217;s
        family, and that a branch would flourish from his despised root, which
        would restore to God&#8217;s people their pristine glory. It is clear
        from the account there given, that this shoot was Christ, the Redeemer
        of the world. And then, he added, that he would be raised for a sign to
        the Gentiles, that might be to them for salvation. The words do indeed
        differ a little from the Hebrew text; for we read here,
        <i>arise, </i>while in Hebrew it is <i>stand for a sign, </i>which is
        the same; for he was to appear conspicuous like a sign. What is here
        <i>hope, </i>is in Hebrew <i>seek; </i>but according to the most common
        usage of Scripture, to seek God is nothing else but to hope in him. </font

        and he reigns among the faithful alone, &#8212; and by the declaration,
        that they shall hope in Christ, which cannot take place without the
        preaching of the word and illumination of the Spirit. With these things
        corresponds the song of Simeon. It may be further added, that hope in
        Christ is an evidence of his divinity.</font

        in case they thought themselves reproved by so many and so urgent
        admonitions, and thus unjustly treated. He then makes an excuse for
        having ventured to assume towards them the character of a teacher and of
        an exhorter; and he says, that he had done so, not <i>because </i>he had
        any doubt as to their wisdom, or kindness, or perseverance; but because
        he was constrained by his <i>office. </i>Thus he removed every suspicion
        of presumption, which especially shows itself when any one thrusts
        himself into an office which does not belong to him, or speaks of those
        things which are unsuitable to him. We see in this instance the singular
        modesty of this holy man, to whom nothing was more acceptable than to be
        thought of no account, provided the doctrine he preached retained its
        authority.</font

        of another nation, much less a barbarian and a Jew. With this
        haughtiness Paul would not contend in his own private name: he however
        subdued it, as it were, by soothing means; for he testified that he

        gives admonitions: the first is kindness, which disposes his mind to aid
        his brethren by his advice, and also tempers his countenance and his
        words with courtesy, &#8212; and the second is skill in advice or
        prudence, which secures authority to him, inasmuch as he is able to
        benefit the hearers whom he addresses. There is indeed nothing more
        opposed to brotherly admonitions than malignity and arrogance, which
        make us disdainfully to despise the erring, and to treat them with
        ridicule, rather than to set them right. Asperity also, whether it
        appears in words or in the countenance, deprives our admonitions of
        their fruit. But however you may excel in the feeling of kindness, as
        well as in courtesy, you are not yet fit to advise, except you possess
        wisdom and experience. Hence he ascribes both these qualifications to
        the Romans, bearing them a testimony, &#8212; that they were themselves
        sufficiently competent, without the help of another, to administer
        mutual exhortations: for he admits, that they abounded both in kindness
        and wisdom. It hence follows, that they were able to exhort.</font

        more fully show his modesty, he says, by way of concession, that he
        acted boldly in interposing in a matter which they themselves were able
        to do; but he adds that he was led to be thus bold on account of his
        office, because he was the minister of the gospel to the Gentiles, and
        could not therefore pass by them who were also Gentiles. He however thus
        humbles himself, that he might exalt the excellency of his office; for
        by mentioning the favor of God, by which he was elevated to that high
        honor, he shows that he could not suffer what he did according to his
        apostolic office to be despised. Besides, he denies that he had assumed
        the part of a teacher, but that of an admonisher, </font

        the first place adopts, that is, &#8220;Administering;&#8221;<i> </i>for
        nothing is more certain than that Paul here alludes to the holy
        mysteries which were performed by the priest. He then makes himself a
        chief priest or a priest in the ministration of the gospel, to offer up
        as a sacrifice the people whom he gained for God, and in this manner he
        labored in the holy mysteries of the gospel. And doubtless this is the
        priesthood of the Christian pastor, that is, to sacrifice men, as it
        were, to God, by bringing them to obey<i> </i>the gospel, and not, as
        the Papists have hitherto haughtily vaunted, by offering up Christ to
        reconcile men to God. He does not, however, give here the name of
        priests to the pastors of the Church simply as a perpetual title, but
        intending to commend the honor and power of the ministry, Paul availed
        himself of the opportunity of using this metaphor. Let then the
        preachers of the gospel have this end in view while discharging their
        office, even to offer up to God souls purified by faith.</font

        &#8220;sacrificing<i> </i>the gospel,&#8221; is not only improper but

        sword, by which the minister sacrifices men as victims to God. </font

        singular consolation to those who surrender themselves to be thus
        consecrated. Now as the ancient victims were dedicated to God, having
        been externally sanctified and washed, so these victims are consecrated
        to the Lord by the Spirit of holiness, through whose power, inwardly
        working in them, they are separated from this world. For though the
        purity of the soul proceeds from faith in the word, yet as the voice of
        man is in itself inefficacious and lifeless, the work of cleansing
        really and properly belongs to the Spirit.</font

        taken upon him the apostolic office conferred on him by God&#8217;s
        appointment, but that he had also eminently adorned it. He at the same

        office.<i> </i>It is indeed to little purpose that we are appointed,
        except we act agreeably to our calling and fulfill our office. He did
        not make this declaration from a desire to attain glow, but because
        nothing was to be omitted which might procure favor and authority to his
        doctrine among the Romans. In God then, not in himself, did he glory;

        given. Hence the apostleship of Paul was made evident from this
        circumstance, &#8212; that this prophecy was fulfilled in him. </font

        be constantly preached. Paul then was a preacher of Christ, yet unknown

        Jerusalem to bear the alms which had been gathered in Macedonia and
        Achaia. Availing himself at the same time of this opportunity, he
        proceeds to commend that contribution; by which, as by a kind of
        intimation, he stirs them up to follow this example: for though he does
        not openly ask them, yet, by saying that Macedonia and Achaia had done
        what they ought to have done, he intimates, that it was also the duty of
        the Romans, as they were under the same obligation; and that he had this

        considered not the distance at which they were separated from them; but
        esteeming those sufficiently nigh, to whom they were united by the bond
        of faith, they relieved their necessities from their own abundance. The
        word <i>communication, </i>which is here employed, ought to be noticed;
        for it well expresses the feeling, by which it behooves us to succor the
        wants of our brethren, even because there is to be a common and mutual
        regard on account of the unity of the body. I have not rendered the

        What we have rendered <i>to minister, </i>is in Greek a participle,
        <i>ministering; </i>but<i> </i>the former seems more fitted to convey
        the meaning of Paul: for he excuses himself, that by a lawful occupation
        he was prevented from going immediately to Rome.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i> And their debtors they are,</i></font

        ><i> etc.</i> Every one perceives, that what is said here of obligation,
        is said not so much for the sake of the Corinthians as for the Romans
        themselves; for the Corinthians or the Macedonians were not more
        indebted to the Jews than the Romans. And he adds the ground of this
        obligation, &#8212; that they had received the gospel from them: and he
        takes his argument from the comparison of the less with the greater. He
        employs also the same in another place, that is, that it ought not to
        have appeared to them an unjust or a grievous compensation to exchange
        carnal things, which are immensely of less value, for things spiritual.
        (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470911&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >2 Corinthians 9:11.) And it shows the value of the gospel, when he
        declares, that they were indebted not only to its ministers, but also to
        the whole nation, from whom they had come forth.</font

        office in the commonwealth, and to undergo the burden of one&#8217;s
        calling: it is also sometimes applied to sacred things. Nor do I doubt
        but that Paul meant that it is a kind of sacrifice, when the faithful
        gave of their own to relieve the wants of their brethren; for they thus
        perform that duty of love which they owe, and offer to God a sacrifice
        of an acceptable odor. But in this place what he had peculiarly in view
        was the mutual right of compensation.</font

        an allusion to a practice among the ancients, who closed up with their
        seals what they intended to lay up in safety. Thus Paul commends his own
        faithfulness and integrity; as though he had said, that he was an honest
        keeper of the money deposited in his hands, no otherwise than if he
        carried it sealed up. </font

      ><font> &#8212; The word </font><font color="Maroon"><i>fruit</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> </i>seems to designate the produce, which he had before said
        returned to the Jews from the propagation of the gospel, in a way
        similar to the land, which by bringing forth fruit supports its
        cultivator.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>And I know, that when I come,</i></font
      ><font
        ><i> etc.</i> These words may be explained in two ways: he first meaning
        is, &#8212; that he should find a plentiful fruit from the gospel at
        Rome; for the blessing of the gospel is, when it fructifies by good
        works: but to confine this to alms, as some do, is not what I approve.
        The second is, that in order to render his coming to them more an object
        of desire, he says, that he hopes that it would not be unfruitful, but
        that it would make a great accession to the gospel; and this he calls </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>fullness of blessing</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>which signifies a full blessing; by which expression he means
        great success and increase. But this blessing depended partly on his
        ministry and partly on their faith. Hence he promises, that his coming
        to them would not be in vain, as he would not disappoint them of the
        grace given to him, but would bestow it with the same alacrity with
        which their minds were prepared to receive the gospel.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >The former exposition has been most commonly received, and seems also
        to me the best; that is, that he hoped that at his coming he would find
        what he especially wished, even that the gospel flourished among them
        and prevailed with evident success, &#8212; that they were excelling in
        holiness and in all other virtues.<sup> </sup>For the reason he gives
        for his desire is, that he hoped for no common joy in seeing them, as he
        expected to see them abounding in all the spiritual riches of the
        gospel. </font

        prevailed against Paul in his own nation on account of false reports, as
        though he taught a departure from Moses. He knew how much calumnies
        might avail to oppress the innocent, especially among those who are
        carried away by inconsiderate zeal. Added also to this, was the
        testimony of the Spirit, recorded in </font

      ><font
        >Acts 20:23; by which he was forewarned, that bonds and afflictions
        awaited him at Jerusalem. The more danger then he perceived, the more he
        was moved: hence it was, that he was so solicitous to commend his safety
        to the Churches; nor let us wonder, that he was anxious about his life,

        though in so great a fear, he yet continued to proceed; nor did he so
        dread danger, but that he was prepared willingly to meet it. At the same
        time he had recourse to the remedies given him by God; for he solicited
        the aid of the Church, so that being helped by its prayers, he might
        find comfort, according to the Lord&#8217;s promise, &#8212;</font

        oppressed, and by bidding them to assist in this contest, he shows how
        the godly ought to pray for their brethren, that they are to assume
        their person, as though they were placed in the same difficulties; and
        he also intimates the effect which they have; for he who commends his
        brother to the Lord, by taking to himself a part of his distress, do so
        far relieve him. And indeed if our strength is derived from prayer to
        God, we can in no better way confirm our brethren, than by praying to
        God for them.</font

        seasonable. And hence appears his wonderful meekness, for he ceased not
        to labor for those to whom he doubted whether he would be acceptable.
        This disposition of mind we ought to imitate, so that we may not cease
        to do good to those of whose gratitude we are by no means certain. We

        unwelcome. He also knew that, saints may sometimes be led away by false

        To the same purpose is the expression </font

        her office, for she performed a most honorable and a most holy function
        in the Church; and then he adduces another reason why they ought to
        receive her and to show her every kindness, for she had always been a

        intimates that it would be unbecoming the servants of Christ not to show
        her honor and kindness. And since it behooves us to embrace in love all
        the members of Christ, we ought surely to regard and especially to love
        and honor those who perform a public office in the Church. And besides,
        as she had always been full of kindness to all, so he bids that help and
        assistance should now be given to her in all her concerns; for it is
        what courtesy requires, that he who is naturally disposed to kind-ness
        should not be forsaken when in need of aid, and to incline their minds

        >1 Timothy 5:9,<i> </i>for as the poor were supported from the public
        treasury of the Church, so they were taken care of by those in public
        offices, and for this charge widows were chosen, who being free from
        domestic concerns, and cumbered by no children, wished to consecrate
        themselves wholly to God by religious duties, they were therefore
        received into this office as those who had wholly given up themselves,
        and became bound to their charge in a manner like him, who having hired
        out his own labors, ceases to be free and to be his own master. Hence
        the Apostle accuses them of having violated their faith, who renounced
        the office which they had once undertaken, and as it behooved them to
        live in widowhood, he forbade them to be chosen under sixty years of
        age, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540509&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >1 Timothy 5:9,11,) because he foresaw that under that age the vow of
        perpetual celibacy was dangerous, yea, liable to prove ruinous. This
        most sacred function, and very useful to the Church, when the state of
        things had become worse, degenerated into the idle order of Nuns; which,
        though corrupt at its beginning, and contrary to the word of God, has
        yet so fallen away from what it was at its commencement, that there is
        no difference between some of the sanctuaries of chastity and a common
        brothel.</font

        individuals, were partly intended for this end, that by honoring those
        who were faithful and worthy, faithfulness itself might be honored, and
        that they who could and would do more good than others, might have
        authority; and partly that they themselves might study to act in a

        this account more clearly shine forth; for he disdained not to have a
        woman as his associate in the work of the Lord; nor was he ashamed to
        confess this. She was the wife of Aquila, and <i>Luke </i>calls her
        Priscilla. (</font

        preserving the life of Paul, he testifies that he himself was
        individually thankful to them: he however adds, that thanks were given
        them by all the Churches of Christ; and he added this that he might, by
        such an example, influence the Romans. And deservedly dear and precious
        to all the Gentiles was the life of such a man, as it was an
        incomparable treasure: it was therefore no wonder that all the Churches
        of the Gentiles thought themselves to be under obligations to his

        for it is plainly evident, that Paul, by way of honor, had used the

        are sanctified to God by faith, they who first offer themselves are
        fitly called the first-fruit. Whosoever then is called first in time to
        the faith, Paul allows him the prerogative of honor: yet he retains this
        eminence only when the end corresponds with the beginning. And doubtless
        it is no common honor when God chooses some for first-fruits: and there
        is in addition a greater and an ampler trial of faith, through a longer
        space of time, provided they who have first begun are not wearied in

        things belonging to the flesh, yet as the relationship which Junia and
        Andronicus bore to him, might avail somewhat to make them more fully
        known, he neglected not this commendation. There is more weight in the
        second eulogy, when he calls them his </font

      ><font
        ><i>: </i>he uses not this word in its proper and common meaning, but
        extends it wider, even to all those who not only teach in one Church,
        but also spend their labor in promulgating the gospel everywhere. He
        then, in a general way, calls those in this place Apostles, who planted
        Churches by carrying here and there the doctrine of salvation; for
        elsewhere he confines this title to that first order which Christ at the
        beginning established, when he appointed the twelve disciples. It would
        have been otherwise strange, that this dignity should be only ascribed
        to them, and to a few others. But as they had embraced the gospel by
        faith before Paul, he hesitates not to set them on this account before
        himself. </font

        long a catalogue, if he was then at Rome: yet he must have been there,
        if we believe the Romanists. But since in doubtful things nothing is
        better than to follow probable conjecture, no one, who judges

        man notorious for many crimes and vices. The more wonderful was the
        goodness of God, which penetrated into that impure house, abounding in
        all kinds of wickedness; not that Narcissus himself had been converted
        to Christ, but it was a great thing that a house, which was like hell,
        should be visited by the grace of Christ. And as they, who lived under a
        foul pander, the most voracious robber, and the most corrupt of men,
        worshipped Christ in purity, there is no reason that servants should
        wait for their masters, but every one ought to follow Christ for
        himself. Yea, the exception added by Paul shows that the family was
        divided, so that the faithful were only a few.</font

        usual and common symbol of friendship among the Jews; it was perhaps
        less used by the Romans, though not unfrequent, only it was not lawful
        to kiss women, except those only who were relatives. It became however a
        custom among the ancients for Christians to kiss one another before
        partaking of the Supper, to testify by that sign their friendship; and
        then they bestowed their alms, that they might in reality and by the
        effect confirm what they had represented by the kiss: all this appears
        evident from one of the homilies of Chrysostom<i>. </i></font

        Hence has arisen that practice among the Papists at this day, of kissing
        the paten, and of bestowing an offering: the former of which is nothing
        but superstition without any benefit, the other serves no other purpose
        but to satisfy the avariciousness of the priests, if indeed it can be
        satisfied.</font

        ><i>, etc.</i> He now adds an exhortation, by which all Churches have
        often need of being stirred up; for the ministers of Satan are ever
        ready to take occasion to disturb the kingdom of Christ: and they
        attempt to make disturbances in two ways; for they either sow discord,
        by which the minds of men are drawn away from the unity of truth, or
        they occasion offenses, by which men are alienated from the love of the
        gospel. </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">f476</font></sup
      ><font>
        The former evil is done when the truth of God is mixed with new dogmas
        devised by men; and the latter takes place, when by various arts it is
        made odious and contemptible. He therefore bids all, who did either of
        these two things, to be observed, lest they should deceive and catch the
        unwary; and also to be shunned, for they were injurious. Nor was it
        without reason that he required this attention from the faithful; for it
        often happens through our neglect or want of care,<i> </i>that such
        wicked men do great harm to the Church, before they are opposed; and
        they also creep in, with astonishing subtlety, for the purpose of doing
        mischief, except they be carefully watched.</font
      ><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <font
        >But observe, that he speaks of those who had been taught the pure truth
        of God. It is indeed an impious and sacrilegious attempt to divide those
        who agree in the truth of Christ: but yet it is a shameful sophistry to
        defend, under the pretext of peace and unity, a union in lies and
        impious doctrines. There is therefore no ground for the Papists to seek
        countenance from this passage, in order to raise ill-will against us;
        for we do not impugn and tear asunder the gospel of Christ, but the
        falsehoods of the devil, by which it has been hitherto obscured: nay,
        Paul clearly shows, that he did not condemn all kinds of discords, but
        those which destroyed consent in the orthodox faith; for the force of
        the passage is in the words, </font
      ><font color="Maroon"><i>which ye have learnt</i></font
      ><font
        ><i>; </i>for it was the duty of the Romans, before they were rightly
        taught, to depart from the habits of their fathers and the institutions
        of their ancestors.</font

      ><font color="Maroon"><i>For they who are such,</i></font

        to be distinguished from the servants of Christ; for they have no care
        for the glory of Christ, but seek the benefit of their stomach. As,
        however, they deceitfully crept in, and by assuming another character,
        concealed<i> </i>their own wickedness,<i> </i>he at the same time
        pointed out, in order that no one might be deceived, the arts which they
        adopted &#8212; that they ingratiated themselves by a bland address. The
        preachers of the gospel have also their courtesy and their pleasing
        manner, but joined with honesty, so that they neither soothe men with
        vain praises, nor flatter their vices: but impostors allure men by
        flattery, and spare and indulge their vices, that they may keep them
        attached to themselves. He calls those <i>simple </i>who are not
        cautious enough to avoid deceptions.</font

        <i>etc.</i> This is said to anticipate an objection; for he shows that
        he did not warn them, as though he thought unfavorably of them, but
        because a fall in their case was such as might have easily happened; as
        if he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Your obedience is indeed commended
        everywhere, and for this reason I rejoice on your account: yet since it
        often happens, that a fall occurs through simplicity, I would have you
        to be harmless and simple as to the doing of evil; but in doing good, to
        be most prudent, whenever it may be necessary, so that you may preserve
        your integrity.&#8221;</font

      <font

        so that they have no reason to claim this distinction, who at this day
        count as a high virtue their stupid ignorance of the word of God. For
        though he approves in the Romans, that they were obedient and teachable,
        yet he would have them to exercise wisdom and judgment, lest their
        readiness to believe exposed them to impositions. So then he
        congratulates them, because they were free from a wicked disposition; he
        yet wished them to be wise, so as to exercise caution. </font

        indeed exhorts them to fight manfully against Satan, and promises that
        they should shortly be victorious. He was indeed once conquered by
        Christ, but not in such a way but that he renews the war continually. He
        then promises ultimate defeat, which does not appear in the midst of the
        contest. At the same time he does not speak only of the last day, when
        Satan shall be completely bruised; but as Satan was then confounding all
        things, raging, as it were, with loose or broken reins, he promises that
        the Lord would shortly subdue him, and cause him to be trodden, as it
        were, under foot. Immediately a prayer follows, &#8212; that the grace
        of Christ would be with them, that is, that they might enjoy all the
        blessings which had been procured for them by Christ.</font

        this to recommend it, &#8212; that it serves to raise up and strengthen
        the confidence of the godly, so that with hearts lifted up to God they

        having spoken of the secret counsel of God, seems to have designedly
        annexed this eulogy, in order that he might draw all men to reverence

        endure for ever; for God declares in it that he is our Father, not only
        at present,<i> </i>but that he will be so to the end: nay, his adoption
        extends beyond death, for it will conduct us to an eternal
        inheritance.</font

        attentive to hear it, but also to impress on our minds the highest
        veneration for it: and he intimates how sublime a secret it is, by
        adding that it was hid for many ages, from the beginning of the world. </font

        much higher than all human learning; and since the very angels regard
        them with wonder, surely none of us can sufficiently admire them. But
        this wisdom ought not to be less esteemed, because it is conveyed in an
        humble, plain, and simple style; for thus it has pleased the Lord to
        bring down the arrogance of the flesh.</font

        has not happened through the hasty doings of men, or through chance, but
        through the eternal ordination of God. Here, also, he doses up the door
        against all those curious questions which the waywardness of the human
        mind is wont to raise; for whatever happens suddenly and unexpectedly,
        they think, happens at random; and hence they absurdly conclude, that
        the works of God are unreasonable; or at least they entangle themselves
        in many perplexing doubts. Paul therefore reminds us, that what appeared
        then suddenly had been decreed by God before the foundation of the
        world.</font

        been foretold; for all the Prophets have rendered to the gospel so clear
        a testimony, that it can in no other way be so fully confirmed. And God
        thus duly prepared the minds of his people, lest the novelty of what
        they were not accustomed to should too much astonish them. </font

        solution of this knot is plainly given by Peter,&#8212;that the
        Prophets, when they sedulously inquired of the salvation made known to
        us, ministered, not to themselves, but to us. (</font

        to the calling of the Gentiles, to which Paul himself expressly refers
        in his Epistle to the Colossians. [Now, though I allow this to be one
        reason, I yet cannot be brought to believe that it is the only reason.
        It seems to me more probable that Paul had also a regard to some other
        differences between the Old and the [New Testament. For though the
        Prophets formerly taught all those things which have been explained by
        Christ and his Apostles, yet they taught them with so much obscurity,
        that in comparison with the clear brightness of gospel light, it is no
        wonder that those things are said to have been hidden which are now made
        manifest. [Nor was it indeed to no purpose that Malachi declared that
        the Sun of righteousness would arise, (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Malachi 4:2 ;) or that Isaiah had beforehand so highly eulogized the
        embassy of the Messiah. And lastly, it is not without reason that the
        gospel is called the kingdom of God: but we may&#8217; conclude from the
        event itself, that then only were opened the treasures of celestial
        wisdom, when God appeared to his ancient people through his
        only-begotten Son, as it were face to face, all shadows having been done
        away. He again refers to the end, mentioned at the beginning of the
        first chapter, for which the gospel is to be preached,&#8212;that God
        may lead all nations to the obedience of faith.</font

        &#8220;The writers of the New Testament, or rather (with reverence be it
        Spoken!) the Holy Spirit, whose penmen they were, wisely chose, in
        expressing evangelical notions, to employ such <i>Greek</i> terms as had
        been long before used for the same purposes by the
        <i>Greek</i> Translators of the Near Testament: and thus the
        <i>Septuagint</i> version, however <i>imperfect</i> and <i>faulty</i> in
        many particulars, became in this respect, not to the first age of the
        Church only, but also to all succeeding generations, the connecting link
        between the languages of the Old and New Testament, and will be regarded

        The inconsistencies of what the retailers of this tradition say, are
        quite palpable. Iren&#339;us affirms, that &#8220;the Church at Rome was
        founded and constituted (fundata et constituta) by the two Apostles,
        Peter and Paul.&#8221; Epiphanius says, that they were the first
        &#8220;<i>Bishops</i>&#8221; at Rome, as well as Apostles, while
        Iren&#339;us declares, that they both &#8220;delivered the episcopal
        office into the hands of Linus ;&#8221; and it is said in what are
        called the Apostolic Constitutions, that &#8220;Linus was ordained
        bishop by Paul, and Clement after the death of Linus by Peter.&#8221;

        But this cannot be admitted, as the same informant, Tradition, tells us
        , that Peter and Paul suffered martyrdom at the same time. The only
        thing which Peter appears to have had to do in forming and founding a
        church at Rome, was to have been the instrument in the conversion, at
        the day of Pentecost, of those who in all probability were the first who
        introduced the gospel into Rome: and it is probable that it was this
        circumstance which occasioned the tradition, that he bad been the
        founder of that church. Less occasion has often produced tales of this

        Let it not be supposed, that by discrediting <i>some</i> things, we
        discredit every thing said by the Fathers. They ought to be treated as
        all other historians. What we find on examination to be unfounded, ought
        to be so viewed: and what we have every reason to believe to be true,
        ought to be so received. Even such a man as Dr. Lardner seemed unwilling
        to reject this tale, from fear of lessening the credit of history;
        evidently mistaking the ground on which history has a title to credit.
        The many authorities adduced respecting Peter being at Rome may be
        reduced almost to two &#8212; Iren&#339;us and Tertullian. They were the
        first to stamp as it were a kind of authority on this report, and also
        on others to which no credit is given even by those who would have the
        Fathers to have been almost infallible.</font

        The account given of Gryn&aelig;us by Watkins in his Biographical
        Dictionary, taken from Moreri, is the following: &#8212; &#8220; A
        learned German, born at Veringen, in Hohenzollern, in 1493. He studied
        at Vienna, after which he became Rector of the school at Baden, but was
        thrown into prison for espousing the Lutheran doctrines. However, he
        recovered his liberty, and went to Heidelberg, afterwards to Basil, and,
        in 1531, he visited England. 1536 he returned to Basil, and died there
        in 1540.&#8221; It is somewhat singular, that in the same year, 1540,
        another learned man of the same name, John James Gryn&aelig;us, was born
        at Berne, and was educated at Basil, and became distinguished for his

        There were at least two other Reformers who had written on the Epistle
        to the Romans: but whether they were published at this time the writer
        is not able to say. There is by Luther an Introduction to it, which has
        been much praised, and has attained the name of the golden preface.
        Peter Martyr wrote a large comment on this Epistle, which was translated
        into English early in Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s reign, in the year 1568.
        It is rather remarkable that there was no <i>commenter </i>among our
        English Reformers, while on the Continent there were a great many

        adopted here, would amount to the same thing, that is, that Christ was
        visibly determined or constituted the Son of God through the
        resurrection, or by that event. It was that which fixed, settled,
        determined, and manifestly exhibited him as the Son of God, clothed and
        adorned with his own power. Professor Stuart has conjured a number of
        difficulties in connection with this verse, for which there seems to be
        no solid reason. The phrase, <i>the Son of God</i>, is so well known
        from the usage of Scripture, that there is no difficulty connected with
        it: the full phrase is the <i>only-begotten Son</i>. To say that
        Christ&#8217;s resurrection was no evidence of his divine nature, as
        Lazarus and others had been raised from the dead, appears indeed very
        strange. Did Lazarus rise through his own power? Did Lazarus rise again
        for our justification? Was his resurrection an attestation of any thing
        he had previously declared? The Revelation A. Barnes very justly says,
        that the <i>circumstances</i> connected with Christ were those which
        rendered his resurrection a proof of his divinity.</font
      ><br /><font
        >Professor Hodge gives what he conceives to be the import of the two
        verses in these words, &#8220;Jesus Christ was, as to his human nature,
        the Son of David; but he was clearly demonstrated to be, as to his
        divine nature, the Son of God, by the resurrection from the dead.&#8221;
        This view is taken by many, such as Pareus, Beza, Turrettin, etc. But
        the words, &#8220;according to the Spirit of Holiness&#8221; &#8212; </font

        >kata&lt; pneu~ma aJgiwsu&gt;nhv</font
      ><font
        >, are taken differently by others, as meaning the Holy Spirit. As the
        phrase is nowhere else found, it may be taken in either sense. That the
        divine nature of Christ is called Spirit, is evident. See </font

        and with power. The thing was demonstrated by an evidence, the
        exhibition of which required a putting forth of power, which Paul in
        another place represents as a very great and strenuous exertion,
        &#8216;According to the working of his mighty power when he raised him
        from the dead.&#8217; &#8212; <i>The Spirit of Holiness</i>, or the Holy
        Spirit. It was through the operation of the Holy Spirit that the divine
        nature was infused into the human at the birth of Jesus Christ; and the
        very same agent, it is remarkable, was employed in the work of the
        resurrection. &#8216;Put to death in the flesh,&#8217; says Peter, 4 and
        &#8216;quickened by the Spirit.&#8217; We have only to do with the facts
        of the case. He was demonstrated to be the Son of God by the power of
        the Holy Spirit having been put forth in raising him from the

        the faith among all nations for the sake of his name.&#8221; But it is
        better to connect the words with the receiving of the apostleship: it
        was received for two purposes &#8212; that there might be the obedience

        The order of the words, as arranged by Calvin, is better than that of

        <i>to instruct</i>, <i>to console</i>, etc. Which of these senses is to
        be preferred here, it is not easy to decide. Most probably the Apostle
        intended to use the word in a wide sense, as expressing the idea, that
        he might be excited, encouraged, and comforted by his intercourse with
        his Christian brethren.&#8221; &#8212; The two verses may be thus

        <i>On the power of God</i>, Pareus observes, that the abstract, after

        instrument of God&#8217;s power; that is, the gospel is an instrument
        rendered efficacious by divine power to convey salvation to believers:
        or, as Stuart says, &#8220;It is powerful through the energy which he
        imparts, and so it is called his power.&#8221; Chalmers gives this
        paraphrase, &#8220;It is that, which however judged and despised as a
        weak instrument by the men of this world &#8212; it is that, to which
        he, by his own power, gives effect for the recovery of that life which

        power of God: the reason is, because by the gospel is revealed the
        righteousness of God, that is, made known by it is a way of
        righteousness and of obtaining life before God, which neither the law,

      ><font
        >, has been the occasion of much toil to critics, but without reason:
        the very context is sufficient to show its meaning, it being what the
        gospel reveals, and what the gospel reveals is abundantly known from
        other passages. Whether we saw, it is the righteousness which is
        approved of God, as Calvin<i> </i>says, or provided by God, or contrived
        by God, or imputed by God, the meaning does not materially differ, and
        indeed all these things, as it is evident from Scripture, are true
        respecting it.</font

        >ejk pi&gt;stewv eijv pi&gt;stin</font

        pistin. The view which Calvin<i> </i>gives was adopted by some of the
        Fathers, such as Theophylact and Clemens Alexandrinus; and it is that of
        Melancthon, Beza, Scaliger, Locke, and many others. From Poole<i> </i>we
        find that Chrysostom gave this exposition, &#8220;From the obscure and
        inchoate faith of the Old Testament to the clear and full faith of the
        New;&#8221; and that Ambrose<i>&#8217;s</i> exposition was the
        following, &#8220;From the faith or fidelity of God who promises to the
        faith of him who believes.&#8221; But in all these views there is not
        that which comports with the context, nor the construction very
        intelligible-&#8221;revealed from faith,&#8221; What can it mean? To
        render the passage intelligibly, </font

        Then it would be, &#8220;The righteousness of God by faith or,
        <i>which is</i> by faith:&#8221; this is revealed in the gospel

        The connection here is not deemed very clear. Stuart thinks that this

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 1:16. and that it includes a reason why the Apostle was not
        ashamed of the gospel: and<i> </i>Macknight seems to have been of the
        same opinion, for he renders gar, <i>besides.</i> In this case the
        revelation of wrath from heaven is that which is made by the gospel.
        This certainly gives a meaning to the words, &#8220;from heaven&#8221;
        which is hardly done by any other views. That the gospel reveals
        &#8220;wrath,&#8221; as well as righteousness to be obtained by faith,
        is what is undeniable. Salvation to the believer, and condemnation to
        the unbeliever, is its sum and substance. The objection made by Haldane
        is of no force, &#8212; that the Apostle subsequently shows the sins of
        mankind as committed against the light of nature, and not against the
        gospel; for he seems to have brought forward the evidence from the light
        of nature, in order to confirm the evidence from the light of
        revelation. The expression is, &#8220;Revealed i<i>s</i> the wrath of

        Calvin is peculiar in his exposition of this verse. Most critics agree
        in thinking that those referred to here were those reputed learned among
        all nations, as Beza says, &#8220;Such as the Druids of the Gauls, the
        soothsayers of the Tuscans, the philosophers of the Greeks, the priests
        of the Egyptians, the magi of the Persians, the gymnosophists of the
        Indians, and the Rabbins of the Jews.&#8221; He considers that the
        Apostle refers especially to such as these, though he speaks of all men
        as appearing to themselves very wise in their insane devices as to the
        worship of God. The wiser they thought themselves, the more foolish they

        On this subject Augustine, as quoted by Poole, uses a stronger language
        than which we find here: &#8212;

        &#8212; &#8220;He delivered them up, not only by sufferance and
        permission, but by power, and as it were by an efficient operation; not
        by making evil their wills, but by using them, being already evil, as he
        pleased; by working many things both within and without them, from which
        they take occasion to sin more grievously, by giving them warnings,
        scourges, benefits, etc., which God knew they would abuse to their own
        destruction.&#8221; &#8212; This is an awful view of God&#8217;s
        proceedings towards those who willfully resist the truth, but no doubt a

        It has appeared to some difficult to reconcile this language with the
        free salvation which the gospel offers, and to obviate the conclusion
        which many are disposed to draw from this passage &#8212; that salvation
        is by works as well as by faith.</font
      ><br /><font
        >To this objection Pareus answers, that the Apostle speaks here of
        salvation by the works of the law, not indeed as a thing possible, which
        he subsequently denies, but as a declaration of what it is, that he
        might thereby show the necessity of a gratuitous salvation which is by
        faith only. And this is the view which Mr. Haldane takes.</font
      ><br /><font
        >But there is no need of having recourse to this hypothesis: for
        whenever <i>judgment</i> is spoken of even in the New Testament, it is
        ever represented in the same way, as being regulated in righteousness,
        according to the works of every individual. See </font

        With regard to the construction of this passage, 6-10, it may be
        observed, that it is formed according to the mode of Hebrew parallelism,
        many instances of which we meet with even in the prose writings of the
        New Testament. None of the ancients, nor any of the moderns, before the
        time of Bishop Lowth<i>,</i> understood much of the peculiar character
        of the Hebrew style. All the anomalies, noticed by Calvin<i>,</i>
        instantly vanish, when the passage is so arranged, as to exhibit the
        correspondence of its different parts. It consists of two general
        portions; the first includes three verses,</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450206&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 2:6, 7, and 8; the other, the remaining three verses. The same
        things are mainly included in both portions, only in the latter there
        are some things additional, and explanatory, and the order is reversed,
        so that the passage ends with what corresponds with its beginning. To
        see the whole in a connected form, it is necessary to set it down in
        lines, in the following manner &#8212;</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>6.</b> Who will render to each according to his works, &#8212;</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>7.</b> To those indeed, who, by perseverance in well &#8212; doing,
        Seek glory and honor and immortality, &#8212; Eternal life</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>8.</b> But <i>there shall be</i> to them who are contentious And
        obey not the truth, but obey iniquity, &#8212;Indignation and wrath:
        Then follow the same things, the order being reversed &#8212;</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>9. </b>Distress and anguish <i>shall be </i>On every soul of man
        that worketh evil, &#8212; On the Jew first, and then on the
        Greek;</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>10.</b> But glory and honor and peace, To every one who worketh
        good, &#8212; To the Jew first and then to the Greek;</font
      ><br /><font><b>11.</b> For there is no respect of persons with God.</font
      ><br /><font
        >The idea in the last and the first line is essentially the same. This
        repetition is for the sake of producing an impression. The character of
        the righteous, in the first part, is, that by persevering in doing good
        they seek glory, honor, and immortality, and their reward is to be
        eternal life: the character of the wicked is that of being contentious,
        disobedient to the truth, and obedient to unrighteousness, and their
        reward is to be indignation and wrath. The character of the first, in
        the second part. is, that they work good; and of the other, that they
        work evil: and the reward of the first is glory, honor, and peace, and
        the reward of the other, distress and anguish; which are the effects of
        indignation and wrath, as glory honor, and peace are the fruits or the
        constituent parts of eternal life It is to be observed that priority in
        happiness, as well as priority in misery, is ascribed to the Jew.

        manifests a difference in bestowing benefits, but not in exercising
        Judgment. Indeed, in the present instance, with regard to the subject
        handled by the Apostle, there was a manifest difference; the Gentile had
        only the law of nature, but the Jew had a revealed law. Yet when brought
        to judgment there was to be no respect of persons, each was to be judged
        impartially according to the circumstances of his condition. And
        further, election does not proceed on the principle of showing respect
        of persons, that is, of regarding men according to their privileges or
        outward circumstances, or kindred or relation in life, or any thing in

        Calvin seems to consider that the latter part of the verse is only a
        expansion or an exposition of the preceding clause respecting
        &#8220;conscience:&#8221; but it seems to contain a distinct idea. The
        testimony of conscience is one thing, which is instantaneous, without
        reflection: and the thoughts or the reasonings &#8212; </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">logismw~n</font
      ><font
        >, which alternately or mutually accuse or excuse, seem to refer to a
        process carried on by the mind, by which the innate voice of conscience
        is confirmed. This is the view taken by Stuart and<i> </i>Barnes, and to
        which<i> </i>Hodge is inclined.</font
      ><br /><font
        >Another view of the latter clause is given by Doddridge<i>, </i
        >Macknight<i>, </i>Haldane<i>,</i> and Chalmers<i>. </i>The last gives
        this paraphrase of the whole verse, &#8212; &#8220;For they show that
        the matter of the law is written in their hearts &#8212; both from their
        conscience testifying what is right and wrong in their own conduct, and
        from their reasonings in which they either accuse or vindicate one
        another.&#8221;</font
      ><br /><font
        >But to regard the two clauses as referring to conscience and the inward
        workings of the mind, appears more consistent with the context. The
        Gentiles are those spoken of: God gave them no outward law, but the law
        of nature which is inward. Hence in the following verse he speaks of God
        as judging &#8220;the secrets of men,&#8221; as the inward law will be

        immediately preceding verse: but almost all modern critics connect it
        with the 12th verse, and consider what intervenes as parenthetic. This
        is according to our version. In the </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450212&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 2:12, both the Gentile and the Jew are spoken of, and that with
        reference to judgment. In this verse the time and the character of that
        judgment are referred to, and its character especially as to the
        Gentile, as his case is particularly delineated in the parenthesis. The
        Apostle then, in what follows, turns to the Jew. &#8220;According to my
        gospel&#8221; must be understood, not as though the gospel is to be the
        rule of judgment to the Gentile, but as to the fact, that Christ is

        doctors assumed, and are not to be considered as having any great
        difference in their real meaning. There seems to be no reason to
        suppose, with<i> </i>Doddridge and some others, that &#8220;the blind,
        foolish, ignorant&#8221; were the Gentiles, for the Jews did not assume
        the office of teaching them. It is to be observed that Paul here takes

        understand by <i>knowledge</i> what refers to morals or outward conduct,

        &#8220;Sacrilege,&#8221; mentioned here, is by some taken literally as
        meaning the robbing of God as to the sacrifices he required, and the
        profanation of sacred rites; &#8220;many examples of which,&#8221;
        says<i> </i>Turrettin, &#8220;are recorded by the Prophets, and also by
        Josephus, both before and during the last war.&#8221; But some extend
        its meaning to acts of hypocrisy and ungodliness, by which God&#8217;s
        honor was profaned, and the glory due to him was denied. The highest
        sacrilege, no doubt, is to deprive God of that sincere service and
        obedience which he justly requires. &#8220;They caused,&#8221;
        <i>says </i>Pareus<i>,</i> &#8220;the name and honor of God to be in
        various ways blasphemed by their wicked hypocrisy; and hence they were
        justly said by the Apostle to he guilty of sacrilege.&#8221; He then
        adds, &#8220;we must notice, that idolatry is not opposed to sacrilege,
        but mentioned as a thing closely allied to it. Indeed all idolatry is
        sacrilegious. How then can the Monks, Priests, and Jesuits clear
        themselves from the charge of sacrilege? for they not only do not detest
        idolatry, being in this respect much worse than these hypocrites, but
        also greedily seek, like them, sacred offerings, and under the pretense
        of sanctity devour widows&#8217; houses, pillage the coffers of kings,
        and, what is most heinous, sacrilegiously rob God of his due worship and
        honor and transfer them to saints.&#8221; Yet the world is so blind as
        not to see the real character of such men! &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        On this remarkable passage Haldane has these very appropriate, just, and

        >&#8220;The Apostle, in these verses, exhibits the most lively image of
        hypocrisy. Was there ever a more beautiful veil than that under which
        the Jew presents himself? He is a man of confession, of praise, of
        thanksgiving &#8212; a man, whose trust is in the Law, whose boast is of
        God, who knows his will, who approves of things that are excellent, a
        man who calls himself a conductor of the blind, a light of those who are
        in darkness, an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of babes; a man
        who directs others, who preaches against theft, against adultery,
        against idolatry, and to sum up the whole, a man who glories in the
        commandments of the Lord. Who would not say that this is an angel
        arrayed in human form &#8212; a star detached from the firmament, and
        brought nearer to enlighten the earth? But observe what is concealed
        under this mask. It is a man who is himself untaught; it is a thief, an
        adulterer, a sacrilegious person; in one word, a wicked man, who
        continually dishonors God by the transgression of his law. Is it
        possible to imagine a contrast more monstrous than between these fair
        appearances and this awful reality?&#8221;</font
      ><br /><font
        >No, certainly; but it is a contrast which still exists, with various
        modifications, in many instances. &#8212; It ought to be observed, that
        when the author calls the Jew &#8220;a man of confession, of praise, of
        thanksgiving,&#8221; he alludes to the import of the word, Jew, in
        Hebrew, which is derived from a verb, which includes these ideas: and it
        is supposed by some, that there is an allusion in the last words of this
        chapter, &#8220;whose praise,&#8221; etc., to what the name signifies.

        Whenever there is a material agreement between the Greek and the Hebrew,
        we ought not to make it otherwise. If the verb </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kri&gt;nesqai</font
      ><font
        >, as admitted by most critics, may be taken actively and be thus made
        to agree with the Hebrew, what reason can there be to take it in another
        sense? The only real difference is in one word, between </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">nikh&gt;shv</font
      ><font>, overcomest,&#8221; and </font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hkzt</font

        words are different. To overcome in judgment, and to be clear in
        judgment, amounts to the same thing. The parallelism of the Hebrew
        requires </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kri&gt;nesqai</font
      ><font>
        to be a verb in the middle voice, and to have an active meaning. The two
        lines in Hebrew, as it is often the case in Hebrew poetry, contain the
        same sentiment in different words, the last line expressing it more
        definitely; so that to be &#8220;justified,&#8221; and to be
        &#8220;cleared,&#8221; convey the same idea; and also &#8220;in thy

        To see the force and meaning of this verse, we must bear in mind that
        the former part was said to prevent the Jews from evading the
        application of the preceding testimonies; and then the words &#8220;that
        every mouth,&#8221; etc., and &#8220;that all the world,&#8221; etc.,
        were added, not so much to include the Gentiles, as to include the Jews,
        who thought themselves exempted. No doubt the Gentiles are included, but
        the special object of the Apostle evidently seems to prevent the Jews
        from supposing that they were not included. In no other way can the
        connection between the two parts of the verse be understood. &#8212;<i>

        >, a sacrifice, being understood; but it is used by itself as other
        words of similar termination are. It is found also in Josephus and in
        <i>Maccabees</i> in this sense. It appears that Origen<i>, </i
        >Theodoret<i>,</i> and other Fathers, and also Erasmus<i>, </i>Luther
        and<i> </i>Locke<i>,</i> take the first meaning &#8212;

        <i>a propitiatory sacrifice.</i> Now as both meanings are legitimate,
        which of them are we to take? Venema<i>,</i> and Stuart allude to one
        thing which much favors the latter view, that is, the phrase </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn tw ai[mati aujtou</font

        himself as the mercy-seat, and to represent him also as sprinkled by his
        own blood; but that it is appropriate to say that a propitiatory
        sacrifice was made by his blood. The verb </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proe&gt;qeto</font
      ><font

        mentioned in chapter. 1:17, as Augustine<i>;</i> and others, his
        righteousness as the God of rectitude and justice, as Chrysostom<i>.</i>
        Some, too, as Grotius<i>, </i>view it as meaning goodness or mercy,
        regarding the word as having sometimes this sense.</font
      ><br /><font
        >It is the context that can help us to the right meaning. God exhibited
        his Son as a propitiation, to set forth this righteousness; and this
        righteousness is connected with the remission of, or rather; as the word
        means, the preterition of or connivance at sins committed under the old
        dispensation: and those sins were connived at through the forbearance of
        God, he not executing the punishment they deserved; and the purpose is
        stated to be, &#8212; that God might be or appear <i>just,</i> while he
        is the justifier of those who believe in Christ. Now, what can this
        righteousness be but his administrative justice? As the law allowed no
        remission, and God did remit sins, there appeared to be a stain on
        divine justice. The exhibition of Christ as an atonement is what alone
        removes it. And there is a word in the former verse, as Venema justly
        observes, which tends to confirm this view, and that word is redemption, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpolutrw&gt;siv</font
      ><font

        justice requires.</font

        is found in the preceding verse. The meaning seems to be the same, for
        both prepositions are used to designate the design, end, or object of
        any thing. This variety seems to have been usual with the Apostle;
        similar instances are found in </font

        (<i>causa finalis</i>) is indicated.&#8221; Beza renders them both by
        the same preposition,<i> ad, </i>in Latin; and Stuart<i> </i>regards the
        two as equivalent. There is, perhaps, more refinement than truth in what
        Pareus says, &#8212; that </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv</font
      ><font>
        intimates the proximate end &#8212; the forgiveness of sins; and </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v</font
      ><font
        >, the final end &#8212; the glory of God in the exhibition of his
        justice as well as of his mercy. There is, at the same time, something
        in the passage which seems favorable to this view. Two objects are
        stated at the end of the passage, &#8212; that God might appear just,
        and be also the justifier of such as believe. The last may refer to </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejiv</font
      ><font>, and the former to </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v</font
      ><font
        >; and this is consistent with the usual style of the Apostle; for, in
        imitation of the Prophets, where two things are mentioned in a former
        clause, the order is reversed in the second. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        declared. Stuart makes here an important remark &#8212; that if the
        death of Christ be regarded only as that of a martyr or as an example of
        constancy, how then could its efficacy be referred to &#8220;sins that

        this is to separate it from it&#8217;s immediate connection without any
        satisfactory reason. Besides, such an interpretation obliterates an
        important doctrine, that faith does not render void, or nullify the
        authority, the use and sanctions of the moral law but on the contrary,
        sustains and confirms them. Though it does what the law does not, and
        cannot do, inasmuch as it saves the sinner whom the law condemns; it yet
        effects this without relaxing or dishonoring the law, but in a way that
        renders it, if possible, more binding, and more honorable, and more
        illustrious. It only renders the passage more intricate to include the
        ceremonial law, (for that has more of faith than of law in it,) to which
        no reference is made in the context: but there seems to be no objection
        to include the law of conscience, as well as the written law; for faith
        confirms both, and the word &#8220;law,&#8221; is here without the
        article, though this indeed of itself is not decisive. The moral law,
        then, as well as the law of conscience, is what is here intended: for

        The adoption is evidently included in the words, found in the first
        verse of this chapter, &#8220;I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
        reward.&#8221; What follows is connected with this, and the promise of a
        numerous seed arose from what Abraham said respecting an heir. His
        <i>believing</i> them had an especial regard to the first promise, as
        the second, respecting his &#8220;seed,&#8221; was only, as it were, an
        enlargement of the first, or an addition to it. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        The foregoing observations contain a lucid and a satisfactory view of
        the character of Abraham&#8217;s faith, perfectly consistent with what
        is said of it by Paul in this chapter, and in the epistle to the
        Galatians. Some think that the <i>principle </i>of faith was the only
        thing which the Apostle had in view in referring to Abraham&#8217;s
        faith, and that he had no special regard to the object of justifying
        faith, that is, Christ. But that Christ was, in a measure, revealed to
        him, is evident from the account given in Genesis, and from what Christ
        himself has said, &#8212; that Abraham saw his day and rejoiced, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430856&gt;</font></sup

        Calvin intimates, that formed the most distinctive object of
        Abraham&#8217;s faith, the promise of a free acceptance, without any
        regard to works. There are two things which the Apostle clearly intended
        to show, &#8212; that imputation of righteousness is an act of
        gratuitous favor, &#8212; and that it is alone by faith.</font

        >Genesis 15:6. Paul gives it literally according to the Septuagint. The
        word &#8220;Abraham,&#8221; is put in; instead of &#8220;Jehovah, it is
        &#8220;God;&#8221; the verb &#8220;count,&#8221; is made passive, and a
        preposition is placed before &#8220;righteousness.&#8221; The Hebrew is
        this, &#8212; &#8220;And he believed on Jehovah, and he counted it to
        him righteousness.&#8221; The &#8220;it,&#8221; no doubt, refers to what
        is included in the word &#8220;believed.&#8221; So Paul explains it in
        verse 9, where he expressly puts down </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pi&gt;stiv</font
      ><font>, faith.</font><br /><font
        >It has been said that this faith of Abraham was not faith in Christ,
        according to what the context shows in Genesis. And it was not so
        specifically: nor does Paul represent it as such; for this was not his
        object. He states it throughout as faith in God; it was believing the
        testimony of God; but that testimony embraced a promise respecting
        Christ; so that it included the Savior within its compass. We must
        remember that Paul&#8217;s object is to establish this truth, &#8212;
        that righteousness is attained by faith and not by works; and that for
        this end he adduces the examples both of Abraham and David. It was not
        his design to point out specifically the object of justifying faith. We
        must keep this in view, in order to understand the reasoning of the
        Apostle in this chapter: it is the power and efficacy of faith, in
        opposition to all works, that he particularly dwells upon, and the
        gracious promise of God was its object. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        Some have stumbled at this sentence, &#8212; &#8220;his faith is counted
        for rghteousness,&#8221; and have misapplied it, as though faith were in
        itself the cause of righteousness, and hence a meritorious act, and not
        the way and means of attaining righteousness. Condensed sentences will
        not submit to the rules of logic, but must be interpreted according to
        the context and explanations elsewhere found. &#8220;His faith&#8221;
        means, no doubt, his faith in the Promise, or in God who promises, or in
        him who, as is said in this verse, &#8220;justifies the ungodly:&#8221;
        hence what is believed, or the object of faith, is what is counted for
        righteousness. This accords with the declarations, &#8212; that
        &#8220;man is justified by faith,&#8221; </font

        That circumcision was a sign or a symbol of what was spiritual, is

        whom there is an express record. But the idea seems to be somewhat
        different. He was a father as the first possessor of an inheritance
        which was to descend to all his children. The inheritance was given him
        by grace through faith; it was to descend, as it were, to all his lawful
        posterity, to all his legitimate seed, that is, to all who possessed the
        like faith with himself. He is therefore called the father of many
        nations, because many nations would become his legitimate heirs by
        becoming believers; and in the same sense must be regarded the
        expression here, &#8220;the heir of the world;&#8221; he was the
        representative of all the believing world, and made an heir of an
        inheritance which was to come to the world in general, to the believing
        Jews and to the believing Gentiles. He was the heir, the first
        possessor, of what was to descend to the world without any difference.
        He was the heir of the world in the same sense as he was &#8220;the

        &#8212; &#8220;The promise is by faith, and not by the law; for the law
        brings wrath or condemnation: but where there is no law, there is no

        This is a striking instance of the latitude of meaning which some words
        have in Scripture. Here hope, in the first instance, means the
        <i>ground </i>of hope; and in the second, the <i>object </i>of hope. So

        >Romans 4:5, and in other places, must be considered as including its
        object, the gracious promise of God; for otherwise it will be a
        meritorious act, the very thing which the Apostle throughout repudiates
        with regard to man&#8217;s justification. Faith, as it lays hold on
        God&#8217;s promise of free acceptance and forgiveness, can alone, in
        the very nature of things, be imputed for righteousness: it is not
        indispensably necessary that the way, or medium, or the meritorious
        cause of acceptance and forgiveness, should be clearly known and
        distinctly seen; the gracious promise of God is enough, so that faith
        may become a justifying faith.</font

        Christ is said here to have been raised from the dead by <i>God</i>, as
        well as delivered into death. &#8220;However much of the import of
        this,&#8221; says Chalmers, &#8220;may have escaped the notice of an
        ordinary reader, it is pregnant with meaning of the weightiest
        importance. You know that when the prison door is opened to a criminal,
        and that by the very authority which lodged him there, it envinces that
        the debt of his transgression has been rendered, and that he stands
        aquitted of all it&#8217;s penalties. It was not for his own, but for
        our offenses that Jesus was delivered unto the death, and that his body
        was consigned to the imprisonment of the grave. And when an angel
        descended from heaven, and rolled back the great stone from the door of
        the sepulchre, this speaks to us, that the justice of God is satisfied,
        that the ransom of our iniquity has been paid, that Christ has rendered
        a full disch of all the debt for which he undertook as the great surety
        between God and the sinners who believe in him.&#8221; &#8212;<i>

        this verse contains in part the same truth as the former. The style of
        Paul is often very like that of the Prophets, that is, the arrangement
        of his sentences is frequently on their model. In the Prophets, and also
        in the Psalms, we find often two distichs and sometimes two verses
        containing the same sentiment, only the latter distich states it
        differently, and adds something to it. See, for example, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193201&gt;</font></sup

        whom we have access,&#8221; are identical in their import. The

        Chalmers observes, that there are two hopes mentioned in this passage,
        &#8212; the hope of faith in the second verse, and the hope of
        experience in this. &#8220;The hope of the fourth verse,&#8221; he says,
        &#8220;is distinct from and posterior to the hope of the second; and it
        also appears to be derived from another source. The first hope is hope
        in believing, a hope which hangs direct on the testimony of God...The
        second hope is grounded on distinct considerations &#8212; not upon what
        the believer sees to be in the testimony of God, but upon what he finds
        to be in himself. &#8212; It is the fruit not of faith, but of
        experience; and is gathered not from the word that is without, but from
        the feeling of what passes within.&#8221; &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        &#8220;The love of God&#8221; in this passage may mean either the love
        of which God is the object &#8212; love to God, or the love which he
        possesses &#8212; God&#8217;s love to us: the <i>usus loquendi</i> would
        admit either of these meanings; and hence commentators have differed on
        the point. The expression, </font

      ><font
        >1 John 4:9, signifies clearly the love of God to us. The meaning then
        can alone be ascertained by the context and by the wording of the
        sentence. It stands connected with Christian graces, patience and hope;
        and this favors the first view, that it is love to God produced within
        by the Spirit. Then the verb, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejkke&gt;cutai</font
      ><font>
        &#8212; is poured out or poured forth, seems more suitable to the idea
        of love being communicated as a gift, or as a holy feeling within. It is
        further what prevents hope from being disappointed; it is some good or
        enjoyment that now strengthens and satisfies hope; and to love God who
        first loved us is to realize in a measure what hope expects; and when it
        is said that it is diffused by the Spirit, we are reminded of what Paul

        &#8220;for,&#8221; and that the subsequent context most clearly refers
        to the love of God to us; and this evidently decides the question.</font

        before us seems to be more direct, in respect to the
        <i>perseverance of the saints</i>, than almost any other passage in the
        Scriptures which I can find. The sentiment here is not dependent on the
        <i>form</i> of a particular expression, (as it appears to be in some
        other passages); but it is fundamentally connected with the very nature
        of the argument.&#8221; &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        The beginning of this verse has occasioned a vast number of conjectures,
        both as to the connection and as to the corresponding clause to the fist
        sentence. Most agree in the main with Calvin on these two points. Hodge
        announces a similar view as to the connection in these words, &#8212;
        &#8220;The idea of men being regarded and treated, not according to
        their own merits, but the merit of another, is contrary to the common
        mode of thinking among men. The Apostle illustrates and enforces it by
        an appeal to the great analogous fact in the history of the
        world.&#8221;</font

        itself. The sentiment of the passage is this, &#8212; through one man
        sin entered and death followed; and death followed as to all mankind,
        because all had sinned. Then, according to his usual manner, the Apostle
        takes up the last subject, &#8220;sin,&#8221; issuing in the death of

        be considered in Adam&#8217;s sin, &#8212; the sinful act, the penalty
        of the law, and the depravity of nature; or in other words, the
        transgression of the command, the punishment of death, and natural
        Corruption, which was the loss of God&#8217;s image, and in its stead
        came deformity and disorder. From none of these his posterity are free,
        but all these have descended to them; there is a participation of the
        transgression, an imputation of guilt, and the propagation of natural
        depravity. There is a <i>participation</i> of the sin; for all his
        posterity were seminally in his loins, so that all sinned in his sin, as
        Levi paid tithes in the loins of Abraham; and as children are a part of
        their parents, so children are in a manner partakers of their
        parents&#8217; sin. There is also an <i>imputation</i> of guilt, for the
        first man so stood in favor, that when he sinned, not only he, but also
        all his posterity fell with him, and became with him subject to eternal
        death. And lastly, there is the <i>propagation</i> or the generation of
        a dreadful deformity of nature; for such as Adam became after the fall,
        such were the children he begat, being after his own image, and not
        after the image of God. </font

        Adam sinning first transgressed, first contracted guilt, and first
        depraved his nature, &#8212; and that all these things belong to his
        posterity by participation, imputation, and propagation.&#8221;</font

        >Both Stuart and Barnes stumble here; and though they denounce
        theorizing, and advocate adherence to the language of Scripture, they do
        yet theorize and attempt to evade the plain and obvious meaning of this
        passage. But in trying to avoid one difficulty, they make for themselves
        another still greater. The penalty, or the imputation of guilt, they
        admit; which is indeed undeniable, as facts, as well as Scripture, most
        clearly prove: but the participation they deny, though words could
        hardly be framed to express it more distinctly than the words of this
        verse; and thus, according to their view, a punishment is inflicted
        without a previous implication in an offense; while the Scriptural
        account of the matter is, according to what Calvin states, that
        &#8220;sin extends to all who suffer its punishment,&#8221; though he
        afterwards explains this in a way that is not altogether consistent.

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450512&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 5:12. He states in this verse two things: a fact and a general
        principle; the fact is, that sin, the first sin in its evident effects,
        (for he speaks throughout of <i>no other sin</i>, as to Adam, or as
        producing death,) was in the world before the law of Moses was given;
        and the general principle he avows is, that no sin is imputed where
        there is no law. Having made this last admission, he proceeds in the </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450514&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 5:14 to say, that &#8220;nevertheless,&#8221; or
        notwithstanding, death, the effect of sin, prevailed in the world, and
        prevailed even as to those who did not <i>actually</i> or personally sin
        as Adam did. He takes no account of personal sins, for his object was to
        show the effects of the first sin. And then he says, that in is respect
        Adam was a kind of type, a figure, a representative of Christ who was to
        come; and in the three verses which follow, </font

        <i>one</i>, which brings the &#8220;gift&#8221; of life; and the
        difference, &#8220;much more,&#8221; seems to refer to the exuberance of
        grace by which man is to be raised to a higher state than that from
        which Adam fell. &#8220;A little lower than the angels&#8221; was man in
        his first creation; he is by exuberance of grace to be raised to a state
        as high as that of angels, if not higher; or we may take &#8220;much
        more&#8221; as intimating the greater power of grace to recover than sin
        to destroy. Sin is the act of man, and issued in death; but grace is the

        &#8220;Sub contemptibili verborum humilitate.&#8221; This sort of
        derogatory language as to the style of Scripture, Calvin had evidently
        learnt from the fathers. Chrysostom<i> </i>and Jerome did sometimes say
        most unwarrantable things in this respect, and that in a great measure
        because they did not understand the style of the New Testament, and in
        part with the view of taking away, by an admission, the force of
        objections alleged by admirers of Grecian and refined diction. The style
        of the New Testament is that of the Old; and hardly any of the fathers,
        except Origen and Jerome knew Hebrew, and the latter learnt it only in
        his old age, so that he could have had no great insight into its
        peculiarities. One like<i> </i>Chrysostom brought up in the refinements
        of Grecian literature, was a very unfit judge of the style of the New
        Testament, and hence it is that the criticisms of the Greek fathers in
        general are comparatively of very little value.</font

        whole race of man is meant in the one instances cannot be doubted: and
        is there any reason why the whole race of man should not be included in
        the second? Most clearly there is. The Apostle speaks of <i>Adam</i> and
        his posterity, and also of <i>Christ </i>and his people, or those
        &#8220;who receive abundance of grace,&#8217; or, &#8220;are made
        righteous;&#8221; and &#8220;the many&#8221; and the &#8220;all&#8221;
        are evidently those who belong to each separately. In no other way can
        the words with any consistency be understood. All who fell in Adam do
        not certainly &#8220;receive abundance of grace,&#8221; and are not
        &#8220;made righteous.&#8221; And it is not possible, as Professor Hodge
        observes, &#8220;so to eviscerate such declarations as these, as to make
        them to contain nothing more than that the chance of salvation is
        offered to all men.&#8221; This is indeed contrary to evident facts. Nor
        can they mean, that a way of acceptance has been opened, which is
        suitable to all; for though this is true, it yet cannot be the meaning
        here. Hence &#8220;the many&#8221; and the &#8220;all,&#8221; as to
        Adam, are all his descendants; and &#8220;the many&#8221; and the

        and this seems to be the meaning given to it by Calvin. The law did not
        create sin, but made it known, and by discovering it, increased its
        guilt when persisted in, and by discovering it showed the necessity of a
        Savior.</font

        The superabounding has a reference to the increasing of sin by means of
        the law. Grace not only abounded so as to be sufficient to remedy the
        first sin and the sins which followed it; but it abounded still more, so
        as to be an adequate provision for sin when increased by the law,
        through the perverseness of human nature. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        The antithesis to &#8220;sin&#8221; is properly
        &#8220;righteousness;&#8221; but, as Calvin observes,
        &#8220;grace&#8221; is connected with it. To preserve the contrast, the
        sentence might be rendered, &#8220;grace through righteousness;&#8221;
        and then to show the medium or channel through which this &#8220;grace
        through righteousness&#8221; is to reign so as to issue in
        &#8220;eternal life,&#8221; it is added, &#8220;through Jesus Christ our
        Lord.&#8221; So that in this single sentence, we have the origin,
        &#8220;grace,&#8221; the means or the meritorious cause,
        &#8220;righteousness,&#8221; the agent, or the procurer of it,
        &#8220;Jesus Christ,&#8221; and the end, &#8220;eternal life.&#8221;
        Some take &#8220;grace&#8221; as antithetic to sin, and connect
        &#8220;righteousness&#8221; with &#8220;eternal life,&#8221; and render
        it &#8220;justification;&#8221; but this does not so well preserve the
        antithetic character of the clause. Those who render it
        &#8220;holiness&#8221; completely misunderstand the drift of the
        passage.</font

        from its power as a master, from the servitude or bondage of sin. To
        live in it, does not mean to live under its guilt, but in its service
        and under its ruling power; and this is what the Apostle represents as a
        contrast to being dead to sin. Not to &#8220;serve sin,&#8221; in </font

        14.</font
      ><br /><font
        >The very argument requires this meaning. The question in the first
        verse, &#8212; Shall we continue in sin?&#8221; does not surely mean
        &#8212; shall we continue in or under the guilt of sin? but in its
        service, and in the practice of it. It was the chapter of practical
        licentiousness that the Apostle rebuts; and he employs an argument
        suitable to the purpose, &#8220;If we are dead to sin, freed from it as
        our master, how absurd it is to suppose that we can live any longer in
        its service?&#8221; Then be shows in what follows how this had been
        effected. This is clearly the import of the passage, and so taken by
        almost all commentators.</font
      ><br /><font
        >But it must be added, that Venema<i> </i>and Chalmers materially agree
        with Haldane<i>.</i> The former says that to &#8220;die to sin&#8221; is
        to give to sin what it demands and that is, death; and that when this is
        given, it can require nothing more. In this sense, he adds, Christ died
        to sin (</font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450610&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 6:10); and in the same sense believers die to sin, being, as
        they are, united to Christ, his death being viewed as their death.
        However true this theology may be, (and Chalmers shows this in his own
        inimitable manner,) it does not seem to be taught here: though there may
        be something in one or two expressions to favor it; yet the whole tenor
        of the passage, and many of the phrase, seem clearly to constrain us to
        adopt the other view. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        conjoining, union, as the sameness of disposition, or the joining
        together of a dismembered limb, or, as Grotius says, the union of

        likeness to Christ&#8217;s death, so his rising to a spiritual life is
        certain to bear a similar likeness to Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Then

        It is thought by Pareus and others, that &#8220;body&#8221; is here
        assigned to &#8220;sin,&#8221; in allusion to the crucifixion that is
        mentioned, as a body in that case is fixed to the cross, and that it
        means the whole congeries, or, as Calvin calls it, the whole mass of
        sins, such as pride, passion, lust, etc. But the reason for using the
        word &#8220;body,&#8221; is more probably this, because he called innate
        sin, man &#8212; &#8220;the old man;&#8221; and what properly belongs to
        man is a body. The &#8220;body of sin&#8221; is a Hebraism, and
        signifies a sinful hody. It has no special reference to the material
        body, as Origen thought. The &#8220;man&#8221; here is to be taken in a
        spiritual sense, as one who has a mind, reason, and affections:
        therefore the body which belongs to him must be of the same character:
        it is the whole of what appertains to &#8220;the old man,&#8221; as he
        is Corrupt and sinful, the whole of what is earthly, wicked, and
        depraved in him. It is the sinful body of the old man. &#8212;<i>

        This verse has occasioned vanous explanations. The most obvious meaning
        of the first clause is, that to &#8220;die&#8221; here means to die with
        or in a similar manner with Christ, for in the next verse, where the
        idea is resumed, &#8220;with&#8221; or like &#8220;Christ,&#8221; is
        expressly stated. The verb, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dedikai&gt;wtai</font
      ><font
        >, &#8220;is,&#8221; or has been &#8220;justified,&#8221; has been
        considered by the early and most of the later commentators in the sense
        of being <i>freed</i> or delivered. This is the view, among others, of
        Chrysostom, Basil, &#338;cumenius, Beza, Pareus, Hammond, Grotius,
        Doddridge and Macknight<i>.</i> But it must be added, that it is a
        meaning of which there is no other clear instance in the New Testament,
        though the verb occurs often. Scott, aware of this, gives it its common
        meaning, &#8220;justified;&#8221; and though he does not take the view
        of Venema, Chalmers, and Haldane, as to the general import of the former
        part of this chapter, he yet considers that to be &#8220;justified from
        sin&#8221; here, is to be justified from its guilt and penalty. Nor is
        it irrelevant to the subject in hand to refer to justification: for it
        is a very important truth to declare, that to die to sin is an evidence
        of being justified from its guilt. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        This difference may be gathered from the general tenor of the whole
        passage; for his death and our death are said to have a <i>likeness</i>,
        and not to be same. And farther, in mentioning our death in this
        connection, in the next verse, he changes his phraseology; it is </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">nekrou&lt;v</font
      ><font> and not </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ei+nai</font

        dead (</font

      ><font
        >) in trespasses and sins,&#8221; are those who have no spiritual life;
        and to be dead <i>to</i> sin is not to have life for sin, to be freed
        from its ruling power. See </font

        personified as a king, a ruler, and as having a body, he being
        &#8220;the old man;&#8221; and this body is represented as belonging to

        The idea of a king, a ruler, or a tyrant, is preserved throughout.

        proposed by Hammond is the meaning most suitable here; for the Apostle
        had previously used reasons and arguments, and sacred similitudes; but
        he comes now to what is known in common life among men, the connection
        between masters and servants, and he did this in condescension to their
        weakness, which he calls the weakness of the flesh, that is, the
        weakness of which flesh, the depravity of nature, was the cause; it was
        weakness arising from the flesh. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        The different clauses of this verse have been a knotty point to all
        commentators. Probably the Apostle did not intend to keep up a regular
        course of antithesis, the subject not admitting of this; because the
        progress of evil and the progress of its remedy may be different, and it
        seems to be so in the present case. Sin is innate and inward, and its
        character, as here represented, is vileness and iniquity, and it breaks
        out into acts of iniquity: he does not repeat the other character,
        vileness; but when he comes to the contrast he mentions holiness, and
        does not add what is antithetic to iniquity. This is a striking instance
        of the elliptical style of the Apostle. It is not neglect or
        carelessness, but no doubt an intentional omission; it being the
        character of his mode of writing, which he had in common with the
        ancient Prophets.</font
      ><br /><font
        >Then comes the word &#8220;righteousness,&#8221; which I am disposed to
        think is that which all along has been spoken of, the righteousness of
        faith; this is not innate, not inward, but which comes from without, and
        is apprehended by faith, by which sins are forgiven, and God&#8217;s
        favor obtained; and they who become the servants of this are to
        cultivate holiness both inward and outward; they ought to present all
        their members, that is, all their faculties, to the service of this
        master, so that they may become holy in all manner of
        conversation.</font
      ><br /><font
        >But if this idea of righteousness be disapproved of, we may still
        account for the apparent irregularity in the construction of the
        passage. It is an instance of an inverted order, many examples of which
        are found even in this Epistle. He begins with
        &#8220;uncleanness,&#8221; he ends with &#8220;holiness,&#8221; and then
        the intervening words which are in contrast Correspond,
        &#8220;iniquity&#8221; and &#8220;righteousness.&#8221; Here is also an
        inversion in the meaning; &#8220;uncleanness&#8221; is the principle,
        and &#8220;holiness&#8221; is the action; while &#8220;iniquity&#8221;
        is the action, and &#8220;righteousness&#8221; is the principle. If this
        view is right, we have here a singular instance of the inverted
        parallelism, both as to words and meaning. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        law. This is a striking instance of the Apostle&#8217;s manner of
        writing, quite different from what is usual with us in the present day.

        This is a plausible reason, derived from Theodoret and<i

        embarrassed in applying the illustration given here. The woman is freed
        by the death of the husband; but the believer is represented as freed by
        dying himself. This does not Correspond: and if we attend to what the
        Apostle says, we shall see that he did not contemplate such a
        Correspondence. Let us notice how he introduces the illustration;
        &#8220;the law,&#8221; he says in the first verse, &#8220;rules, or
        exercises authority, over a man while he lives;&#8221; and then let us

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450704&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 7:4, where he speaks of our dying to the law The main design of
        the illustration then was, to show that there is no freedom from a law
        but by <i>death;</i> so that there is no necessity of a Correspondence
        in the other parts, As in the case of man and wife, death destroys the
        bond of marriage; so in the case of man and the law, that is, the law as
        the condition of life, there must be a death; else there is no freedom.
        But there is one thing more in the illustration, which the Apostle
        adopts, the liberty to marry another, when death has given a release:
        The bond of connection being broken, a union with another is legitimate.
        So far only is the example adduced to be applied &#8212;
        <i>death</i> puts an end to the right and authority of law; and then the
        party released may justly form another connection. It is the attempt to
        make all parts of the comparison to Correspond that has occasioned all

        Perhaps the sentence ought to have been rendered, For lust
        (concupiscentiam) I had not known, except the law had said, &#8220;Thou
        shalt not lust&#8221; (non concupisces.) Then the word
        &#8220;coveting&#8221; in the next verse should be &#8220;lust&#8221;
        (concupiscentiam.) But &#8220;Thou shalt not covet,&#8221; is the
        commandment; and to retain a similarity of idea, for the lack of a more
        suitable word, it seems necessary to have coveting, as covetousness has
        not the meaning here intended. There is the same Correspondence in the
        words in Greek as in Calvin<i>&#8217;s</i> Latin. The noun is rendered
        first in our version &#8220;lust,&#8221; and then

        It was the saying of Ambrose, &#8220;Lex index peccati est, non genitrix
        &#8212; the law is the discoverer, not the begetter of sin.&#8221;
        &#8220;The law,&#8217; says Pareus, &#8220;prohibits sin; it is not then

        As an instance of the frivolous and puerile mode of reasoning adopted by
        the Papists, the following may be adduced: quoting </font

      ><font
        >James 1:15, &#8220;When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and
        sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death,&#8221; they reason thus:
        &#8212; &#8220;Lust is not simply a sin, for it brings it forth; and
        when it is sin, it is not mortal sin, for it afterwards brings forth
        death. &#8220;Taking advantage of a metaphor, they apply it strictly and
        literally, without considering that the Apostle is only exhibiting the
        rise, progress, and termination &#8212; of what? of sin no doubt. The
        like produces its like. If lust were not sinful, it could not generate
        what is sinful. such childish and profane reasoning is an outrage both
        on common sense and on religion. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        Most commentators take the opposite view, &#8212; that the irritation of
        sin occasioned by the law is more especially meant here. The two ideas,
        the knowledge and the excitement, or the increase of sin by the law, are
        no doubt referred to by the Apostle in these verses. &#8212;<i>

        This clause is rightly separated from the former verse; for it clearly
        announces what is illustrated in the following verses. &#8220;Without

        and not known still. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        blameless. Critics often make difficulties when there are none. What is
        said here of being alive without the law, or when the law is not known,
        and of the commandment supposed to be for life being found to be unto
        death, is still exemplified in the character of men, and takes place in
        the experience of all who are brought out of darkness, as Paul was, unto
        marvellous light. Experience is often the best expositor.</font

        This verse will be better understood if we consider it as in a manner a
        repetition, in another form, of what the former verse contains, and this
        is perfectly consistent with the usual manner of the Apostle. His object
        seems to have been to prevent a misapprehension of what he had said,
        that the commandment which was for life proved to be unto death. He
        hence says, that sin availed itself of the commandment, and by it
        deceived him, that is, promised him life, and then by it killed him,
        that is, proved fatal to him. There is a Correspondence in meaning
        between the commandment unto life and deceiving, and between death and
        killing. In </font

        to expose, and subject him to death and misery. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

      ><font>
        This is doubtless true, and it is an example of what the Apostle&#8217;s
        manner of writing is, it being that of the ancient prophets. How various
        are the words used in the 119th Psalm to designate the law or the
        revealed will of God? and two different words are often used in the same
        verse.</font
      ><br /><font
        >Having spoken of the law in connection with sin, the Apostle may be
        supposed to have had the character of sin in view in characterizing the
        law. Sin works depraved desires and lusts; the law is <i>holy:</i> sin
        deceives and acts the traitor, the law is plain-dealing and
        <i>just:</i> sin leads to death and misery; the law is <i>good</i> and
        leads to happiness. The last contrast is evident from what follows in
        the next verse, &#8220;Was that which is good made death unto me?&#8221;
        &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font
      ><br /><sup><font color="Maroon">ft215</font></sup
      ><font>
        This can hardly be admitted. The Apostle in Corinthians evidently states
        a fact, as he often does, without going into an explanation; and the
        fact was, that the law proved to be the ministration of death: but it
        proved to be so through the sin and wickedness of man. &#8212;<i>

        Erasmus, Beza, Pareus, Stuart, and others, make up the ellipsis by
        putting in, &#8220;was made death to me,&#8221; after sin.&#8221; But
        there is no need of adding anything. The sentence throughout is
        thoroughly Hebraistic. What is partially announced in the words,
        &#8220;that it might appear sin,&#8221; or, to be sin, etc., is more
        fully stated in the last clause; and the participle,

        This is evidently the case here. As<i> carnal</i> means what is sinful
        and Corrupt, so spiritual imports what is holy, just, and good. As the

        >It has been usual with a certain class of divines, such as<i

        Augustine viewed Paul here as not speaking of himself. But this is
        plainly contradicted by what Augustine declares himself in several parts
        of his writings. In his </font
      ><font color="Blue"><i>Retractations, B. 1:chapter 23</i></font
      ><font
        >, he refers to some authors of divine discourses (<i
          >quibusdam divinorum tractatoribus eloquiorom</i
        >) by whose authority he was induced to change his opinion, and to
        regard Paul here as speaking of himself. He alludes again in his work
        against Julian, an advocate of Pelagianism, B. 6, chapter 11, to this
        very change in his view, and ascribes it to the reading of the works of
        those who were better and more intelligent than himself, (<i
          >melioribus et intelligentioribus cessi</i
        >..) Then he refers to them by name, and says, &#8220;Hence it was that
        I came to understand these things, as Hilary, Gregory, Ambrose, and
        other holy and known doctors of the Church, understood them, who thought
        that the Apostle himself strenuously struggled against carnal lusts,
        which he was unwilling to have, and yet had, and that he bore witness as
        to this confiict in these words,&#8221; (referring to this very text,)
        &#8212;
        <i>Hinc factum est. ut sic ista intelligerem, quemadmodum intellexit</i>

        It appears from this, that Calvin did not apply the foregoing words,
        &#8220;I am carnal, sold under sin,&#8221; in the same way: but they are
        evidently connected together. They are indeed strong words, and some
        explain them in such a way as to be wholly unsuitable to a renewed man;
        but we ought to take the explanation as given by the Apostle himself in
        what follows, for he handles the subject to the end of the
        chapter.</font
      ><br /><font
        >Various fictions have been resorted to by critics on this point. The
        Apostle has been supposed by some to speak of himself as under the law,
        or as Stuart terms it, &#8220;in a law state,&#8221; and such is the
        scheme of Hammond<i>.</i> Others have imagined, that he personates a Jew
        living during the time between Abraham and the giving of the law; and
        this was Locke<i>&#8217;s </i>idea. A third party have entertained the
        notion, that the Apostle, speaking in his own person, represents, by a
        sort of fiction, as Vitringa<i> </i>and some others have imagined, the
        effects of the law in Jews and proselytes, as opposed to the effects of
        the gospel, as delineated in the next chapter. And a fourth party
        maintain, that the Apostle describes a man in a transition state, in
        whom God&#8217;s Spirit works for his conversion, but who is as yet
        doubtful which way to turn, to sin or to God.</font
      ><br /><font
        >All these conjectures have arisen, because the language is not taken in
        its obvious meaning, and according to the Apostle&#8217;s own
        explanation. As soon as we depart from the plain meaning of the text and
        the context, we open a door to endless conjectures and fictions. The
        Apostle says nothing here of himself, but what every real Christian
        finds to be true. Is not a Christian, yea, the best, in this world
        <i>carnal</i>, as well as spiritual? Is he not &#8220;sold under
        sin?&#8221; that is, subjected to a condition, in which he is
        continually annoyed, tempted, hindered, restrained, checked, and seduced
        by the depravity and Corruption of his nature; and in which he is always
        kept far below what he aims at, seeks and longs for. It was the saying
        of a good man, lately gone to his rest, whose extended pilgrimage was
        ninety-three years, that he must have been often swallowed up by
        despair, had it not been for the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the
        Romans. The best interpreter of many things in Scripture is spiritual
        experience; without it no right judgment can be formed. Hence it is that
        the learned often stumble at what is quite plain and obvious to the
        illiterate when spiritually enlightened. Critics sometimes find great
        difficulties in what is fully understood by a simpler minded Christian,
        taught from above. &#8220;Wayfaring men&#8221; are far better divines
        than any of the learned, who possess nothing more than natural talents
        and natural acquirements. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        &#8220;As the Apostle was far more enlightened and humble than
        Christians in general are, doubtless this clog (indwelling sin) was more
        uneasy to him than it is to them, though most of us find our lives at
        times greatly embittered by it. So that this energetic language, which
        many imagine to describe an unestablished believer&#8217;s experience,
        or even that of an unconverted man, seems to have resulted from the
        extraordinary degree of St. Paul&#8217;s sanctification, and the depth
        of his self-abasement and hatred of sin; and the reason of our not
        readily understanding him seems to be, because we are far beneath him in
        holiness, humility, acquaintance with the spirituality of God&#8217;s

        notice is that of our own version, and of Calvin, and it is that alone

        accounts here for the paradoxical statements which he had made, by
        mentioning the operation and working of two laws, which were directly
        contrary to one another. It seems to be a mistake that he alludes to
        <i>four</i> laws; for the law of the mind and the law of God are the
        same, under different names; it is that of the mind, because it belongs
        to and resides in the mind: and it is the law of God, because it comes
        from him, and is implanted by his Spirit. To the other law he also gives
        two names, the &#8220;law in his members,&#8221; and the &#8220;law of

        against it; and its proper place seems to be at the end of the fourth

        <i>Ca1vin</i> has, in his exposition of this verse, followed Chrysostom,
        and the same view has been taken by Beza, Grotius, Vitringa, Doddridge,
        Scott, and Chalmers. But Pareus, following Ambrose, has taken another
        view, which Haldane has strongly advocated, and with considerable power
        of reasoning, though, as some may perhaps think, unsuccessfully. The
        exposition is this, &#8212; &#8220;The law of the spirit of life&#8221;
        is the law of faith, or the gospel, which is the ministration of the
        Spirit; and &#8220;the spirit of life&#8221; means either the
        life-giving spirit, or the spirit which conveys the life which is in
        Christ Jesus. Then &#8220;the law of sin and death&#8221; is the moral
        law, so called because it discloses sin and denounces death. It is said
        that this view Corresponds with the &#8220;no condemnation&#8221; in the
        first verse, and with the word &#8220;law&#8221; in the verse which
        follows, which is no doubt the moral law, and with the truth which the
        verse exhibits. It is also added that freedom or deliverance from the
        law of sin, viewed as the power of sin, is inconsistent with the latter
        part of the former chapter; and that the law of faith, which through the
        Spirit conveys life, makes us free from the moral law as the condition
        of life, is the uniform teaching of Paul. &#8220;This freedom,&#8221;
        says Pareus, &#8220;is ascribed to God, to Christ, and to the Gospel,
        &#8212; to God as the author, </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450725&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 7:25, &#8212; to Christ as the mediator, &#8212; and to the

        Calvin<i> </i>is not singular in this rendering. Pareus<i> </i>and

        The beginning of this verse, though the general import of it is evident,
        does yet present some difficulties as to its construction. The clause,
        as given by Calvin, is, &#8220;Quod enim impossibile erat legi,&#8221;
        &#8212; </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"
        >to&lt; ga&lt;r ajdu&gt;naton ton no&gt;mou</font
      ><font
        >. Pareus supposes dia understood, &#8220;For on account of the
        impotency of the law,&#8221; etc. Stuart<i> </i>agrees with Erasmus and
        Luther<i> </i>and supplies the verb &#8220;did,&#8221; or accomplish,
        &#8212; &#8220;For what the law could not accomplish . . .God . . . .
        accomplished,&#8221; etc. But the simpler construction is, &#8220;For
        this,&#8221; (that is, freedom from the power of sin and death,
        mentioned in the former verse,) &#8220;<i>being </i>impossible for the
        law,&#8221; etc. It is instance of the nominative case absolute, which
        sometimes occurs in Hebrew. The possessive case, as Grotius says, has
        often the meaning of a dative after adjectives, as &#8220;malum
        hominis&#8221; is &#8220;<i>malum homini</i> &#8212; evil to man.&#8221;
        The </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;</font
      ><font> has sometimes the meaning of </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">touto</font
      ><font>; it is separated by </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font
      ><font> from the adjective. Some say that it is for </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[ti ga&lt;r</font
      ><font
        >, &#8220;Because it was impossible for the law,&#8221; etc. But changes
        of this kind are never satisfactory. The rendering of the whole verse
        may be made thus, &#8212;</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>3. </b>For this <i>being </i>impossible for the law, because it was
        weak through the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of
        sinful a flesh and on account of sin, has condemned sin in the
        flesh.</font
      ><br /><font
        >God sent his Son in that flesh which was polluted by sin, though his
        Son&#8217;s flesh,<i> i.e.</i> human nature, was sinless; and he sent
        him on account of that sin which reigned in human nature or flesh; and
        for this end &#8212; to condemn, <i>i.e</i>., to doom to ruin, to
        adjudge to destruction, the sin which ruled in the flesh, <i>i.e</i>. in
        human nature as fallen and Corrupted. This seems to e meaning. Then in
        the following verse the design of this condemnation of sin is stated
        &#8212; that the righteousness of the law, or what the law requires,
        might be done by us. Without freedom from the power of sin, no service
        can be done to God. It is the destruction of the power of sin, and not
        the removal of guilt, that is contemplated here throughout; the text of
        the whole passage is walking after the flesh and walking after the

        is used for a ruling power, for that which exercises authority and
        ensures obedience. &#8220;The law of sin,&#8221; is the ruling power of
        sin; &#8220;the law of the spirit of life,&#8221; is the power of the

        live in subjection to the flesh; as &#8220;walking after the
        Spirit&#8221; is to live in subjection to him. All these things have a

        Commentators are divided as to the meaning of this verse. This and the
        second verse seem to bear a relation in sense to one another; so that if
        the second verse refers to justification, this also refers to it; but if
        freedom from the
        <i>power </i>of sin and death be what is taught in the former verse, the
        actual or personal fulfillment of the law must be what is intended here.
        Some, such as<i> </i>Pareus and Venema, consider justification to be the
        subject of both verses; and others, such as Scott and Doddridge,
        consider it to be sanctification. But Beza, Chalmers, as well as Calvin,
        somewhat inconsistently, regard the second verse as speaking of freedom
        from the power or dominion of sin, and not from its guilt or
        condemnation, and this verse as speaking of the imputed righteousness of
        Christ, and not of that righteousness which believers are enabled to
        perform by the Spirit&#8217;s aid and influence. The verses seem so
        connected in the argument, that one of these two ideas must be held
        throughout.</font

        >There is nothing <i>decisive</i> in the wording of this verse, though
        the cast of the expressions seem more favorable to the idea entertained
        by Doddridge<i> </i>and Scott, and especially what follows in the
        context, where the work of the Spirit is exclusively spoken of. The word
        dikaiwma, is better rendered &#8220;righteousness&#8221; than
        &#8220;justification;&#8221; for &#8220;the righteousness to the
        law&#8221; means the righteousness which the law requires; and the words
        &#8220;might be fulfilled in us,&#8221; may, with equal propriety as to
        the <i>uses loquendi</i>, be rendered, might be performed by us.&#8221;

        >to&lt; fro&gt;nhma th~v sarko&lt;v</font
      ><font>
        is the abstract of &#8220;minding the things of the flesh,&#8221; in the
        preceding verse. The mindedness, rather than the minding of the flesh,
        would be most correct. But the phrase is no doubt Hebraistic, the
        adjective is put as a noun in the genitive case, so that its right
        version is, &#8220;The carnal mind;&#8221; and &#8220;mind&#8221; is to
        be taken in the wide sense of the verb, as including the whole soul,
        understanding, will, and affections. The phrase is thus given in the
        next verse in our version; and it is the most correct rendering. The
        mind of the flesh is its thoughts, desires, likings, and delight. This
        carnal mind is death,<i> i.e</i>., spiritual death now, leading to that
        which is eternal; or death, as being under condemnation, and producing
        wretchedness and misery; it is also enmity towards God, including in its
        very spirit hatred and antipathy to God. On the other hand, &#8220;the
        spiritual mind&#8221; is &#8220;life,&#8221; <i>i.e</i>., a divine life,
        a living principle of holiness, accompanied with &#8220;peace,&#8221;
        which is true happiness; or life by justification, and
        &#8220;peace&#8221; with God as the fruit of it.</font

        The <i>order </i>which the Apostle observes ought to be noticed. He

      ><font>Romans 8:5, or at the end of </font

      ><font
        >Romans 8:4, with two characters &#8212; the <i>carnal</i> and, the
        <i>spiritual</i>. He takes the <i>carnal</i> first, because it is the
        first as to us in order of time. And here he does not reverse the order,
        as he sometimes does, when the case admits it, but goes on first with
        the carnal man, and then, in </font

        Stuart attempts to evade this conclusion, but rather in an odd way. The
        whole amount, as he seems to say, of what the Apostle declares, is that
        this </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fro&gt;nhma sarko&gt;v</font
      ><font>
        <i>itself </i>is not subject, and cannot be, to the law of God; but
        whether the sinner who cherishes it &#8220;is actuated by other
        principles and motives,&#8221; the expression, he says, does not seem
        satisfactorily to determine. Hence he stigmatizes with the name of
        &#8220;metaphysical reasoning&#8221; the doctrine of man&#8217;s moral
        inability, without divine grace, to turn to God &#8212; a doctrine which
        Luther, Calvin, and our own Reformers equally maintained. The Apostle
        does not only speak abstractedly, but he applies what he advances to
        individuals, and concludes by saying, So then they that are in the flesh
        cannot please God.&#8221; Who and what can bring them out of this state?
        The influence of &#8220;other principles and motives,&#8221; or the
        grace of God? This is no metaphysical question, and the answer to it
        determines the point. Our other American brother, Barnes, seems also to
        deprecate this doctrine of moral inability, and makes distinctions to no
        purpose, attempting to separate the carnal mind from him in whom it
        exists, as though man could be in a neutral state, neither in the flesh
        nor in the Spirit. &#8220;It is an expression,&#8221; as our third
        American brother, Hodge, justly observes, &#8220;applied
        <i>to all</i> unrenewed persons, as those who are not in the flesh are

        There are mainly two explanations of this verse and the following, with
        some shades of difference. The one is given here; according to which
        &#8220;the body,&#8221; and &#8220;bodies,&#8221; are taken figuratively
        for nature Corrupted by sin; the &#8220;body,&#8221; as it is flesh, or
        Corrupted, is &#8220;dead,&#8221; is crucified, or doomed to die
        &#8220;on account of sin;&#8221; and this &#8220;body,&#8221; or these
        &#8220;bodies,&#8221; which are mortal, and especially so as to their
        Corruption, are to be quickened, revived, and made subservient to the
        will of God. It appears that this is essentially the view taken by
        Chrysostom, and also by Erasmus,<i> </i>Locke, Marckius, and by Stuart
        and<i> </i>Barnes. It is said that </font

        >The other explanation, adopted by Augustine, and also by Pareus,
        Vitringa, Turrettin, Doddridge, Scott, Chalmers, Haldane, and Hodge, is
        the following, &#8212; The &#8220;body,&#8221; and &#8220;bodies,&#8221;
        are to be taken literally, and the spirit, in the 10th verse, is the
        renewed man, or the renewed soul, which has or possesses
        &#8220;life&#8221; through the righteousness of Christ, or is made to
        enjoy life through the righteousness implanted by the Spirit. The
        meaning then is this, &#8220;The body is dead through sin, is doomed to
        die because of sin; but the spirit is life through righteousness, the
        soul renewed has life through Christ&#8217;s righteousness: but the
        dying body, now tabernacled by the Spirit, shall also be quickened and
        made immortal through the mighty power of the divine Spirit.&#8221; Thus
        salvation shall be complete when the &#8220;redemption of the
        body&#8221; shall come. See </font

        is the most consonant with the usual phraseology of Scripture, though
        the former seems the most suitable to the context. The subject evidently
        is the work of the Spirit in mortifying sin, and in bestowing and
        sustaining spiritual life. The inference in the next verse seems

        but under the gospel they are made children; and hence the privilege of
        calling God <i>Abba.</i> Haldane, quoting Claude, gives the same

        sentence, but in a different meaning. The Holy Spirit testifies to our

        the import of this text would be, that the Holy Spirit testifies,
        together with the spirit of adoption, to our spirit, to our soul or
        renewed mind, that we are the children of God. Thus a direct influence
        of the Spirit, in addition to that which is sanctifying and filial,
        seems to have been intended. See </font

        &#8220;The [Roman] Catholic Church, with which all sects that proceed
        from Pelagian principles agree, deters from the certainty of the state
        of grace, and desires uncertainty towards God. such uncertainty of
        <i>hearts</i> is then a convenient means to keep men in the
        leading-strings of the priesthood or ambitious founders of sects; for
        since they are not allowed to have any certainty themselves respecting
        their relation to God, they can only rest upon the judgments of their
        leaders about it, who thus rule souls with absolute dominion; the true
        evangelic doctrine makes free from such slavery to man. &#8212;

        meaning <i>for</i>, <i>because</i>, <i>therefore.</i> The context is our
        guide; when there is nothing previously said, for which a reason is
        given, then it has only an affirmative sense: or as some think, it is to
        be viewed as a particle of transition, or as signifying an addition, and
        may be rendered <i>besides</i>,<i> further</i>, moreoverse Perhaps this
        latter meaning would be suitable here. In the preceded verse the Apostle
        says, for the encouragement of Christians, that their conformity to
        Christ in suffering would terminate in conformity to him in glory: and
        then, as an additional consideration, he states his full conviction,
        that present sufferings are as nothing to the glory which they would
        have to enjoy. The connection can hardly be otherwise seen, except
        indeed we consider something understood, as, &#8220;Not only so;&#8221;

        The impropriety, which Calvin notices, is according to the usual
        phraseology of Scripture. What commences in this world and is completed
        the next is called by the same name. The word salvation is used in this
        way as designating its commencement and its progress as well as its
        completion. Besides, adoption here has a particular regard to the<i>

        When we are said to be saved by hope, the meaning is that we are not
        fully or perfectly saved now, and that this is what we hope for.

        but we hope for it.&#8221; There is present salvation, but that which is

        reference to those who would believe and obey the gospel. The verb is
        found only in this place, and in the following passages, </font

        means the same as elected; for the Apostle speaks of what God did
        &#8220;according to the election of grace,&#8221; and not according to
        foreseen faith.</font

      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup
      ><font

        God&#8217;s foreknowledge or foreordination, <i>because </i>of their
        obedience. This entirely subverts the gloss put on the verb in this
        passage.</font
      ><br /><font
        >The usual meaning given to the verb here is fore-approved, or chosen.
        Grotius, Turrettin, and others, consider that </font

        regarding with love and approbation. So the compound verb may be
        rendered here, &#8220;whom he fore-approved, or foreknew,&#8221; as the
        objects of his choice: and this idea is what alone comports with the
        rest of the passage.</font

        According to Poole, several of the Fathers entertained this opinion,
        such as Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Ambrose<i>:</i> but even<i
        > </i>Hammond<i> </i>and Grotius, great admirers of the Fathers, regard
        this love as that of God or of Christ to us. Wolfius says, that all the
        Lutheran divines give this exposition. It is indeed impossible rightly
        to view the whole passage without seeing that this explanation is the
        true one. In verse 32, it is incontestably evident that God&#8217;s love
        to us is what is spoken of: then in<sup> </sup>verse 37, it is expressly
        said, &#8220;through him who loved us;&#8221; and the last verse seems
        sufficient to remove every possible doubt. The difficulty of Barnes, in
        thinking it &#8220;not conceivable how afflictions should have any
        tendency to alienate Christ&#8217;s love <i>from us</i>,&#8221; arises
        from a misconception: for when we speak of not being separated from the
        love of Christ, the obvious meaning is, that nothing can separate us
        from participating in the effects of his love, that He, on account of
        his love, will sustain us under the greatest trials, and make &#8220;us
        more than conquerors.&#8221; The substance of what is here said, is
        contained in the last clause of </font

        calamities, he draws the inference, that God&#8217;s love is constant
        and most effectual, so that he is present with the distressed to give
        them courage, to strengthen their patience, and to moderate their
        calamities. See </font

        &#8220;death or life,&#8221; he ascends the invisible world, and
        mentions angels, then their combined powers, then the powers which do
        and may exist, then both heaven and hell, and, that he might include
        everything, except the uncreated God himself, he finishes with the

      ><br /><font
        >The whole passage is sublime in an extraordinary degree. The contrast

        weakness in himself, despised and trampled under foot by the world,
        triumphing over all existing, and all possible, and even impossible
        evils and opposition, having only this as his stay and support &#8212;
        that the God who has loved him, will never cease to love, keep, and
        defend him; yea, were everything created, everything except God himself,
        leagued against him and attempting his ruin. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        The connection seems to be this: he had been speaking of the impos
        sibility of separating God&#8217;s people from the protecting influence
        and pre serving power of his love; he had clearly shown, that no divorce
        or separa tion can take place through any possible circumstances. Then
        the Jews might say, &#8220;If this be true, then we are safe, we are
        still God&#8217;s people.&#8221; Hence he proceeds to remove this
        objection, and in order to prepare their mind to receive what he is
        going to say and to prove, he speaks first of his deep concern for their
        welfare: and then he resumes the doctrine he touched upon in Romans
        8:28, 29, and 30, and illustrates it by a reference to the past dealings
        of God with the Jews, and proves it by passages from the ancient
        Prophets. He shows that God&#8217;s people are the called according to
        his purpose, and not all who wear the outward sym bol of his covenant<i

        &#8212; I speak in Christ,&#8221; that is, as a Christian; to be in

        of the passage more than any other. It is as though he said,
        &#8220;Though I am in Christ or a Christian, yet I tell you this as the
        truth or the fact, and I have the testimony of conscience enlightened by
        the Spirit, that I have great grief and unceasing sorrow on your
        account.&#8221; The Jews had the impression that the Apostle, having
        become the follower of Christ, must have necessarily entertained hatred
        towards them, and must have therefore felt no concern for them; for this
        is really the case with all <i>real </i>apostates, that is, with those
        who leave the truth for error, but not with them who leave error for the
        truth. To obviate this impression seems to have been the object here.
        How the idea of an oath comports with what follows it is difficult to

        meaning of anathema; for while he was a Pharisee he deemed it a
        privilege and an honour even to persecute Christ. And we cannot suppose

        Archbishop Usher<i> </i>asks this question, &#8220;Did God, before he
        made man, .determine to save some and reject others?&#8221; To this he
        gives this answer, &#8212; &#8220;Yes, surely; before they had done
        either good or evil, God in his eter nal counsel set them apart.&#8221;
        It is the same sentiment that is announced here by Calvin<i>. </i>But to
        deduce it from what is said of Jacob and Esau, does not seem legitimate,
        inasmuch as they were in a fallen condition by nature, and the reference
        is evidently made to anything done person ally by themselves. Election
        and reprobation most clearly presuppose man as fallen and lost: it is
        hence indeed, that the words derive their meaning. That it was
        God&#8217;s eternal purpose to choose some of man&#8217;s fallen race,
        and to leave others to perish, is clearly taught us: but this is a
        different question from the one touched upon here, &#8212; that this
        purpose was irrespective of man&#8217;s fall, &#8212; a sentiment which,
        as far as I can see, is not recognised nor taught in Scripture. And not
        only Calvin<i>, </i>but many other divines, both before and after him,
        seem to have gone in this re spect somewhat beyond the limits of
        revelation; it is true, by a process of reasoning apparently obvious;
        but when we begin to reason on this high and mysterious subject, we
        become soon bewildered and lost in mazes of difficulties. &#8212;<i>

        Nothing can be conceived more conclusive in argument than what is
        contained here. The idea of foreseen works, as the reason or the ground
        of election, is wholly excluded. The choice is expressly denied to be on
        ac count of any works, and is as expressly ascribed to the sovereign
        will of God.</font
      ><br /><font
        >&#8220;He does not oppose <i>works </i>to <i>faith, </i>but to him who
        calls, or to the calling, which precedes faith, that is, to that calling
        which is according to God&#8217;s purpose. Paul means, that the
        difference between Jacob and Esau was made through the sole will and
        pleasure of God, not through their wills or works, existing or
        <i>foreseen.&#8221; &#8212; Poli. Syn.</i></font

        >Yet some of the Fathers, as Chrysostom<i> </i>and Theodoret<i>, </i>as

        this is reconcil-able with the argument of the Apostle, and with the
        instances he adduces, it is indeed a very hard matter to see. One way by
        which the Apostle&#8217;s argument is evaded, is, that the election here
        is to temporal and outward privileges. Be it so: let this be granted;
        but it is adduced by the Apostle as an illustration &#8212; and of what?
        most clearly of spiritual and eternal election. He refers both to the
        same principle, to the free choice of God, and not to anything in man.

        The meaning of the words &#8220;loving&#8221;<i> </i>and

      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejlee&gt;w</font
      ><font>
        is to be taken here in the sense of showing favour rather than mercy,
        according to the meaning of the Hebrew word; for the idea of mercy is
        what the other verb, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oijktei&gt;rw</font
      ><font
        ><i>, </i>conveys. Schleusner<i> </i>renders it here and in some other
        passages in this sense. The rendering then would be &#8212; &#8220;I
        will favour whom I favour,&#8221; that is, whom I choose to favour;
        &#8220;and I will pity whom I pity,&#8221; which means whom I choose to
        pity. The latter verb in both clauses is in Hebrew in the future tense,
        but rendered pro perly in Greek in the present,<i> </i>as it commonly
        expresses a present act. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font
      ><br /><sup><font color="Maroon">ft294</font></sup

        These two words clearly show that election regards man as fallen; for
        favour is what is shown to the undeserving, and mercy to the wretehed
        and miserable, so that the choice that is made is out of the corrupted
        mass of mankind, contemplated in that state, and not as in a state of
        innocency. Augustine<i> </i>says, &#8220;Deus alios facit vasa irae
        secundum meritus; alios vasa miserieordiae secundum gratiam &#8212; God
        makes some vessels of wrath accord~ ing to their merit; others vessels
        of mercy according to his grace.&#8221; In another place he says,
        &#8220;Deus ex eadem massa damnata originaliter, tan-quam figulus, fecit
        aliud vas ad honorem, aliud in contumeliam &#8212; God, as a potter,
        made of the same originally condemned mass, one vessel to honor, another
        to dishonor.&#8221; &#8220;Two sorts of vessels God forms out of the
        great lump of fallen mankind.&#8221; &#8212; Henry<i>.</i></font

        The terms &#8220;willing&#8221; and &#8220;running&#8221;<i> </i>are
        evidently derived from the circumstances connected with the history of
        Esau. &#8220;In<i> </i>vain,&#8221; says Turrettin<i>, &#8220;</i>did<i
        > </i>Esau seek the blessing. In vain did Isaac hasten to grant it, and
        in vain did Esau run to procure venison for his father; neither the
        father&#8217;s willingness nor the running of the son availed anything;
        God&#8217;s favour overruled the whole.&#8221; But the subject handled
        is God&#8217;s sovereignty in the manifestation of his favour and grace.
        Esau was but a type of the unbelieving Jews, when the gospel was
        proclaimed, and of thousands of such as are in name Christians. There is
        some sort of &#8220;willing,&#8221; and a great deal of
        &#8220;running,&#8221; and yet the blessing is not attained. There was
        much of apparent willing, and running in the strict formality and zeal
        of Pharisaism, and there is much of the same kind still in the
        austerities and mechanical worship of superstition, and also in the
        toils and devotions of self-righteousness. The word or the revealed will
        of God is in all these instances misunderstood and neglected.</font

        >Isaac&#8217;s &#8220;willingness&#8221; to give the blessing to Esau,
        notwithstanding the announcement made at his birth, and Rebecca&#8217;s
        conduct in securing it to Jacob, are singular instances of man&#8217;s
        imperfections, and of the overruling power of God. Isaac acted as though
        he had forgotten what God had expressed as his will; and Rebecca acted
        as though God could not effect his purpose without her interference, and
        an interference, too, in a way highly improper and sinful. It was the
        trial of faith, and the faith of both halted exceedingly; yet the
        purpose of God was still fulfilled, but the improper manner in which it
        was fulfilled was afterwards visited with God&#8217;s displeasure.

        alive in the midst of them. We hence see the reason why Paul changed the
        verb; for &#8220;preserve,&#8221; used by the <i>Septuagint, </i>did not
        fully express the meaning; but to &#8220;raise <i>up,&#8221; </i>as it

        Much has been unnecessarily written on this subject of
        <i>hardening. </i>Pharaoh is several times said to have hardened his own
        heart, and God is said also several times to have hardened him too. The
        Scripture in many instances makes no minute distinctions, for these may
        be easily gathered from the general tenor of its teaching. God is in his
        nature holy, and therefore hardening as his act cannot be sinful: and as
        he is holy, he hates sin and punishes it; and for this purpose he
        employs wicked men, and even Satan himself, as in the case of Ahab. As a
        punishment, he affords occasions and opportunities to the obstinate even
        to increase their sins, and thus in an indirect way hardens them in
        their rebellion and resistance to his will; and this was exactly the
        case with Pharaoh. This, as Calvin<i> </i>says, was the operation or
        working of his wrath. The history of Pharaoh is a sufficient explanation
        of what is said here. He was a cruel tyrant and oppressor; and God in
        his first message to Moses said, &#8220;I am sure that the king of Egypt
        will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.&#8221; God might indeed
        have softened his heart and disposed him to allow them to depart: but it
        pleased him to act otherwise, and to manifest his power and his
        greatness in another way: so that &#8220;whom he wills, he favours, and
        whom he wills, he hardens;&#8221; and for reasons known only to
        himself.</font

        The metaphor in these verses is doubtless to be interpreted according to
        the context. Not only Calvin<i>, </i>but many others, have deduced from

        the necessary explanation. By the&#8221; mass&#8221; or the lump of day,
        is not meant mankind, contemplated as creatures, but as fallen
        creatures; or, as Augustine<i> </i>and Pareus<i> </i>call them,
        &#8220;massa damnata &#8212; the condemned mass;&#8221; for they are
        called in the next verse <i>vessels of wrath, </i>that is, the objects

        only in one instance from the Hebrew; &#8220;seed&#8221; is put for

        There seems to be no necessity for this transposition. &#8220;A law (not
        the law) of righteousness&#8221; means a law which prescribes
        righteousness, and which, if done, would have conferred righteousness.
        But the Jews following this did not attain to a law of righteousness,
        such a law as se cured righteousness. The Apostle often uses the same
        words in the same verse in a different sense, and leaves the meaning to
        be made out by the context. Grotius<i> </i>takes &#8220;law&#8221; as
        meaning way, &#8220;They followed the way of righteousness, but did not
        attain to a way of righteousness.&#8221;</font

        falsehood, as there may be zeal for error and false doctrine as well as
        for that which is true; 2. That we may understand the comparative
        <i>importance</i> of things, so as not to make much of what is little,
        and make little account of what is great; 3. That we may prosecute and
        defend the truth in the <i>right way</i>, with prudence, firmness,
        fidelity, and meekness; 4. That our zeal may have the
        <i>right object</i>, not our own interest and reputation, but the glory

        >The meaning of the word depend on what is connected with it. The end of
        <i>evils</i>, or of life, is their termination; the end of a
        <i>promise</i> is its fulfillment; the end of a <i>command</i>, its
        performance or obedience; the end of <i>faith</i> is salvation. In such
        instances, the general idea is the result, or the effect, or the
        consequence. Now the law may be viewed as an economy, comprising the
        whole Jewish law, not perfect, but introductory; in this view Christ may
        be said to be its end &#8212; its perfection or &#8220;its landing
        place.&#8221; But we may also regard the law in its moral character, as
        the rule and condition of life; then the end of the law is its
        fulfillment, the performance of what it requires to attain life: and
        Christ in this respect is its end, having rendered to it perfect
        obedience. This last meaning is most consistent with the words which
        follow, and with the Apostle&#8217;s argument. The first view is taken
        by Chrysostom, Beza, Turrettin, as well as Calvin; the second, by Mede<i
          >, </i
        >Stuart<i>, </i>and Chalmers. There is really not much difference in the
        two views; only the sequel of the verse, &#8220;for righteousness to
        every one who believes,&#8221; and the opposite sentiment in the next
        verse, &#8220;the man who doeth these shall live in (or through)
        them,&#8221; seem to favor the latter view. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        It seems not necessary to have recourse to the distinctions made in the
        foregoing section. The character of the quotation given is correctly
        described in the words of Chrysostom, as quoted by Poole, &#8220;Paulus
        ea transtulit et aptavit ad jusitiam fidei &#8212; Paul transferred and
        accommodated these things to the righteousness of faith.&#8221; He
        evidently borrowed the words of Moses, not literally, but substantially,
        for the purpose of setting forth the truth he was handling. The speaker
        is not Moses, but &#8220;the righteousness of faith,&#8221; represented
        as a person. Luther, as quoted by Wolfius, says, that &#8220;Paul, under
        the influence of the Spirit, took from Moses the occasion to form, as it
        were, a new and a suitable text against the justiciaries.&#8221; It
        appears to be an application, by way of analogy, of the words of Moses
        to the gospel; but Pareus, Wolfius, Turrettin, and Doddridge, consider
        the words as applied by way of accommodation. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        It is &#8220;the word&#8221; which requires &#8220;faith,&#8221; and is
        received by faith; or it is the word entitled to faith, worthy of being
        believed; or it is the word which generates and supports faith.

        exuberance of things, and here, of gifts and blessings, of mercy and
        grace to pardon, to cleanse, and to endow with spiritual privileges.

        from the <i>Septuagint</i>, when that version materially departs from
        the Hebrew, as is the case here. Though it appears to be a version of
        his own, he yet gives not the original literally, but accommodates it to
        his own purpose: he leaves out &#8220;on the mountains,&#8221; and
        adopts the plural number instead of the singular, both as to the
        participle &#8220;announcing&#8221; or evangelizing, and as to the word
        &#8220;good.&#8221; The words peace, good, and salvation, in Hebrew,

        Intepreters have been very much at a loss to account for this
        difference. The Apostle adopts the rendering of the <i>Septuagint</i>,
        as though the Hebrew word had been </font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lwq</font
      ><font
        >. Though there is no copy, yet consulted, that favors this reading, it
        is yet the probable one; not only because the Apostle sanctions it, but
        it is what the context demands, and especially the parallelism which
        prevails in Hebrew poetry. In the next line &#8220;words&#8221; are
        mentioned, and &#8220;voice&#8221; here would be the most suitable
        corresponding term. But we may go back to the preceding distich, and
        find not only a confirmation of this, but also an instance of terms
        being used in the same passage in different senses, while yet the
        meaning is obvious to a common reader, and at the same time intricate
        and puzzling to a critic. The two distichs may be thus rendered,
        &#8212;</font
      ><br /><font><b>4.</b> Without speech, and without words!</font
      ><br /><font>Not heard is their voice! &#8212;</font><br /><font

      ><br /><font
        >They have no words, and yet they have words; they have no voice, and
        yet they have a voice. Here the first and the last line Correspond, and
        the second and the third. There is indeed a different term used for
        &#8220;words&#8221; in the last line from that which is adopted in the
        first, but in the first there are two, &#8220;speech,&#8221; </font

        is according to the Hebrew, with the exception of the last word, which
        from its form, the last radical letter being doubled, can hardly be
        expressed in another language by a single term, and so the
        <i>Septuagint</i> has employed two. It means &#8220;revolting again and
        again,&#8221; or willfully revolting. The simple verb </font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rs</font

        reduplicate form, as here, it means either a repeated or an obstinate

        reiterated and perverse, as their history abundantly testifies.

        That foreknowledge here includes election or predestination, as
        Augustine maintains, is evident from what follows in verse 5, where
        &#8220;the remnant&#8221; is said to be reserved &#8220;according to the
        election of grace,&#8221; or gratuitous election. If it be gratuitous,
        then it cannot be according to any foreseen works: and works are

      ><font
        >Romans 11:6. Were it otherwise, were foreseen works the ground of
        election, there would be no suitableness nor congruity in such terms as
        foreknowledge and election on the subject. It would have been much more
        appropriate in this case for the Apostle to say, &#8220;God will receive
        every Jew who will render himself worthy by his works.&#8221; On this
        supposition there was no necessity for him to go back to election to
        remove the objection which he had stated; he had only to refer to the
        terms of the gospel, which regard Jews and Gentiles without any
        difference. But instead of doing this, which <i>seems</i> adequate to
        the purpose, he gives an answer by referring to the foreknowledge and
        free election of God. There is no way to account for this, except by
        admitting, that election is an efficacious purpose which secures the
        salvation of those who are its objects, who have been chosen in Christ
        before the foundation of the world. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        The last half of this verse is considered spurious by Griesbach, being

        The foregoing reasoning is not satisfactory: it goes beyond the evident
        meaning of the Apostle. He no doubt quoted the texts according to their
        original design, and to say he did not is to assert what is incapable of
        being proved, and what is even contrary to the Apostle&#8217;s reasoning
        throughout. The hardening or blinding spoken of by the Prophets, is
        stated uniformly as a punishment for previous unbelief and impenitence,
        as admitted by our author himself, and the obvious fact as to the Jews
        in the Apostle&#8217;s days, was an evidence of the same, and though he
        states not this fact here, he states it in the sequel of this Epistle.
        But why some were hardened, and others were softened, is what must be
        resolved altogether to the will of God. This, and no more than this, is
        what the Apostle evidently teaches here: and it is neither wise nor
        right to go beyond what is expressly taught, especially on a subject of
        a nature so mysterious and incomprehensible. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        Grotius understands by &#8220;table&#8221; guests, or friends, who
        partake of the provisions spread on the table. The wish is, that these
        should be a snare, etc. &#8220;Table,&#8221; according to Pareus, means
        luxury or festivity: and he adds, that there are here three metaphors,
        &#8212; the ensnaring of birds &#8212; the entrapping of wild beasts
        &#8212; and the stumbling in the dark, or that of blind men. Then the
        recompense or retaliation implies, that this evil of being ensnared and
        entrapped, and of stumbling, are only just retaliations for similar acts
        on their part; as they had ensnared, entrapped, and caused others to
        stumble, it was but just that they should be treated in the same way.
        And if we take &#8220;table&#8221; as a metonymy for friends or guests,
        the meaning would be very striking. And we know that the very friends
        and confederates of the Jews became their enemies and effected their

        This is not quite correct: the first part is a mere announcement of a
        fact &#8212; the fall of the Jews; and then in what follows, according
        to the usual style of Scripture, the same thing is stated in other

        to be suitable &#8212; the diminution and the completion. The reason for
        the restatement of the first clause seems to be this, &#8212; that the

        Apostle, which is to express the same thing in two ways, or by two

        That the holiness here mentioned is external and relative, and not
        personal and inward, is evident from the whole context. The children of
        Israel were denominated holy in all their wickedness and disobedience,
        because they had been consecrated to God, adopted as his people, and set
        apart for his service, and they enjoyed all the external privileges of
        the covenant which God had made with their fathers.</font

        their offspring and what does not pass. In the present case the rights
        and privileges of the covenant were transmitted, but not faith and
        inward holiness. &#8220;Often,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the worst descend
        from the best, and the best from the worst; from wicked Ahaz sprang good
        Hezekiah, from Hezekiah descended impious Manasse, from Manasse again
        came good Josiah, and from Josiah sprang wicked sons, Shallum and
        Jehoiakim.&#8221; But all were alike holy in the sense intended here by
        the Apostle, as they were circumcised, and inherited the transmissible
        rights and privileges of the covenant.</font

        >&#8220;The holiness,&#8221; says Turrettin, &#8220;of the first-fruits

        exclusively meant. . . . Abraham was as it were the root of the visible
        Church. Ishmael was broken off, and the tree grew up in Isaac; and when
        Esau was broken off, it grew up in Jacob and his sons. . . . When the
        nation rejected the Messiah, their relation to Abraham and to God was as
        it were suspended. They no longer retained even the outward seal of the
        covenant; for circumcision lost its validity and baptism became the sign
        of regeneration: they were thenceforth deprived of the ordinances of

        thou hast been ingrafted for them,&#8221; or in their stead; that of
        Beza and Pareus is the same, and also that of Macknight; but Grotius has
        &#8220;inter illos &#8212; between them,&#8221; that is, the remaining
        branches; and Doddridge renders the words &#8220;among them,&#8221;
        according to our version. What is most consonant with the first part of
        the verse, is the rendering of Calvin; what is stated is the cutting off
        of some of the branches, and the most obvious meaning is, that others
        were put in for them, or in their stead. It has been said, that it was
        not the practice to graft a wild olive in a good olive, except when the
        latter was decaying. such may have been the case; but the
        Apostle&#8217;s object was no so much to refer to what was usual, as to
        form a comparison suitable to his purpose; and this is what our Savior
        in his parables had sometimes done. Contrary to what the case is in
        nature, the Apostle makes the stock good and the graft bad, and makes
        the stock to communicate its goodness to the graft and to improve the
        quality of its fruit. But his main object is to show the fact of
        incision, without any regard to the character of the stock and of the
        graft in natural things; for both <i>his</i> stock and <i>his </i>graft

        Some have deduced from what Paul says here the uncertainty of faith, and
        its possible failure. This has been done through an entire
        misapprehension of the subject handled by the Apostle. He speaks not of
        individuals, but of the Gentile world, not of living faith but of
        professed faith, not the inward change, but of outward privileges, not
        of the union of the soul to Christ, but of union with his Church. The
        two things are wholly different; and to draw an argument from the one to
        the other is altogether illegitimate; that is to say, that as professed
        faith may be lost, therefore living faith may be lost.</font

        The mystery is accounted for in rather a singular way. The most obvious

        the manner of it. No doubt the word sometimes means what is obscure,
        sublime, or profound, as &#8220;great is the mystery of

        The explanation of this verse is by no means satisfactory. It does not
        Correspond at all with what the Apostle has already declared in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451111&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 11:11,12, and 15; where the restoration of the Jews to the faith
        is most clearly set forth. Besides, by making Israel, in the next verse,
        to mean generally the people of God, the contrast, observable through
        the whole argument, is completely destroyed.</font
      ><br /><font>The word for &#8220;blindness&#8221; is </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pw&gt;rwsiv</font
      ><font
        >, hardness, callousness, and hence contumacy. &#8220;In part,&#8221; is
        generally regarded as having reference both to extent and duration: the
        hardness did not extend to all the Jews, and it was not to endure, but
        to continue for a time; and the time is mentioned, &#8220;until the
        fullness of the Gentiles come in.&#8221; This is obviously the meaning,
        and confirmed by the whole context. The attempt of Grotius and Hammond,
        and of some of the Fathers, to confine what is said to the Apostolic
        times, is wholly irreconcilable with the drift of the whole passage and
        with facts.</font
      ><br /><font>Much as been written on the words, </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"
        >a]criv ou+ to&lt; plh&gt;rwma tw~n ejqnw~n eijse&gt;lqh|</font
      ><font
        >. That the event was future in the Apostle&#8217;s time, (and future
        still as history proves) is evident, especially from the following
        verse, &#8220;and so all Israel shall be saved.&#8221; The plain
        construction of the passage is, &#8220;until the fullness of the
        Gentiles shall come.&#8221; What this &#8220;fullness&#8221; is to be
        has been much controverted. But by taking a view of the whole context,
        without regard to any hypothesis, we shall, with no great difficulty,
        ascertain its meaning. The &#8220;fullness&#8221; of the Jews in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451112&gt;</font></sup
      ><font>Romans 11:12, is determined by </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451126&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 11:26; it includes the whole nation. Then the &#8220;fullness of
        the Gentiles&#8221; must mean the same thing, the introduction of all
        nations into the Church. The grafting more particularly signifies
        profession. It then follows that all nations shall be brought publicly
        to profess the gospel prior to the removal of the hardness from the
        whole nation of the Jews. There may be isolated cases of conversion
        before this event, for &#8220;in part&#8221; as to extent the hardness
        is to be: but all shall not be brought to the faith, until the faith
        spread through the whole world: and the effect of their restoration will
        be a great revival of vital religion among the professing Gentiles,
        according to what is said in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451115&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 11:15. This is clearly the view presented to us in this
        extraordinary passage, when all its parts are compared with each
        other.</font
      ><br /><font
        >Hammond<i> </i>tells us, that many of the Fathers wholly denied the
        future restoration of the Jews, and we are told by Pareus<i>, </i>who
        mentions some of the same Fathers, that they maintained it. But it
        appears from the quotations made by the first, that the restoration
        disallowed was that to their own land, and that the restoration referred
        to by the latter was restoration to the faith; two things wholly
        distinct. That &#8220;Israel&#8221; means exclusively the Jewish nation,
        was almost the unanimous opinion of the Fathers, according to Estius;
        and that their future restoration to the faith is here foretold was the
        sentiment held by Beza, Pareus, <i>Willet</i>, Mede, and others, and is
        generally held by modern divines. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        There is more discrepancy in this reference than any we have met with.
        The Apostle follows not literally either the Hebrew or the Septuagint,
        though the latter more than the former. In the Hebrew, it is, &#8220;to
        Sion,&#8221; </font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;wyxl</font
      ><font>, and in the Septuagint, &#8220;for the sake of Sion,&#8221; </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e[neken Siw&gt;n</font
      ><font
        >. Then the following clause is given verbatim from the
        <i>Septuagint</i>, and differs materially from the Hebrew, at least as
        translated in our version. The Syriac and Chaldee give the verb a
        causative meaning, so as to make the sense the same as here. But it may
        be regarded as an infinitive with a pargogic </font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">y</font
      ><font>, and in a transitive sense, which it sometimes has. See </font

        Our common version departs here from the original by connecting

        shown to you, or the mercy of which you are the objects. &#8212;<i>

        Luther, &#8212; to the gospel, says Pareus, &#8212; to God, says Mede
        and Stuart. The parallel in the next clause, &#8220;beloved,&#8221;
        favors the last sentiment. They were become God&#8217;s enemies, and
        alienated through their rejection of the gospel; but they were still
        regarded as descendants of the Fathers and in some sense on their
        account &#8220;beloved,&#8221; as those for whom God entertained love,

        It is not desirable to amalgamate words in this manner; nor is it
        necessary. The Apostle ascends; he mentions first the
        &#8220;gifts,&#8221; the free promises which God made to the Jews; and
        then he refers to the origin of them, the calling or the election of
        God, and says that both are irreversible, or, as
        <i>Castellio</i> well explains the word </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajmetame&gt;lhta</font

        >Calvin seems to regard &#8220;the gifts and calling&#8221; as having

        often fails, but the internal, made by the Spirit, and every
        efficacious, of which the Apostle had spoken, when he said, &#8220;Those
        whom he has predestinated, he has called, justified, and
        glorified.&#8221; according to this view the Apostle must be considered

        they may be suspended, they shall yet be made evident at the appointed
        time; so that what secures and renders certain the restoration of the

        long season be in a degenerated state, God will yet, in his own

        then knowledge, which in point of order precedes it. Then in the

        states first what belongs to knowledge &#8212; &#8220;judgments,&#8221;
        decisions, divine decrees, such as knowledge determines; and then
        &#8220;ways,&#8221; actual proceedings, for the guiding of which wisdom

        other,&#8221; Doddridge; &#8220;Be of the same disposition towards one
        another,&#8221; Macknight. The verb means to think, or to feel, or to
        mind, in the sense of attending to, or aspiring after a thing. It is
        used also in the next clause, evidently in the last sense,
        <i>minding</i>. There is no reason why its meaning should be different
        here; it would then be, &#8220;Mind the same things towards one
        another,&#8221; that is, Do to others what you expect others to do to
        you. It is to reduce to an axiom what is contained in the former verse.

        one another,&#8221; that is, sympathize with one another: and this would

        no instance of the expression, &#8220;to give place,&#8221; having this

        patiently to endure the wrath of the man who does the wrong. Some have
        maintained that the meaning is, that the injured man is to give place to
        his own wrath, that is, allow it time to cool: but this view comports
        not with the passage. The subject is, that a Christian is not to
        retaliate, or to return wrath for wrath, but to endure the wrath of his
        enemy, and to leave the matter in the hand of God. With this sense the
        quotation accords as much as with that given by Calvin. Not a few have
        taken this view, Basil, Ambrose, Drusius, Mede, Doddridge, Scott, etc.

        Calvin<i> </i>has in this exposition followed Chrysostom and Theodoret.
        The former part no doubt contains the right view; the following verse
        proves it, &#8220;Overcome evil with good.&#8221; The idea of
        &#8220;heaping coals of fire&#8221; is said to have been derived from
        the practice of heaping coals on the fire to melt hard metals; but as
        &#8220;the coals of fire&#8221; must mean &#8220;burning coals,&#8221;

        producing strong effects. such is represented to be kindness to any
        enemy, to feed him when hungry and to give him drink when thirsty, has
        commonly such a power over him that he cannot resist its influence, no
        more than he can withstand the scorching heat of burning coals. Of
        course the natural tendency of such a conduct is all that is intended,
        and not that it invariably produces such an effect; for in Scripture
        things are often stated in this way; but human nature is such a strange

        Grotius qualifies this obedience by saying, that it should not extend to
        what is contrary to the will of God. But it is remarkable, that often in
        Scripture things are stated broadly and without any qualifying terms,
        and yet they have limits, as it is clear from other portions. This
        peculiarity is worthy of notice. Power is from God, the abuse of power
        is from what is evil in men. The Apostle throughout refers only to power
        justly exercised. He does not enter into the subject of tyranny and
        oppression. And this is probably the reason why he does not set limits
        to the obedience required: he contemplated no other than the proper and
        legitimate use of power. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        a new subject of exhortation, as Calvin says, and the words must be
        rendered as he proposes, or be viewed as elliptical; the word &#8220;I

        The case is the same with the two preceding instances; the vice which
        seems to follow is placed first. Revelling is first mentioned, though

        concubinage, or indulgence in unlawful lusts is first stated, though
        lasciviousness or wantonness is the source from which it proceeds. It is

        Many have explained &#8220;the putting on&#8221; here in a manner wholly
        inconsistent with the passage, as though the putting on of
        Christ&#8217;s righteousness was intended. Calvin keeps to what accords
        with the context, the putting on of Christ as to his holy image.
        Sanctification, and not justification, is the subject of the passage. To
        put on Christ, then, is to put on his virtues and graces, to put on or
        be endued with his spirit, to imitate his conduct and to copy his
        example. This is in addition to the putting him on as our righteousness,
        and not as a substitute for it. Both are necessary: for Christ is our
        sanctification, the author, worker, and example of it, as well as our
        righteousness. &#8212;<i> Ed.</i></font

        Some, as Haldane, have found fault with this classification, as there is
        nothing in the chapter which countenances it. But as the Apostle&#8217;s
        object throughout the epistle was to reconcile the Jews and Gentiles,
        there is reason sufficient to regard them as the two parties here
        intended: and, as Chalmers justly observes, it is more probable that the
        Gentiles were the despisers, inasmuch as the Jews, who, like Paul, had
        got over their prejudices, were no doubt disposed to sympathize with
        their brethren, who were still held fast by them. &#8212;<i>

        real Christians; nor did St. Paul, by an express decision and command,

        certain and important truth; yet a man cannot receive it without due
        preparation of mind and heart; &#8212; so that a compelled assent to any
        doctrine, or conformity to any outward observances, without conviction,

        the rights and existence of private judgment, in all possible cases, to

        This is true, but the passage here seems not to require such a
        construction. Both sentences are declarative, announcing a fact

        it is not likely that abstinence, arising from such an absurd notion,
        would have been thus treated by the Apostle. It indeed appears evident,
        that the abstinence here referred to did arise from what was regarded to
        be the will of God: and though abstinence from all animal food was not
        enjoined on the Jews, yet it appears from history that Jews, living
        among heathens, wholly abstained, owing to the fear they had of being in

        The last clause is by Haldane confined to the strong, and he object to

        his view, for the weak, the condemner, is the person reproved, and
        therefore the strong is he who to his own master stands or falls. The

        From the words &#8220;destroy not,&#8221; etc., some have deduced the

        neither wise nor just to draw a conclusion of this kind; for it is one
        that is negatived by many positive declarations of Scripture.
        Man&#8217;s inference, when contrary to God&#8217;s word, cannot be
        right. Besides, the Apostle&#8217;s object in this passage is clearly
        this, &#8212; to exhibit the <i>sin</i> of those who disregarded without
        saying that it actually effected that evil. Some have very unwisely
        attempted to obviate the inference above mentioned, by suggesting, that
        the destruction meant was that of comfort and edification. But no doubt
        the Apostle meant the ruin of the soul; hence the urgency of his
        exhortation, &#8212; &#8220;Do not act in such a way as tends to
        endanger the safety of a soul for whom Christ has shed his blood;&#8221;
        or, &#8220;Destroy not,&#8221; that is, as far as you can do so.
        Apostles and ministers are said to &#8220;save&#8221; men; some are
        exhorted here not to &#8220;destroy&#8221; them. Neither of these
        effects can follow, except in the first instance, God grants his

        What is here said is no doubt true of the kingdom of God; but by
        considering what is afterwards said in the two following verses, we
        cannot well accede to this exposition. Righteousness, peace, and joy,
        mentioned here, are things acceptable to God and <i>approved by men</i>:
        they must then be things apparent and visible, which men see and
        observe; and to follow &#8220;the things of peace,&#8221; refers to the
        conduct. &#8220;Righteousness&#8221; then must mean here the doing of
        what is right and just towards one another; &#8220;peace,&#8221;
        concordand unanimity, as opposed to discord and contentions;
        &#8220;joy,&#8221; the fruit of this peaceable state, a cheering
        delight, a mutual rejoicing, instead of the sorrow and grief occasioned
        by discord; and these come &#8220;through the Holy Spirit&#8221; and are
        produced by him; and they are not the semblances of such virtues and

        is given here to the former word. The Apostle still adopts, as it were,
        the ascending scale. He first mentions the most obvious effect, the
        actual fall, the extreme evil, and then the next to it, the obstacle in
        the way; and, in the third place, the weakening of the faith of the
        individual. The real order of the process is the reverse, &#8212; the
        weakening, then the impediment, and, lastly, the stumblingblock which

        had &#8220;faith,&#8221; who believed all meats lawful. The verb means
        to try, to examine, as well as to approve; but the latter seems to be
        its meaning here. To approve and to have faith appears in this case to
        be the same: then to have faith and not to abuse it by giving offense to
        a brother was to be a happy man, who did not condemn himself. The
        meaning then most suitable to the passage is this, &#8220;Happy the man!
        who condemns not himself by what he approves,&#8221; that is, by eating

        25-27. It appears that the largest number of copies is in favor of this
        arrangement, countenanced by the Greek fathers, and the Syriac and
        Arabic versions. In favor of the present order, as in our version, there
        are some good MSS., the Latin fathers, and the Vulgate, etc. What
        strongly favors and decidedly confirms the order which we have, is the

        There is a difference of opinion as to the unity contemplated here,
        whether it be that of sentiment or of feeling. The phrase, </font

      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fronei~n</font
      ><font>
        may admit of these three significations, yet the Apostle no doubt had in
        view a specific idea; and when we consider that he had been inculcating
        the principle of toleration as to unity of sentiment with regard to the
        eating of meats and of observing of days, and that he has been enforcing
        the duty of forbearance, and of sympathy, and of love towards each
        other, it appears probable that unity of feeling and of concern for each
        other&#8217;s welfare is what is intended here. Beza, Scott, and
        Chalmers take this view, while Pareus, Mede, and Stuart take the other,
        that is, that unity of sentiment is what is meant.</font

        The construction of this first sentence is differently viewed. Grotius
        and Stuart connect it with &#8220;I say&#8221; at the beginning of the
        former verse; but Beza and Pareus connect it with the last clause, and
        consider </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv to&lt;</font
      ><font>
        as being here understood: and this seems to be the best construction.
        Christ became the minister of the circumcision, a minister under the
        Abrahamic economy, for two objects, &#8212; that he might confirm the
        promises made to the Fathers, &#8212; and that the Gentiles might
        glorify God for his mercy. Mercy was destined to come to the Gentiles
        through the covenant made with Abraham, of which circumcision was the
        sign and seal. The promise, &#8220;In thee shall the nations of the
        earth be blessed,&#8221; was made to Abraham, and not to the Gentiles.
        Hence it is called &#8220;mercy&#8221; to them, there being to previous
        promise made distinctly <i>to them</i>, while the same mercy as to the
        Jews is called &#8220;truth,&#8221; because it was the fulfillment of a
        promise. A remarkable instance of this difference, noticed by Haldane,
        is found in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;330720&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Micah 7:20. What is said to be &#8220;mercy&#8221; to Abraham, to whom
        the promise was first made, is said to be &#8220;truth&#8221; to Jacob,
        to whom it was confirmed. It may also, by the way, be observed, that
        this verse in Micah affords an example of what we often find in
        Paul&#8217;s style; for in mentioning two or more things, he often
        reverses the regular order. What Micah mentions first is
        &#8220;truth&#8221; to Jacob, and then he goes back to God&#8217;s
        &#8220;mercy&#8221; to Abraham.</font

        the Septuagint. The difference, as noticed by Calvin, between the words
        as given in Hebrew, is considerable. The language of the Prophet is
        metaphorical, the Septuagint interpreted it, and this interpretation the
        Apostle approved and adopted. The Messiah is represented by the Prophet
        as a general or a leader of an army, raising his banner for the nations,
        (</font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ym[</font

        This is the view approved by Theophylact, Beza, Grotius, Mede, and
        Hammond: but Doddridge, Scott, Stuart, and Chalmers<i> </i>consider
        &#8220;peace&#8221; here to be that with God, and &#8220;joy&#8221; as
        its accompaniment; while Pareus and Hodge view both as included,
        especially the latter. If we consider the subject in hand, that the
        Apostle was attempting to produce union and concord between the Jews and
        the Gentiles, we shall see reason to accede to Calvin<i>&#8217;s</i>
        explanations. This joy and peace seem to be the same as in </font
      ><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451417&gt;</font></sup
      ><font
        >Romans 14:17. Concord, union, and mutual enjoyment, are graces which
        come by believing, or by faith, as well as concord or peace with God,
        and its accompanying joy; and these graces have no doubt an influence on
        hope, so as to make it brighter and stronger, when they are produced by
        the Holy Spirit. There are three things which distinguish these graces
        from such as are fictitious, &#8212; they proceed from faith, &#8212;
        they increase hope, &#8212; they are produced by the Spirit. &#8212;<i>

        that is, not fully, which seems to have no meaning consistently with the
        evident tenor of the passage. Others, as Chrysostom, Erasmus, and
        Pareus, connect the words with the adjective, &#8220;I have in part (or
        somewhat) more boldly (or more freely, or more confidently) written to
        you.&#8221; Macknight connects them with the following clause,

        Beza and Pareus; &#8220;docens sacrum evangelium &#8212; teaching the
        holy gospel,&#8221; Vatablus. The verb means to &#8220;perform sacred
        rites,&#8221; or to officiate in holy things. It has no connection, as
        some think, with a sacrificing priest; indeed </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">iJereu&lt;v</font
      ><font>
        itself, that is a priest, is a holy person, who did sacrifice no doubt
        among other things, but the word does not import a sacrificer any more
        than </font
      ><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;hk</font
      ><font>
        in Hebrew. The word here does not mean to consecrate, or to sanctify, or
        to sacrifice, but to discharge a holy function. Perhaps the most literal
        rendering would be &#8220;performing a holy office as to the
        gospel,&#8221; but dispensing, administering, or preaching the gospel
        would be the best version. The Apostle had previously called himself </font
      ><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">leitourgo&lt;n</font
      ><font
        >, a public functionary, a public minister of Jesus Christ; he now
        designates his work as such, being a sacred administrator of the gospel,
        and then he states the object, that the offering of the Gentiles, that
        is, that the Gentiles being offered, might be an acceptable sacrifice to
        God, sanctified by the Spirit. See </font

        Some, as Beza and Grotius, understand by the last clause, &#8220;through
        the power of the Spirit of God,&#8221; the internal power of speaking
        with tongues, etc., and by &#8220;signs and wonders,&#8221; the external
        work of healing the sick, etc. But this passage is evidently an instance
        of the Apostle&#8217;s usual mode of stating things. &#8220;Word&#8221;
        means preaching; and &#8220;work,&#8221; the doing of miracles. He first
        specifies the last, the work was that of &#8220;signs and
        wonders;&#8221; and then he mentions what belongs to the first, and
        shows how it became effectual, that is, through the power of the Spirit.

        words, &#8220;and by the Spirit of our God.&#8221; &#8220;Signs and
        wonders&#8221; are often mentioned together: they designate the same
        things by different names: miracles were called &#8220;signs,&#8221;
        because they were evidences of divine power, and they were called
        &#8220;wonders,&#8221; or prodigies, because they were not according to
        the course of nature, but were extraordinary things. By these words

        On this subject Wolfius says, &#8220;Paul&#8217;s journey to Spain we
        unknown to Origen and Eusebius; nor does it comport with the records
        connected with him. The Apostle, when freed from the chains of Nero, did
        not go to Spain, but to Asia; and there is no vestige of a Church
        founded by Paul in Spain. Basnage has carefully examined this subject as
        well as W. Wall<i> </i>in his critical Notes in English on the New
        Testament.&#8221; As is common in many things connected with antiquity,
        fathers later than Origen<i> </i>and Eusebius came to know of this
        journey, but how, it is not easy to know: and in process of time various
        particulars were discovered, or rather invented, in connection with this

        More satisfactory is the explanation of Stuart: he says, that the word

        applied is
        <i>authenticated</i>, <i>made valid, i.e.</i>, &#8220;sure to answer the
        purpose intended. So here the Apostle would not stop short in the
        performance of his duty, as the almoner of the Churches, until he had
        seen the actual distribution of their charity.&#8221; It seems then that
        &#8220;sealed&#8221; here means &#8220;secured,&#8221; or safely

        &#8212; minister, or servant, or deaconess, one who ministers. Origen
        and Chrysostom considered her to be a deaconess, but the word does not
        necessarily prove this; for it is used often to designate generally one
        who does service and contributes to the help and assistance of others.
        She was evidently a person of wealth and influence, and was no doubt a
        great support and help to the Cenchrean Church. Those spoken of by Paul

        early Church, and Grotius says that they were ordained by imposition of
        hands before the Laodicean Council, which forbade the practice. Their
        office was, according to <i>Bingham</i> and <i>Suicer</i>, referred to
        by Schleusner, to baptize women, to teach female catechumens, to visit
        the sick, and to perform other inferior offices in the Church. But this
        was the state of things after the apostolic times, and there is no
        reason to believe that Phoebe was of this order. She was evidently a
        great helper of the Christian cause, as some other women also are

        It appears from Justin Martyr and Tertullian, that the early Christians
        kissed one another always after prayers, or at the end of the service.
        They did so, says Grotius, to &#8220;show that they were all equal; for
        the Persians and the orientals kissed the mouth of those only of the
        same rank, and gave their hands to be kissed by their inferiors.&#8221;

        what he noticed in chapter 14, about eating and observing of days; and

        &#8220;divisions,&#8221; and then the cause &#8212;
        &#8220;offenses.&#8221; The Gentile Christians, by eating, gave offense
        to the believing Jews, and this offense led to a division or separation.
        The evils which he had previously attempted to correct were doubtless
        those referred to here. &#8220;Serving their own belly,&#8221; in the

        &#8220;Good&#8221; and &#8220;evil&#8221; in this clause, is beneficence

        speaks of God as &#8220;the<i> </i>God of peace,&#8221; the author of
        peace among his people; and he says that this God of peace would soon
        tread down Satan, the author of discord, the promoter of divisions and
        offenses; or, as most consider the passage, he prays that God would do
        this; for the future, after the manner of the Hebrew, is sometimes used
        by the Apostle as an optative. And indeed the verb is found in some

        This conclusion bears an evident reference to the point the Apostle had
        especially in view &#8212; the reconciling of the Jews and Gentiles. He
        connects the gospel with the ancient Scriptures, and mentions the gospel
        as being in unison with them. Then the Jews had no reason to complain.

        is&#8212;&#8221;that the mystery, hid for ages, is now manifest, that
        is, by the gospel, and by means of the prophetic Scriptures, and
        consistently with the decree (</font

        and in rejecting the Jews for a time, and afterwards restoring them
        &#8212; however mysterious all these things may appear, the Apostle

        ><b>23.</b> And not only <i>they, </i>but we also ourselves, Who possess

        Anxiously waiting for <i>our </i>adoption, The redemption of our
        body;</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>24. </b>For in hope are we saved, But hope seen is not hope; For
        what one sees, why does he yet hope for it?</font
      ><br /><font
        ><b>25. </b>But if what we see not, we hope for, We wait for
        <i>it </i>in patience.</font

        >We <i>may </i>indeed consider &#8220;every creature&#8221; in verse 22
        as referring to every renewed creature then living, (except the Apostles
        and those endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit,) and all
        such from the beginning of the world. In this case, &#8220;to this
        day&#8221; has a striking import. All God&#8217;s servants from the
        beginning had been groaning under the body of sin, and not only they,
        but even?hose who had enjoyed the first outpouring of the Spirit, and
        had been endued with extraordinary gifts. The gifts of the Spirit,
        however abundant, did not free any from the bondage of corruption, from
        the body of sin; but this was an object of hope, for which they were to
        wait. The context, before and after, clearly shows that the present
        condition of God&#8217;s people is the subject. <i>&#8212; Ed.</i></font
