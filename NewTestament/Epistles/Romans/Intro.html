        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Paul, the author, was a Hebrew by descent, a native of Tarsus in
          Cilicia, and educated by Gamaliel, the great Pharisaic teacher. He was
          one of the most unmerciful persecutors of the early Christians, but
          was converted by the sudden appearance to him of the risen Lord. He
          began preaching at Damascus, but on account of persecution went into
          Arabia. Returning from Arabia he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and
          then went to Cilicia, where he doubtless did evangelistic work until
          Barnabas sought him at Tarsus and brought him to Antioch, where he
          worked a year with Barnabas. After this they went up to Jerusalem with
          contributions for the brethren. Upon return to Antioch he was called
          by the Holy Ghost to mission work in which he continued till his
          death, making at least three great missionary journeys, during which
          and afterward he suffered "one long martyrdom" till his death.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>Paul's epistles are commonly put into four groups as follows:</p>
        <p>
          (1) The Eschatological group, or those dealing with the second coming
          of Christ. These are I. and II. Thessalonians and were written from
          Corinth about 62 to 63 A. D.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The Anti-Judaic group, or those growing out of controversy with
          Judaistic teachers. They are I. Corinthians. II. Corinthians,
          Galatians and Romans, written during the third Missionary journey,
          probably at Ephesus, Philippi, and Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The Christological group, which center their teachings around the
          character and work of Jesus, and were written during the imprisonment
          at Rome. They are Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and
          Hebrews (many think Paul did not write Hebrews).
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) The Pastoral Group, or those written to young preachers touching
          matters of church organization and government and practical
          instructions concerning evangelists, pastors, and other Christian
          workers. They are 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Romans falls into the Anti-Judaic group and was likely written from
          Corinth which makes the date circa 58 A. D.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Church at Rome was doubtless in a very prosperous condition the
          time of Paul's writing. It was perhaps organized by some Jews heard
          and believed while at Jerusalem, probably on the day of Pentecost.
          While its membership included both Jews and Gentiles (1:6- 13; 7:1),
          it was regarded by Paul as especially a Gentile church (1:3-7; 13-15).
        </p>
        <p>
          He had never been there up to this time (1:11, 13, 15) and it is not
          likely that any other apostles had been there. For then Paul would
          have not have been planning to go since his rule was not to go where
          another had worked (15:20; 2 Cor. 10:14-16). This strikes a heavy blow
          at Catholicism, claiming that Peter was first bishop of Rome. If Paul
          would not have followed him, then Peter had not been there, and the
          most important test of papacy is overthrown. Paul had, however, many
          intimate friends and acquaintances at Rome, many of whom were
          mentioned in chapter 16. Among them were his old friends, Aquila and
          Priscilia.
        </p>
        <h2>Occasion</h2>
        <p>
          (1) Paul longed to go to Rome (Acts 19:21) and now hoped soon to do so
          (Romans 15:24-33). He may, therefore, have wished them to know of his
          doctrine before his arrival, especially as they had perhaps heard some
          false reports of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) It was just after he wrote Galatians and Paul's mind was full of
          the doctrine of justification, and he may have desired to write
          further upon the subject, giving special emphasis to the Divine side
          of the doctrine as he had given to the human side of it in Galatians.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) Then, too, he may have been misunderstood in Galatians and desired
          to enlarge upon his teaching. In Galatians man is justified by
          believing, in Romans God gives his own righteousness to the believer
          for his justification through faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) Phoebe, a woman of influence and Christian character, a friend of
          Paul, was about to go to Rome from the coasts of Corinth, and Paul not
          only had a good opportunity to send the letter, but could do her a
          service by way of introducing her (16:1-2).
        </p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
          All of Paul's epistles (not including Hebrews), fall very naturally
          into five sections, as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) An introduction, which may contain a salutation, usually including
          the subject of the epistle and the name of those with Paul as
          co-laborers at the time of the writing, and a thanksgiving for the
          good character or conduct of those whom he addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) A Doctrinal Section, in which he discusses some great Christian
          teaching, which needs special emphasis as the case of thechurch or
          individual addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) A Practical Section, in which he sets forth the practical
          application of the principles discussed in the doctrinal section to
          the life of those addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4) A Personal Section, in which are personal messages and salutations
          sent to and by various friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) A Conclusion, in which may be found a benediction or autograph
          conclusion to authenticate the letter, maybe both, with other closing
          words.
        </p>
        <h2>Theme</h2>
        <p>
          The gift of the righteousness of God as our justification which is
          received through faith in Christ, or justification by faith.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          The doctrines of the book can be sumarized with the following
          propositions:
        </p>
        <p>(1) All men are guilty before God, Jews and Gentiles alike.</p>
        <p>(2) All men need a Savior.</p>
        <p>
          (3) The Gospel, by revealing the righteousness of God obtained by
          faith, is God's power for salvation to all who believe.
        </p>
        <p>(4) Faith is the gift and work of God in our hearts.</p>
        <p>
          (4) This faith justifies, gives us a right standing before God,
          because it apprehends Christ, the Redeemer.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5) We live out our lives by faith, not to seeking to be justified by
          works, because by works of the Law, no one will be justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6) Once a person has been justified by Christ, he will not be
          unproductive of good, but as a good tree he will bring forth good
          fruit.
