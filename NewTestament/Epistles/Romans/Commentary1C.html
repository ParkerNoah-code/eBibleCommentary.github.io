              etc. This is an anticipation of an objection; for he declares
              beforehand, that he cared not for the taunts of the ungodly; and
              he thus provides a way for himself, by which he proceeds to
              pronounce an eulogy on the value of the gospel, that it might not
              appear contemptible to the Romans. He indeed intimates that it was
              contemptible in the eyes of the world; and he does this by saying,
              that he was not ashamed of it. And thus he prepares them for
              bearing the reproach of the cross of Christ, lest they should
              esteem the gospel of less value by finding it exposed to the
              scoffs and reproaches of the ungodly; and, on the other hand, he
              shows how valuable it was to the faithful. If, in the first place,
              the power of God ought to be extolled by us, that power shines
              forth in the gospel; if, again, the goodness of God deserves to be
              sought and loved by us, the gospel is a display of his goodness.
              It ought then to be reverenced and honored, since veneration is
              due to God&#8217;s power; and as it avails to our salvation, it
              ought to be loved by us.</font

              for he speaks not here of any secret revelation, but of vocal
              preaching. It hence follows, that those as it were willfully
              despise the power of God, and drive away from them his delivering
              hand, who withdraw themselves from the hearing of the word.</font

              The gospel is indeed offered to all for their salvation, but the
              power of it appears not everywhere: and that it is the savor of
              death to the ungodly, does not proceed from what it is, but from
              their own wickedness. By setting forth but one Salvation he cuts
              off every other trust. When men withdraw themselves from this one
              salvation, they find in the gospel a sure proof of their own ruin.
              Since then the gospel invites all to partake of salvation without
              any difference, it is rightly called the doctrine of salvation:
              for Christ is there offered, whose peculiar office is to save that
              which was lost; and those who refuse to be saved by him, shall
              find him a Judge. But everywhere in Scripture the word salvation
              is simply set in opposition to the word destruction: and hence we
              must observe, when it is mentioned, what the subject of the
              discourse is. Since then the gospel delivers from ruin and the
              curse of endless death, its salvation is eternal life. </font

              Under the word Greek, he includes all the Gentiles, as it is
              evident from the comparison that is made; for the two clauses
              comprehend all mankind. And it is probable that he chose
              especially this nation to designate other nations, because, in the
              first place, it was admitted, next to the Jews, into a
              participation of the gospel covenant; and, secondly, because the
              Greeks, on account of their vicinity, and the celebrity of their
              language, were more known to the Jews. It is then a mode of
              speaking, a part being taken for the whole, by which he connects
              the Gentiles universally with the Jews, as participators of the
              gospel: nor does he thrust the Jews from their own eminence and
              dignity, since they were the first partakers of God&#8217;s
              promise and calling. He then reserves for them their prerogative;
              but he immediately joins the Gentiles, though in the second place,
              as being partakers with them.</font

              etc. This is an explanation and a confirmation of the preceding
              clause &#8212; that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation.
              For if we seek salvation, that is, life with God, righteousness
              must be first sought, by which being reconciled to him, we may,
              through him being propitious to us, obtain that life which
              consists only in his favor; for, in order to be loved by God, we
              must first become righteous, since he regards unrighteousness with
              hatred. He therefore intimates, that we cannot obtain salvation
              otherwise than from the gospel, since nowhere else does God reveal
              to us his righteousness, which alone delivers us from perdition.
              Now this righteousness, which is the groundwork of our salvation,
              is revealed in the gospel: hence the gospel is said to be the
              power of God unto salvation. Thus he reasons from the cause to the
              effect.</font

              as that, on the contrary, is usually called the righteousness of
              men, which is by men counted and supposed to be righteousness,
              though it be only vapor. Paul, however, I doubt not, alludes to
              the many prophecies in which the Spirit makes known everywhere the
              righteousness of God in the future kingdom of Christ.</font

              God justifies us by the gospel, and thus saves us: yet the former
              view seems to me more suitable, though it is not what I make much
              of. Of greater moment is what some think, that this righteousness
              does not only consist in the free remission of sins, but also, in
              part, includes the grace of regeneration. But I consider, that we
              are restored to life because God freely reconciles us to himself,
              as we shall hereafter show in its proper place.</font

            ><font face="Palatino"
              >: for as our faith makes progress, and as it advances in
              knowledge, so the righteousness of God increases in us at the same
              time, and the possession of it is in a manner confirmed. When at
              first we taste the gospel, we indeed see God&#8217;s smiling
              countenance turned towards us, but at a distance: the more the
              knowledge of true religion grows in us, by coming as it were
              nearer, we behold God&#8217;s favor more clearly and more
              familiarly. What some think, that there is here an implied
              comparison between the Old and New Testament, is more refined than
              well-founded; for Paul does not here compare the Fathers who lived
              under the law with us, but points out the daily progress that is
              made by every one of the faithful.</font

              righteousness of faith; for he, predicting the overthrow of the
              proud, adds this &#8212; that the life of the righteous consists
              in faith. Now we live not before God, except through
              righteousness: it then follows, that our righteousness is obtained
              by faith; and the verb being future, designates the real
              perpetuity of that life of which he speaks; as though he had said,
              &#8212; that it would not be momentary, but continue forever. For
              even the ungodly swell with the false notion of having life; but
              when they say, &#8220;Peace and safety,&#8221; a sudden
              destruction comes upon them, (</font

            ><font face="Palatino"
              >1 Thessalonians 5:3.) It is therefore a shadow, which endures
              only for a moment. Faith alone is that which secures the
              perpetuity of life; and whence is this, except that it leads us to
              God, and makes our life to depend on him? For Paul would not have
              aptly quoted this testimony had not the meaning of the Prophet
              been, that we then only stand, when by faith we recumb on God: and
              he has not certainly ascribed life to the faith of the godly, but
              in as far as they, having renounced the arrogance of the world,
              resign themselves to the protection of God alone. </font

              is rightly applied to the present subject. Besides, we necessarily
              gather from his reasoning, that there is a mutual connection
              between faith and the gospel: for as the just is said to live by
              faith, he concludes that this life is received by the
