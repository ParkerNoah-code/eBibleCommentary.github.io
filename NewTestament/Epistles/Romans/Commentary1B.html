              occasion, as he seasonably prepares them for receiving instruction
              by reasons connected with himself as well as with them. What he
              states respecting them is, the celebrity of their faith; for he
              intimates that they being honored with the public approbation of
              the churches, could not reject an Apostle of the Lord, without
              disappointing the good opinion entertained of them by all; and
              such a thing would have been extremely uncourteous and in a manner
              bordering on perfidy. As then this testimony justly induced the
              Apostle, by affording him an assurance of their obedience, to
              undertake, according to his office, to teach and instruct the
              Romans; so it held them bound not to despise his authority. With
              regard to himself, he disposes them to a teachable spirit by
              testifying his love towards them: and there is nothing more
              effectual in gaining credit to an adviser, than the impression
              that he is cordially anxious to consult our wellbeing.</font

              that he implies that it had been received from God. We are here
              taught that faith is God&#8217;s gift; for thanksgiving is an
              acknowledgment of a benefit. He who gives thanks to God for faith,
              confesses that it comes from him. And since we find that the
              Apostle ever begins his congratulations with thanksgiving, let us
              know that we are hereby reminded, that all our blessings are
              God&#8217;s free gifts. It is also needful to become accustomed to
              such forms of speaking, that we may be led more fully to rouse
              ourselves in the duty of acknowledging God as the giver of all our
              blessings, and to stir up others to join us in the same
              acknowledgment. If it be right to do this in little things, how
              much more with regard to faith; Which is neither a small nor an

              The eulogy of faithful men was to Paul equal to that of the whole
              world, with regard to the faith of the Romans; for the
              unbelieving, who deemed it detestable, could not have given an
              impartial or a correct testimony respecting it. We then understood
              that it was by the mouths of the faithful that the faith of the
              Romans was proclaimed through the whole world; and that they were
              alone able to judge rightly of it, and to pronounce a correct

              loved them, he would not have so anxiously commended them to the
              Lord, and especially he would not have so ardently desired to
              promote their welfare by his own labors. His anxiety then and his
              ardent desire were certain evidences of his love; for had they not
              sprung from it, they would never have existed. And as he knew it
              to be necessary for establishing confidence in his preaching, that
              the Romans should be fully persuaded of his sincerity, he added an

              pious dread it more than a thousand deaths; inasmuch as it cannot
              be, but that where there is a real fear of God, there must be also
              a reverence for his name. It is then the same thing, as though
              Paul had said, that he knew how much sacredness and sincerity
              belonged to an oath, and that he did not rashly appeal to God as a
              witness, as the profane are wont to do. And thus, by his own

              such evidence of piety, that the name of God, which we use in our
              declarations, may retain its sacredness. And further, he gives a

              devoted to God&#8217;s glory, when he denied himself, and

              retain the very words of Paul. He then takes an argument from his
              own office, and intimates that it ought not to be ascribed to his
              arrogance, that he thought himself in a manner capable of teaching
              the Romans, however much they excelled in learning and wisdom and
              in the knowledge of things, inasmuch as it had pleased the Lord to
              make him a debtor even to the wise. </font

              by a heavenly mandate destined and offered to the wise, in order
              that the Lord may subject to himself all the wisdom of this world,
              and make all variety of talents, and every kind of science, and
              the loftiness of all arts, to give way to the simplicity of his
              doctrine; and what is more, they are to be reduced to the same
              rank with the unlearned, and to be made so meek, as to be able to
              bear those to be their fellow-disciples under their master,
              Christ, whom they would not have deigned before to take as their
              scholars; and then that the unlearned are by no means to be driven
              away from this school, nor are they to flee away from it through
              groundless fear; for if Paul was indebted to them, being a
              faithful debtor, he had doubtless discharged what he owed; and
              thus they will find here what they will be capable of enjoying.
              All teachers have also a rule here which they are to follow, and
              that is, modestly and kindly to accommodate themselves to the
              capacities of the ignorant and unlearned. Hence it will be, that
              they will be able, with more evenness of mind, to bear with many
              absurdities and almost innumerable things that may disgust them,
              by which they might otherwise be overcome. They are, however, to
              remember, that they are not so indebted to the foolish, as that
              they are to cherish their folly by immoderate indulgence.</font

              that as he knew it to be his duty to spread the gospel among them,
              in order to gather fruit for the Lord, he was anxious to fulfill
              God&#8217;s calling, as far as he was allowed to do so by the
              Lord.</font
