              Augustine, that he took occasion refinedly to philosophize on the
              subject; for he says, that from a proud Saul he was made a very

              thought that he had two names; for it is not unlikely to be true,
              that his name, Saul, derived from his kindred, was given him by
              his parents to indicate his religion and his descent; and that his
              other name, Paul, was added, to show his right to Roman
              citizenship; </font

              they would not have this honor, then highly valued, to be
              otherwise than made evident; but they did not so much value it as
              to withhold a proof of his Israelitic descent. But he has commonly
              taken the name Paul in his Epistles, and it may be for the
              following reasons: because in the churches to which he wrote, it
              was more known and more common, more acceptable in the Roman
              empire, and less known among his own nation. It was indeed his
              duty to avoid the foolish suspicion and hatred under which the
              name of a Jew then labored among the Romans and in their
              provinces, and to abstain from inflaming the rage of his own
              countrymen, and to take care of himself.</font

              purpose of securing more authority to his doctrine; and this he
              seeks to secure by two things &#8212; first, by asserting his call
              to the Apostleship; </font

              and secondly, by showing that his call was not unconnected with
              the Church of Rome: for it was of great importance that he should
              be deemed an Apostle through God&#8217;s call, and that he should
              be known as one destined for the Roman Church. He therefore says,
              that he was a </font

            ><font face="Palatino"
              >of Christ, and called to the office of an Apostle, thereby
              intimating that he had not presumptuously intruded into that
              office. He then adds, that he was <i>chosen</i>, (selectum &#8212;
              selected, </font
            ><sup style="display: none"
              ><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f15</font></sup
            ><font face="Palatino"
              >) by which he more fully confirms the fact, that he was not one
              of the people, but a particular Apostle of the Lord. Consistently
              with this, he had before proceeded from what was general to what
              was particular, as the Apostleship was an especial service; for
              all who sustain the office of teaching are to be deemed
              Christ&#8217;s servants, but Apostles, in point of honor, far
              exceed all others. But the <i>choosing</i> for the gospel, etc.,
              which he afterwards mentions, expresses the end as well as the use
              of the Apostleship; for he intended briefly to show for what
              purpose he was called to that function. By saying then that he was
              servant of Christ, he declared what he had in common with other
              teachers; by claiming to himself the title of an Apostle, he put
              himself before others; but as no authority is due to him who
              willfully intrudes himself, he reminds us, that he was appointed
              by God.</font

              explanation of the Apostolic office, &#8212; it was ordained for
              the preaching of the Gospel. For I cannot agree with those who
              refer this call of which he speaks to the eternal election of God;
              and who understand the separation, either that from his
              mother&#8217;s womb, which he mentions in </font

              the authority of a doctrine, he confirms the faith of the gospel
              by antiquity; as though he said, &#8220;Christ came not on the
              earth unexpectedly, nor did he introduce a doctrine of a new kind
              and not heard of before, inasmuch as he, and his gospel too, had
              been promised and expected from the beginning of the world.&#8221;
              But as antiquity is often fabulous, he brings witnesses, and those
              approved, even the Prophets of God, that he might remove every
              suspicion. He in the third place adds, that their testimonies were
              duly recorded, that is, in the Holy Scriptures.</font

              not that it was promulgated by the Prophets but only promised. If
              then the Prophets promised the gospel, it follows, that it was
              revealed, when our Lord was at length manifested in the flesh.
              They are then mistaken who confound the promises with the gospel,
              since the gospel is properly the appointed preaching of Christ as
              manifested, in whom the promises themselves are exhibited. </font

              etc. &#8212; This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught
              that the whole gospel is included in Christ, so that if any
              removes one step from Christ, he withdraws himself from the
              gospel. For since he is the living and express image of the
              Father, it is no wonder, that he alone is set before us as one to
              whom our whole faith is to be directed and in whom it is to
              center. It is then a definition of the gospel, by which Paul
              expresses what is summarily comprehended in it. I have rendered
              the words which follow, </font

              ><i>Jesus Christ our Lord</i></font
            ><font face="Palatino"
              >, in the same case; which seems to me to be most agreeable with
              the context. We hence learn, that he who has made a due
              proficiency in the knowledge of Christ, has acquired every thing
              which can be learned from the gospel; and, on the other hand, that
              they who seek to be wise without Christ, are not only foolish, but
              even completely insane.</font

              may obtain salvation in him, even divinity and humanity. His
              divinity possesses power, righteousness, life, which by his
              humanity are conveyed to us. Hence the Apostle has expressly
              mentioned both in the Summary he gives of the gospel, that Christ
              was manifested in the flesh &#8212; and that in it he declared
              himself to be the Son of God. So John says; after having declared
              that the Word was made flesh, he adds, that in that flesh there
              was a glory as of the only-begotten Son of God. (</font

              Christ from his ancestor David, is not superfluous; for by this he
              calls back our attention to the promise, that we may not doubt but
              that he is the very person who had been formerly promised. So well
              known was the promise made to David, that it appears to have been
              a common thing among the Jews to call the Messiah the Son of
              David. This then &#8212; that Christ did spring from David &#8212;
              was said for the purpose of confirming our faith.</font

              not take from David, even that which he afterwards mentions, the
              glory of the divine nature. Paul does further by these words not
              only declare that Christ had real flesh, but he also clearly
              distinguishes his human from his divine nature; and thus he
              refutes the impious raving of <i>Servetus</i>, who assigned flesh

              here three separate evidences of the divinity of Christ &#8212;
              &#8220;power,&#8221; understanding thereby miracles &#8212; then
              the testimony of the Spirit &#8212; and, lastly, the resurrection
              from the dead &#8212; I yet prefer to connect them together, and
              to reduce these three things to one, in this manner &#8212; that
              Christ was declared the Son of God by openly exercising a real
              celestial power, that is, the power of the Spirit, when he rose
              from the dead; but that this power is comprehended, when a
              conviction of it is imprinted on our hearts by the same Spirit.
              The language of the Apostle well agrees with this view; for he
              says that he was declared by power, because power, peculiar to
              God, shone forth in him, and uncontestably proved him to be God;
              and this was indeed made evident by his resurrection. Paul says
              the same thing in another place; having stated, that by death the
              weakness of the flesh appeared, he at the same time extols the
              power of the Spirit in his resurrection; (</font

              >2 Corinthians 8:4) This glory, however, is not made known to us,
              until the same Spirit imprints a conviction of it on our hearts.
              And that Paul includes, together with the wonderful energy of the
              Spirit, which Christ manifested by rising from the dead, the
              testimony which all the faithful feel in their hearts, is even
              evident from this &#8212; that he expressly calls it the Spirit of
              Holiness; as though he had said, that the Spirit, as far as it
              sanctifies, confirms and ratifies that evidence of its power which
              it once exhibited. For the Scripture is wont often to ascribe such
              titles to the Spirit, as tend to illustrate our present subject.
              Thus He is called by our Lord the Spirit of Truth, on account of
              the effect which he mentions; (</font

              been chosen for so high an office. For though it has hardly any

              because the Lord had already exhibited in them an evidence by
              which he had manifested that he had called them to a participation
              of the gospel. It hence followed, that if they wished their own
              calling to remain sure, they were not to reject the ministry of
              Paul, who had been chosen by the same election of God. I therefore

              they are committed to his care and protection as their shepherd. </font

              etc. By this happy arrangement he sets forth what there is in us
              worthy of commendation; he says, that first the Lord through his
              own kindness made us the objects of his favor and love; and then
              that he has called us; and thirdly, that he has called us to
              holiness: but this high honor only then exists, when we are not
              wanting to our call.</font

              >Here a rich truth presents itself to us, to which I shall briefly
              refer, and leave it to be meditated upon by each individual: Paul
              does by no means ascribe the praise of our salvation to ourselves,
              but derives it altogether from the fountain of God&#8217;s free
              and paternal love towards us; for he makes this the first thing
              &#8212; God loves us: and what is the cause of his love, except
              his own goodness alone? On this depends our calling, by which in
              his own time he seals his adoption to those whom he had before
              freely chosen. We also learn from this passage that none rightly
              connect themselves with the number of the faithful, except they
              feel assured that the Lord is gracious, however unworthy and
              wretched sinners they may be, and except they be stimulated by his
              goodness and aspire to holiness, for he hath not called us to
              uncleanness, but to holiness. (</font

              etc. Nothing is more desirable than to have God propitious to us,
              and this is signified by <i>grace</i>; and then to have prosperity
              and success in all things flowing from him, and this is intimated
              by </font

              >; for however things may seem to smile on us, if God be angry,
              even blessing itself is turned to a curse. The very foundation
              then of our felicity is the favor of God, by which we enjoy true
              and solid prosperity, and by which also our salvation is promoted
              even when we are in adversities. </font

              And then as he prays to God for peace, we must understand, that
              whatever good comes to us, it is the fruit of divine benevolence.
              Nor must we omit to notice, that he prays at the same time to the
              Lord Jesus Christ for these blessings. Worthily indeed is this
              honor rendered to him, who is not only the administrator and
              dispenser of his Father&#8217;s bounty to us, but also works all
              things in connection with him. It was, however, the special object
              of the Apostle to show, that through him all God&#8217;s blessings
              come to us. </font

              as signifying quietness of conscience; and that this meaning
              belongs to it sometimes, I do not deny: but since it is certain
              that the Apostle wished to give us here a summary of God&#8217;s
              blessings, the former meaning, which is adduced by <i>Bucer</i>,
              is much the most suitable. Anxiously wishing then to the godly
              what makes up real happiness, he betakes himself, as he did
              before, to the very fountain itself, even the favor of God, which
              not only alone brings to us eternal felicity but is also the
              source of all blessings in this life.</font
