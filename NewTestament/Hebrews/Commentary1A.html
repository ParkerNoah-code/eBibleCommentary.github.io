          <h2>
            Ver 1.
            <em
              >God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the
              prophets at many times and in various ways,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>God, having formerly spoken...</em> This beginning is for the
            purpose of commending the doctrine taught by Christ; for it shows
            that we ought not only reverently to receive it, but also to be
            satisfied with it alone. That we may understand this more clearly,
            we must observe the contrast between each of the clauses. First, the
            Son of God is set in opposition to the prophets; then we to the
            fathers; and, thirdly, the various and manifold modes of speaking
            which God had adopted as to the fathers, to the last revelation
            brought to us by Christ. But in this diversity he still sets before
            us but one God, that no one might think that the Law militates
            against the Gospel, or that the author of one is not the author of
            the other. That you may, therefore, understand the full import of
            this passage, the following arrangement shall be given, --
          </p>
          <p>
            Formerly by the Prophets => Now by the Son;<br />
            Then to the Fathers => But now to us;<br />
            Then at Various times => Now as at the end of the times.
          </p>
          <p>
            This foundation being laid, the agreement between the Law and the
            Gospel is established; for God, who is ever like himself, and whose
            word is the same, and whose truth is unchangeable, has spoken as to
            both in common.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we must notice the difference between us and the fathers; for
            God formerly addressed them in a way different from that which he
            adopts towards us now. And first indeed as to them he employed the
            prophets, but he has appointed his Son to be an ambassador to us.
            Our condition, then, in this respect, is superior to that of the
            fathers. Even Moses is to be also classed among the prophets, as he
            is one of the number of those who are inferior to the Son. In the
            manner also in which revelation was made, we have an advantage over
            them. For the diversity as to visions and other means adopted under
            the Old Testament, was an indication that it was not yet a fixed
            state of things, as when matters are put completely in order. Hence
            he says,
            <em>many times and in various ways</em>. God would have indeed
            followed the same mode perpetually to the end, had the mode been
            perfect and complete. It hence follows, that this variety was an
            evidence of imperfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two words I thus understand: I refer <em>multifariously</em> to
            a diversity as to times but <em>various ways</em> points out a
            diversity, as I think, in the very manner itself. And when he speaks
            of the last times, he intimates that there is no longer any reason
            to expect any new revelation; for it was not a word in part that
            Christ brought, but the final conclusion. It is in this sense that
            the Apostles take the last times and the last days. And Paul means
            the same when he says, "Upon whom the ends of the world are come."
            (1 Corinthians 10:11.) If God then has spoken now for the last time,
            it is right to advance thus far; so also when you come to Christ,
            you ought not to go farther: and these two things it is very needful
            for us to know. For it was a great hindrance to the Jews that they
            did not consider that God had deferred a fuller revelation to
            another time; hence, being satisfied with their own Law, they did
            not hasten forward to the goal. But since Christ has appeared, an
            opposite evil began to prevail in the world; for men wished to
            advance beyond Christ. What else indeed is the whole system of
            Popery but the overleaping of the boundary which the Apostle has
            fixed? As, then, the Spirit of God in this passage invites all to
            come as far as Christ, so he forbids them to go beyond the last time
            which he mentions. In short, the limit of our wisdom is made here to
            be the Gospel.

          <h2>
            Ver 2.
            <em
              >has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he
              appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the
              worlds.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Whom he appointed heir...</em> He honors Christ with high
            commendations, in order to lead us to show him reverence; for since
            the Father has subjected all things to him, we are all under his
            authority. He also intimates that no good can be found apart from
            him, as he is the heir of all things. It hence follows that we must
            be very miserable and destitute of all good things except he
            supplies us with his treasures. He further adds that this honor of
            possessing all things belongs by right to the Son, because by him
            have all things been created. At the same time, heirship and
            creation are ascribed to Christ for different reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world was created by him, as he is the eternal wisdom of God,
            which is said to have been the director of all his works from the
            beginning; and hence is proved the eternity of Christ, for he must
            have existed before the world was created by him. If, then, the
            duration of his time be inquired of, it will be found that it has no
            beginning. Nor is it any derogation to his power that he is said to
            have created the world, as though he did not by himself create it.
            According to the most usual mode of speaking in Scripture, the
            Father is called the Creator; and it is added in some places that
            the world was created by wisdom, by the word, by the Son, as though
            wisdom itself had been the creator, or the word, or the Son. But
            still we must observe that there is a difference of persons between
            the Father and the Son, not only with regard to men, but with regard
            to God himself. But the unity of essence requires that whatever is
            peculiar to Deity should belong to the Son as well as to the Father,
            and also that whatever is applied to God only should belong to both;
            and yet there is nothing in this to prevent each from his own
            peculiar properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the word <em>heir</em> is ascribed to Christ as manifested in
            the flesh; for being made man, he put on our nature, and as such
            received this heirship, and that for this purpose, that he might
            restore to us what we had lost in Adam. For God had at the beginning
            constituted man, as his Son, the heir of all good things; but
            through sin the first man became alienated from God, and deprived
            himself and his posterity of all good things, as well as of the
            favor of God. We hence only then begin to enjoy by right the good
            things of God, when Christ, the universal heir, admits to a union
            with himself; for he is an heir that he may endow us with his
            riches. But the Apostle now adorns him with this title, that we may
            know that without him we are destitute of all good things.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 3.
            <em
              >His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his
              substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who,
              when he had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the
              right hand of the Majesty on high,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            It is not the direct and immediate design of the apostle to treat
            absolutely of either nature of Christ, his divine or human, but only
            of his person. Hence, though the things which he mentions and
            expresses may be the properties of his divine nature, some of his
            human, yet none of them are spoken of as such, but are all
            considered as belonging unto his person. He intends not to speak
            directly and absolutely of either nature of Christ; but treating of
            his person. And therefore the method and order of the apostle is not
            to be inquired after in what relates in his expressions to this or
            that nature of Christ, but in the progress that he makes in the
            description of his person and offices; which alone he had
            undertaken.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>His Son is the radiance of his glory...</em> The Son is said to
            be "the brightness of his glory", and "the impress of his
            substance:" they are words borrowed from nature. For nothing can be
            said of things so great and so profound, but by similitudes taken
            from created things. There is therefore no need refinedly to discuss
            the question how the Son, who has the same essence with the Father,
            is a brightness emanating from his light. We must allow that there
            is a degree of impropriety in the language when what is borrowed
            from created things is transferred to the hidden majesty of God. But
            still the things which are indent to our senses are fitly applied to
            God, and for this end, that we may know what is to be found in
            Christ, and what benefits he brings to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            It ought also to be observed that frivolous speculations are not
            here taught, but an important doctrine of faith. We ought therefore
            to apply these high titles given to Christ for our own benefit, for
            they bear a relation to us. When, therefore, thou hear that the Son
            is the brightness of the Father's glory, think thus with thyself,
            that the glory of the Father is invisible until it shines forth in
            Christ, and that he is called the impress of his substance, because
            the majesty of the Father is hidden until it shows itself impressed
            as it were on his image. They who overlook this connection and carry
            their philosophy higher, weary themselves to no purpose, for they do
            not understand the design of the Apostle; for it was not his object
            to show what likeness the Father bears to the Son; but, as I have
            said, his purpose was really to build up our faith, so that we may
            learn that God is made known to us in no other way than in Christ:
            for as to the essence of God, so immense is the brightness that it
            dazzles our eyes, except it shines on us in Christ. It hence
            follows, that we are blind as to the light of God, until in Christ
            it beams on us. It is indeed a profitable philosophy to learn Christ
            by the real understanding of faith and experience. The same view, as
            I have said is to be taken of "the impress;" for as God is in
            himself to us incomprehensible, his form appears to us only in his
            Son.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And upholding all things...</em>
            To uphold or to bear here means to preserve or to continue all that
            is created in its own state; for he intimates that all things would
            instantly come to nothing, were they not sustained by his power. For
            as that power in Him, that is influencing and giving existence,
            life, motion, and guidance unto all things, is clearly expressed by
            “upholding and disposing of all things”; so is the exercise and
            issuing of it forth by the spirit of life in all things, to guide
            them certainly and regularly, by these words, “the word of his
            power:” both denoting the unspeakable facility of omnipotent power
            in its operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By the word of his power</em>... This work is peculiarly
            assigned to the Son, not only as he is the eternal power and wisdom
            of God, but also because by his interposition, as undertaking the
            work of mediation, he reprieved the world from an immediate
            dissolution upon the first entrance of sin and disorder, that it
            might continue, as it were, the great stage for the mighty works of
            God's grace, wisdom, and love, to be wrought on. Hence the care of
            the continuance of the creation and the disposal of it is delegated
            unto him, as he that hath undertaken to bring forth and consummate
            the glory of God in it, notwithstanding the great breach made upon
            it by the sin of angels and men. He affirms that all things have
            also their present consistency in him and by his power, and must
            have so, until the work of reconciliation of all things unto God
            being accomplished, the glory of God may be fully retrieved and
            established for ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When he had by himself purified us of our sins</em> When he
            says, <em>by himself</em>, there is to be understood here a
            contrast, that he had not been aided in this by the shadows of the
            Mosaic Law. He shows besides a difference between him and the
            Levitical priests; for they also were said to expiate sins, but they
            derived this power from another. In short, he intended to exclude
            all other means or helps by stating that the price and the power of
            purgation were found only in Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sat down on the right hand...</em> as though he had said, that
            having in the world procured salvation for men, he was received into
            celestial glory, in order that he might govern all things. And he
            added this in order to show that it was not a temporary salvation he
            has obtained for us; for we should otherwise be too apt to measure
            his power by what now appears to us. He then reminds us that Christ
            is not to be less esteemed because he is not seen by our eyes; but,
            on the contrary, that this was the height of his glory, that he has
            been taken and conveyed to the highest seat of his empire.
            <em>The right hand</em> is by a similitude applied to God, though he
            is not confined to any place, and has not a right side nor left. The
            session then of Christ means nothing else but the kingdom given to
            him by the Father, and that authority which Paul mentions, when he
            says that in his name every knee should bow (Philippians 2:10).
            Hence to sit at the right hand of the Father is no other thing than
            to govern in the place of the Father, as deputies of princes are
            wont to do to whom a full power over all things is granted. And the
            word <em>majesty</em> is added, and also <em>on high</em>, and for
            this purpose, to intimate that Christ is seated on the supreme
            throne whence the majesty of God shines forth. As, then, he ought to
            be loved on account of his redemption, so he ought to be adored on
            account of his royal magnificence.

            <em>Having become as much better...</em>
            After having raised Christ above Moses and all others, he now
            amplifies His glory by a comparison with angels. It was a common
            notion among the Jews, that the Law was given by angels; they
            attentively considered the honorable things spoken of them
            everywhere in Scripture; and as the world is strangely inclined to
            superstition, they obscured the glory of God by extolling angels too
            much. It was therefore necessary to reduce them to their own rank,
            that they might not overshadow the brightness of Christ. And first
            he proves from his name, that Christ far excelled them, for he is
            called the Son of God.

            is μέρος, “the part of any thing;” and πολυμερής, “that which

            of the versions, and the majority of the fathers, Tischendorf, in
            his second edition of the New Testament, inserts ἐσχάτου in the
            text. In most critical editions since the time of Bengel, the same
            reading has been preferred and adopted. Our author himself, to judge
            from a remark which he makes in the course of exposition, had a
            decided leaning to it.

            EXPOSITION. — II. καὶ π. “Of the two modes of interpreting these
            words, I rather prefer that which separates them, and gives a
            distinct meaning to each: ‘God, who in ancient times made
            communications to the fathers by the prophets, in sundry parts and
            in various ways, has now made a revelation to us by his Son:’i. e.,
            he has completed the whole revelation which he intends to make under
            the new dispensation by his Son, his Son only, and not by a
            long-continued series of prophets, as of old.” — Stuart.

            the distribution of the Old Testament revelation among the prophets,
            and the undivided fullness of the New Testament revelation by
            Christ.” — Ebrard.

            the species that is placed in opposition to the species, although,

            a possession which he on his part can transfer as an inheritance to
            his posterity; consequently a permanent possession, over which he
            has full authority.” — Ebrard.

            is,” or “was;” “who existing:” as Php 2:6, ῝Ος ἐν μορφῇ Θεοῦ
            ὑπάρχων, — “Who being in the form of God.”

            “beam,” “effulgency,” or “shining forth of glory.” Syr., צֶמְחָא,

          </p>
          <p>
            Αὐγή is “lux,” “light,” particularly the morning light: Acts 20:11,
            ῾ομιλήσας ἄχρις αὐγῆς, — “He talked until the break of day,” or the
            beaming of the morning light. Αὐγὴ ἡλίου, Gloss. Vet., “jubar solis”
            — “the sun-beam.” And sometimes it denotes the day itself. It is
            also sometimes used for the light that is in burning iron. ῾Απαυγή
            is of the same signification; properly “splendor lucis,” — “the
            brightness, shining, beauty, glory or lustre of light.” Hence is
            αὐγάζω, to a shine forth,” to “shine into” to “irradiate:” 2 Cor
            4:4, Εἰς τὸ μὴ αὐγάσαι αὐτοῖς, — “That the light of the gospel
            should not irradiate” (shine) “into them.” ᾿Απαυγάζω is of the same
            importance; and from thence ἀπαύγασμα. The word is nowhere used in
            the New Testament save in this place only; nor doth it occur in the
            Old of the LXX. Only we have it, Wis_7:26. Wisdom is said to be
            ἀπαύμασμα φωτὸς ἀϊδίου, — “a beam of eternal light;” to which place
            the margin of our translation refers. And it is so used by
            Nazianzen: Μεγάλου φωτὸς μικρὸν ἀπαύγασμα, — “A little beam of a
            great light.” It answers exactly to the Hebrew נֹגַהּ, or אוֹר
            נֹגַהּthat is; that is, “The morning light:” Pro_4:18, “The path of
            the righteous כְּאוֹר נֹגַהּ,” — “ut lux splendoris,” Jerome; “as
            the light of brightness,” — that is, “of the morning,” αὐγή, Acts
            20:11. And it is also applied to the light of fire, or fire in iron,
            Isa_4:5, נֹגַהּ אֵשׁ, — “The light of fire;” and the fiery streaming
            of lightning, Hab_3:11.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brightness, shining, ray, beam, τῆς δόξης, “of glory.” Some look
            on this expression as a Hebraism, ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης, “the beam of
            glory,” for ἔνδοξον ἀπαύγασμα, “a glorious beam;” but this will not
            answer the design of the apostle, as we shall see afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our translators have supplied “his,” “the brightness of his glory,”
            by repeating αὐτοῦ from the end of the sentence; perhaps, as we
            shall find, not altogether necessarily, — in which case alone such
            supplements unto the text are allowed in translations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Καὶ χαρακτὴρ, — “character.” “Imago,” “forma,” “figura,” “expressa
            forma,” “figura expressa,” צָלְמָא, Syr.; — “the character,”
            “image,” “form,” “figure, “express form,” “express figure:” so
            variously is the word rendered by translators, with little
            difference. It is nowhere used in the New Testament but only in this
            place. In other authors it hath many significations. Sometimes they
            use it properly and naturally; sometimes metaphorically and
            artificially, as when it denotes several forms of speech or
            orations. Properly, from χαράσσω or χαράττω, to engrave with a tool
            or style, is χάραγμα and χαρακτήρ which is firstly and properly the
            note or mark cut by a tool or instrument into wood, or any other
            subject capable of such impression, or the stamp and sign that is
            left in the coining of money. The mark or scar also left by a wound
            is by the LXX. termed χαρακτήρ, Lev_13:28. It is in general an
            express representation of another thing, communicated unto it by an
            impression of its likeness upon it, opposed unto that which is
            umbratile and imaginary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ, — “substantiae,” “subsistentiae,” “personae.”
            Syr., יִאיתוּתֵהּ, “substantiae ejus;” — “hypostasis,” “substance,”
            “subsistence,” “person.” The word is four times used in the New
            Testament, — thrice in this epistle, in this place, and Heb 3:14,
            and Heb 11:1, as also 2 Cor 9:4, — everywhere in a different sense;
            so that the mere use of it in one place will afford no light unto
            the meaning of it in another, but it must be taken from the context
            and subject treated of. The composition of the word would denote
          </p>
          <p>
            “substantia,” but so as to differ from and to add something unto
            οὐσία, “substance,” or being; which in the divine nature can be
            nothing but a special manner of subsistence. But the controversy
            that hath been about the precise signification of these words we
            shall not here enter into the discussion of.

            Τῷ ῤήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, — “by the word of his power,” “by his
            powerful word.” Syr., בִּחַיְלָא דְּמִלְּתֵהּ, — “by the power of
            his word,”
          </p>
          <p>
            changing the order of the words, but not the meaning of them: “By
            the power of his word,” or, “the word of his power;” that is, his
            powerful word. Αὐτοῦ; some would read it αὐτοῦ, and refer it unto
            the Father, — “By the powerful word of him;” that is, of the Father,
            by whose power, they say, the Son disposed of all things. But all
            copies with accents have αὐτοῦ constantly, none αὐτοῦ, nor will the
            disposition of the words bear that reference.
          </p>
          <p>Δι᾿ ἑαυτοῦ, — “by himself,” “in his own person.”</p>
          <p>
            Καθαρισμὸν ποιησάμενος, — “purgationem faciens,” “purgatione facta;”
            — “having purged,” “cleansed,” “expiated” or “purified” (us from)
            “our sins.” “Having made a purgation or purification of our sins.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εκάθισεν. Καθίζω is used both neutrally and actively, answering to
            יָשַׁב both in Kal and Hiphil, signifying “to sit down,” and “to
            cause to sit down.” Chrysostom seems to have understood the word in
            the latter sense, referring it to God the Father causing the Son to
            sit down. But it is hard to find any antecedent word whereby it
            should be regulated, but only ὅς, “who,” in the beginning of the
            verse, — that is, he himself; and, as Erasmus observes, γενόμενος in
            the following words, will not grammatically admit of this
            construction; for if ἐκάθιοε be to be understood actively and
            transitively, it must have been γενόμενον. And the apostle clears
            the neutral sense of the word, Heb 8:1. It is well, then, rendered
            by our translators, “he sat,” or “sat down.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν δεξιᾷ. Ps 110:1, שֵׁב לִימִינִי. LXX., κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν, in the
            plural number. So is the same thing expressed, Acts 7:55; and by
            Mark, ἐν δεξιοῖς, Mk 16:5. Our apostle constantly keepeth the
            singular number, with ἐν, Heb 8:1; Heb 12:2. The same thing in both
            expressions is intended; only that of ἐκ δεξιῶν, or ἐν δεξιοῖς, in
            the plural number, is more eminently destructive of the folly of the
            Anthropomorphites; for they cannot hence pretend that God hath a
            right hand, unless they will grant that he hath many, which were not
            only to turn the glory of the invisible God into the likeness of a
            man, but of a monster. And Austin well observes that in the psalm
            where that expression is first used, “Sit on my right hand,” it is
            added, אֲדֹנָי עַלאּיְמִינְךָ. “The Lord on thy right hand,” — at
            the right hand of him who sat on his right hand; which removes all
            carnal apprehensions from the meaning of the words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Τῆς μεγαλωσύνης. This word is seldom used in other authors: twice in
            this epistle, here, and Heb 8:1; once by Jude, Jude 1:25; and
            nowhere else in the New Testament; by the LXX. not at all. The
            apostle evidently expresseth by it כָּבוֹד or גְּבוּרָה not as they
            are used appellatively for glory, power, or majesty, but as they are
            names and denote the essential glory of God, “The glorious God.” So
            that
          </p>
          <p>
            μεγαλωσύνη is God himself; not absolutely considered, but with
            reference unto the revelation of his glory and majesty in heaven,
            God on his throne; as our apostle declareth, Heb 8:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            ᾿Εν ὑψηλοῖς, — “in the highest.” Μεγαλωσύνη ἐν ὐψηλοῖς is ὐψίστος;
            that is, עֶלְיוֹן, “the Highest,” God himself. See Lk 1:35. [3]

            [3]— ED. VARIOUS READINGS. — Owen, though perhaps it is a misprint,
            reads αὐτοῦ after ὑποστάσεως both in the text of the verse and in
            the subsequent explanation of the words; the textus receptus has
            αὐτοῦ. He reads δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ in agreement with the textus
            receptus; Tischendorf here gives αὐτοῦ. The words δι᾿ ἑαυτοῦ are
            omitted by Lachmann and Tischendorf; who, together with Hahn, omit
            ἡμων also. EXPOSITION. — ᾿Απαύγ. τ. δ. plainly means the same as the
            Hebrew כָבוֹד, namely, splendor, brightness. Comp. Lk 2:9,” etc. —
            Stuart. “The idea that God in the Λόγος finds and reflects himself
            as in his counterpart is expressed by Paul when, 2 Cor 4:4, Col
            1:15, he calls the Logos εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ, denotes the splendor which
            surrounds God, Lk 2:9.” — Tholuck. “Nouns ending in μα denote not
            the act as continuing, but the result of the act as finished.
            ᾿Απαύγ. denotes not the brightness received from another body, and
            thrown back as a reflection or a mirrored image, not the light
            continually proceeding from a shining body, as a light streaming out
            and losing itself in space; but a light radiated from another light,
            in as far at it is viewed as now become an independent light. It is
            more than a mere ray, more than a mere image, — a sun produced from
            the original light.” Δόξ., “the eternal essential glory of the
            Father.” According to the explanation which refers it to the
            Shechinah, “the Son would be degraded beneath the Old Testament
            imperfect typical form of the divine manifestation; seeing that he
            would be represented as an ἀπαύγ of the latter, which was not even
            itself an ἀπαύγ., but a mere reflection.” — Ebrard. Χαρακ. τ. ὑ. α.
            plainly retains the more ancient meaning of substance or essence....
            Christ is “the development of that substance to our view, the
            delineation of it.... Ancient Greek annotators, and after them most
            of the modern ones, have applied these words to the divine nature of
            Christ. In the opinion that the verse now under consideration
            relates to the incarnate Messiah, I find that Scott and Beza
            concur.” — Stuart. “ ῾Ψπ. means being, essence. Many expositors,
            offended at the Son being called only the copy of the Being, took
            ὑπ. in the sense adopted by the church, of Person.” — Tholuck. Δόξ
            signifies the essence of the Father,with reference to the glory in
            which he represents himself before the eyes of the suppliant
            creature; ὑπ., this essence as essence, and without regard to its
            outward manifestation. Χαρ. is here used “in the sense of a form cut
            out or engraven.” The δόξ represents itself in a form composed of
            rays, a sun; the ὑπ. stamps itself out in a manifest figure. These
            appositions belong more properly to the Logos qua eternally
            pre-existent. — Ebrard.

            Φέρ. corresponds to the Hebrew נָשָׁאIsa_46:3; Isa_66:9, curo,
            conservo, to sustain, to preserve, as a mother does her child. Τῷ
            ῥήμ. τ. δ. α., by his own powerful word, the word of the Son, not
            the word of God, as αὐτοῦ would mean. — Stuart. According to Bleek,
            αὐτοῦ corresponds to ἐμαυτοῦ of the first person, αὐτοῦ to ἐμου. If
            the former, the emphasis being on “self,” the phrase would be, By
            the word of his own power.” “There is no occasion for this emphasis
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Αὐτοῦ applies in a reflexive sense to the Son, and not to the
            Father.” — Ebrard. Καθ., purification; in Hellenistic Greek
            expiation, e.g., Exo_29:36; Exo_30:10 not purification by moral
            means, because it is joined with δι᾿ ἑαυτοῦ, which is explained in
            Heb 2:14 by διὰ τοῦ ζανάτου; in Heb 9:12 by διὰ τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος;
            and in Heb 9:26 by διὰ τῆς ζυσίας αὐτοῦ. — Stuart. “The purification
            in the Biblical sense consists in the atonement, the gracious
            covering (כַפֵר Lev_16:30) of guilt.” — Ebrard. ᾿Εκάθ. corresponds
            to the Hebrew יָשַׁב; which applied to God and to kings, does not
            mean simply to sit, but to sit enthroned, Ps 2:4.— Stuart. “As man,
            and continuing to be man, he was exalted to a participation in the
            divine government of the world.” — Ebrard. TRANSLATIONS. — ᾿Απαύγ.

            Τοσούτῳ κρείττων γενὸμενος τῶν ἀγγέλων, ὅσῳ διαφορώτερον παρ᾿ αὐτοὺς
            κεκληρονόμηκεν ὄνομα.
          </p>
          <p>
            Τοσούτῳ κρείττων γενόμενος Syr. וְהָנָא כֻּלֵהּ יִרֵב“Et ipse tantum
            praestantior fuit,” Boderian.; — “And he was so much more
            excellent.” “At tanto potior factus est,” Tremel.; — “And he is made
            so much more better.” “At ipse toto excellit;” or, as De Dieu, “At
            hoc totum excellit;” — “And he wholly excelleth;” or, “in all things
            he excelleth.” Vulg. “Tanto melior factus angelis.” The translation
            of κρείττων by “melior” is blamed by Erasmus, Beza, Vatablus, and is
            generally deserted by the expositors of the Roman church; and it is
            hard, if not impossible, to find “melior” in any good author used in
            the sense that κρείττων is here and elsewhere constantly applied
            unto. Ours render the word “better,” “made better;” to avoid, I
            believe, a coincidence with that which they express διαφορώτερον by,
            “more excellent.” Κρείττων is properly “nobilior,” “potentior,”
            “praestantior,” “excellentior,” — “more powerful,” “able,”
            “excellent,” as to love, honor, or state and condition; as in that
            of Homer, Il. A. 80, —
          </p>
          <p>
            Κρεισσων γὰρ βασιλεὺς ὅτε χώσεται ἀνδρὶ χέρηι. That is, πολλὸν
            ἀρείων, saith Eustathius, “multo potentior,” — “more powerful,”
            “able to prevail,” or “more excellent.” Γενόμενος, “factus,”
            “effectus,” — “made,” “was,” “became.” Διαφορώτερον, “differentius”
            — “ different;” which is sometimes put absolutely for the best
            things, orthings far better than other things that differ: “make to
            differ,” to prefer, make better, 1 Cor 4:7. Syr.
            דַמְיַתַּר“excellentius,” — “more excellent.” Διαφέρω is both to
            differ and excel; but the “differentius” of the Vulgar yields no
            good sense in this place. Κεκληρονόμηκε, “haereditavit,” “sortitus
            est,” “jure hereditario obtinuit;” of the importance of which word
            before. [4]
          </p>
          <p>
            [4] EXPOSITION. — The comparison of the Son with angels divides
            itself into two sections; — the Son is superior to the angels
            already, in virtue of his eternal existence as the Son of God, Heb
            1:4-14; in the Son, man also has been exalted above the angels, Heb
            2:5-18. — Ebrard. Γενόμ, points out that this exaltation is true not
            only of the Logos in abstracto, but of the whole divine-human
            subject. — Tholuck. The aorist, “having been made” or “become,” is
            antithetic to the present ὤν, “being,” in 1 Cor 4:3. — Turner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name “sons of God” is given to angels. But it is a different
            thing to apply a common name in the plural to a class, from what it
            is to apply the same as an individual name in the singular to an
            individual. When Jehovah, in Ps 2:2; Ps 2:7, declares his anointed
            to be his Son whom he has begotten, this is something different from
            what is said, when the angels as a class are called sons of the
            Elohim who has created them. — Ebrard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Κρείτ. refers to superiority in rank or dignity. The term “better”
