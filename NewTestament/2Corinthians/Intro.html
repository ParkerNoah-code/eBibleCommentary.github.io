        <h2>CONTENTS</h2>
        <p>
          The contents of this Epistle are naturally divided into three parts:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Review of Pauls Relation’s with the Corinthians, 2Co_1:1-24,
          2Co_2:1-17, 2Co_3:1-18, 2Co_4:1-18, 2Co_5:1-21, 2Co_6:1-18,
          2Co_7:1-16. After the usual epistolary introduction, 2Co_1:1-11, the
          apostle vindicates himself with respect to the change in his intended
          visit, and with reference to what he had written respecting the
          offender, 2Co_1:12-24, 2Co_2:1-13. Having done this, he takes up the
          discussion of the apostleship. In the first place he considers the
          office of an apostle, comparing the ministry of the Law with that of
          the Gospel, 2Co_3:6-18, and vindicating his own position as an apostle
          of the New Covenant, 2Co_2:14-17, 2Co_3:5; 2Co_4:1-6. Then he treats
          of the sufferings of an apostle which are inseparably connected with
          his work, but are alleviated by the hope of future glory, 2Co_4:7-18,
          2Co_5:1-10. Next the life of an apostle passes the review, which finds
          its constraining motive in the love of Christ, has its spiritual basis
          in the life of the Redeemer, and is marked by sufferings, dishonor and
          poverty, on the one hand; but also by longsuffering and kindness, by
          knowledge and righteousness, on the other, 2Co_5:11-21, 2Co_6:10. This
          is followed up by an appeal of the apostle to the Corinthians that
          they should give him place in their hearts, and should not be
          unequally yoked together with unbelievers, 2Co_6:11-18, 2Co_7:1-4.
          Finally the apostle tells the Corinthians that he had been comforted
          greatly by the coming of Titus, by whom his fears that the former
          letter might have estranged them, were allayed and made place for
          rejoicing, 2Co_7:5-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Collection for the Judean Christians, 2Co_8:1-24, 2Co_9:1-15.
          The apostle points the Corinthians to the example of the Macedonians
          who gave abundantly for the poor at Jerusalem, 2Co_8:1-7; and to the
          example of Christ who became poor that the Corinthians might be
          enriched, 2Co_8:8-15. He commends to them Titus and the two brethren
          that are sent with him to gather the collection, 2Co_8:16-24; and
          exhorts them to give abundantly for this worthy cause, 2Co_9:1-15.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Pauls Vindication of his Apostleship, 2Co_10:1-18, 2Co_11:1-33,
          2Co_12:1-21, 2Co_13:1-14. In this part Paul deals directly with his
          opponents. First of all he points out that the ministry entrusted to
          him also extended to the Corinthians, 2Co_9:1-15. Then he replies to
          his opponents that he had been perfectly loyal to the cause of Christ,
          2Co_11:1-6; that he had not dealt deceitfully with the Corinthians,
          when he refused support from them, 2Co_11:7-15; that he had far
          greater things in which to glory than they could boast of,
          2Co_11:16-33, 2Co_12:1-10; and that it had never been and was not now
          his aim to make a gain of the Corinthians, 2Co_12:11-18. Finally he
          gives them warnings in view of his coming visit, and closes his
          epistle with final salutations and benediction, 2Co_12:19-21,
          2Co_13:1-13.
        </p>
        <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>
          1. II Corinthians is one of the most personal and the least doctrinal
          of all the letters of Paul, except the one written to Philemon. The
          doctrinal element is not altogether wanting; the great truths of
          salvation find expression in it, as well as in the other letters of
          the apostle; but, though they enter into its composition, they have a
          subordinate place and are, as it were, eclipsed by its large personal
          element, in which we see the very heart of the apostle, with all its
          varying moods of courage and anxiety, of love and aversion, of hope
          and disappointment. Alford says: “Consolation and rebuke, gentleness
          and severity, earnestness and irony succeed one another at very short
          intervals and without notice.”
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The second characteristic of this Epistle is closely connected with
          the preceding one; it is the most unsystematic of all the letters of
          Paul. How greatly it differs in this respect from the Epistle to the
          Romans and from First Corinthians, becomes perfectly evident, when one
          attempts to give an outline of the contents. This irregularity is due
          to the fact that in this letter we do not find a calm discussion of
          doctrinal subjects or of certain phases of Christian life, but above
          all an impassioned self-defense against unjust charges and calumnies
          and insinuations. However humble the apostle may be, and though he may
          regard himself as the least of all the saints, yet in this letter he
          finds himself constrained to boast of his sufferings and of his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The language of this Epistle has been judged variously, some
          criticizing it severely and others praising its excellencies. We
          cannot deny that it is more rugged and harsh, more obscure and
          difficult of interpretation than we are accustomed to in Paul’s other
          writings. “Parentheses and digressions often intersect the narrative
          and disturb its sequence.” (Davidson) Meyer says beautifully: “The
          excitement and varied play of emotion with which Paul wrote this
          letter, probably also in haste, certainly make the expression not
          seldom obscure and the sentences less flexible, but only heighten our
          admiration of the great delicacy, skill and power with which this
          outpouring of Paul’s spirit and heart, possessing as a defense of
          himself a high and peculiar interest, flows and gushes on, till
          finally, in the last part, wave on wave overwhelms the hostile
          resistance.” Comm. p. 412.
        </p>
        <h2>AUTHORSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          The external testimony to the authorship of Paul is inferior to that
          of I Corinthians; yet it is so strong that it leaves no room for
          honest doubt. Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and many
          others, from all parts of the early Church, quote it by name.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even if this were not so strong, internal evidence would be quite
          sufficient to settle the question of authenticity. In the first place
          the Epistle claims to be a product of the great apostle. In the second
          place it is written in a style that is in many respects
          characteristically Pauline, notwithstanding its unique features; it
          contains the doctrine of salvation, as we are wont to hear it
          proclaimed by the apostle of the Gentiles; and it reveals his
          character, as no other Epistle does. And in the third place the
          thought of this Epistle is closely interwoven with that of I
          Corinthians. In 1Co_16:5 Paul speaks of his plan of travel, and in
          2Co_1:15-24 he comments on it; in 1 Corinthians 5 he urges that
          discipline be applied to the incestuous person, and in 2Co_2:5-11 he
          says, with reference to this case, that they have inflicted sufficient
          punishment, and restrains their evident severity; respecting the
          collection for the Judean Christians which he enjoins on the
          Corinthians in 1Co_16:14, he gives further directions in 2Co_8:1-24,
          2Co_9:1-15; to the Judaizers who cast doubt on his apostleship he
          refers in 1Co_4:1-21, 1Co_9:1-27, and speaks of them more at length in
          2Co_10:1-18, 2Co_11:1-33, 2Co_12:1-21, 1Co_13:1-14.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authenticity of the Epistle too was attacked by Bruno Bauer and by
          the Dutch critics that we mentioned in connection with the first
          Epistle. But their work failed to convince anyone but themselves.
          Godet truly says: “—the scholars who cannot discern, across these
          pages, the living personality of St. Paul, must have lost in the work
          of the study, the sense for realities.” Introd. to the N. T. I p. 337.
        </p>
        <h2>COMPOSITION</h2>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. In order to understand the occasion that
          induced Paul to write this Epistle to the Corinthians, we must bring
          it in connection with the first letter, which was in all probability
          borne to Corinth by Titus, Paul’s spiritual son. After it had gone
          forth, the apostle pondered on what he had written in that letter, and
          it caused him some uneasiness of mind, 2Co_7:8. He reflected that he
          had written in a rather severe strain regarding the divisions at
          Corinth and the incestuous person, and feared for a time that his
          words might be misconstrued, that his letter might create a false
          impression, and that his severity might provoke resentment and thus
          injure the cause of the gospel that lay so near to his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are aware that some scholars, as Hausrath, Schmiedel, Kennedy,
          Baljon, Findlay, Robertson (in Hastings D. B.) and Davidson hold that
          2Co_2:4; 2Co_2:9; 2Co_7:8 refer to a second lost epistle of Paul, the
          so-called Painful Letter; but with Zahn, Holtzmann and Bernard (in
          Expositors Gk. Test.) we believe it to be a rather gratuitous
          assumption that such an epistle ever existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly after Paul had sent I Corinthians, he left Ephesus for Troas,
          where a splendid opportunity for work offered. Yet he was keenly
          disappointed, for he had expected to find Titus there with tidings
          from Corinth; and when he did not find him, his very anxiety caused
          him to sail for Macedonia that he might meet his beloved brother and
          co-laborer the sooner and be reassured by him, 2Co_2:12-13. The mere
          change of the field of labor brought him no relief, for he says: “When
          we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were
          troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.”
          7:5. Soon, however, he was comforted by the coming of Titus, 2Co_7:6;
          the painful uncertainty now made place for calm assurance, yea even
          for joy and thanksgiving. But his happiness was not unalloyed, since
          the report of Titus was not altogether favorable. The Corinthian
          congregation as a whole had taken kindly to the warnings and
          directions of the previous letter. The words of reproof had made a
          deep impression on them, had saddened their hearts, had filled them
          with sorrow,—but it was a godly sorrow that worked repentance. Hence
          the apostle had occasion to rejoice and did rejoice, 2Co_7:7-16. The
          enemies of Paul, however, had been embittered by the former Epistle
          and had increased their sinister work, attempting to undermine the
          apostolic authority of Paul by charging that he was fickle and
          vacillating, 2Co_1:15-24; that he was controlled by fleshly motives,
          2Co_10:2; that he was bold at a distance, but cowardly, when present,
          2Co_10:10; that he was dealing deceitfully with the Corinthians even
          in taking no support from them, 2Co_11:7-12; and that he had not shown
          himself an apostle by his works, 2Co_12:11-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question may be asked to which one of the four parties mentioned
          in I Corinthians the enemies belong with which the apostle deals in
          2Co_10:1-18, 2Co_11:1-33, 2Co_12:1-21, 1Co_13:1-14. It is quite clear,
          and scholars are generally agreed, that they were in the main, if not
          exclusively, ultra-Judaists. But there is no such unanimity in
          classifying them with one of the divisions of which the first Epistle
          speaks. Following F. C. Baur many, such as Baljon, Davidson, Weiss,
          identify them with those whose watchword was: “I am of Christ!”
          Others, however, as Meyer and Zahn regard them as belonging to the
          party that professed special allegiance to Peter. To this view we give
          preference; however, with the provisos that in this letter Paul does
          not deal with the whole party, but rather with its leaders, who had
          probably come from Judaea with letters of commendation, 2Co_3:1, and
          whom Paul qualifies as “false apostles, deceitful workers,
          transforming themselves in apostles of Christ,” 2Co_11:13 ;—and that
          it is quite possible that some of his words refer to those who,
          ignoring and despising all human authority, claimed to be of Christ,
          and did not uphold the honor and faithfulness of the apostle against
          the false teachers. Cf. 2Co_10:7.
        </p>
        <p>
          This being the situation at Corinth, when the apostle wrote his second
          letter, he was naturally led to write with a twofold purpose. In the
          first place it was his desire to express his gratitude for the way in
          which the Corinthians had received his former letter, and to inform
          them of the joy he experienced, when they had manifested their
          willingness to mend their ways and had been filled with godly sorrow.
          And in the second place he considered it incumbent on him to defend
          his apostleship against the calumnies and the malignant attacks of the
          Judaeistic adversaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. In view of the account we have given of the course
          of events that followed the writing of 1 Corinthians, it is not very
          difficult to establish approximately both the time and the place of
          writing. We may assume that, in accordance with the plan expressed in
          1Co_15:8, the apostle remained at Ephesus until Pentecost of A. D. 57.
          On leaving Ephesus he went to Troas, from where he crossed over to
          Macedonia. There he soon met Titus, presumably in the summer of that
          same year, and therefore some time before he was ready to visit
          Corinth, and received information from him regarding the condition of
          the Corinthian church. Overjoyed by what he heard, but at the same
          time apprehending the danger that lurked in the agitation of the
          Judaizers, he immediately wrote II Corinthians, and sent it to Corinth
          by the hand of Titus, who was accompanied on his journey by two of the
          brethren, whose names are not recorded, 2Co_8:18; 2Co_8:22. The letter
          was written, therefore, in the summer of A. D. 57, somewhere in
          Macedonia.
        </p>
        <h2>INTEGRITY</h2>
        <p>
          The integrity of the letter has been attacked especially on two
          points. It is claimed by some that the verses 6:14—7:1 do not belong,
          where they stand, but form an awkward interruption in the course of
          thought. A few scholars regard them as a part of the lost letter to
          which 1Co_5:9 refers. Now it is true that at first sight these verses
          seem out of place, where they stand, but at the same time it is very
          well possible to give a plausible explanation for their insertion at
          this point. Cf. Meyer, Alford, Expositors Greek Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several critics opine that 2Co_10:1-18, 2Co_11:1-33, 2Co_12:1-21,
          1Co_13:1-14 did not originally form a part of this letter. Hausrath
          and Schmiedel advocated the theory that they constituted a part of the
          so-called Painful letter that intervened between I and II Corinthians.
          The reasons why they would separate this section from the other nine
          chapters, are the following: (1) 2Co_10:1-18 begins with the words
          Αὐτός δὲ ἐγὼ Παῦλος, which δὲ marks these words as an antithesis to
          something that is not found in the preceding. (2) The tone of the
          apostle in these last chapters is strikingly different from that in
          the other nine; from a calm and joyful tone it has changed to one of
          stern rebuke and of sharp invective. (3) Certain passages found in the
          first part point back to statements that are found in the last
          chapters, and thus prove that these are part of a previous letter.
          Thus 2Co_2:3 refers to 2Co_13:10; 2Co_1:23 to 2Co_13:2; and 2Co_2:9 to
          2Co_10:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to these arguments we may reply, in the first place, that δὲ often
          does no more than mark the transition to a new subject (cf. 1Co_15:1;
          2Co_8:1); in the second place, that the change of tone need not
          surprise us, if we take in consideration the possibility that Paul did
          not write the whole Epistle at a single sitting and therefore in the
          same mood; and the fact that in the last chapters he deals more
          particularly with the false teachers among the Corinthians; and in the
          third place, that the passages referred to do not necessitate the
          construction put on them by the above named critics. Moreover, if we
          adopt the theory that another letter intervened between our two
          canonical Epistles. we are led to a very complicated scheme of Pauls
          transactions with Corinth, a scheme so complicated that it is its own
          condemnation.
        </p>
        <h2>CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <p>
          The ancient Church was unanimous in accepting the Epistle as a part of
          the Word of God. Of the apostolic fathers Polycarp plainly quotes it.
          Marcion included it in his canon, and it is also named in the
          Muratorian Fragment. The Syriac and old Latin Versions contain it, and
          the three great witnesses of the end of the second century quote it by
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Epistle too has permanent value for the Church of God. It is
          inseparably connected with I Corinthians, and as such also brings out
          that it is not the wisdom of the world but the foolishness of the
          cross that saves; and sheds further light on the application of
          Christian principles to social relations. More than any other Epistle
          it reveals to us the apostles personality, and is therefore a great
          psychological aid in the interpretation of his writings. It also has
          considerable doctrinal interest in that it exhibits a part of the
          apostles eschatology, 4:16—5:8; brings out the contrast between the
          letter and the spirit, 3:6-18; describes the beneficent influence of
          the glory of Christ, 3:18—A:6; and contains an explicit statement of
          the reconciliation and renovation wrought by Christ, 5:17-21.
