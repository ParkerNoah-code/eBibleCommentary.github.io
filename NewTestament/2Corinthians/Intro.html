        <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          The ancient Church was unanimous in accepting the Epistle as a part of
          the Word of God. Of the apostolic fathers Polycarp plainly quotes it.
          Marcion included it in his canon, and it is also named in the
          Muratorian Fragment. The Syriac and old Latin Versions contain it, and
          the three great witnesses of the end of the second century quote it by
          name.
        </p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>
          This Epistle too has permanent value for the Church of God. It is
          inseparably connected with I Corinthians, and as such also brings out
          that it is not the wisdom of the world but the foolishness of the
          cross that saves; and sheds further light on the application of
          Christian principles to social relations. More than any other Epistle
          it reveals to us the apostles personality, and is therefore a great
          psychological aid in the interpretation of his writings. It also has
          considerable doctrinal interest in that it exhibits a part of the
          apostles eschatology, 4:16—5:8; brings out the contrast between the
          letter and the spirit, 3:6-18; describes the beneficent influence of
          the glory of Christ, 3:18—A:6; and contains an explicit statement of
          the reconciliation and renovation wrought by Christ, 5:17-21.
