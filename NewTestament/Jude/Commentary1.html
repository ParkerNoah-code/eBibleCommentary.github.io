              >Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those
              who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and kept for Jesus
              Christ:</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ</em>. Jude, the brother of the
            Lord. And though a brother of Jesus by the flesh, he calls himself
            "a servant of Jesus Christ." Though this is a title common to all
            believers, yet here, and in some other places, it is peculiar to an
            apostle, or minister of the Gospel; and therefore is used not merely
            in humility, and to acknowledge obedience to Christ, but as a title
            of dignity and honour.
          </p>
          <p>
            And, no doubt, he who declares himself to be the servant of God,
            includes both these things, that is, that God is the bestower of the
            office which he exercises, and that he faithfully performs what has
            been committed to him. Many act falsely, and falsely boast to be
            what they are very far from being: we ought always to examine
            whether the reality corresponds with the profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And brother of James</em>. He mentions a name more celebrated
            than his own, and more known to the churches. For though
            faithfulness of doctrine and authority do not depend on the names of
            mortal men, yet it is a confirmation to the faith, when the
            integrity of the man who undertakes the office of a teacher is made
            certain to us. This James must have been well known as to need no
            further description; and there was but one James at that time of
            whom this could be said, namely James the brother of the Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To those who are called</em>. Not merely externally by the
            ministry of the word, but internally by the Spirit and grace of God;
            so that this is to be understood of a special and effectual call,
            whereby souls are called out of darkness into light, and from
            bondage to liberty; and from a dependence on themselves to the grace
            and righteousness of Christ; and from society with the men of the
            world to fellowship with him; and to eternal glory, so as to have
            faith and hope concerning it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Sanctified by God the Father</em>. Which is to be understood not
            of internal sanctification, which is usually ascribed to the Spirit
            of God, but of the act of eternal election, which is peculiar to God
            the Father; in which sense Christ is said to be sanctified by the
            Father, and men ordained and appointed to an office, and vessels are
            set apart the owner's use (Jn 10:36 and Jer 1:5). The language is
            taken from the ceremonial law, by which persons and things were
            sanctified, or set apart for sacred use and service (Ex 13:2);
          </p>
          <p>
            So the elect of God are by God the Father sanctified and set apart
            in the act of election, which is expressed by this word; partly
            because of its separating nature, men being by it separated from the
            rest of the world, to the use and service of God, and for his glory,
            so that they are a distinct and peculiar people; and partly because
            such are chosen through sanctification of the Spirit, and unto
            holiness both in this world and that which is to come; so that the
            doctrine of election is no licentious doctrine; for though holiness
            is not the cause of it, yet is a means fixed in it, and is certain
            by it, and an evidence of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And kept for Jesus Christ</em>. They were not preserved from
            falling in Adam, with the rest of mankind, nor from the corruption
            of human nature, nor from actual sins and transgressions; yet,
            notwithstanding these, were so preserved that the law could not
            execute the sentence of condemnation on them, nor sin damn them, nor
            Satan, who led them captive, hale them to prison; and after calling,
            they are preserved not from indwelling sin, nor from the temptations
            of Satan, nor from doubts and fears and unbelief, nor from slips and
            falls into sin; but from the tyranny and dominion of sin, from being
            devoured by Satan, and from a total and final falling away. They are
            preserved in the love of God, and of Christ; in the covenant of
            grace; in a state of justification and adoption; and in the paths of
            truth, faith, and holiness; and are preserved safe to the heavenly
            kingdom and glory.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 2.
            <em>May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>May mercy</em>. In this salutation the apostle wishes for a
            multiplication of "mercy", from God the Father, by whom these
            persons were sanctified: mercy is a perfection in God; and shows
            itself in a special manner towards the elect, in the covenant of
            grace, in the provision of Christ as a Saviour, in the mission of
            him into this world, in redemption by him, in the forgiveness of
            sin, in regeneration, and in their whole salvation; and the
            multiplication of it intends an enlarged view and fresh application
            of it, which they sometimes stand in need of, as under desertions,
            when they want the sense and manifestation of it to them; and under
            temptations and afflictions, when they need sympathy and compassion;
            and when they fall into sin they stand in need of the fresh
            discoveries and application of pardoning mercy to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Peace</em>. Moreover, herein is wished for a multiplication of
            "peace" from Christ, in whom these chosen ones were preserved; and
            may design a fresh and enlarged view of peace being made for them by
            his blood, and an increase of conscience peace in their own hearts,
            as the effect of it; and may include peace, and an abundance of it,
            among themselves, as well as all prosperity, both external,
            internal, and eternal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And love be multiplied to you</em>. Likewise in the salutation,
            "love", and a multiplication of it is wished for from the Spirit of
            God, by whom they were called; and may be understood of the love
            with which God loved them; and which may be said to be multiplied,
            when it is gradually shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, and
            they are by degrees led into it more and more, and the acts of it
            are drawn out and set before them one after another, and fresh
            manifestations of it are made unto them; as in afflictive
            providences, after the hidings of God's face, and under temptations:
            and it may design the love with which they love God, which may be
            increased and made to abound more and more.

              They were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is

            Jude doesn't call himself an apostle, as Paul and Peter had, but a

              "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set
              apart for the Good News of God, which he promised before through
              his prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning his Son" (Rom
              1:1-3).
            </p>
            <p>
              "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
              twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings." (James
              1:1).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who
              have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness
              of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ" (2 Pet 1:1).

            The natural relationship of Jude to Jesus is subordinate to the
            spiritual:

          <section>
            <p>
              "It came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of
              the multitude lifted up her voice and said to him, 'Blessed is the
              womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!' But he
              said, 'On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of
              God, and keep it.'" (Lk 11:27-28).
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Calling has roots in election and the eternal plan of God and is
            closely linked with sanctification:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "But we are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers
              loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for
              salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the
              truth, to which he called you through our Good News, for the
              obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ." (2 Thes
              2:13-14).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from
              my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, to reveal his
              Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t
              immediately confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to
              Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away
              into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus." (Gal 1:15-17).
            </p>
            <p>
              "We know that all things work together for good for those who love
              God, for those who are called according to his purpose. For whom
              he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of
              his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. Whom
              he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he
              also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified." (Rom

              Christ, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the
              world, that we would be holy and without defect before him in
              love, having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus
              Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,
              to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely gave
              us favor in the Beloved." (Eph 1:3-6).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
              yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, that no one would
              boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for
              good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them."

              all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the
              knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue, by
              which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great
              promises; that through these you may become partakers of the
              divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the

              my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
              salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you

          </h2>
          <p>
            Servant (δοῦλος, doulos). Precisely as James (James 1:1), only James
            added kuriou (Lord). Probably not here in the wider sense, in which
            all Christians are servants of Christ—but in that special sense in
            which those were bound to His service who were employed in the
            preaching and disseminating of His word.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brother of James (adelphos Iakōbou). Thus Jude identifies himself.
            But not the “Judas of James” (Lk 6:16; Acts 1:13).
          </p>
          <p>
            To them that are called (tois - klētois). But this translation
            (treating klētois as a substantive like Rom 1:6; 1 Cor 1:24) is by
            no means certain as two participles come in between tois and
            klētois. Klētois may be in the predicate position (being called),
            not attributive. But see 1 Pet 1:1. In the sense of St. Paul:
            effectually drawn by God the Father to the knowledge of the Gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beloved in God the Father (en theōi patri ēgapēmenois). Perfect
            passive participle of agapaō, but no precise parallel to this use of
            en with agapaō. The only allowable sense of ἐν seems to be, “in the
            case of,” “as regards,” understanding of course that the love of the
            Father is spoken of. St. Paul ordinarily in his greetings adds ἡμῶν
            to θεὸς πατήρ, cf. Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:3; 2 Cor 1:2; Eph 1:2; Php 1:2;
            Col 1:2; 2 Thes 1:1; Phm 1:3. But he has θεὸς πατήρ absolutely in
            the following places; Gal 1:1-2; Eph 6:23; Php 2:11; 2 Thes 1:2; 1
            Tim 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2; Titus 1:4; as also St. Peter, 1 Pet 1:2; 2 Pet
            1:17; St. John, 2 Jn 1:3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kept for Jesus Christ (Iēsou Christōi tetērēmenois). Perfect passive
            participle again with dative, unless it is the instrumental, “kept
            by Jesus Christ,” a quite possible interpretation. Reserved, to be
            His at the day of His coming: the dative is commodi. If the question
            be asked, kept by whom? the answer must be, by God the Father:
            though constructionally the words are not connected.

          <p>
            All three proceeding from God: God’s mercy, God’s peace, God’s love:
            see Jude 1:21. In the somewhat similar passage, Eph 6:23, εἰρήνη
            τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς κ. ἀγάπη μετὰ πίστεως ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρὸς κ. κυρίου Ἰησοῦ
            χριστοῦ, the love and faith are clearly, in themselves, the gift of
            God: mutual love or love towards God.

          <h2>A Special Benediction</h2>
          <p>
            “Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
            that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus
            Christ, and called: mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be
            multiplied.” — Jude 1, 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those were troublous times in which Jude wrote this very forcible
            Epistle. The first early days of Christianity, with all the
            spring-time of the singing of birds and the blossoming of flowers,
            had passed away. There had come times of trial for everyone; but
            worst of all were the troubles within the church.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unawares, evil men had been admitted into membership. The human
            mind, always acting like leaven, had begun to corrupt even the truth
            of the gospel; so that, where there had once been an unadulterated,
            unmingled preaching of the cross of Christ, there had come in a
            savour of Gnosticism and other philosophies of the day, and with all
            the error there had also come a tendency to tone down the high
            spirituality, the deep sanctity, of Christian life. So the children
            of God, who truly cared for him and walked with him, were very sad
            at heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suppose that Paul had gone home to his reward. John still
            lingered, and perhaps James and Peter also; but when the time came
            for Peter to write his second Epistle, the day was darkening down,
            and when Jude took up his pen, and wrote this short Epistle, the
            times were getting darker and darker, and great forebodings of evil
            were in the hearts of God’s servants,— forebodings which were only
            removed by their joyous faith in him who had gone from them, and who
            would, by-and-by, come again without a sin-offering unto salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Epistle, therefore, seems to me to fit our times, which are not
            altogether unlike those of which I have been speaking; and the
            apostle might have been writing yesterday, so appropriate are his
            words to the evils of the present age. If Jude were living now, he
            might have to deal with a different form of evil; but, at the
            bottom, it would really be the same evil as that of which he wrote,
            the same mischievous root of bitterness which, springing up in our
            days, troubles us, and thereby many are defiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought, as I read this Epistle through, that Jude seems to take
            the right view of things, namely, that the proper way of meeting
            evils in the church is by dealing with the church itself, dealing
            with the truly faithful members of the church, and speaking to those
            who really are “sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus
            Christ, and called,” stirring them up to seek the highest degree of
            spiritual strength, and pleading for them that mercy and peace and
            love may be multiplied to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have to visit infected places, it may help you to ward off
            disease if you yourself are vigorous and full of health. The best
            protection against surrounding evil will be the cultivation of a
            right state of heart and life, a continual growth in grace and in
            the knowledge of the Lord. That wind which may upset yonder boat
            with its butterfly sails, may do no mischief whatever to the barque
            which is well ballasted, and fitted to weather the gale. Be yourself
            right; listen to the word of wisdom which says, “Take heed unto
            thyself, and unto the doctrine,” and when these two matters are as
            they should be, then every wind of error which blows hither and
            thither will but little affect you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such I take it is the run of this Epistle, and the opening verses
            are a fit preface thereto. I am going to speak of these two verses
            under three heads. First, here is a special man: “Jude, the servant
            of Jesus Christ, and brother of James.” Next, the Epistle is written
            to special persons: “to them that are sanctified by God the Father,
            and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called.” Then, thirdly, it
            contains a special benediction: “Mercy unto you, and peace, and love
            be multiplied.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >I. First of all, it does seem to me that the apostle who wrote
              this Epistle was A SPECIAL MAN.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Jude evidently wished to set himself apart from the general mass of
            those who were apostatizing, and to make it known that he himself
            was strong in the faith, and remaining faithful to his Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, it seems as if every word of his own title has a speciality
            about it. There is something special in his name. He begins his
            Epistle with his own name: “Jude.” Among the members of a certain
            denomination that I need not name, there is a practice of using
            initials when they write a book. I never find any instance of that
            custom in Scripture. “G.B.” did not write an Epistle; and neither
            “A.B.” nor “X.Y.Z.” has favoured us with any book of Holy Scripture.
            Names, however, are not always used; we have no name at the
            commencement of the Epistle to the Hebrews, for no writer in the Old
            or the New Testament gloried in his own name. Still, they were not
            ashamed of their names, and since they were bound to make an open
            confession of their faith, it is as well that they used their names
            at the beginning of their writings.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Epistle was written by Jude, that is to say, by Judas, but not
            Iscariot; and herein lies the speciality of his name. This Judas was
            not the son of perdition, but a true son of God, a sincere and
            earnest-hearted believer. Yet, when he wrote his own name down,
            Judas, which we pronounce short as “Jude,” I think that the tears
            must have come to his eyes as he remembered that other Judas,— with
            the same name, ay, and by birth with the same nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            If left to himself, he might have proved a traitor to his Master,
            like the other Judas; but grace had made him to differ from the man
            who betrayed his Lord. If it had been your case or mine, I am sure
            that we could not have written down that name without reflecting
            upon our obligations to the sovereign grace of God which kept us
            from being sons of perdition.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There goes John Bradford but for the grace of God,” is a saying
            often quoted; and there would have gone this other Judas but for the
            grace of God that restrained him. You remember how particular the
            Holy Spirit is that we should not mistake this Judas for Judas
            Iscariot, for when he asked of Jesus, “Lord, how is it that thou
            wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?” the Holy
            Spirit records the name of the questioner as “Judas, not Iscariot.”
          </p>
          <p>
            No, “not Iscariot.” What a mercy for you that, though some other of
            your name may have fallen into gross sin, you have been preserved!
            But as you recollect your own name, and remember how often that name
            has been defiled by others who at first were your companions in your
            childhood, thank God that he has kept you from falling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not even think of your name without thinking of that name which
            is above all names, by which your name has been rescued from the
            Stygian bog, and placed in the book of the children of God among
            those whose names are written in heaven. So, you see, there was
            something special even about the name of Jude.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was something equally or still more special in his office.
            “Jude— Judas— the servant of Jesus Christ.” Our Revised Version very
            properly puts in the margin “bondservant of Jesus Christ”; and it is
            very beautiful to see how, in the original, these servants of Jesus
            Christ delighted to set forth the completeness of their service, and
            to declare how perfectly they belonged to Christ. They were not
            servants that could come and go at their own pleasure, but they were
            bondservants of Jesus Christ. Though there were no free men on earth
            more truly free than they, yet these servants of Jesus Christ
            delighted in wearing chains of love which were soft as silk yet
            stronger than steel. They rejoiced to feel that they had no liberty
            to run away from Christ; their desire was to have their ear bored to
            the door-post of his house, to be his servants through their whole
            lifetime, and throughout eternity. This is what the apostle meant
            when he wrote, “Jude, the bondservant of Jesus Christ.”
          </p>
          <p>
            You know how persons came to be bondservants in the olden time,
            according to Jewish practice. They were bondservants by purchase.
            When anyone had bought a slave with his money, the poor man was
            reckoned as belonging to him. So, we are not our own, we were bought
            with a price; we were not redeemed with corruptible things, such as
            silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
            without blemish and without spot. The fine gentry in the ministry of
            the present day turn up their noses at this truth, and say that it
            is a mercantile idea. So it is, and we are not ashamed to have it
            so. “Ye are bought with a price,” wrote the apostle Paul to the
            Corinthians, as if to make it clear beyond all question that it was
            really so; and you and I feel that we too have been bought and paid
            for, and that is one reason why we belong to Christ. We henceforth
            feel that we have no ownership rights over ourselves; yet we rejoice
            that we have that which is much more valuable, for we can each one
            say, with Thomas, “My Lord and my God.” Henceforth we have no claim
            over ourselves, but give ourselves over to him who has bought us
            with his blood, for we are his bondservants by purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there was another method by which a man became possessed of
            bondservants, that was by birth. Under the law, the man born in the
            priest’s house or bought with the priest’s money might eat of the
            holy things. There were some who were born under gracious
            influences; David makes mention of this when he says, in the 116th
            Psalm, “O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the
            son of thine handmaid.” Having a godly mother, he reckoned that he
            was born into the service of God. Even so, you and I, the
            twice-born, the really regenerate, have been born into the household
            of God, and our regeneration binds us to the noble service of him
            whom we call Master and Lord henceforth and for ever. As naturally
            as the old nature rebels, the new nature obeys; and as naturally as
            the old Adam within us will have its own way, so naturally the new
            Adam bends to the will of Christ, for we possess another life than
            that we used to have, we have been born into a new world wherein
            dwelleth righteousness; old things have passed away, and all things
            have become new; and now we surrender our members, which once were
            instruments of unrighteousness, to become instruments of
            righteousness, and we rejoice in being permitted to enter the
            service of our God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look again at, this man Jude; he does not even call himself an
            apostle. Paul did, because with some it was a matter of dispute as
            to whether he was an apostle or not, and it was needful for him to
            assert his right to the title; but Jude, having no question upon
            that matter, takes the lower-higher title,— for lower and higher are
            one in the Kingdom of Christ,— and calls himself “ the bondservant
            of Jesus Christ.” My dear hearer, can you also take that title— a
            bondservant of Jesus Christ? Let the free-thinker be free to go his
            own way if he will; you are a Christ-thinker, and you wish to go
            Christ’s way. Let the man who loves himself, and seeks to please
            himself; do what he will; henceforth you will love your Lord, and
            seek to please him, for you are by purchase and by birth the
            bondservant of Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, also, men became bondservants by indenture. They entered
            into bonds of servitude for a set time; and you and I have freely
            surrendered ourselves to Christ; we have entered into a covenant
            that we will be his for ever. Paul wrote as if he had been branded
            with Christ’s mark; and I doubt not that Jude might have done the
            same. “From henceforth,” says Paul, “let no man trouble me: for I
            bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.” He belonged
            undoubtedly, irrevocably, eternally, to the Lord Jesus Christ, and
            he gloried in that fact. Dear friends, will not you also glory in
            this if it is true of you?
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Jude added another part of his title showing that he was
            special in his relation: “and brother of James.” This expression
            seems to me to place Jude in a very pleasant light. He felt as if he
            was a specially favoured person, because he had for a brother that
            famous servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, James the Less, known among
            the Jews of old as James the Just, who had a reputation even among
            the outside world for the great holiness of his life. This man was
            Jude’s brother. Christianity teaches us to value brotherhood, and we
            highly esteem those with whom we are joined in relationship,
            especially in the relationships which are of grace. I like that any
            man should feel glad of his brother, thankful for his brother; and I
            am glad that Jude, when under divine inspiration, does not forget to
            say that he was “the brother of James.” Some of us owe a great deal
            to our brothers, and all of you have reason to thank God that you
            are the son of such an one, or that you are the father of such an
            one, or the sister of such an one, or the brother of such an one.
            There is a special mercy, probably, in your domestic position; and
            if there is, do not cease to praise God that he has given you to be
            associated in life with those who are associated with him. May our
            children be his children! May our friends be his friends! May our
            brothers be our brothers in Christ!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >II. Now, secondly, let us think of THE SPECIAL PEOPLE to whom
              Jude wrote this Epistle.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            In this instance, the marginal reading of the Revised Version is, I
            doubt not, the more correct translation: “To them that are beloved
            in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ, being called.” I shall
            take that as the best version, believing it to be strictly accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The special persons to whom Jude wrote were, first, beloved and
            sanctified: “To them that are beloved in God the Father.” O child of
            God, in times of darkness and of doubt, above all others cling you
            to the faith once delivered to the saints, because according to it
            you are beloved in God the Father, or, as our Authorized Version
            puts it, “Sanctified by God the Father;” which means that, by reason
            of his eternal love to you, he set you apart unto himself. To his
            spiritual Israel the Lord still says, “You only have I known of all
            the families of the earth They shall be mine, saith the Lord of
            hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels.” Or ever the earth was,
            or sun or moon or stars began to shine, the prescient eye of God was
            fixed on his beloved, and he sanctified them unto himself, “for the
            Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And because he had thus set them apart unto himself, in fulness of
            time he redeemed them unto himself, redeemed them from among men.
            “Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it;” and in
            consequence of that love of his, he determined that those whom he
            had redeemed should be the instruments of his gracious working among
            the sons of men. They were to be vessels meet for the Master’s use.
            They were to be the lamps in which his light should be carried, the
            salt by which his preserving power should be made manifest amidst
            the putrefaction of the world. He set them apart for himself and his
            service according to those ancient words, “This people have I formed
            for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of this love and this separation there came a sanctification of
            another kind, namely, that of cleansing, for we were heirs of wrath
            even as others, polluted like others; but the Spirit of God fulfils
            the divine purpose of separation, brings us out from the world, even
            as he brought Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees, and puts us in a
            separate path that we may be sojourners with God as all our fathers
            were. Then he washes us in the precious blood and in that water
            which flowed with the blood from the side of Jesus, that mystic
            fountain opened on Calvary for the sin and uncleanness of the house
            of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what is meant by being “sanctified by God the Father.” If
            you take the other translation, “beloved in God the Father,” it
            comes to the same point, for love has a separating influence upon
            its object. If the love of a man is fixed upon one woman, he calls
            her his bride, and he looks upon her as different from all other
            women on the face of the earth. She is ever in his thought and in
            his heart, and her praise is often on his lips; he lives for her.
            Even so hath God taken unto himself a people who are his alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to being beloved and sanctified, they are also
            “preserved in Christ Jesus.” This is a very sweet expression, and
            conveys a very true meaning, but the exact translation is, “kept for
            Jesus Christ.” To my mind, this is a most delightful truth; it makes
            my eyes sparkle to think of our being kept for Jesus Christ, as
            jewels that he alone must wear. “A garden enclosed is my sister, my
            spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.” “Kept for Jesus
            Christ.” I wish that we all carried out this divine purpose. What
            have I to do with idols? I am kept for Jesus Christ. What have I to
            do with seeking the things of this world? I am kept for Jesus
            Christ. What have I to do with living to myself, or to win the
            applause of men? What have I to do with the judgments of those who
            would be thought wise? What have we to do with anything but this—
            “Kept for Jesus Christ”? Our heart should be a cup from which no lip
            but his shall drink, a chalice consecrated to him who has given
            himself for us. Henceforth, let us have no eyes but for Jesus, no
            ears but for Jesus, no tongue but for Jesus; let us be ever, only,
            all for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Kept for Jesus Christ.” You must not touch that treasure; it is set
            apart for the King. You must not meddle with that man, you must not
            seek to engross the love of that woman; they are kept for Jesus
            Christ. It is to such people that Jude writes his Epistle. Others
            may be filthy dreamers; but these people are kept for Jesus Christ.
            Some may be wandering stars or trees plucked up by the roots; but
            these people are kept for Jesus Christ; kept by him, kept in him,
            but specially kept for him. May the meaning of this precious word be
            written upon all your hearts, beloved in Christ!
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Jude adds, “and called.” Do you not see the speciality running
            through all this description? Those who were beloved, sanctified,
            and preserved, were also called. There is a call in the gospel which
            comes to all men to whom it is proclaimed, yet all men are not
            “called” in the sense meant here. Brother, do you remember that day
            when you were called? The gospel had called you many times, and up
            to that time it had fallen upon a deaf ear; but that day you were
            called. Just as Lazarus came forth out of the grave because he was
            called by Christ, so was it with you. You had been lying asleep
            before , wrapped in the arms of sin; nay, like Lazarus, you were
            actually dead; but that day there came a voice to you out of the
            excellent glory It was not a voice that you heard with the ear; but,
            better than that, you heard it in your very soul, and it was as
            clear a call from Christ to you as when he called out of heaven to
            Saul of Tarsus, and said, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”
          </p>
          <p>
            1 remember distinctly when the Lord first called me, and I recollect
            it all the better because he has called me many times since, for
            that blessed call continues, and is often repeated. He called us
            first from death to life, then from darkness to light, then from a
            lesser light to a brighter one; and he has called us to go up step
            by step. Not even the angels go up Jacob’s ladder with a flight,
            they ascend it step by stop; and every day and all the day there is
            a call that comes to some of us, “Friend, come up higher.” When we
            are half inclined to sit down on the step of life, and admire the
            golden way up which we have hitherto ascended, we hear a voice that
            says to us, “Higher”; and there is our gracious God at the top of
            the ladder, still beckoning us to ascend, and saying to us again and
            again, “Seek ye my face,” and making us respond, “Thy face, Lord,
            will we seek.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who are the beloved of the Lord are called. They have heard a
            voice which worldlings have not heard; they have seen a face which
            the blind men of this world have never seen; they have touched a
            hand, and a mystic hand has touched them, which those dead ones who
            still lie in the wicked one have never felt. They are the called;
            they are called by Christ to come out from among the ungodly, to be
            separate from them, to follow him, and to keep following him till at
            last he bids them enter into his glory to be with him for ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            O beloved, the blessings of the gospel belong to men and women such
            as these, who have been set apart by divine love, who have been held
            apart and consecrated to Christ, and who have been taken apart by
            effectual calling, and so made to dwell apart to the glory of Christ
            alone, and for his use only. Shall any Belshazzar drink out of these
            golden cups? God forbid! Shall Satan come, and take away these crown
            jewels of the Prince, and bedeck himself with them? God forbid! When
            I see professedly Christian men seeking worldly amusements and
            worldly honours, and thus giving themselves over to Belial, what can
            I think or say of them? God grant that it may not be so with any of
            us; but may we be “kept by the power of God through faith unto
            salvation ready to be revealed in the last time”!
          </p>

              >III. Now I must close by noticing, with brevity, a SPECIAL
              BENEDICTION which Jude wished to these people, and this is to be
              the very pith and point of my sermon.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is, dear friends, my special desire and prayer to God for all who
            are separated unto him, that mercy, and peace, and love, may be
            multiplied unto them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beloved, may you have mercy! You will always want it, for even a
            saint is a sinner still. May you have the mercy that will continue
            to forgive your sin, the mercy that will continue to wash your feet
            from the defilement of the way! May you have the mercies of
            providence that will supply your need, the mercies that will sustain
            you under trial, the mercies that will lead you on from strength to
            strength! May you have much mercy, for you will want it; and,
            blessed be God, “He delighteth in mercy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, says the apostle, he wishes that we may have peace. Oh, may
            you have it! The man who is at perfect peace with God, who is at
            perfect peace with his own conscience, who is at peace with all his
            fellow-men, who especially cultivates peace by behaving himself
            aright in the household of God, this is the man who is strong in the
            midst of unrest and turmoil. This is the man who will stand firm
            when others flinch; for he can say, “My heart is fixed, O God, my
            heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.” May you have this
            peace, beloved!
          </p>
          <p>
            Jude next wishes that we may have love; that is to say, first, a
            sense of the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost,
            a ravishing realization that God loves us with that everlasting love
            which knows no measure, nor change, nor end. May your heart dance at
            the very thought of the infinite love of God which he displays
            towards you! And then may you have love towards men, loving your
            neighbour as yourself with that compassionate love which is pictured
            in the parable of the Samaritan, that love which does not say, “Be
            ye warmed, and be ye filled,” but which proves itself to be real by
            deeds of charity and acts of kindness! May you abound in love to
            God’s people; may your love be exceeding abundant to those who are
            your brethren and sisters in Christ, whose names are written in the
            Lamb’s book of life! I wish, dear friends, that you and I could be
            suffused with love. One said of Basil that he was a pillar of light;
            I would not so much care for that comparison as to be a pillar of
            love. Look at holy John; next to his Master, surely, and chiefly so
            because he abounded in love.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benediction of the apostle is this, — that this mercy, peace,
            and love may be multiplied to you. Is not that a beautiful word,
            “multiplied”? — not merely increased, but multiplied. You know what
            it is to increase; you add one to two, that is three; but when you
            multiply, you say, “Three times three, that is nine.” Multiplying is
            a quick way of growing. Oh, that you had all these blessings
            multiplied,— that, if you have had mercy, you might have ten times
            as much mercy richer,— that, if you have had peace, you might have a
            deeper, fuller, richer, more abiding peace, multiplied peace, peace
            upon peace, “the peace of God, which passeth all understanding;” —
            and that, if you have had love, your love might be multiplied,
            squared, cubed ! May the biggest figures that can be found multiply
            your love, for never did any man yet have too much love to God, or
            too much of the right kind of love to his fellow-men! May the Lord
            make us to grow in grace, to be filled with grace, to have these
            three graces multiplied unto us!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I come back to where I began. It was a dark time when Jude wrote
            this Epistle; but instead of saying to the Christian people, “You
            see that all these people have gone astray, the cause is in danger;
            go forth and fight with them,” he says, “mercy, and peace, and love,
            be multiplied unto you.” The graces of Christians will be the defeat
            of the enemy. If you want to improve a dark night, give us brighter
            stars; and if we want to enlighten a dark age, let us have brighter
            Christians. If there be mischief abroad in the world, the fault,
            dear brethren, to a great extent in ourselves. If we lived wholly to
            God, people would know better what Christians are. I believe that
            the short way to the conversion of sinners is the sanctification of
            saints. If we had more faith, we should preach better. If we had
            more believing prayer, wo should see more souls converted. If we
            lived nearer to God, it would be better for the far-off ones. Is it
            not written that when a man receives this water of life into
            himself, it “shall be in him a well of water springing up into
            everlasting life,” and “out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
            water”? God make you to be such reservoirs of grace!
          </p>
          <p>
            I have not spoken hardly a word to the unconverted, you see, because
            I want you professors so to live that your lives shall preach
            sermons. It is all very well to preach with the mouth; but the best
            sermons in the world are preached with the legs, with the life, by
            the walk and conversation of God’s people. If there be piety at
            home, if there be uprightness in business, if there be a burning
            zeal for God in your common conversation, then the ungodly will say,
            “What does this mean?” and they will want to know more about it. How
            earnestly I wish that every person here who cannot be described as
            “Kept for Jesus Christ” might long that it were so with him, and ere
            he goes to bed to-night might pray that he may belong to Christ!
            Then, giving himself up to Christ by faith, he may even this very
            night know that sweet peace of which I spoke just now. So may it be
            with you all, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake! Amen.
