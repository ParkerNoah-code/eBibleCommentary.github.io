          <h2>
            Ver 22.
            <em>On some have compassion, making a distinction,</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>On some have compassion</em>. That is, of such who have gone
            astray, being drawn aside; who are simple and ignorant, and out of
            the way; who sin through infirmity, and the force of temptation; and
            who are tractable and open to conviction, and whose mistakes are in
            lesser matters of religion; as also such who are convicted and
            wounded in their consciences for their sins and mistakes: and to
            these compassion is to be shown, by praying with them, and for them,
            with ardency and affection; instructing them in meekness; giving
            friendly and brotherly reproofs to them; expressing on all occasions
            a tender concern for their good; doing them all the good that can be
            done, both for their souls and bodies: and good reason there is why
            compassion should be shown them, because God is a God of compassion;
            Christ is a merciful high priest; a contrary spirit is grieving to
            the Holy Ghost; saints should consider what they themselves were,
            and what they now are, and that compassion has been shown to them,
            and they may want it again. The Alexandrian copy, and some others,
            and the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, read, "reprove".
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Making a distinction</em>. Between one and another; using some
            more tenderly, others more severely, as the nature and circumstances
            of their case appear to be. The Syriac version renders the whole,
            "when they repent, have compassion on them".
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 23.
            <em
              >and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear, hating
              even the clothing stained by the flesh.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And some save</em>. Meaning false teachers, who lead others into
            errors, and such as give themselves over unto sin, whether teachers
            or hearers, and who are obstinate and irreclaimable; even such as
            these, means should be used to save, if possible, by sharp
            admonitions and severe language; by denouncing the awful judgments
            of God, which threaten them; by inflicting on them church censures
            in a terrible manner; by declaring the terrors of the Lord, and of
            hell, and of everlasting damnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Snatching them out of the fire with fear</em>. Of their soul
            destroying doctrines, and of their filthy and unnatural lusts, and
            as it were out of the fire of hell, of which they are in great
            danger.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Hating even the clothing stained by the flesh</em>. By which may
            be meant the conversation of those men, even their filthy
            conversation, which is to be hated, though their persons are not;
            but all ways and means should be used to save them; and this is one
            way, by showing a dislike unto, and a resentment at their wicked way
            of living, excluding them from church communion for it, and shunning
            all conversation with them. The allusion is not to garments defiled
            by profluvious persons, or menstruous women, as some think, but to
            garments spotted with nocturnal pollutions, or through unnatural
            lusts, which these persons were addicted to l. It was reckoned very
            dishonourable for religious persons, in the time of divine service,
            or on a sabbath day, to have on a garment spotted with any thing; if
            a priest's garments were spotted, and he performed service in them,
            that service was not right m; and if a disciple of a wise man had
            any grease on his garments (on a sabbath day), he was guilty of
            death.
