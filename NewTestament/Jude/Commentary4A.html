        <h2>A. Warning: New Testament Times (17-19)</h2>

        <div id="Expositional" class="commentary">
          <h2>
            Ver 17.
            <em
              >But you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken
              before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>But you, beloved</em>. Or "my beloved", as the Syriac and Arabic
            versions read; or "our brethren", as the Ethiopic version; the
            apostle addresses the saints in this manner, to distinguish them
            from the false teachers, and to show that he had a different opinion
            of them from them; and that be would have them beware of them, and
            not be surprised at them, since it was no other than what was
            foretold; and also to engage their attention and regard to the
            following exhortation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles
              of our Lord Jesus Christ</em
            >. These words mean not the doctrines of the apostles in general,
            but particularly the prophecies delivered out by them, as by the
            Apostles Paul and Peter, concerning the false teachers that should
            arise; and these being spoken of before, and by apostles, even by
            the apostles, of our Lord Jesus Christ, were worthy of regard, and
            deserved to be remembered; a remembrance of which is a preservative
            from error, and a relief in the worst of times, whether of
            persecution, or heresy. This does not suppose that Jude was not an
            apostle, only that there were other apostles besides him; and that
            these, some of them at least, had prophesied of these men, and that
            he had lived to see their predictions verified; nor does he exclude
            himself from being one of them; yea, the Ethiopic version reads,
            "which we the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ have formerly
            declared unto you"; see 2 Peter 3:2.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 18.
            <em
              >They said to you, “In the last time there will be mockers,
              walking after their own ungodly lusts.”</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            The word rendered “mockers” here is the same which in the parallel
            place in 2 Peter 3:3 is rendered “scoffers.” Peter has stated more
            fully what was the particular subject on which they scoffed, and has
            shown that there was no occasion for it 2 Peter 3:4, following.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 19.
            <em
              >These are those who cause divisions and are sensual, not having
              the Spirit.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>These are those who cause divisions</em>. Not from sinners
            openly profane; such a separation is commendable, being according to
            the will and word of God, to the mind and practice of Christ, and
            which tends to the good of men, and to the glory of God; but from
            the saints and people of God; it is possible that a child of God may
            for a time leave the fellowship of the saints, but an entire and
            total forsaking of them, and of assembling with them, looks with an
            ill aspect; nor did they separate themselves from superstition and
            will worship, and every false way of worship, which would have been
            right, but from the pure worship, ordinances, and discipline of
            God's house, by a perversion of them, and as being above them, or
            unwilling to be under any notice and government; not from errors and
            heresies, and persons that held them, with these they herded; but
            from the pure doctrines of the Gospel, and ministers of the word,
            and made divisions and separations among the churches, for worldly
            ends, and through pride and affectation of vain glory, as if they
            were more knowing, more holy, and more spiritual than other men.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And are sensual</em>. Such as gave themselves up to sensual
            lusts and pleasures; and at best were but natural men, who had only
            natural and rational abilities, but without spiritual and
            experimental knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Not having the Spirit</em>. Though they might have some external
            gifts of the Spirit; or he himself dwelling in them as a spirit of
            conviction and illumination, as a spirit of regeneration and
            sanctification, as a spirit of faith and comfort, as a spirit of
            adoption, and as the earnest and pledge of the heavenly glory; they
            were not under his influence, nor did they feel the operations of
            his grace, nor had they communion with him: hence they appeared to
            be none of Christ's, nor could they claim interest in him, and were
            without life, and so could not persevere.
