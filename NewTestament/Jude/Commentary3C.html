            <em
              >Woe to them! For they went in the way of Cain, and ran riotously
              in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished in Korah’s
              rebellion.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Woe to them!</em> This may be considered as a commiseration of
            their case, or as a denunciation of deserved punishment, or as a
            prediction of what would befall them. The Arabic version prefaces
            these words with an address to the saints, "O my beloved": that what
            was about to be said might be attended to, as a caution and
            instruction to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For they went in the way of Cain</em>. Which was a way of envy,
            for Cain envied the acceptance of his brother's gift, and that
            notice which the Lord took of him; so these men envied the gifts
            bestowed on Christ's faithful ministers, and the success that
            attended their labours, and the honour that was put upon them by
            Christ, and that was given them by the churches; which shows, that
            they were destitute of grace, and particularly of the grace of
            charity, or love, which envies not, and that they were in an
            unregenerate estate, and upon the brink of ruin and destruction.
            Moreover, the way of Cain was a way of hatred, and murder of his
            brother, which his envy led him to; so these men hated the brethren,
            persecuted them unto death, as well as were guilty of the murder of
            the souls of men, by their false doctrine: to which may be added, as
            another of Cain's ways, in consequence of the former, absence from
            the presence of God, or the place of his worship; so these men
            separated themselves, and went out from the churches, forsook the
            assembling together with them, and so might expect Cain's
            punishment, to be driven from the face of God; yea, to be bid go as
            cursed into everlasting burnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire</em>. Balaam's
            error, which he himself was guilty of, was covetousness, or an
            immoderate love of money, 2 Peter 2:15; which, as it is the root of
            all evil, is the bane of religion, and the source of heresy, and
            what the false teachers were greatly addicted to; and where it
            prevails, it is insatiable, and not to be checked and stopped, as in
            these men; and is a damnable sin, and excludes from the kingdom of
            heaven, as well as is dishonourable to religion; hence such
            particular notice is taken of it, lest it be found in a minister of
            the word: this character exactly agrees with the followers of Simon
            Magus. The error which Balaam led others into, was both idolatry and
            adultery, Revelation 2:14, which these false teachers were both
            guilty of themselves, and taught others, and indulged them therein;
            and which both teachers and people ran greedily after. Balaam is one
            of the four private persons, who, according to the Jews, shall have
            no part or portion in the world to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And perished in Korah’s rebellion</em>. The same with Korah,
            Numbers 16:1. The Septuagint there call him Core, and so does Philo
            the Jew x, as the apostle does here, and by Josephus he is called y
            "Cores": now the gainsaying or contradiction of these men was like
            Korah's; as his was against Moses, the ruler of the people, so
            theirs was against magistracy, Judges 1:8; which was gainsaying
            God's own ordinance, and a contradiction of that which is for the
            good of men; the ground of which contradiction was love of liberty,
            and their own lusts; and, generally speaking, men perish in their
            factions and rebellions against good and lawful magistrates: also,
            as Korah gainsayed Aaron, the priest of the Lord, so these men
            contradicted and opposed the ministers of Christ, whom they would
            have thrust out in order to put in themselves, and whose persons
            they reviled, and contradicted their doctrines, which to do is of
            dangerous consequence; and they might be said to perish in his
            gainsaying, as a type and example of their destruction, which would
            be swift and sudden, as his was; and to denote the certainty of it.
            So the Jews z say of Korah and his company, that they shall never
            ascend, or rise up and stand in judgment, and that they shall have
            no part or portion in the world to come.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>These are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts</em>. Or
            "love". The Jews speak סעודתיה דמהימנותא, "of a feast of faith" b.
            These here seem to be the Agapae, or love feasts, of the primitive
            Christians; the design of which was to maintain and promote
            brotherly love, from whence they took their name; and to refresh the
            poor saints, that they might have a full and comfortable meal now
            and then: their manner of keeping them was this; they began and
            ended them with prayer and singing; and they observed them with
            great temperance and frugality; and they were attended with much joy
            and gladness, and simplicity of heart: but were quickly abused, by
            judaizing Christians, as observing them in imitation of the
            passover; and by intemperance in eating and drinking; and by
            excluding the poor, for whose benefit they were chiefly designed;
            and by setting up separate meetings for them, and by admitting unfit
            persons unto them; such as here are said to be spots in them,
            blemishes, which brought great reproach and scandal upon them, being
            persons of infamous characters and conversations. The allusion is
            either to spots in garments, or in faces, or in sacrifices; or to a
            sort of earth that defiles; or else to rocks and hollow stones on
            shores, lakes, and rivers, which collect filth and slime; all which
            serve to expose and point out the persons designed. The Alexandrian
            copy and some others read, "these are in their own deceivings,
            spots", απαταις, instead of αγαπαις, as in 2 Peter 2:13.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When they feast with you</em>. Which shows that they were among
            them, continued members with them, and partook with them in their
            solemn feasts, and were admitted to communion; and carries in it a
            kind of reproof to the saints, that they suffered such persons among
            them, and allowed them such privilege, intimacy, and familiarity
            with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Shepherds who without fear feed themselves</em>. These were like
            the shepherds of Israel, who fed themselves, and not the flock, and
            were very impious and impudent, open and bare faced in their
            iniquities, neither fearing God nor regarding man.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Clouds without water</em>. They are compared to clouds for their
            number, being many false prophets and antichrists that were come out
            into the world; and for their sudden rise, having at once, and at an
            unawares, crept into the churches; and for the general darkness they
            spread over the churches, making it, by their doctrines and
            practices, to be a dark and cloudy day, a day of darkness, and
            gloominess, a day of clouds, and of thick darkness, a day of
            trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy; and for the storms, factions, rents,
            and divisions they made; as also for their situation and height,
            soaring aloft, and being vainly puffed up in their fleshly mind; as
            well as for their sudden destruction, disappearing at once. And to
            clouds "without water", because destitute of the true grace of God,
            and of true evangelical doctrine; which, like rain, is from above,
            from heaven; and which, like that, refreshes, softens, and
            fructifies. Now these false teachers looked like clouds, that
            promised rain, boasted of Gospel light and knowledge, but were
            destitute of it, wherefore their ministry was uncomfortable and
            unprofitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Carried along by winds</em>. Either of false doctrines, or of
            their own lusts and passions, or of Satan's temptations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Autumn trees without fruit</em>. Or "trees in autumn"; either
            like to them, which put forth at that season of the year, and so
            come to nothing; or like to trees which are bare of leaves as well
            as fruit, it being the time when the leaves fall from the trees; and
            so may be expressive of these persons casting off the leaves of an
            outward profession, of their going out from the churches, separating
            from them, and forsaking the assembling together with them, when
            what fruit of holiness, and good works, they seemed to have, came to
            nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Twice dead</em>. That is, entirely, thoroughly, and really dead
            in trespasses and sins, notwithstanding their pretensions to
            religion and godliness; or the sense may be, that they were not only
            liable to a corporeal death, common to them with all mankind, but
            also to an eternal one, or to the death both of soul and body in
            hell. Homer calls d those διθανεις, "twice dead", that go to hell
            alive: or rather the sense is this, that they were dead in sin by
            nature, as all men are, and again having made a profession of
            religion, were now become dead to that profession; and so were twice
            dead, once as they were born, and a second time as they had
            apostatized.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Plucked up by the roots</em>. Either by separating themselves
            from the churches, where they had been externally planted; or by the
            act of the church in cutting them off, and casting them out; or by
            the judgment of God upon them.

          <p>
            <em>Wild waves of the sea</em>. False teachers are so called, for
            their, swelling pride and vanity; which, as it is what prevails in
            human nature, is a governing vice in such persons, for knowledge
            without grace puffs up; and this shows that they had not received
            the doctrine of grace in truth, for that humbles; as also for their
            arrogance, boasting, and ostentation; and for their noisiness, their
            restless, uneasy, and turbulent spirits, for their furious and
            wrathful dispositions; as well as for their levity and inconstancy,
            and for their turpitude and filthiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Foaming out their own shame</em>. Wrathful words, frothy and
            obscene language, and filthy doctrines; and which expresses the
            issue of their noisy and blustering ministry, which ends in
            uncleanness, shame, emptiness, and ruin.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Wandering stars</em>. They are called "stars", because they have
            the appearance of such, and blaze for a while, in seeming light,
            zeal, and warmth, and in fame and reputation; and "wandering" ones,
            not comparable to the planets, which go their regular course, but to
            fiery exhalations, gliding and running stars; because they wander
            about from house to house, as well as from one nation to another,
            and being never settled in their principles, nor at a point in
            religion; and wander also after their own carnal lusts, and cause
            others to wander likewise, and at last become falling stars; not
            from real grace and sanctified knowledge, which they never had; but
            from truth to error, and from a seemingly holy life and
            conversation, to a vicious one; and from a profession of religion,
            to open profaneness; and whose fall is irrecoverable, as that of
            stars.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Or whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever</em
            >. Or the blackest darkness, even utter darkness; which phrase not
            only expresses the dreadful nature of their punishment, their most
            miserable and uncomfortable condition; but also the certainty of it,
            it is "reserved" for them among the treasures of divine wrath and
            vengeance, by the righteous appointment of God, according to the
            just demerit of their sins; and likewise the duration of it, it will
            be for ever; there will never be any light or comfort, but a
            continual everlasting black despair, a worm that dieth not, a fire
            that will not be quenched, the smoke and blackness of which will
            ascend for ever and ever; hell is meant by it, which the Jews
            represent as a place of darkness: the Egyptian darkness, they say,
            came from the darkness of hell, and in hell the wicked will be
            covered with darkness; the darkness which was upon the face of the
            deep, at the creation, they interpret of hell.
