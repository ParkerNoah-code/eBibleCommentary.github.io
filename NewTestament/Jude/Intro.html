        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          With respect to the time of its composition we have a final limiting
          point in the date of 2 Peter, about A. D. 67, since that Epistle is
          evidently dependent on Jude. On the other hand it does not seem likely
          that Jude would write such a letter, while his brother James was still
          living, so that we have a starting point in A. D. 62. A date later
          than 62 is also favored by the Pauline words employed in this letter,
          in some of which we seem to have an echo of Ephesians and Colossians.
          Moreover the great similarity between the conditions pictured in this
          letter and those described in 2 Peter is best explained, if we date
          them in close proximity to each other. We shall not go far wrong in
          dating the Epistle about the year 65.
        </p>

        <h2>Occasion and Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The danger to which these Christians were thus exposed, led to the
          composition of this Epistle. Apparently Jude intended to write to them
          of the common salvation, when he suddenly heard of the grave situation
          and found it necessary to pen a word of warning. In the verse from
          which we draw this conclusion, the author also clearly states his aim,
          when he says that he deemed it imperative to write to them that they
          should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the
          saints. In order to do this, he pictures to them the disobedient and
          immoral character of the ungodly persons that had unawares crept into
          the fold and endangered their Christian faith and life; reminds them
          of the fact that God would certainly punish those wanton libertines,
          just as He had punished sinners in the past; and exhorts them to stand
          in faith and to strive after holiness.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          As unprincipled men, under the name of Christians, had crept in, whose
          chief object was to lead the unstable and weak to a profane contempt
          of God, Jude first shows, that the faithful ought not to have been
          moved by agents of this kind, by which the Church has always been
          assailed; and yet he exhorts them carefully to beware of such pests.
          And to render them more hateful and detestable, he denounces on them
          the approaching vengeance of God, such as their impiety deserved. Now,
          if we consider what Satan has attempted in our age, from the
          commencement of the revived gospel, and what arts he still busily
          employs to subvert the faith, and the fear of God, what was a useful
          warning in the time of Jude, is more than necessary in our age.
        </p>

        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          In the Epistle of Jude we have the Christian war-cry, resounding
          through the ages: Contend earnestly for the faith that was once
          delivered unto the saints! This letter, the last of the New Testament,
          teaches with great emphasis that apostasy from the true creed with its
          central truths of the atonement of Christ and the permanent validity
          of the law as the rule of life, is assured perdition; and clearly
          reveals for all generations the inseparable connection between a
          correct belief and a right mode of living.
        </p>

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          The writer begins his Epistle with the regular address and apostolic
          blessing (1-2). He informs his readers that he felt it incumbent on
          him to warn them against certain intruders, who deny Christ, lead
          lascivious lives and will certainly be punished like the people
          delivered from Egypt, the fallen angels and the cities of the plain
          (3-7). These intruders are further described as defilers of the flesh
          and as despisers and blasphemers of heavenly dignities, and the woe is
          pronounced on them (8-11). After giving a further description of their
          debauchery, the author exhorts the readers to be mindful of the words
          of the apostles, who had spoken of the appearance of such mockers
          (12-19). Admonishing them to increase in faith and to keep themselves
          in the love of God, and giving them directions as to the correct
          behaviour towards others, he concludes his Epistle with a doxology
          (20-25).
