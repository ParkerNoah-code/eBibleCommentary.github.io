        <div id="Expository" class="commentary">
          <h2>
            Ver 1-2.
            <em
              >This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to
              you; and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding
              you that you should remember the words which were spoken before by
              the holy prophets and the commandment of us, the apostles of the
              Lord and Savior,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em
              >This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to
              you</em
            >. his is a transition to another part of the epistle; for the
            apostle having largely described false teachers, the secret enemies
            of the Christian religion under a profession of it, passes on to
            take notice of the more open adversaries and profane scoffers of it;
            and from their ridicule of the doctrine of Christ's second coming,
            he proceeds to treat of that, and of the destruction of the world,
            and the future happiness of the saints: he calls this epistle his
            "second epistle", because he had written another before to the same
            persons; and that the author of this epistle was an apostle, is
            evident from 2 Peter 3:2; and which, compared with 2 Peter 1:18
            shows him to be the Apostle Peter, whose name it bears, and who was
            an eyewitness to the transfiguration of Christ on the mount, Matthew
            17:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            He addresses these saints here, as also in 2 Peter 3:8, under the
            character of "beloved"; because they were the beloved of God, being
            chosen by him according to his foreknowledge, and regenerated by
            him, according to his abundant mercy; and were openly his people,
            and had obtained mercy from him, and like precious faith with the
            apostles; and were also the beloved of Christ, being redeemed by
            him, not with gold and silver, but with his precious blood; for whom
            he suffered, and who were partakers of his sufferings, and the
            benefits arising from them, and who had all things given them by
            him, pertaining to life and godliness, and exceeding great and
            precious promises; and were likewise beloved by the apostle, though
            strangers, and not merely as Jews, or because they were his
            countrymen, but because they were the elect of God, the redeemed of
            Christ, and who were sanctified by the Spirit, and had the same kind
            of faith he himself had.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >And in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding
              you</em
            >. That this was his view both in this and the former epistle,
            appears from 1 Peter 1:13; he calls their minds pure; not that they
            were so naturally, for the minds and consciences of men are
            universally defiled with sin; nor are the minds of all men pure who
            seem to be so in their own eyes, or appear so to others; nor can any
            man, by his own power or works, make himself pure from sin; only the
            blood of Christ purges and cleanses from it; and a pure mind is a
            mind sprinkled with that blood, and which receives the truth as it
            is in Jesus, in the power and purity of it, and that holds the
            mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. Some versions, as the
            Vulgate Latin and Arabic, render the word "sincere", as it is in
            Philippians 1:10; and may design the sincerity of their hearts in
            the worship of God, in the doctrines of Christ, and to one another,
            and of the grace of the Spirit of God in them; as that their faith
            was unfeigned, their hope without hypocrisy, and their love without
            dissimulation, and their repentance real and genuine; but yet they
            needed to be stirred up by way of remembrance, both of the truth of
            the Gospel, and the duties of religion; for saints are apt to be
            forgetful of the word, both of its doctrines and its exhortations;
            and it is the business of the ministers of the word to put them in
            mind of them, either by preaching or by writing; and which shows the
            necessity and usefulness of the standing ministry of the Gospel: the
            particulars he put them in mind of next follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That you should remember the words which were spoken before</em
            >. This is an explanation of the above mentioned end of his writing
            this and the other epistle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By the holy prophets</em>. That is, the prophets of the Old
            Testament, who were holy men of God, and therefore their words are
            to be regarded, and retained in memory; the Gospel itself was spoken
            by them, and so was Christ, and the things relating to his person
            and offices, and to his incarnation, sufferings, and death, and the
            glory that should follow; and indeed the apostles said no other than
            what they did, only more clearly and expressly; and particularly
            many things, were said by them concerning the second coming of
            Christ to judge the world, and destroy it, and to prepare new
            heavens and a new earth for his people, which is what the apostle
            has chiefly in view; see Judges 1:14.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >And the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and
              Savior</em
            >. That is, Jesus Christ, as Judges 1:17 expresses it, and the
            Ethiopic version adds here; and which likewise, and also the Syriac
            version, and some ancient copies, read, "our Lord and Saviour", and
            omit the us before the apostles; by whom are meant the twelve
            apostles of Christ, of which Peter was one, and therefore says, "us
            the apostles"; though the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions, and the
            Complutensian edition, read "your apostles", and so the Alexandrian
            copy; but the former is the received reading: now "the commandment"
            of these intends either the Gospel in general, so called because it
            was the commandment of our Lord to his apostles to preach it; and
            therefore the word "commandment", in the original, stands between
            "us the apostles", and "the Lord and Saviour", as being the
            commandment of the one to the other; unless it can be thought any
            regard is had to the new commandment of love, or that of faith,
            inculcated both by Christ and his apostles; John 13:34; or rather,
            particularly the instructions, directions, and predictions of the
            apostles concerning the second coming of Christ, and what should go
            before it, as appears from the following words, and the parallel
            place in Judges 1:17, the words of the prophets and apostles being
            here put together, show the agreement there is between them, and
            what regard is to be had to each of them, and to anything and every
            thing in which they agree.

            <em>Knowing this first</em>. In the first place, principally, and
            chiefly, and which might easily be known and observed from the
            writings of the apostles and prophets; see 1 Timothy 4:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That in the last days mockers will come</em>. Such as would make
            a mock at sin, make light of it, plead for it, openly commit it, and
            glory in it; and scoff at all religion, as the prejudice of
            education, as an engine of state, a piece of civil policy to keep
            subjects in awe, as cant, enthusiasm, and madness, as a gloomy
            melancholy thing, depriving men of true pleasure; and throw out
            their flouts and jeers at those that are the most religious, for the
            just, upright man, is commonly by such laughed to scorn, and those
            that depart from evil make themselves a prey; and particularly at
            the ministers of the word, for a man that has scarcely so much
            common sense as to preserve him from the character of an idiot,
            thinks himself a wit of the age, if he can at any rate break a jest
            upon a Gospel minister.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor do the Scriptures of truth escape the banter and burlesque of
            these scoffers; the doctrines of it being foolishness to them, and
            the commands and ordinances in it being grievous and intolerable to
            them; yea, to such lengths do those proceed, as to scoff at God
            himself; at his persons, purposes, providences, and promises; at
            Jehovah the Father, as the God of nature and providence, and
            especially as the God and Father of Christ, and of all grace in him;
            at Jehovah the Son, at his person, as being the Son of God, and
            truly God, at his office, as Mediator, and at his blood,
            righteousness, and sacrifice, which they trample under foot; and at
            Jehovah the Spirit, whom they do despite unto, as the spirit of
            grace, deriding his operations in regeneration and sanctification,
            as dream and delusion; and, most of all, things to come are the
            object of their scorn and derision; as the second coming of Christ,
            the resurrection of the dead, a future judgment, the torments of
            hell, and the joys of heaven; all which they represent as the
            trifles and juggles of designing men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such as these, according to the prophets and apostles, were to come
            in "the last days"; either in the days of the Messiah, in the Gospel
            dispensation, the times between the first and second coming of
            Christ; for it is a rule with the Jews, that wherever the last days
            are mentioned, the days of the Messiah are intended; see Hebrews
            1:1; when the prophets foretold such scoffers should come; or in the
            last days of the Jewish state, both civil and religious, called "the
            ends of the world", 1 Corinthians 10:11; a little before the
            destruction of Jerusalem, when iniquity greatly abounded, Matthew
            24:11; or "in the last of the days"; as the words may be rendered;
            and so answer to באחרית הימים, in Isaiah 2:2, and may regard the
            latter part of the last times; the times of the apostles were the
            last days, 1 John 2:18; they began then, and will continue to
            Christ's second coming; when some time before that, it will be a
            remarkable age for scoffers and scorners; and we have lived to see
            an innumerable company of them, and these predictions fulfilled;
            from whence it may be concluded, that the coming of Christ is at
            hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Walking after their own lusts</em>. Either after the carnal
            reasonings of their minds, admitting of nothing but what they can
            comprehend by reason, making that the rule, test, and standard of
            all their principles, and so cast away the law of the Lord, and
            despise the word of the Holy One of Israel; or rather, after their
            sinful and fleshly lusts, making them their guides and governors,
            and giving up themselves entirely to them, to obey and fulfil them;
            the phrase denotes a continued series of sinning, a progress in it,
            a desire after it, and pleasure in it, and an obstinate persisting
            in it; scoffers at religion and revelation are generally libertines;
            and such as sit in the seat of the scornful, are in the counsel of
            the ungodly, and way of sinners, Psalms 1:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And saying, “Where is the promise of his coming?"</em> TThat is,
            of the coming of the Lord and Saviour, 2 Peter 3:2; the object of
            their scorn and derision, and whom they name not, through contempt;
            and the meaning is, what is become of the promise of his coming?
            where the accomplishment of it? The prophets foretold he would come;
            he himself said he would come again, John 14:3; the angels, at his
            ascension, declared he would come from heaven in like manner as he
            went up, Acts 1:11; and all his apostles gave out that he would
            appear a second time to judge both quick and dead, Acts 10:42 1
            Peter 4:5, and that his coming was at hand, Philippians 4:5; but
            where is the fulfilment of all this? he is not come, nor is there
            any sign or likelihood of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>"For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep."</em> Or
            "died": which is the language of the Scriptures, and here sneered at
            by these men, who believe them so fast asleep as never to be awaked
            or raised more; and by "the fathers" they mean the first inhabitants
            of the world, as Adam, Abel, Seth, c. and all the patriarchs and
            prophets in all ages the Ethiopic version renders it, "our first
            fathers."

            Reasoning from the settled order of things, the constant revolution
            of the sun, moon, and stars, the permanency of the earth, and the
            succession of the inhabitants of it, to the future continuance of
            things, without any alteration; and consequently, that Christ would
            not come, as was promised, to raise the dead, judge mankind destroy
            the world, and set up a new state of things: the fallacy of which
            reasoning is exposed by the apostle in the following words.

          <p>
            <em>For they willfully forget</em>. Namely, what follows; for as
            these men were such as had professed Christianity, and had the
            advantage of revelation, and had the opportunity of reading the
            Scriptures, they might have known that the heavens and the earth
            were from the beginning; and that they were made by the word of God;
            and that the earth was originally in such a position and situation
            as to be overflowed with a flood, and that it did perish by a
            general inundation; and that the present heavens and earth are kept
            and reserved for a general burning; and it might be discerned in
            nature, that there are preparations making for an universal
            conflagration; but all this they chose not to know, and affected
            ignorance of.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That there were heavens from of old</em>. Not only in the times
            of Noah, but "from the beginning"; as the Ethiopic version reads,
            and which agrees with the account in Genesis 1:1; by "the heavens"
            may be meant both the third heaven, and the starry heavens, and the
            airy heavens, with all their created inhabitants; and especially the
            latter, since these were concerned in, and affected with the general
            deluge; and these were in the beginning of time, out of nothing
            brought into being, and so were not eternal, and might be destroyed
            again, or at least undergo a change, even though they were of old,
            and of long duration: for it was "by the word of God" that they at
            first existed, and were so long preserved in being; either by the
            commanding word of God, by his powerful voice, his almighty fiat,
            who said, Let it be done, and it was done, and who commanded beings
            to rise up out of nothing, and they did, and stood fast; and so the
            Arabic version renders it, "by the command of God"; or by his
            eternal Logos, the essential Word of God, the second Person in the
            Trinity, who is often in Scripture called the Word, and the Word of
            God, and, as some think, by the Apostle Peter, 1 Peter 1:23, and
            certain it is that the creation of all things is frequently ascribed
            to him; see John 1:16; wherefore by the same Word they might be
            dissolved, and made to pass away, as they will.

            <em>And an earth formed out of water and amid water</em>. That is,
            "by the Word of God"; for this phrase, in the original text, is
            placed after this clause, and last of all; and refers not only to
            the being of the heavens of old, but to the rise, standing, and
            subsistence of the earth, which is here particularly described for
            the sake of the deluge, the apostle afterwards mentions: and it is
            said to be "standing out of the water", or "consisting out of it";
            it consists of it as a part; the globe of the earth is terraqueous,
            partly land and partly water; and even the dry land itself has its
            rise and spring out of water; the first matter that was created is
            called the deep, and waters in which darkness was, and upon which
            the Spirit of God moved, Genesis 1:2; agreeably to which Thales the
            Milesian asserted t, that water was the principle of all things; and
            the Ethiopic version here renders the words thus, "and the Word of
            God created also the earth out of water, and confirmed it."
          </p>
          <p>
            The account the Jews give of the first formation of the world is
            this u; "at first the world was מים במים, "water in water"; what is
            the sense (of that passage Genesis 1:2;) "and the Spirit of God
            moved upon the face of the waters?" he returned, and made it snow;
            he casteth forth his ice like morsels, Psalms 147:17; he returned
            and made it earth; "for to the snow he saith, Be thou earth", Job
            37:6, and the earth stood upon the waters; "to him that stretched
            out the earth above the waters", Psalms 136:6;'' however, certain it
            is, that the earth was first covered with water, when at the word,
            and by the command of God, the waters fled and hasted away, and were
            gathered into one place, and the dry land rose up and appeared; and
            then it was that it "stood out of the water"; see Genesis 1:9;
            moreover, the earth consists, or is kept and held together by water;
            there is a general humidity or moisture that runs through it, by
            which it is compacted together, or otherwise it would resolve into
            dust, and by which it is fit for the production, increase, and
            preservation of vegetables and other things, which it otherwise
            would not be.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it is also said to stand "in the water", or by the water; upon
            it, according to Psalms 24:2; or rather in the midst of it, there
            being waters above the firmament or expanse; in the airy heavens, in
            the clouds all around the earth, called the windows of heaven; and
            water below the firmament or expanse, in the earth itself; besides
            the great sea, a large body of waters is in the midst of the earth,
            in the very bowels of it, which feed rivers, and form springs,
            fountains and wells, called "the fountains of the great deep",
            Genesis 7:11; and in this position and situation was the earth of
            old, and so was prepared in nature for a general deluge, and yet was
            preserved firm and stable by the word of God, for a long series of
            time; so the Arabic version renders it, "and the earth out of the
            water, and in the water, stood stable, by the command of God"; but
            when it was his pleasure, he brought the flood on the world of the
            ungodly, of which an account follows.
          </p>
          <p><em>By the word of God</em>.</p>
          <p>
            <em>By which means the world that existed then</em>. The old world,
            as it is called in 2 Peter 2:5.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Being overflowed with water</em>. By the windows of heaven being
            opened, and the waters over the earth poured down upon it; and by
            the fountains of the great deep being broken up in it; thus by these
            waters from above and below, a general inundation was brought upon
            it; for that the deluge was universal is clear from hence, and from
            the account by Moses; for as the earth was filled with violence, and
            all flesh had corrupted its way, God threatened a general
            destruction, and which was brought by a flood, which overflowed the
            whole earth; for all the hills that were under the whole heaven were
            covered with it, and everything that had life in the dry land died,
            and every living substance was destroyed that was upon the face of
            the ground; see Genesis 6:11.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Perished</em>. Not as to the substance of it, whatever
            alteration there might be in its form and position; but as to the
            inhabitants of it; for all creatures, men and cattle, and the
            creeping things, and fowls of the heaven, were destroyed, excepting
            Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their wives, and the
            creatures that were with him in the ark; see Genesis 7:23; and by
            this instance the apostle shows the falsehood of the above
            assertion, that all things continued as they were from the beginning
            of the creation; for the earth was covered with water first, and
            which, by the command of God, was removed, and, after a long series
            of time, was brought on it again, and by it drowned; and from whence
            it also appears, that this sort of reasoning used by those scoffers
            is very fallacious; for though the heavens and the earth may
            continue for a long time, as they did before the flood, in the same
            form and situation, it does not follow from thence that they always
            will, for the contrary is evident from what follows.

            <em>But the heavens that exist now and the earth</em>. In being, in
            distinction from, and opposition to the heavens that were of old,
            and the earth standing in and out of the water, and the world that
            then was when the waters of the flood overflowed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By the same word</em>. That is, by the word of God, as in 2
            Peter 3:5; and the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "by
            his word"; by the same word that the heavens and the earth were made
            of old, or in the beginning, are they kept, preserved, and upheld in
            their being; or "are treasured up"; the heavens and the earth are a
            rich treasure, they are full of the riches God, as the God of nature
            and providence; and they are kept with care, as a treasure is, not
            to be touched or meddled with at present, but must continue in the
            same position and use; or they are laid up in the stores, and scaled
            up among the treasures of divine wrath and vengeance, and will be
            brought out another day, and made use of, to the destruction of the
            ungodly inhabitants of the world, and to aggravate and increase
            their misery and ruin.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Have been stored up for fire</em>. For though the world is, and
            has been preserved a long time without any visible alteration in it,
            yet it will not be always so preserved: and though it is, and will
            be kept from being drowned by water again, through the promise and
            power of God, yet it is kept and reserved for a general
            conflagration; see 2 Peter 3:10. And as the old world was put into a
            natural situation, so as to be drowned by water, there are now
            preparations making in nature, in the present world, for the burning
            of it; witness the fiery meteors, blazing stars, and burning comets
            in the heavens, and the subterraneous fires in the bowels of the
            earth, which in some places have already broke out: there are now
            many volcanos, burning mountains and islands, particularly in
            Sicily, Italy, and the parts adjacent, the seat of the beast, and
            where it is very likely the universal conflagration will begin, as
            Aetna, Vesuvius, Strombilo, and other volcanos; and even in our own
            island we have some symptoms and appearances of these fires under
            ground, as fiery eruptions in some places, and the hot waters at the
            Bath, and elsewhere, show; from all which it is plain that the
            heavens and earth, that now are, are not as they always were, and
            will be, but are reserved and prepared for burning; and that things
            are ripening apace, as men's sins also are, for the general
            conflagration.

            Josephus relates, that Adam foretold that there would be a
            destruction of all things, once by the force of fire, and once by
            the power and multitude of water; and it is certain the Jews had
            knowledge of the destruction of the earth by fire, as by water: they
            say x, "that when the law was given to Israel, his (God's) voice
            went from one end of the world to the other, and trembling laid hold
            on all the nations of the world in their temples, and they said a
            song, as it is said, Psalms 29:9, "and in his temple doth everyone
            speak of his glory": all of them gathered together to wicked Balaam,
            and said to him, what is the voice of the multitude which we hear,
            perhaps a flood is coming upon the world? he said unto them, "the
            Lord sitteth upon the flood, yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever",
            Psalms 29:10. Thus hath the Lord swore, that he will not bring a
            flood upon the world; they replied to him, a flood of water he will
            not bring, but מבול של אש, "a flood of fire" he will bring, as it is
            said, Isaiah 66:16, "for by fire will the Lord plead",'' or judge:
            and hence they speak y of the wicked being judged with two sorts of,
            judgments, by water, and by fire: and, according to our apostle, the
            heavens and earth are kept and reserved to fire.

              >Being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of

            known; and it is called a "day", because of the evidence and light
            in which things will appear, and the quick dispatch of business in
            it; and the "judgment" spoken of is the future judgment, and which
            is certain, and will be universal, righteous, and eternal, and when
            wicked and ungodly men will be punished with everlasting
            destruction: the bodies of those that will be alive at the general
            conflagration will be burnt in it, though not annihilated, and will
            be raised again, and both soul and body will be destroyed in hell.
