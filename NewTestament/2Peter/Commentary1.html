            In the inscription, the writer of the epistle describes himself by
            his names, the one given him by his parents, the other by his Lord
            and master, and by his character and office; and the persons to whom
            he writes are described as having faith, and that of the same kind
            with the apostles, and which they obtained through the righteousness
            of Christ. The salutation is the same with that in the former
            epistle, only here is added a wish for an increase of divine
            knowledge since, by the power of living grace, everything necessary
            to a spiritual and godly life bad been given them in the effectual
            calling, through the knowledge of Christ.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ</em>. The
            writer of this epistle is described first by his names, Simon Peter;
            Simon, or Simeon as it is sometimes put, was the name by which he
            was called from his infancy by his parents, and by which he was
            known when Christ called him to be a disciple and follower of him
            (Acts 15:14), a name common with the Jews; Peter is what was given
            him by Christ at his conversion (Jn 1:4), and answers to Cephas in
            the Syriac language; and both signify a rock or stone, because he
            was built upon Christ, the rock and foundation, and chief corner
            stone, and with a view to his future solidity, firmness, and
            constancy: and he is next described by his character as a servant,
            not of sin, nor Satan, nor man, but Jesus Christ, whose servant he
            was, not only by creation, but by redemption and grace; and not
            merely a servant of his, in common with other believers, but in a
            ministerial way, as a preacher of the Gospel, which this phrase
            sometimes designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of it shows the apostle's humility, his sense of obligation
            to Christ, and acknowledgment of him as his Lord, and that he
            esteemed it an honour to stand in such a relation to him: but to
            distinguish him from a common servant of Christ, and an ordinary
            minister of the word, it is added, "an apostle of Jesus Christ": one
            that was immediately sent by Christ, had his commission and doctrine
            directly from him, and a power of working miracles, in confirmation
            of his mission and ministry being divine, and an authority at large
            to go everywhere and preach the Gospel, plant churches, and put them
            in due order, and place proper persons over them. This is said to
            give weight and authority to his epistle.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To those who have obtained a like precious faith with us</em>.
            They were believers in Christ, who had a faith of the right kind;
            not a faith of doing miracles, which was not common to all, nor was
            it saving; nor a mere assent to truths, nor a temporary one, or a
            bare profession of faith; but that faith which is the faith of God's
            elect, the gift of his grace, and the operation of his power; which
            sees the Son, goes to him, ventures on him, trusts in him, lives
            upon him, and works by love to him. This is said to be "precious",
            as it is in its own nature, being a rich and enriching grace, of
            more worth and value than gold that perisheth, or than thousands of
            gold and silver; it is not to be equalled by, nor purchased with the
            riches of the whole world; it is precious in its object, it being
            conversant with the precious person, precious blood, and precious
            righteousness and sacrifice of Christ, and is that grace which makes
            Christ, and all that is his, precious to souls; it is precious in
            its acts and usefulness; it is that grace by which men go to God and
            Christ, receive from them, and give all glory to them, and without
            which it is not possible to please God: to which add the durableness
            of it; it is an abiding grace, and will never fail, when the most
            precious things in nature do.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a commendation of the grace which God had indiscriminately
            showed to all his elect people; for it was no common gift, that they
            had all been called to one and the same faith, since faith is the
            special and chief good of man. But he calls it like or equally
            precious, not that it is equal in all, but because all possess by
            faith the same Christ with his righteousness, and the same
            salvation. Though then the measure is different, that does not
            prevent the knowledge of God from being common to all, and the fruit
            which proceeds from it. Thus we have a real fellowship of faith with
            Peter and the Apostles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the righteousness of... Christ</em>. In order that they might
            know that they did not obtain faith through their own efforts or
            strength, but through God's favor alone. For these things stand
            opposed the one to the other, the righteousness of God (in the sense
            in which it is taken here) and the merit of man. For the efficient
            cause of faith is called God's righteousness for this reason,
            because no one is capable of conferring it on himself. So the
            righteousness that is to be understood, is not that which remains in
            God, but that which he imparts to men, as in Romans 3:22. Besides,
            he ascribes this righteousness in common to God and to Christ,
            because it flows from God, and through Christ it flows down to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ</em>.
            Here is a testimony of the deity of Christ, as well as of his
            character as a Saviour, who is an able and a willing one, a full,
            complete, suitable, and only Saviour: and the reason why he is so is
            because he is truly and properly "God"; and why he is so to us,
            because he is "our" God: wherefore by "righteousness" here, cannot
            be meant the goodness and mercy of God, as some think, though faith
            undoubtedly comes through that; nor the faithfulness of God making
            good his purpose and promise of giving faith to his elect, as others
            think: but the righteousness of Christ, which is not the
            righteousness of a creature, but of God; that is wrought out by one
            that is God, as well as man, and so answerable to all the purposes
            for which it is brought in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now faith comes "in", or "with" this righteousness, as the phrase
            may be rendered; when the Spirit of God reveals and brings near this
            righteousness to a poor sensible sinner, he at the same time works
            faith in him to look to it, lay hold upon it, and plead it as his
            justifying righteousness with God: or it comes "through" it; hence
            it appears that faith and righteousness are two distinct things; and
            that faith is not a man's righteousness before God, for it comes to
            him through it; as also that righteousness is before faith, or
            otherwise faith could not come by it; and, moreover, is the cause
            and reason of it; faith has no causal influence upon righteousness,
            but righteousness has upon faith: the reason why a man has a
            justifying righteousness is not because he has faith; but the reason
            why he has faith given him is because he has a justifying
            righteousness provided for him, and imputed to him.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace</em>. By grace is designated God's paternal favor towards
            us. We have indeed been once for all reconciled to God by the death
            of Christ, and by faith we come to the possession of this so great a
            benefit; but as we perceive the grace of God according to the
            measure of our faith, it is said to increase according to our
            perception when it becomes more fully known to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Peace</em>. For as the beginning of our happiness is when God
            receives us into favor; so the more he confirms his love in our
            hearts, the richer blessing he confers on us, so that we become
            happy and prosperous in all things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Be multiplied</em>. By a multiplication of grace may be meant a
            larger discovery of the love and favour of God; which though it
            admits of no degrees in itself, being never more or less in God's
            heart, yet, as to the manifestations of it, it is different, and
            capable of being increased, and drawn out to a greater length; or
            else an increase of the internal graces of the Spirit of God, as to
            the actings and exercise of them; or a larger measure of the gifts
            of the Spirit, for greater usefulness among them; or a clearer view,
            and a more enlarged knowledge of the Gospel of the grace of God, and
            the truths of it; and indeed, the word grace may take in all these
            senses: and by a multiplication of peace, which the apostle in this
            salutation also wishes for, may be designed an affluence of all kind
            of prosperity, temporal, and spiritual, external and internal; and
            more especially an increase of spiritual peace, a fulness of joy and
            peace in believing, arising from a sense of free justification by
            Christ's righteousness, and full pardon and atonement by his blood
            and sacrifice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord</em>. Which is to
            be understood, not of a natural, but of a spiritual and evangelical
            knowledge; of a knowledge of God, not as the God of nature and
            providence, but as the God of all grace, as in Christ, and a
            covenant God in him, and of the person, offices, and grace of
            Christ; and which designs true faith in him, by which means larger
            discoveries of the grace of God are made, and a greater enjoyment of
            spiritual peace is had. The apostle prays, as for a multiplication
            of grace and peace, so along with it, an increase of spiritual and
            evangelical knowledge which in the best is imperfect, but may be
            increased by the blessing of God on those means which he has
            appointed for that end.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the more any one advances in the knowledge of God, every kind of
            blessing increases also equally with the sense of divine love.
            Whosoever then aspires to the full fruition of the blessed life
            which is mentioned by Peter, must remember to observe the right way.
            He connects together at the same time the knowledge of God and of
            Christ; because God cannot be rightly known except in Christ,
            according to that saying, "No one knoweth the Father but the Son,
            and he to whom the Son will reveal him." (Mat 11:27).

            Like First Peter, Second Peter opens with a salutation closely
            resembling Paul’s modification of the usual opening of the Greek
            letter of that day. The naming of Peter as author of the letter
            differs in two respects from that employed in 1 Peter 1:1: First, in
            joining Peter’s original Aramaic name of &quot;Simon&quot; with his
            Greek name (see Matthew 16:17; John 1:42); and second, in describing
            Peter as &quot;a servant&quot; as well as an &quot;apostle of Jesus
            Christ,&quot; In this respect also Second Peter is somewhat
            patterned after Paul’s formula (see Romans 1:1).
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike First Peter (see 1:1), Second Peter is not addressed to any
            particular group of churches, but instead is written to &quot;those
            who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours in the
            righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ&quot; (vs. 1). This
            unusual description of the readers of the letter, together with its
            general format and the fact that it contains no closing greetings,
            suggests that in origin it was an essay or sermon, later converted
            into a letter by the addition of the opening salutation. However, as
            we shall see, the stamp of Peter’s experiences and character is so
            impressed upon the composition as a whole as to point to its
            essential unity and to the fact that it must have been the original
            author (see 1:14, 17-18; 3:1-2).
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Faith&quot; plays a relatively small part in the teaching of
            Second Peter, the word being found only in verses 1 and 5 of this
            first chapter, whereas in First Peter it is found in 1:5, 7, 9, 21,
            and 5:9. Nowhere else in the New Testament is &quot;faith&quot; said
            to be &quot;in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus
            Christ,&quot; the nearest equivalent to this expression being found
            in Galatians 5:5 (see also Romans 1:17). The idea, however, is a
            thoroughly biblical one, inasmuch as &quot;righteousness&quot; in
            the Scriptures represents a far more concrete conception than with
            us. We might, therefore, translate the Greek here rather as
            &quot;faith ... in the righteous activity&quot; of God, such
            activity being the equivalent of the &quot;salvation&quot; or
            &quot;deliverance&quot; which he works out for man on the plane of
            history through a series of redemptive acts (see Isaiah 51:5-6;
            Isaiah 51:8).

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            The first part of the benediction in verse 2 (&quot;May grace and
            peace be multiplied to you&quot;) is identical with that found in 1
            Peter 1:2. In what follows in this verse (&quot;in the knowledge of
            God and of Jesus our Lord&quot;) we are introduced to two points of
            striking significance for the letter as a whole: First, its emphasis
            upon &quot;knowledge,&quot; and second, its high view of the person
            of Jesus Christ. This is seen here in the close connection of
            &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Jesus our Lord,&quot; a phenomenon which
            is duplicated many times elsewhere in the New Testament (see 1
            Corinthians 8:6). The expression &quot;our God and Savior Jesus
            Christ&quot; in verse 1, however, goes beyond the one in verse 2. It
            is comparable in form to the expression &quot;our Lord and Savior
            Jesus Christ&quot; in 1:11; 2:20; and 3:18 (see also 3:2). There can
            be no doubt that in these latter references &quot;Lord&quot; and
            &quot;Savior&quot; both apply to &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; and it is
            natural, therefore, to take the expression &quot;God and
            Savior&quot; as also referring to &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; as is
            done in the Revised Standard Version. Jesus Christ is called at once
            God and Savior is Titus 2 Peter 2:13.

            "Since I see thee, most excellent Diognetus, exceedingly desirous to
            learn the mode of worshipping God prevalent among the Christians,
            and inquiring very carefully and earnestly concerning them, what God
            they trust in, and what form of religion they observe, so as all to
            look down upon the world itself, and despise death, while they
            neither esteem those to be gods that are reckoned such by the
            Greeks, nor hold to the superstition of the Jews; and what is the
            affection which they cherish among themselves; and why, in fine,
            this new kind or practice [of piety] has only now entered into the
            world, and not long ago; I cordially welcome this thy desire, and I
            implore God, who enables us both to speak and to hear, to grant to
            me so to speak, that, above all, I may hear you have been edified,
            and to you so to hear, that I who speak may have no cause of regret

            dearest son Marcellinus, suggested, and which is due to you by my
            promise. I have undertaken its defence against those who prefer
            their own gods to the Founder of this city,-a city surpassingly
            glorious, whether we view it as it still lives by faith in this
            fleeting course of time, and sojourns as a stranger in the midst of
            the ungodly, or as it shall dwell in the fixed stability of its
            eternal seat, which it now with patience waits for, expecting until
            "righteousness shall return unto judgment," and it obtain, by virtue
            of its excellence, final victory and perfect peace. A great work
            this, and an arduous; but God is my helper. For I am aware what
            ability is requisite to persuade the proud how great is the virtue
            of humility, which raises us, not by a quite human arrogance, but by
            a divine grace, above all earthly dignities that totter on this
            shifting scene. For the King and Founder of this city of which we
            speak, has in Scripture uttered to His people a dictum of the divine
            law in these words: 'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto
            the humble.'" (Augustine,

            "I Lately inflicted a severe stroke upon those who are grasping and
            wish to overreach others; I did this not in order to wound them but
            in order to correct them; not because I hate the men, but because I
            detest their wickedness. For so the physician also lances the
            abscess, not as making an attack upon the suffering body, but as a
            means of contending with the disorder and the wound. Well to-day let
            us grant them a little respite, that they may recover from their
            distress, and not recoil from the remedy by being perpetually
            afflicted. Physicians also act thus; after the use of the knife they
            apply plasters and drugs, and let a few days pass whilst they devise
            things to allay the pain. Following their example let me today,
            devising means for them to derive benefit from my discourse, start a
            question concerning doctrine, directing my speech to the words which
            have been read. For I imagine that many feel perplexed as to the
            reason why these words were uttered by Christ: and it is probable
            also that any heretics who are present may pounce upon the words,
            and thereby upset many of the more simple-minded brethren."

            "The knowledge of our religion and of the truth of things is
            independently manifest rather than in need of human teachers, for
            almost day by day it asserts itself by facts, and manifests itself
            brighter than the sun by the doctrine of Christ. Still, as you
            nevertheless desire to hear about it, Macarius, come let us as we
            may be able set forth a few points of the faith of Christ: able
            though you are to find it out from the divine oracles, but yet
            generously desiring to hear from others as well. For although the
            sacred and inspired Scriptures are sufficient to declare the truth —
            while there are other works of our blessed teachers compiled for
            this purpose, if he meet with which a man will gain some knowledge
            of the interpretation of the Scriptures, and be able to learn what
            he wishes to know — still, as we have not at present in our hands
            the compositions of our teachers, we must communicate in writing to
            you what we learned from them — the faith, namely, of Christ the
            Saviour; lest any should hold cheap the doctrine taught among us, or

            ἰσότιμον. It is doubtful whether it means “like in honour” or “like
            in value”. We may compare the sense of τιμή in 2 Peter 1:17, where
            the sense is clearly of an honour conferred (cf. 1 Peter 1:7), which
            would suggest the same meaning here.

            instrumental., δικαιοσύνῃ has the sense of “justice” or
            “impartiality,” and is opposed to προσωπολημψία. God is no respecter
            of persons. There is no distinction in His sight between the faith
            of an eyewitness, and the faith of those “who have not seen”. With
            this non-theological sense of δικ. cf. ἄδικος in Hebrews 6:10; also
            1 John 1:9. Θεοῦ refers to Christ, cf. John 20:28. σωτῆρος, a title
            used by the Emperor.
          </p>

            πίστιν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ. can hardly be taken together (cf. Ephesians
            1:15, 1 Timothy 3:13), as the relation of the believer to Christ in
            this epistle is rather that of γνῶσις or ἐπίγνωσις (cf. 2 Peter
            1:2).

          <p>
            ἐπίγνωσις in this epistle corresponds to πίστις in the Pauline
            sense. In Romans 1:21 γνόντες is used of the imperfect knowledge of
            God possessed by the heathen world, and in Romans 1:28 he contrasts
            it with the Christian or perfect knowledge of God. (καθὼς οὐκ
            ἐδοκίμασαν τὸν Θεὸν ἔχειν ἐν ἐπιγνώσει). Cf. 1 Corinthians 13:12,
            Colossians 1:9.
          </p>
          <p>
            ἐπίγνωσις. Involving the complete appropriation of all truth and the
            unreserved acquiescence in God’s will, is the goal and crown of the
            believer’s course. ἐπίγνωσις implies a more intimate and personal
            relationship than γνῶσις. It would be a useful word, seeing that
            γνῶσις. had become associated with Gnosticism, then incipient in the
            Church. Grace and peace are multiplied in and through this more
            intimate heart knowledge of Jesus Christ, in contrast to a mere
            barren γνῶσις.

            In reading the epistles of the different Apostles, whether written
            to particular Churches, or to the whole catholic Church throughout
            the world, we cannot but be struck with the benevolence which they
            breathe in every part, and especially in the salutations with which
            they begin, and the blessings with which they close. In the words
            which we have now read, which, as in the former epistle, are
            addressed to the whole Church scattered through the Roman empire, we
            may notice two things,—an inscription—and a salutation: to both of
            which we will now turn your attention.
          </p>
          <p><b>Peter&#x27;s Salutation to the Saints:</b></p>
          <p>
            <b>2 Peter 1:1-2.</b> "Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of
            Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us
            through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ: grace
            and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and
            of Jesus our Lord."
          </p>
          <p><b>I. The inscription.</b></p>
          <p>Here the Apostle describes,</p>
          <p>1. The writer.</p>
          <p>
            His own proper name was Simon, or Simeon, as he is called in the
            original and by the Apostle James. The name Peter was given to him
            by his Lord on two different occasions; partly, to mark his
            characteristic boldness; and partly to intimate, that on his
            testimony both to Jews and Gentiles the Christian Church should be
            established. The office he held as a servant and an Apostle of the
            Lord Jesus Christ was the highest that could be assigned to mortal
            man: and the peculiar care which he took in thus designating his own
            name and character satisfies our minds that this epistle, no less
            than the former which bears his name, was written by him: for no bad
            man would have written it; and no good man could have been guilty of
            such a forgery as that of assuming the name and office of this
            inspired Apostle.
          </p>
          <p>2. The persons addressed.</p>
          <p>
            These were believers throughout the world. They &quot;had
            faith&quot; in our Lord Jesus Christ, as the only Savior of fallen
            man. They had &quot;obtained&quot; this faith, not by any efforts of
            their own, but, as it were, by lot, just as all the tribes of Israel
            obtained their portion in the promised land. To each the precise
            measure was assigned by God himself: nor was there one throughout
            the whole land who was not constrained to acknowledge that he owed
            his portion solely to the free and sovereign grace of God—This faith
            was precisely &quot;the same&quot; whether in Apostles or private
            Christians, and &quot;alike precious&quot; to them all: for though
            the faith of different persons might differ widely in its degrees
            and consequent operations, it was &quot;alike precious&quot; to all,
            inasmuch as it was the one means of uniting them to Christ, and of
            saving their souls alive—&quot;Through the righteousness of God our
            Savior&quot; too was this faith obtained: for by that righteousness
            it was purchased for them; and through the prevalence of that
            righteousness, as pleaded with God in their behalf, was the gift of
            faith imparted to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this respect, then, every saint under Heaven answers to the
            character drawn by the Apostle, and may consider the epistle as
            addressed personally to his own self in particular, as much as ever
            it was to the saints in the Apostle&#x27;s days.
          </p>
          <p>From the inscription we pass on to,</p>
          <p><b>II. The salutation.</b></p>
          <p>
            &quot;Grace and peace&quot; comprehended all the blessings of the
            Gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, in the salutations of the Apostles, &quot;mercy&quot; is
            added; &quot;Grace, mercy, and peace,&quot; but generally it is, as
            here, &quot;Grace and peace.&quot; By &quot;Grace&quot; I understand
            all that is necessary for the transformation of the soul into the
            Divine image: and by &quot;peace,&quot; all that is necessary for
            the comfort and encouragement of the soul in its progress
            heavenward.
          </p>
          <p>
            These the Apostle desired to be &quot;multiplied&quot; unto the
            saints.
          </p>
          <p>
            There should be no measure of these in which we should rest; seeing
            that there is no measure which may not be greatly and abundantly
            increased. We should therefore, even if our attainments were equal
            to those of the Apostle Paul, &quot;forget what is behind, and reach
            forth to that which is before.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            They are to be multiplied solely &quot;through the knowledge of God,
            and of Jesus our Lord.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            It is by that knowledge alone that grace and peace are at first
            obtained: when we look to God as reconciled to us in Christ Jesus,
            then grace and peace flow down into our souls. In like manner, it is
            only through an increasing acquaintance with this mystery that we
            grow up into Christ, and are transformed into his image. Contemplate
            then more and more the wonders of redeeming love: and be assured,
            that in proportion as you are enabled to comprehend them, you shall
            &quot;be filled with all the fullness of God.&quot;
