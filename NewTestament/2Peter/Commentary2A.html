        <h2>A. Divine Provision (1:3-4)</h2>
        <p>
          In verses 3-4 Peter’s thesis is that this intimate
          &quot;knowledge&quot; of God is the means whereby men are led to share
          his &quot;glory and excellence,&quot; thus receiving the fulfillment
          of &quot;his precious and very great promises&quot; and at last
          becoming &quot;partakers of the divine nature.&quot; The creative
          cause, says our author, which lies behind this redemptive process is
          God’s &quot;divine power.&quot;
        </p>
        <div id="Expository" class="commentary">

              pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>His divine power</em>. Meaning either the power of God the
            Father, to whom belong eternal power and Godhead; and he is
            sometimes called by the name of power itself; see Matthew 26:64
            being all powerful and mighty; or rather the power of Christ, since
            he is the next and immediate antecedent to this relative; and who,
            as he has the fulness of the Godhead in him, is almighty, and can do
            all things; and is "El-shaddai", God all-sufficient, and can
            communicate all things whatsoever he pleases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Has granted to us all things that pertain to life and
              godliness</em
            >. Referring not so much to a temporal life, though he gives that
            and preserves it, and furnishes with all the mercies and comforts of
            it; and which come to us, from him, in a covenant way, as his left
            hand blessings, and in great love; but rather a spiritual life,
            which he is the author and maintainer of, all the joys, pleasures,
            blessings, and supports of it, being given by him; as also eternal
            life, for that, and everything appertaining to it, are from him; he
            gives a meetness for it, which is his own grace, and a right unto
            it, which is his own righteousness; and he has power to give that
            itself to as many as the Father has given him, and he does give it
            to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise all things belonging to "godliness", or internal religion;
            and which is the means of eternal life, and leads on to it, and is
            connected with it, and has the promise both of this life, and of
            that which is to come; and everything relating to it, or is in it,
            or it consists of, is from Christ: the internal graces of the
            Spirit, as faith, hope, and love, which, when in exercise, are the
            principal parts of powerful godliness, are the gifts of Christ, are
            received out of his fulness, and of which he is the author and
            finisher; and he is the donor of all the fresh supplies of grace to
            maintain the inward power of religion, and to assist in the external
            exercise of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through the knowledge of him</em>. A "knowledge" of him which is
            not notional and speculative, but spiritual, experimental, fiducial,
            and practical, or along with such knowledge all the above things are
            given; for as God, in giving Christ, gives all things along with
            him, so the Spirit of Christ, which is a spirit of wisdom and
            revelation in the knowledge of him, when he makes him known in the
            glory of his person, grace, and righteousness, also makes known the
            several things which are freely given of God and Christ: and this is
            what, among other things, makes the knowledge of Christ preferable
            to all other knowledge, or anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who called us</em>. The call here spoken of is not a bare
            outward call, by the ministry of the word, but an internal, special,
            and powerful one, which springs from the grace, and is according to
            the purpose of God, and is inseparably connected with justification
            and glorification; and is either of God the Father, who, as the God
            of all grace, calls to eternal glory by Christ; or rather of Christ
            himself, who calls by his Spirit and grace. Hence the saints are
            sometimes styled, the called of Jesus Christ, Romans 1:6.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By his own glory and virtue</em>. They are called unto him by
            his, "glory and virtue"; by the former may be meant, the glorious
            state of the saints in the other world, and so answers to "life",
            eternal life, in the preceding clause; and by the latter, grace, and
            the spiritual blessings of grace here, and which answers to
            "godliness" in the said clause; for the saints are called both to
            grace and glory, and to the one, in order to the other.

            <em>By which he has granted to us</em>. That is, glory and virtue;

            Gospel of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>His precious and exceedingly great promises</em>. Meaning the
            promises of the new and everlasting covenant, of which Christ is the
            Mediator, surety, and messenger; and which are "exceeding great", if
            we consider the author of them, who is the great God of heaven and
            earth, and who was under no obligation to make promises of anything
            to his creatures; and therefore must arise from great grace and
            favour, of which they are largely expressive, and are like himself;
            are such as become his greatness and goodness, and are confirmed by
            his oath, and made good by his power and faithfulness: and they are
            also great, as to the nature and matter of them; they are better
            promises than those of the covenant of works; they are not merely
            temporal ones, nor are they conditional and legal; but as they
            relate to things spiritual and eternal, to grace here and glory
            hereafter, so they are absolute, free, and unconditional, and are
            irreversible and unchangeable; and they answer great ends and
            purposes, the glory of God, and the everlasting good and happiness
            of his people; and therefore must be "precious", of more value and
            worth than thousands of gold and silver, and to be rejoiced at more
            than at the finding of a great spoil, being every way suited to the
            cases of God's people, and which never fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >That through these you may become partakers of the divine
              nature</em
            >. Not essentially, or of the essence of God, so as to be deified,
            this is impossible, for the nature, perfections, and glory of God,
            are incommunicable to creatures; nor, hypostatically and personally,
            so as the human nature of Christ, in union with the Son of God, is a
            partaker of the divine nature in him; but by way of resemblance and
            likeness, the new man or principle of grace, being formed in the
            heart in regeneration, after the image of God, and bearing a
            likeness to the image of his Son, and this is styled, Christ formed
            in the heart, into which image and likeness the saints are more and
            more changed, from glory to glory, through the application of the
            Gospel, and the promises of it, by which they have such sights of
            Christ as do transform them, and assimilate them to him; and which
            resemblance will be perfected hereafter, when they shall be entirely
            like him, and see him as he is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by
              lust</em
            >. Not the corruption and depravity of nature, which is never
            escaped by any, nor got rid of so long as the saints are in the
            world; but the corrupt manners of the world, or those corruptions
            and vices which, are prevalent in the world, and under the power and
            dominion of which the world lies; and particularly the sins of
            uncleanness, adultery, incest, sodomy, and such like filthy and
            unnatural lusts, which abounded in the world, and among some that
            called themselves Christians, and especially the followers of Simon
            Magus. Now the Gospel, and the precious promises, being graciously
            bestowed and powerfully applied, have an influence on purity of
            heart and conversation, and teach men to deny ungodliness and
            worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly; such are
            the powerful effects of Gospel promises, under divine influence, as
            to make men inwardly partakers of the divine nature, and outwardly
            to abstain from and avoid the prevailing corruptions and vices of
            the times.

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the most striking characteristics of Second Peter (and one
            incidentally which distinguishes it markedly from First Peter) is
            the emphasis upon &quot;knowledge.&quot; In Second Peter the
            &quot;knowledge&quot; in question concerns, in the first instance,
            an intimate acquaintance and fellowship with God, or, alternatively,
            with Jesus Christ as Lord. In the New Testament the nearest approach
            to Second Peter’s meaning is to be found in numerous passages in
            Paul (see Romans 1:28; Romans 10:2; Ephesians 1:17; Ephesians 4:13).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the phrase &quot;his own glory and excellence&quot; we probably
            have a form of expression where two words are used to express a
            single idea. In Isaiah 42:8; Isaiah 42:12 the Greek translation of
            the Hebrew (rendered in the Revised Standard Version
            &quot;glory&quot; and &quot;praise&quot;) employs the same two Greek
            words as are found here. &quot;Excellence,&quot; therefore, should
            be taken to mean the same as &quot;glory,&quot; and both together
            represent the fact that, by the &quot;divine power,&quot; man is to
            be raised to the stature of the manifested nature of God in all of
            his moral excellence (see Ephesians 4:13). The statement that God
            gives his people &quot;all things that pertain to life and
            godliness&quot; sounds very much like the teaching of Jesus, as for
            example, in Matthew 6:33; Matthew 7:11. God’s salvation of man
            issues in &quot;escape from... corruption&quot; and the effects of
            man’s &quot;passion&quot; (see also 2 Peter 2:10; 2:18; 3:3).
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 4.

              world by lust.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            The expressions &quot;divine power&quot; and &quot;divine
            nature,&quot; which represent at once the beginning and end of this
            redemptive activity of God, find no parallel in the New Testament,
            but the ideas involved are biblical. It needs no proof that
            throughout the Scriptures the power of God lies behind the
            redemptive process. And it is clear that for Second Peter, to be
            &quot;partakers of the divine nature&quot; is simply to say that God
            has &quot;called us to his own glory and excellence.&quot; This a
            wholly biblical idea (see Romans 2:10; 5:2; 8:21; 1 Corinthians 2:7;
            2 Corinthians 3:18).

            Two Greek words, both from the same stem, are translated as
            "knowledge" in the Revised Standard Version. The more simple of the
            two, the word which gives us &quot;Gnosticism,&quot; is found in
            1:5, 6 and 3:18; its verb form (to &quot;understand&quot;) appears
            in 1:20 and 3:3. The related word, also translated
            &quot;knowledge,&quot; is found in 1:2, 3, 8, and 2:20, and its
            verbal form appears twice in 2:21, where it is translated
            &quot;known&quot; and &quot;knowing.&quot; None of these forms with
            the exception of the very first is found in First Peter (see 1 Peter
            3:7, &quot;considerately”) and this one instance has no theological
            significance.
