        <h2>A. Divine Provision (1:3-4)</h2>
        <p>
          In verses 3-4 Peter’s thesis is that this intimate
          &quot;knowledge&quot; of God is the means whereby men are led to share
          his &quot;glory and excellence,&quot; thus receiving the fulfillment
          of &quot;his precious and very great promises&quot; and at last
          becoming &quot;partakers of the divine nature.&quot; The creative
          cause, says our author, which lies behind this redemptive process is
          God’s &quot;divine power.&quot;
        </p>
        <div id="Expository" class="commentary">

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>His divine power</em>. Meaning either the power of God the
            Father, to whom belong eternal power and Godhead; and he is
            sometimes called by the name of power itself; see Matthew 26:64
            being all powerful and mighty; or rather the power of Christ, since
            he is the next and immediate antecedent to this relative; and who,
            as he has the fulness of the Godhead in him, is almighty, and can do
            all things; and is "El-shaddai", God all-sufficient, and can
            communicate all things whatsoever he pleases.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Has granted to us all things that pertain to life and
              godliness</em
            >. Referring not so much to a temporal life, though he gives that
            and preserves it, and furnishes with all the mercies and comforts of
            it; and which come to us, from him, in a covenant way, as his left
            hand blessings, and in great love; but rather a spiritual life,
            which he is the author and maintainer of, all the joys, pleasures,
            blessings, and supports of it, being given by him; as also eternal
            life, for that, and everything appertaining to it, are from him; he
            gives a meetness for it, which is his own grace, and a right unto
            it, which is his own righteousness; and he has power to give that
            itself to as many as the Father has given him, and he does give it
            to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise all things belonging to "godliness", or internal religion;
            and which is the means of eternal life, and leads on to it, and is
            connected with it, and has the promise both of this life, and of
            that which is to come; and everything relating to it, or is in it,
            or it consists of, is from Christ: the internal graces of the
            Spirit, as faith, hope, and love, which, when in exercise, are the
            principal parts of powerful godliness, are the gifts of Christ, are
            received out of his fulness, and of which he is the author and
            finisher; and he is the donor of all the fresh supplies of grace to
            maintain the inward power of religion, and to assist in the external
            exercise of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through the knowledge of him</em>. A "knowledge" of him which is
            not notional and speculative, but spiritual, experimental, fiducial,
            and practical, or along with such knowledge all the above things are
            given; for as God, in giving Christ, gives all things along with
            him, so the Spirit of Christ, which is a spirit of wisdom and
            revelation in the knowledge of him, when he makes him known in the
            glory of his person, grace, and righteousness, also makes known the
            several things which are freely given of God and Christ: and this is
            what, among other things, makes the knowledge of Christ preferable
            to all other knowledge, or anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who called us</em>. The call here spoken of is not a bare
            outward call, by the ministry of the word, but an internal, special,
            and powerful one, which springs from the grace, and is according to
            the purpose of God, and is inseparably connected with justification
            and glorification; and is either of God the Father, who, as the God
            of all grace, calls to eternal glory by Christ; or rather of Christ
            himself, who calls by his Spirit and grace. Hence the saints are
            sometimes styled, the called of Jesus Christ, Romans 1:6.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By his own glory and virtue</em>. They are called unto him by
            his, "glory and virtue"; by the former may be meant, the glorious
            state of the saints in the other world, and so answers to "life",
            eternal life, in the preceding clause; and by the latter, grace, and
            the spiritual blessings of grace here, and which answers to
            "godliness" in the said clause; for the saints are called both to
            grace and glory, and to the one, in order to the other.

          <p>
            <em>By which he has granted to us</em>. That is, glory and virtue;

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>His precious and exceedingly great promises</em>. Meaning the
            promises of the new and everlasting covenant, of which Christ is the
            Mediator, surety, and messenger; and which are "exceeding great", if
            we consider the author of them, who is the great God of heaven and
            earth, and who was under no obligation to make promises of anything
            to his creatures; and therefore must arise from great grace and
            favour, of which they are largely expressive, and are like himself;
            are such as become his greatness and goodness, and are confirmed by
            his oath, and made good by his power and faithfulness: and they are
            also great, as to the nature and matter of them; they are better
            promises than those of the covenant of works; they are not merely
            temporal ones, nor are they conditional and legal; but as they
            relate to things spiritual and eternal, to grace here and glory
            hereafter, so they are absolute, free, and unconditional, and are
            irreversible and unchangeable; and they answer great ends and
            purposes, the glory of God, and the everlasting good and happiness
            of his people; and therefore must be "precious", of more value and
            worth than thousands of gold and silver, and to be rejoiced at more
            than at the finding of a great spoil, being every way suited to the
            cases of God's people, and which never fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >That through these you may become partakers of the divine
              nature</em
            >. Not essentially, or of the essence of God, so as to be deified,
            this is impossible, for the nature, perfections, and glory of God,
            are incommunicable to creatures; nor, hypostatically and personally,
            so as the human nature of Christ, in union with the Son of God, is a
            partaker of the divine nature in him; but by way of resemblance and
            likeness, the new man or principle of grace, being formed in the
            heart in regeneration, after the image of God, and bearing a
            likeness to the image of his Son, and this is styled, Christ formed
            in the heart, into which image and likeness the saints are more and
            more changed, from glory to glory, through the application of the
            Gospel, and the promises of it, by which they have such sights of
            Christ as do transform them, and assimilate them to him; and which
            resemblance will be perfected hereafter, when they shall be entirely
            like him, and see him as he is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by
              lust</em
            >. Not the corruption and depravity of nature, which is never
            escaped by any, nor got rid of so long as the saints are in the
            world; but the corrupt manners of the world, or those corruptions
            and vices which, are prevalent in the world, and under the power and
            dominion of which the world lies; and particularly the sins of
            uncleanness, adultery, incest, sodomy, and such like filthy and
            unnatural lusts, which abounded in the world, and among some that
            called themselves Christians, and especially the followers of Simon
            Magus. Now the Gospel, and the precious promises, being graciously
            bestowed and powerfully applied, have an influence on purity of
            heart and conversation, and teach men to deny ungodliness and
            worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly; such are
            the powerful effects of Gospel promises, under divine influence, as
            to make men inwardly partakers of the divine nature, and outwardly
            to abstain from and avoid the prevailing corruptions and vices of
            the times.

          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the most striking characteristics of Second Peter (and one
            incidentally which distinguishes it markedly from First Peter) is
            the emphasis upon &quot;knowledge.&quot; In Second Peter the
            &quot;knowledge&quot; in question concerns, in the first instance,
            an intimate acquaintance and fellowship with God, or, alternatively,
            with Jesus Christ as Lord. In the New Testament the nearest approach
            to Second Peter’s meaning is to be found in numerous passages in
            Paul (see Romans 1:28; Romans 10:2; Ephesians 1:17; Ephesians 4:13).
          </p>
          <p>
            In the phrase &quot;his own glory and excellence&quot; we probably
            have a form of expression where two words are used to express a
            single idea. In Isaiah 42:8; Isaiah 42:12 the Greek translation of
            the Hebrew (rendered in the Revised Standard Version
            &quot;glory&quot; and &quot;praise&quot;) employs the same two Greek
            words as are found here. &quot;Excellence,&quot; therefore, should
            be taken to mean the same as &quot;glory,&quot; and both together
            represent the fact that, by the &quot;divine power,&quot; man is to
            be raised to the stature of the manifested nature of God in all of
            his moral excellence (see Ephesians 4:13). The statement that God
            gives his people &quot;all things that pertain to life and
            godliness&quot; sounds very much like the teaching of Jesus, as for
            example, in Matthew 6:33; Matthew 7:11. God’s salvation of man
            issues in &quot;escape from... corruption&quot; and the effects of
            man’s &quot;passion&quot; (see also 2 Peter 2:10; 2:18; 3:3).
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 4.

              world by lust.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            The expressions &quot;divine power&quot; and &quot;divine
            nature,&quot; which represent at once the beginning and end of this
            redemptive activity of God, find no parallel in the New Testament,
            but the ideas involved are biblical. It needs no proof that
            throughout the Scriptures the power of God lies behind the
            redemptive process. And it is clear that for Second Peter, to be
            &quot;partakers of the divine nature&quot; is simply to say that God
            has &quot;called us to his own glory and excellence.&quot; This a
            wholly biblical idea (see Romans 2:10; 5:2; 8:21; 1 Corinthians 2:7;
            2 Corinthians 3:18).

            Two Greek words, both from the same stem, are translated as
            "knowledge" in the Revised Standard Version. The more simple of the
            two, the word which gives us &quot;Gnosticism,&quot; is found in
            1:5, 6 and 3:18; its verb form (to &quot;understand&quot;) appears
            in 1:20 and 3:3. The related word, also translated
            &quot;knowledge,&quot; is found in 1:2, 3, 8, and 2:20, and its
            verbal form appears twice in 2:21, where it is translated
            &quot;known&quot; and &quot;knowing.&quot; None of these forms with
            the exception of the very first is found in First Peter (see 1 Peter
            3:7, &quot;considerately”) and this one instance has no theological
            significance.

            THE Lord Jesus Christ, as Mediator, procures for us all blessings
            from God: but, as God, he authoritatively imparts them. It is of him
            that the Apostle speaks, when he says, &quot;His divine power has
            given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.&quot; But
            the words which follow my text are of more doubtful interpretation.
            Some understand them as importing, that these things are given for
            the acknowledgment of God, who has called us by the mighty working
            of his power. This rendering of the words is so extremely different
            from that which our translators have given us, and at the same time
            is maintained by so many persons of eminence, that I have chosen
            rather to wave the consideration of them altogether, than to
            determine which of the two is the more correct: though I cannot but
            say, that I prefer the sense that is given us in our authorized
            translation. The words before us convey a most important truth,
            which I shall endeavor to illustrate. The Lord Jesus has indeed
            given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,
          </p>
          <p><b>I. In a way of general provision.</b></p>
          <p>
            In his blessed word, he has given to us, and to the whole world,
          </p>
          <p>1. Instructions.</p>
          <p>
            There is nothing needful for us to know, but it may be found in the
            Scriptures of truth. There we are informed how a sinner may be
            reconciled to his offended God—There we see how we may obtain a new
            nature, and be renewed after the image of our God in righteousness
            and true holiness—There we are told how we may walk so as to please
            and honor God—Nothing is omitted there, which can conduce, either to
            our obtaining of life, or to our possessing of vital godliness. And
            whatever has been added by man, has a tendency rather to counteract
            than forward our eternal interests.
          </p>
          <p>2. Promises.</p>
          <p>
            These are &quot;exceeding great and precious,&quot; and comprehend
            everything which our necessities require. Place us in any situation
            that can possibly be imagined, and there will be found a promise
            directly applicable to our state. Nor is anything required of us, in
            order to obtain an interest in these promises: if only we have a
            desire after the things promised, and a willingness to receive them
            as the free gift of God for Christ&#x27;s sake, they become ours,
            and shall be fulfilled to us: and by them we shall be made partakers
            of that very godliness which might be supposed to be a necessary
            pre-requisite for an interest in them. We are not first to cleanse
            ourselves from sin, and then lay hold on the promises; but first to
            take the promises, and then, by their influence, to &quot;cleanse
            ourselves from all filthiness, both of flesh and spirit, and to
            perfect holiness in the fear of God.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>3. Examples.</p>
          <p>
            The force of example is pre-eminently great, as affording us both
            direction and encouragement. And there is no grace which we can be
            called to exercise, but we have it exhibited and embodied in some
            bright pattern that is set before us. As for faith, the first
            leading grace from which almost all others flow, the examples of it
            are innumerable; and the powers which it possesses to elevate the
            soul are displayed in the strongest colors. Would we wish to know
            the precise operations of patience and meekness? the lives of Job
            and of Moses afford us most distinguished patterns. Would we behold
            fidelity, devotion, and the constraining influence of love? Elijah,
            David, Paul, say to us, &#x27;Be followers of us, and you shall
            attain these graces in perfection.&#x27; Such examples as these, not
            to mention any others of a different kind, which are &quot;set forth
            for our admonition,&quot; serve to explain the precepts, and to show
            us what measure of godliness we should aspire after, and may hope to
            attain. So that nothing is wanting to us, that can by any means help
            us forward in the divine life.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the Lord Jesus Christ has, to his obedient followers, given all
            things also,
          </p>
          <p><b>II. In a way of special communication.</b></p>
          <p>
            The instructions, promises, examples, which are contained in the
            Holy Scriptures, are common to all; but to his peculiar people the
            Lord Jesus Christ has given graces, which, by his divine power, he
            has wrought in their souls. On them he has bestowed,
          </p>
          <p>1. The gift of faith.</p>
          <p>
            This grace is essential to the welfare of every child of man; for it
            is through it alone that either life or godliness can be brought
            into the soul. But he enables his people to come to him, and lay
            hold on him, and to embrace his promises; and to draw forth out of
            his fullness all needful supplies, both of grace and peace. In their
            minds he works a conviction, that they have nothing in themselves to
            recommend them to God, and can do nothing whereby to obtain an
            interest in his favor. To them he makes himself known, as &quot;the
            way, the truth, and the life;&quot; and he brings them to &quot;live
            altogether by faith in Him, who has loved them, and given himself
            for them.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>2. The assistances of his grace.</p>
          <p>
            &quot;Without him they can do nothing,&quot; but &quot;through
            strength communicated by him, they are enabled to do all
            things.&quot; Have they to conflict with Satan, and withstand his
            assaults? They go forth in the strength of Christ, and are made
            &quot;more than conquerors,&quot; not all the powers of darkness can
            stand before them. Have they to sustain the heaviest afflictions?
            Through Christ they are enabled to &quot;glory in
            tribulations;&quot; and to &quot;take pleasure in every species of
            distress for his sake,&quot; under a full assurance that &quot;his
            strength shall be made perfect through their weakness;&quot; and
            that &quot;he shall be magnified in their body, whether by life or
            death.&quot; Whatever they have either to do or suffer, &quot;his
            grace his sufficient for them;&quot; and his divine power
            &quot;makes them perfect in every good work to do his will, working
            in them that which is well pleasing in his sight.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>3. The consolations of his Spirit.</p>
          <p>
            These are of prime necessity in the divine life; for &quot;the joy
            of the Lord is our strength.&quot; Without the light of God&#x27;s
            countenance lifted up upon us, our &quot;hands will hang down, our
            knees be feeble, and our hearts faint.&quot; But he will send to his
            people the Comforter, according to his word, to be in them &quot;a
            Spirit of adoption,&quot; &quot;a witness of their relation to
            him,&quot; and &quot;an earnest of their eternal inheritance.&quot;
            This will support them under all their trials, and animate them in
            all their conflicts, and bear them up above all the concerns of time
            and sense. With &quot;his love shed abroad in their hearts,&quot;
            nothing will move them: &quot;nor will they count their lives dear
            unto them, if only they may but fulfill his will, and finish their
            course with joy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p><b>III. Application.</b></p>
          <p>
            1. Let us inquire whether these blessings have indeed been conferred
            on us.
          </p>
          <p>
            As possessing the Book of Revelation, we have free access to all the
            benefits contained in it. But have we availed ourselves of this
            liberty, so as to have become partakers of the blessings themselves?
            How many are there who name the name of Christ, and yet have never
            received anything from him but the name! Look you well to this
            matter, my dear brethren; for, if you be not brought to live by him,
            and for him, and to him, it were better that you had never heard the
            Gospel at all; yes, and better that Christ himself had never come
            into the world.
          </p>
          <p>2. Endeavor to make a just improvement of them.</p>
          <p>
            If we are responsible to God for the offers of salvation, which are
            given to the whole world, much more are we for those special
            communications which are made only to God&#x27;s peculiar people.
            Have you light in your understandings? follow it with holy
            assiduity, and with a tender conscience; never &quot;hiding it under
            a bushel,&quot; or &quot;shutting it up in unrighteousness.&quot;
            Have you good desires in your hearts? Labor to carry them into
            effect; and rest not until you have attained the object for which
            they were given. Let every grace &quot;have its perfect work in you,
            that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Impart liberally to others what the Lord Jesus has so liberally
            conferred on you.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not for yourselves only that Christ has bestowed on you such
            blessings; but that you may be instruments in his hands to impart
            them to others. Have you the Holy Scriptures? Put them, if possible,
            into the hands of every child of man. Are you instructed in the
            knowledge of them? Send out missionaries into the world, to instruct
            the heathen, and to bring your Jewish brethren to the knowledge of
            that Savior whom their fathers crucified. Endeavor, too, that the
            rising generation be imbued with the principles of our holy
            religion, and be made partakers of all the benefits which you
            yourselves enjoy—&quot;Freely we have received; freely give,&quot;
            and let every blessing that you possess be regarded as a talent to
            be improved for the Lord, and to be accounted for to him at his
            judgment-seat.

            Commentators are not agreed with respect to the connection of these
            words. Some connect &quot;whereby&quot; with &quot;glory and
            virtue,&quot; in the preceding verse; and understand it thus:
            &quot;By which glorious energy of the Gospel are given unto us
            exceeding great and precious promises.&quot; Others, understanding
            the third verse parenthetically, connect my text with &quot;God and
            Christ,&quot; in the second verse, and translate the passage thus:
            &quot;By whom are given unto us,&quot; and so on. But, for the use
            which I am about to make of the passage, it is of no importance to
            determine precisely what the connection is. It is to the greatness
            and preciousness of the promises that I propose to direct your
            attention: and, therefore, waving any further notice of the context,
            I will open to you the promises of God, and show you,
          </p>
          <p><b>I. Their intrinsic worth.</b></p>
          <p>
            But how shall I attempt this? Shall I bring them all in order before
            your eyes? Many hours would not be sufficient for this arduous
            undertaking: let it suffice, then, to say,
          </p>
          <p>They extend to all the necessities of sinful man.</p>
          <p>
            Even the things of this life are frequently and fully comprehended
            in them: for Paul says, &quot;Godliness is profitable unto all
            things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that
            which is to come.&quot; And our blessed Lord has assured us, that,
            if we &quot;seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all
            needful things shall be added unto us.&quot; But &quot;the things
            which pertain unto life and godliness&quot; are those which are more
            immediately referred to in my text: and there is no want which an
            immortal soul can feel, in reference either to time or to eternity,
            which is not richly provided for in the promises of our God. Pardon,
            and peace, and holiness, and glory, are all secured to us, in terms
            the most explicit that language can afford. Nor, if men had been
            permitted to dictate unto God what things should be made over to
            them, or how freely they should be bestowed, could they ever have
            ventured to express what God has expressed, or to ask them on such
            easy terms: for all the promises are to be apprehended simply by
            faith, and to be possessed by all who will truly and sincerely rest
            upon them&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>But fully to declare their worth is impossible.</p>
          <p>
            Who shall appreciate a deliverance from the torments which are
            endured by those who are now cast into the lake of fire and
            brimstone? or, who shall form a correct estimate of the glory and
            felicity of Heaven? None but those who have experienced the one or
            the other can form any just conception of either: nor could any one
            fully and adequately comprehend what salvation imports, unless he
            have both endured the evil from which a condemned soul is rescued,
            and partaken of the blessedness to which a glorified soul is exalted
            before the throne of God. Eternity will be too short to count the
            inestimable worth of the exceeding great and precious promises which
            are contained in the Gospel of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>Let us pass on to consider,</p>
          <p><b>II. Their sanctifying efficacy.</b></p>
          <p>
            We must not imagine that any sinner can so &quot;partake of the
            Divine nature&quot; as really to be united to the Divine essence.
            That is impossible. But to partake of all the communicable
            perfections of the Deity, is the privilege of all who believe in
            Christ.
          </p>
          <p>We are exalted to bear a strict resemblance to the Deity.</p>
          <p>
            In mind, in will, in our whole character, we may resemble God: for,
            in conversion, we &quot;are renewed in knowledge after the image of
            Him that created us;&quot; so that we view everything no longer
            according to the apprehensions of our corrupt nature, but as taught
            of God, and enlightened by his Holy Spirit. With a renovated
            understanding we receive also a new heart; so that, instead of
            finding our will opposed to the will of God, &quot;we delight in the
            law of God after our inward man,&quot; and desire to do his will
            even as it is done in Heaven. I say not too much, if I add, that the
            very character of God is imparted to his saints, even as the
            impression of a seal to the melted wax; so that, through the
            operation of his grace upon them, they become &quot;holy, even as he
            is holy,&quot; and &quot;perfect, even as their Father which is in
            Heaven is perfect.&quot; As for &quot;the corruptions that are in
            the world through lust and inordinate desire, the true believer
            escapes from them,&quot; he renounces the world and all its
            vanities: he &quot;becomes crucified to it by the cross of
            Christ,&quot; he rises above it, &quot;keeps himself unspotted from
            it,&quot; and has his &quot;conversation altogether in Heaven.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>And by what is all this effected, but by the promises of God?</p>
          <p>
            &quot;By these we become partakers of the Divine nature, and escape
            the corruption that is in the world through lust.&quot; Paul is
            particularly careful in marking this important truth. He traces not
            any of these benefits to mere human efforts, but simply to faith in
            the Lord Jesus, which alone can &quot;overcome the world,&quot; and
            &quot;purify the heart.&quot; Hear his words; and mark especially
            the order which he prescribes for the attainment of these blessings:
            &quot;Having these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
            ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
            holiness in the fear of God.&quot; Here, at the same time that he
            specifies the extent to which the promises will effect this change,
            he shows us, that we are not to attain the change first, and then
            lay hold on the promises; but first to lay hold on the promises, and
            by them to attain the change. Now, this is a point of extreme
            importance; and it was marked with singular precision in the Jewish
            law. In the ordinance for the cleansing of the leper, it was
            appointed that the blood of his sacrifice should be put upon the tip
            of his right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the
            great toe of his right foot; which was to show, that, in all his
            faculties, whereby he either received or executed the will of God,
            even from head to foot, he needed an application of the blood of
            atonement, to cleanse him from his guilt: and then oil was not only
            to be applied by the priest to the same places, but to be &quot;put
            upon the very place of the blood of the trespass-offering&quot; And
            what was this intended to show? I hesitate not to say, it was
            intended to declare the very same thing which is intimated in my
            text; namely, that our justification by the blood of atonement must
            be first sought, and then our sanctification by the Holy Spirit;
            that the blood of atonement must be the foundation of our
            sanctification; and that, though the two are never to be separated,
            they must be sought in their due order, and be put each in its
            appointed and appropriate place. In a word, we must first go to God
            as sinners, to obtain mercy through the blood of Christ; and then
            shall we be made saints, by the operation of the Spirit of Christ
            upon our souls.
          </p>
          <p><b>III. Inferences.</b></p>
          <p>1. How desirable is an interest in Christ Jesus!</p>
          <p>
            It is in Christ that all the promises are treasured up for us; and
            in Him alone are they ratified and confirmed to us. Unless as found
            in him, and united unto him by faith, we have no part in any one of
            them: but &quot;all are ours, when we are Christ&#x27;s.&quot; How
            earnest, then, should we be, in fleeing to him, that we may receive
            out of his fullness all the blessings both of grace and glory! I
            pray you, brethren, neglect him not; but seek him with your whole
            hearts, and cleave unto him with your whole souls.
          </p>
          <p>2. How truly blessed are they who are united to him by faith!</p>
          <p>
            To them God has secured everything, not by promise only, but by oath
            also! And this he has done in order that they might be assured of
            &quot;the immutability of his counsel, and enjoy the richer
            consolation in their own souls.&quot; Take the word of God, my dear
            brethren: cull out of it every promise it contains, and carry it to
            the throne of grace, and plead it before God; and truly you shall,
            in your dying hour, be able to say with Solomon, &quot;Blessed be
            the Lord, who has given rest unto his people Israel, according to
            all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good
