              the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.</em

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>These are wells without water</em>. Which look large and deep,
            promise much, and have nothing in them; so these men looked like
            angels of light, transformed themselves as ministers of
            righteousness, had a form of godliness, and boasted of their great
            knowledge; promised great advantages to their followers, but were
            like deceitful brooks, or dry wells, and so disappointed those that
            came to them, and attended on them; having nothing but the filth and
            slime of error and iniquity, being destitute both of the grace of
            God, comparable to water, and of the truth of heavenly doctrine,
            which is like the rain that fills the wells, pools, and fountains.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Clouds driven by a storm</em>. These false teachers may be
            compared to clouds for their number, for many antichrists and false
            prophets soon came into the world; and for their sudden rise in the
            churches, into which they crept privily and unawares; and because of
            the general darkness they spread, for when errors and heresies
            prevail it is a dark and cloudy day with the churches, a day of
            gloominess and darkness, of thick darkness, a day of trouble,
            rebuke, and blasphemy; and because of the height of them, especially
            light clouds, as these are compared to, who are high in their own
            conceits and imaginations, and think, and give out themselves to be
            some great persons; and also because of their sudden destruction,
            which lingers and slumbers not, but comes upon them in a moment, and
            their glory passes away like the morning cloud: and these may be
            said to be as clouds "carried with a tempest": of their own lusts
            and passions, by which they are governed, and are led, and carried
            away with the force of them, and have no power to resist them, being
            under the dominion of them, and captives to them; and of Satan's
            temptations, who works effectually in them, with all power, signs,
            and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness,
            and being taken in his snare, are led captive by him at his will:
            Jude says, "carried about of winds", Judges 1:12, with every wind of
            false doctrine, like meteors in the air; are never at a point,
            always unsteady and unsettled, and ready to embrace every new and
            upstart notion
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever</em
            >. The nature of their punishment is expressed by "darkness", the
            blackest darkness, the mist of darkness, and which Jude calls
            blackness of darkness, the same with utter darkness; and which
            signifies a most forlorn and uncomfortable condition, and is a
            righteous judgment, and just retaliation upon them who studied to
            darken counsel by words without knowledge; and the certainty of
            their punishment is signified by its being "reserved", even as the
            happiness of the saints, and the safety and sureness of it are
            represented by an inheritance reserved in heaven: and as God has his
            treasures, magazines, and stores of grace and mercy, felicity and
            glory, for his people; so he has his wrath and vengeance reserved,
            laid up in store with him, and sealed up among his treasures, which
            he will surely bring forth in his own time: and the duration of this
            punishment is "for ever"; it is a worm that never dies, a fire that
            is never quenched, Isaiah 66:24 Mark 9:44; it is everlasting fire
            and burnings, the smoke of which ascends for ever and ever.

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness</em>. Marvellous
            things against the God of gods, great things and blasphemies against
            God, his name, his tabernacle, and his saints; see Daniel 11:36; or
            against men, dominions, and dignities, 2 Peter 2:10; or it may
            design their self-applauses and vain glorying in themselves, and
            their empty boast of knowledge and learning; and also express the
            windiness of their doctrines, and the bombast style, and high flown
            strains of rhetoric in which they were delivered; as likewise the
            flattering titles they bestowed on men for the sake of their own
            worldly interest and advantage; see Judges 1:16.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>They entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness</em>.
            That is, from those who lived in the error of Heathenism or Judaism,
            from whom, and which, they were clean escaped; or truly, really, and
            entirely delivered, being fully convinced of the falsity thereof,
            and of the truth of the Christian religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error</em>.
            But be they more or less, and truly, or but a little, and for a
            little while, or almost, escaped from their former errors, in which
            they were brought up, and lived; yet by the carnal lusts and
            liberties, lasciviousness and wantonness, which these false teachers
            indulged, they were allured, ensnared, and drawn by them into their
            wicked principles and practices.
          </p>

              corruption; for a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes
              him.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Promising them liberty</em>. Not Christian liberty, which lies
            in a freedom from sin, its dominion, guilt, and condemnation, and in
            serving God with liberty, cheerfulness, and without fear; but a
            sinful carnal liberty, a liberty from the law of God, from obedience
            to it as a rule of walk and conversation, and from the laws of men,
            from subjection to the civil magistrate, and from servitude to
            masters, and obedience to parents; a liberty to lay aside and
            neglect the ordinances of the Gospel at pleasure, and to live in all
            manner of sin and wickedness; a liberty which is contrary to the
            nature, will, and work of Christ, to his Spirit, and to the
            principle of grace in the heart, and to the Gospel, and to the
            conduct and conversation of real saints. Now this was the snare by
            which the false teachers beguiled unstable souls; liberty being what
            is greatly desirable to men, and is suited to their carnal lusts and
            interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>While they themselves are bondservants of corruption</em>. Of
            sin, which has corrupted all mankind in soul and body; and
            particularly the lust of uncleanness, which these men walked in, and
            by which they not only corrupted themselves, but the good manners of
            others also; and which tended and led them both to ruin and
            destruction, signified by the pit of corruption: and yet these very
            preachers, that promised liberty to others, were the servants of
            sin; they were under the power and government of sin. They were not
            only born so, and were homeborn slaves to sin, but they sold
            themselves to work wickedness; voluntarily and with delight, they
            served divers lusts and pleasures, and were slaves and drudges
            thereunto; as likewise to Satan, whose lusts they would do, and by
            whom they were led captive; so that their condition was mean, base,
            and deplorable, and therefore could never make good their promise,
            or give that which they had not themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For a man is brought into bondage by whoever overcomes him</em>.
            As this is a certain point in war, that when one man is conquered by
            another, he is no longer a free man, but the other's prisoner and
            captive, and is in a state of servitude and bondage; so it is when a
            man is overcome by sin, which must be understood not of a partial
            victory or conquest, for a good man may be surprised by sin, and
            overtaken in a fault, and be overcome and carried captive by it for
            a time, as was the apostle, see Romans 7:23; and yet not be a
            servant of corruption, or properly in a state of bondage to it; but
            this is to be understood of a total and complete victory, when a man
            is wholly under the dominion of sin, it reigns in his mortal body,
            and he obeys it in the lusts of it, and yields his members
            instruments of unrighteousness; such a man is neither a free man
            himself, nor can he much less promise and give liberty to others.

            <em>For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world</em

            world are addicted to, and immersed in; for the whole world lies in
            wickedness, and which are of a defiling nature: the phrase is
            Rabbinical; it is said,"he that studies not in the law in this
            world, but is defiled בטנופי עלמא, "with the pollutions of the
            world", what is written of him? and they took him, and cast him
            without:" these, men may escape, abstain from, and outwardly reform,
            with respect unto, and yet be destitute of the grace of God; so that
            this can be no instance of the final and total apostasy of real
            saints; for the house may be swept and garnished with an external
            reformation; persons may be outwardly righteous before men, have a
            form of godliness and a name to live, and yet be dead in trespasses
            and sins.

          <p>
            <em>Through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</em>.
            The Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, read, our Lord,
            and the latter leave out, "and Saviour"; by which "knowledge" is
            meant, not a spiritual experimental knowledge of Christ, for that is
            eternal life, the beginning, pledge, and earnest of it; but a
            notional knowledge of Christ, or a profession of knowledge of him,
            for it may be rendered "acknowledgment"; or rather the Gospel of
            Christ, which, being only notionally received, may have such an
            effect on men, as outwardly to reform their lives, at least in some
            instances, and for a while, in whose hearts it has no place.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>They are again entangled in it</em>. In the pollutions of the
            world, in worldly lusts, which are as gins, pits and snares.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And overcome</em>. By them, so as to be laden with them, and led
            away, and entirely governed and influenced by them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The last state has become worse for them than the first</em>.
            Their beginning, or first estate, was that in which they were born,
            a state of darkness, ignorance, and sin, and in which they were
            brought up, and was either the state of Judaism, or of Gentilism;
            their next estate was an outward deliverance and escape from the
            error of the one, or of the other, and an embracing and professing
            the truth of the Christian religion, joined with a becoming external
            conversation; and this their last estate was an apostasy from the
            truth of the Gospel they had professed, a reception of error and
            heresy, and a relapse into sin and immorality, which made their case
            worse than it was at first; for, generally, such persons are more
            extravagant in sinning; are like raging waves of the sea, foaming
            out their own shame; and are seldom, or ever, recovered; and by
            their light, knowledge, and profession, their punishment will be
            more aggravated, and become intolerable.

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Not to have known the way of righteousness</em>. The same with
            "the way of truth", 2 Peter 2:2, and "the right way", 2 Peter 2:15,
            the Gospel, which points out the way and method of a sinner's
            justification before God, which is not by the works of the law, but
            by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them, and received by
            faith; and which teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and
            godly; and a large, notional, though not an experimental knowledge,
            these apostates had of the word and doctrine of righteousness, and
            indeed of the whole of the Christian religion, which may truly go by
            this name.

            <em>From the holy commandment delivered to them</em>. By the

            because of its nature and influence, and in opposition to the
            pollutions of the world; and which is the faith once delivered,
            Judges 1:3, and which they received, as delivered to them; and,
            particularly, the ordinances of it, which they once submitted to,
            kept, and observed, as they were delivered to them, but now
            relinquished, or corrupted: wherefore, it would have been better for
            them to have been in their former ignorance, either in Judaism, or
            in Gentilism, since proportionate to a man's light is his guilt, and
            so his punishment, see Romans 2:12.

            and dirt, and is washed from its filthiness, naturally returns to it
            again: so such apostates return to what they were before, to their
            former principles and practices.
