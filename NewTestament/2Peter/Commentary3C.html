              heed it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>We have the more sure word of prophecy</em>. Though this word of
            prophecy is generally understood of the writings and prophecies of
            the Old Testament concerning Christ, yet different ways are taken to
            fix the comparison: some think the sense is, that they are more sure
            than the cunningly devised fables, 2 Peter 1:16 but as these have no
            certainty nor authority in them, but are entirely to be rejected,
            the apostle would never put the sacred writings in comparison with
            them: and it is most clear, that the comparison lies between this
            word of prophecy, and the testimony of the apostles, who were eye
            and ear witnesses of the majesty and glory of Christ; but how
            prophecy should be a surer evidence of Christ, and the Gospel, than
            such a testimony, is difficult to understand; and is a sense which
            all agree to reject, by different methods: some think that a
            comparative is used for a positive, and that the meaning is, that
            besides the testimony of the apostles, prophecy is a very sure
            evidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is countenanced by the Syriac version, which renders it, "and
            we have also a firm", or "true word of prophecy"; to which the
            Arabic agrees, "and we have a word of prophecy very true": others
            choose to retain the comparison, and which indeed ought not to be
            thrown out; but these are divided about it; some are of opinion that
            it is to be understood of the Jews to whom the apostle writes, and
            he himself was one, and the sense to be this; not that prophecy in
            itself was surer than an apostolical testimony, but that it was
            surer to the Jews, and more valid with them, who had been trained up
            in, and long used to the prophetic writings; and who had a greater
            esteem for the prophets of the Old Testament than for the apostles
            of the New; but it is scarcely credible that the apostle, who had
            been an eye and ear witness in the holy mount, would put himself in
            among them, and say, "we have", c. for whatever prophecy was to
            them, it could not be surer to him than what he had seen with his
            eyes, and heard with his ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Others suppose that the meaning is, that prophecy was "now" surer to
            the Christians than it was "before", it being confirmed and
            established by facts and events, and also by miracles, and even by
            the attestation of this voice heard on the mount, and by the majesty
            of Christ seen there but if this had been the sense of the apostle,
            he would have used these words, "now" and "before"; and besides,
            this puts the comparison quite out of its place, which manifestly
            stands between former prophecy, and the present testimony of the
            apostles: but the truth of the matter is, that this word of prophecy
            is not to be understood of the prophetic writings of the Old
            Testament; for though these are the word of God, and do testify of
            Christ, and are to be taken heed, and attended to, as proofs and
            evidence of Gospel truths, and are a light to direct and guide in
            matters both of faith and practice, yet they are not the only light,
            and are far from being the clearest, and what are only to be
            attended to;
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Gospel that came by Christ, and is preached by his apostles,
            and is contained in the writings of the New Testament, is a much
            clearer light, and at least equally to be attended to: nor are the
            prophecies of the Old Testament, which particularly relate to
            Christ, designed; there are many of this kind, which, put together,
            may very well be called the word of prophecy, and which were to the
            Jews a light in a dark place, until Christ came in the flesh; and
            though they are to be attended to, and compared with facts, to show
            the truth of the divine revelation, yet they are not a surer
            evidence, nor so sure an evidence, as the evangelical testimony is,
            which is of facts, and these supported by miracles; for now the
            dayspring from on high hath visited us, and Christ, the bright and
            morning star, has appeared: but the word of prophecy, concerning
            Christ's second coming, is here intended, whether it lies in the
            words of the prophets of the Old Testament, as in Psalms 96:13 or in
            the words of Christ, Matthew 16:27, which latter is most likely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ethiopic version understands this of some particular prophecy,
            and as if the words were a citation of some prophet, rendering the
            words thus, "and we have a voice more ancient than this of a
            prophet, saying, ye do well who take heed", c. Sir Isaac Newton is
            of opinion, that the apostle refers to the book of the Revelation of
            St. John, which would not be unlikely, could it be proved that it
            was then written. Now this prophecy or prediction, concerning
            Christ's coming again with power and great glory, was a surer
            evidence of it than what the apostles saw with their eyes, and heard
            with their ears upon the mount nothing was surer to them, nor could
            anything make it surer to them, that he was honoured and glorified,
            than what they saw and heard: but then this did not so certainly
            prove that he would hereafter be glorified, or come again in glory.
            What they saw and heard was a presumptive proof that it "might" be
            so, and was a confirming pledge and evidence to them that so it
            "would" be, and was a glorious representation of it; but Christ's
            prophecy or prediction, that so it "should" be, more strongly
            ascertained it, since he said it, to whom all things were known from
            the beginning, and whose counsel shall stand, and not one word of
            his shall ever fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >And you do well that you heed it as to a lamp shining in a dark
              place</em
            >. The prophecy concerning Christ's second coming is as "as a
            light"; it is a revelation of that which was in the dark, lay hid as
            a secret and mystery in the heart of God; and which could not be
            known by men, had it not been foretold by God; and it is made as
            prophecy in all other cases is, by throwing light, as to this
            affair, into the mind of him, or them, to whom it is revealed; and
            is a light to them to whom it is delivered, and which they should
            attend unto, as to a lamp or torch to guide and direct them; though
            in some sense it is but a feeble one, and is as a light "that
            shineth in a dark place"; meaning not the world, which is a place of
            darkness, ignorance, and error; nor merely the state of the saints
            in general in this life, who, at most and best, see but through a
            glass darkly; but has a particular respect to the darkness which
            attends the saints, concerning the second coming of Christ, and
            which will especially attend them a little before that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prophecy holds out clearly that Christ will come again; that he will
            come in great glory, in his Father's, and in his own, and in the
            glory of his angels, and with great power, to raise the dead, and
            judge mankind; and though it gives hints, that, upon this, the
            saints shall be with Christ in the air, on earth, and in heaven; and
            that there will be new heavens, and a new earth; and that the saints
            shall reign here with Christ a thousand years, after which the Gog
            and Magog army will attack them without success; yet these are not
            so clear, as for saints to be agreed in the sense of them; and much
            more are they in the dark about the time of his coming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now prophecy is the surest evidence and best light the saints have
            concerning this matter, "until the day dawn"; not the Gospel day, so
            much spoken of by the prophets, that had dawned already; rather a
            more clear knowledge of Christ, and Gospel truths, which will be in
            the spiritual kingdom and reign of Christ hereafter; or else the
            latter day glory, at the personal coming of Christ, when the light
            of the moon shall be as that of the sun, and that of the sun shall
            be sevenfold as the light of seven days; yea, when there will be no
            need of sun or moon, but Christ shall be come, and be the light of
            his people; see Isaiah 30:26 after which will follow the everlasting
            day of glory, when all darkness will be gone, and saints shall see
            face to face, and know as they are known.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your
              hearts</em
            >. Or "the sun", as the Syriac version renders it; not Christ, the
            morning star, the dayspring from on high, and the sun of
            righteousness, who was already risen upon them; nor the grace of God
            implanted in their hearts, by which they were already called out of
            darkness, and made light in the Lord; but as the day star is the
            bringer of light, as the word used signifies, or the forerunner of
            the day, so it here intends the immediate signs and forerunners of
            the coming of Christ; which when observed in their hearts, and by
            their understandings, as being come to pass, they may lift up their
            heads with joy, because their redemption draws near, Luke 21:28 and
            so the Ethiopic here renders it, "and redemption, arise for you in
            your hearts". Now till this time the sure word of prophecy
            concerning Christ's second coming is to be "taken heed unto", as a
            lamp, light, and torch, to direct us to it, to encourage us to love
            it, long for it, and hasten to it: and in so doing we shall "do
            well"; it will be well for the glory of God and Christ, this being
            setting our seals to them as true; and well for ourselves to keep up
            our faith, hope, and expectation of it, unmoved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private
              interpretation</em
            >. Especially, and in the first place, this is to be known,
            observed, and considered. Not that this is levelled against the
            right of private judgment of Scripture; or to be understood as if a
            private believer had not a right of reading, searching, examining,
            and judging, and interpreting the Scriptures himself, by virtue of
            the unction which teacheth all things; and who, as a spiritual man,
            judgeth all things; otherwise, why are such commended as doing well,
            by taking heed to prophecy, in the preceding verse, and this given
            as a reason to encourage them to it? the words may be rendered, "of
            one's own interpretation"; that is, such as a natural man forms of
            himself, by the mere force of natural parts and wisdom, without the
            assistance of the Spirit of God; and which is done without comparing
            spiritual things with spiritual; and which is not agreeably to the
            Scripture, to the analogy of faith, and mind of Christ; though
            rather this phrase should be rendered, "no prophecy of the Scripture
            is of a man's own impulse", invention, or composition; is not human,
            but purely divine: and this sense carries in it a reason why the
            sure word of prophecy, concerning the second coming of Christ,
            should be taken heed to, and made use of as a light, till he does
            come; because as no Scripture prophecy, so not that, is a
            contrivance of man's, his own project and device, and what his own
            spirit prompts and impels him to, but what is made by the dictates
            and impulse of the Spirit of God; for whatever may be said of human
            predictions, or the false prophecies of lying men, who deliver them
            out how and when they please, nothing of this kind can be said of
            any Scripture prophecy, nor of this concerning the second coming of
            Christ; and this sense the following words require.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 21.
            <em
              >For no prophecy ever came by the will of man, but holy men of God
              spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For no prophecy ever came by the will of man</em>. The whole
            Scripture, all the prophetic writings; so the Jews call the
            Scriptures הנבואה, "the prophecy" g, by way of eminence, and from
            the subject matter of the sacred word. Was not brought into the
            world at first, or in any period of time, as and when man would,
            according to his pleasure, and as he thought fit: neither Moses, nor
            David, nor Isaiah, nor Jeremiah, nor Ezekiel, nor Daniel, nor any
            other of the prophets, prophesied when they pleased, but when it was
            the will of God they should; they were stirred up to prophesy, not
            by any human impulse, but by a divine influence: with this agrees
            what R. Sangari says, "that the speech of the prophets, when the
            Holy Spirit clothed them, in all their words was directed by a
            divine influence, and the prophet could not speak in the choice of
            his own words,'' or according to his will.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But holy men of God</em>. Such as he sanctified by his Spirit,
            and separated from the rest of men to such peculiar service; and
            whom he employed as public ministers of his word: for so this phrase
            "men", or "man of God", often signifies, 1 Samuel 2:27.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit</em>. Who illuminated
            their minds, gave them a knowledge of divine things, and a foresight
            of future ones; dictated to them what they should say or write; and
            moved upon them strongly, and by a secret and powerful impulse
            stirred them up to deliver what they did, in the name and fear of
            God: which shows the authority of the Scriptures, that they are the
            word of God, and not of men; and as such should be attended to, and
            received with all affection and reverence; and that the Spirit is
            the best interpreter of them, who first dictated them; and that they
            are to be the rule of our faith and practice; nor are we to expect
            any other, until the second coming of Christ.
