        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h2>
        <p>
          Peter warns that danger was approaching from false teachers, who would
          spread impious inventions, as well as from the despisers of God, who
          would mock all religion; and he did this, lest they expect that the
          course of truth in the kingdom Of Christ would be tranquil and
          peaceable, and free from all contention. He afterwards, as on a
          tablet, describes the character and manners of those who would, by
          their corruptions, pollute Christianity. But the description which he
          presents, especially suits the present age, as it will be more evident
          by a comparison. For he especially draws his pen against Lucianic men,
          who abandon themselves to every wickedness, and take a profane license
          to show contempt to God, and treat with ridicule the hope of a better
          life; and at this day we see that the world is everywhere full of such
          rabble.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          The design is to show, that those who have once professed the true
          faith of Christ, ought to respond to their calling to the last. After
          having then extolled, in high terms, the grace of God, he recommends
          to them holiness of life, because God usually punishes in hypocrites a
          false profession of his name, with dreadful blindness, and on the
          other hand he increases his gifts to those who truly and from the
          heart embrace the doctrine of religion. He, therefore, exhorts them to
          prove their calling by a holy life. And, to give a greater weight to
          his admonitions, he says that he is already near his end, and at the
          same time, excuses himself that he so often repeated the same things,
          his object being that they who should remain alive on the earth after
          his death, might have what he, when alive, wrote, more deeply fixed in
          their minds.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Themes</h2>
        <p>
          Historicity of the Gospel: As the foundation of true religion is the
          certainty and truth of the gospel, he shows, first, how indubitable is
          its truth by this fact, that he himself had been an eyewitness of all
          things which it contains, and especially that he had heard Christ
          proclaimed from heaven to be the Son of God; and, in the second place,
          it was God's will that it should be borne witness to, and approved by
          the oracles of the prophets.
        </p>

          <a
            href="../../../SystematicTheology/Prolegomena/Scripture/Scripture.html"
            >Inspiration</a
          >: The infallibility and divine authority of the Scriptures are due to
          the fact that they are the word of God; and they are the word of God
          because they were given by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost: "For no
          prophecy ever came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke,
          being moved by the Holy Spirit" (2 Pet 1:21). It is God speaking to
          man, God speaking by man, God speaking as man, God speaking for man!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second coming: He exhorts the faithful, not only to look always for
          the coming of Christ with suspended and expectant minds, but also to
          regard that day as present before their eyes, and in the meantime to
          keep themselves unpolluted for the Lord: in which doctrine he makes
          Paul as his associate and approver; and to defend his writings from
          the calumnies of the ungodly, he severely reproves all those who
          pervert them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="../../../SystematicTheology/Ethics/Repentance/Repentance.html"
            >Repentance</a
          >: The covenant of works allowed no repentance; there it was: sin and
          die. Repentance came in by the gospel. Christ has purchased us with
          his blood so that repenting sinners shall be saved. The law required
          personal, perfect, and perpetual obedience. It cursed all who could
          not come up to this: “Cursed is everyone that does not continue to do
          all things which are written in the book of the law” (Gal 3:10). It
          does not say, “He that does not obey all things, let him repent;”
          instead, it says “let him be cursed.” Thus repentance is a doctrine
          that has been brought to light only by the gospel.
