            Ver 12.
            <em
              >Therefore I will not be negligent to remind you of these things,
              though you know them and are established in the present truth.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Therefore I will not be negligent</em>. The apostle having made
            use of proper arguments to excite the saints he writes to regard the
            exhortation he had given, to the diligent exercise of grace, and
            discharge of duty, proceeds to give the reasons of his own conduct,
            why he gave such an exhortation to them, and pressed it, and
            continued to do so, and determined for the future to go on with it,
            as particularly the usefulness and profitableness of it; and
            therefore, seeing it would be attended with so many advantages
            before mentioned, he was resolved that he would not be careless, nor
            omit any opportunity that should offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To remind you of these things</em>. Of the exercise of the above
            graces, and the performance of the above duties, which saints are
            too apt to forget, and therefore should be reminded of; and it is
            the duty and business of the ministers of the word frequently to
            inculcate those things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Though you know them and are established in the present truth</em
            >. For those that know the most, know but in part; and may have
            their knowledge increased; and those that are the most established
            in the truths of the Gospel, may be confirmed yet more and more.
            This the apostle mentions as an apology for himself, and to prevent
            an objection that might be made, as if he had suggested that they
            were ignorant and unstable; or which might insinuate that there was
            no necessity of such frequent putting in remembrance; since they
            were both knowing and stable: by "the present truth" may be meant,
            either the whole scheme of the Gospel, which was now come by Christ,
            in opposition to the exhibition of it under the former dispensation,
            by promise and type; and it being so called, shows that it is always
            now, and new; that there will be no alteration in it, nor addition
            to it, it being like the author of it, the same yesterday, today,
            and for ever, and will not give place to another scheme of things;
            or else the particular truth of the coming of Christ, either to take
            vengeance on the Jewish nation, or to judge the world in
            righteousness, and introduce his own people into the new heavens,
            and new earth, 2 Peter 3:1.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 13-14.
            <em
              >I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by
              reminding you, knowing that the putting off of my tent comes
              swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>I think it right</em>. Or "just". This is the apostle's other
            reason for his conduct, taken from the duty of his place and office;
            judging it to be what became him as an apostle and elder, and the
            minister of the circumcision, and was what was due to God and
            Christ, whom he served, and the souls of men under his care.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>As long as I am in this tent</em>. For the body is as a
            tabernacle for the soul to dwell in, pitched for a time, and, ere
            long, to be taken down.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To stir you up by reminding you</em>. To the lively exercise of
            grace, and constant performance of duty: by putting you in
            remembrance: of the said things; for saints are apt to be forgetful
            of their duty, and backward to it, and sluggish and slothful in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Knowing that the putting off of my tent comes swiftly</em>.
            Which is another reason why the apostle was so pressing in this
            case, and so much urged the exhortation, and was so diligent in
            reminding the saints of it, and stirring them to observe it, because
            he knew he had but a little time to live, and which therefore he was
            willing to improve for their good. He sets forth his death in a very
            easy and familiar way, it being not at all terrible and distressing
            to him; it was but like the putting off of a garment, or unpinning
            of a tabernacle, or a removing from a tent to a palace. Saints are
            pilgrims here, they dwell in tents or tabernacles, at death they
            remove to their own country, and Father's house. Death is not a
            destruction of man, an annihilation of him, neither of his soul nor
            body: the soul is not mortal, it dies not with the body; it only
            removes from this world to another, from a cottage to a kingdom; and
            the body though it dies, it is not reduced to nothing, it is only
            like a tabernacle put off, or taken down, which will be put together
            again in better order than now it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me</em>. By some
            special revelation lately made to him; or by some strong impulse
            upon his mind; just as the Apostle Paul knew that the time of his
            departure was at hand, 2 Timothy 4:7 or this may have respect to the
            words of Christ to Peter, above thirty years before, in John 21:18,
            which both signified what kind of death he should die, and when it
            should be; namely, when he was old, as now he was.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 15.
            <em
              >Yes, I will make every effort that you may always be able to
              remember these things even after my departure.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Yes, I will make every effort</em>. He signifies, that he should
            not only use all diligence to stir them up to, and put them in
            remembrance of the necessary duties of their calling while he was
            alive, but should make it his study to concert some measures, and
            take some steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That you may always be able to remember these things</em>. Or
            Exodus, meaning his going out of this world by death, in allusion to
            the Israelites going out of Egypt, and marching for Canaan's land;
            this world being, like Egypt, a place of wickedness, misery, and
            bondage; as heaven, like Canaan, a place and state of rest and
            happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Even after my departure</em>. By which they might be always put
            in mind of them, or by recurring to which they might have their
            memories refreshed; and what he means is, to leave these
            exhortations and admonitions in writing, which they might read, and
            be of use to them when he was dead and gone; and indeed by this, and
            his former epistle, though being dead, he yet speaketh.
