          <p>
            <em>For we didn’t follow cunningly devised fables</em>. Such as
            Jewish fables, cautioned against Titus 1:14 which their traditionary
            and oral law, their Talmud, and other writings, mention; as
            concerning the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, the sumptuous feast,
            and carnal pleasures and entertainments, of that state, with many
            other things; some of which indeed are not very cunningly put
            together, but weak enough: or Gentile fables concerning the theogony
            and exploits of their deities; and which may be meant by fables and
            endless genealogies in 1 Timothy 1:4, and especially reference may
            be had to the metamorphoses of their gods, and their fables relating
            to them, devised by Ovid, and others, since the apostle is about to
            speak of the metamorphosis, or transfiguration of Christ; and also
            other fables with which their poets and histories abound; and
            likewise the prophecies of the Sibyls, and the oracles at Delphos,
            and elsewhere: or the fabulous accounts of the followers of Simon
            Magus concerning God, angels, the creation of the world, and the
            several Aeones; or the more artful composures of the false teachers,
            set off with all the cunning, sophistry, wit, and eloquence they
            were masters of. Now in order to set forth the nature, excellency,
            and certainty of the doctrine the apostle taught, especially that
            part of it which respected the coming of Christ; and to show that it
            was worth his while to put them in mind of it, and theirs to
            remember it; he observes, that he and his fellow apostles did not
            proceed in their account of it on such a foundation, but upon an
            evidence which they had received, both with their eyes and ears, and
            also on a word of prophecy surer than that.

              >When we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
              Christ</em
            >. Not his first coming, though that, and the benefits arising from
            it, were the subject of their ministry; and that was attended with
            divine power, which appeared in the incarnation of Christ itself,
            which was owing to the power of the Highest; and was seen in his
            doctrine and ministry, which were with great authority; and in the
            miracles which he wrought, which proved him to have power equal with
            God, his Father; and in the work of redemption, which he came about
            and finished; in doing which he made an end of sin, and saved his
            people from it, redeemed them from the curse of the law, overcame
            the world, destroyed Satan, and abolished death; and especially in
            his resurrection from the dead, when he was declared to be the Son
            of God with power: but notwithstanding his first coming was in great
            humility, in much meanness and imbecility, he grew up as a tender
            plant, and was encompassed with infirmities, and at last was
            crucified through weakness. This therefore was to be understood of
            an after coming of his, which the apostle had wrote of, and made
            known in his former epistle, 1 Peter 1:7 and which he puts them in
            mind of in this, 2 Peter 3:1, nor is the word παρουσια, used of any
            other coming of Christ, and this will be with power; and it designs
            his more near coming to take vengeance on the Jewish nation, and
            deliver his people from the afflictions and persecution they
            laboured under, and which was with great power; see Matthew 14:3, or
            more remote, namely, at the last day, when there will be a great
            display of power in raising the dead, gathering all nations before
            him, separating them one from another, passing the final sentence on
            each, and executing the same in the utter destruction of the wicked,
            and the complete glorification of the saints.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But we were eyewitnesses of his majesty</em>. Meaning, not of
            the glory of his divine nature by faith, and with the eyes of their
            understanding, while others only considered him as a mere man; nor
            of the miracles he wrought, in which there was a display of his
            glory and majesty, of all which the apostles were eyewitnesses; but
            of that glory and greatness which were upon him, when he was
            transfigured on the mount before them; then his face was as the sun,
            and such a glory on his whole body, that it darted through his
            clothes, and made them glitter like light, and as white as snow, and
            so as no fuller on earth could whiten them; at which time also Moses
            and Elijah appeared in glorious forms: and now this was a prelude
            and pledge of his power and coming, of his kingdom coming with
            power, and of his coming in his own, and his Father's glory, and in
            the glory of the holy angels. This was a proof that notwithstanding
            his meanness in his incarnate state, yet he was glorified, and would
            be glorified again; and this was a confirmation of it to the
            apostles, and might be to others: see Matthew 16:27.

          <p>
            <em>For he received from God the Father honor and glory</em>. Not as
            an inferior from a superior, for he was equal in glory with the
            Father, and was, and is, the brightness of his Father's glory; nor
            essentially, having the same glory as his Father, and to which
            nothing can be added; but declaratively, God the Father testifying
            of his glory, declaring the honour that belonged to him, as the Son
            of God, at the same time that an external glory was put on him, and
            received by him, as the son of man.

            From the bright cloud which overshadowed Jesus, Moses, and Elijah
            and was a symbol of the glory and presence of God, as the cloud in

            habitation of the holiness and glory of God, and where he displays
            the glory of his being and perfections; or from himself, who is the
            God and Father of glory, and is glorious in himself, in all his
            attributes and works.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>We heard this voice come out of heaven</em>. Peter, who wrote
            this epistle, and James and John, the favourite disciples of Christ;
            and who were a sufficient number to bear witness of what they then
            saw and heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When we were with him</em>. And saw his glory, and the glory of
            Moses and Elias, and were so delighted with his company, and theirs,
            and with communion with him, that Peter, in the name of the rest,
            desired to stay there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>On the holy mountain</em>. The Ethiopic version reads, "in the
            mountain of his sanctuary"; and so Grotius understands it of Mount
            Moriah, on which the temple was built, called the holy hill, and the
            holy hill of Zion; and supposes that this voice was heard in the
            temple, and that it refers to John 12:28, but without any
            foundation; for the mount on which Christ was transfigured is here
            meant; and which was either, as is generally said, Tabor, a mountain
            in Galilee; or it may be Lebanon, which was near Caesarea Philippi,
            in the parts of which Christ then was: and it is called "holy", from
            his presence or transfiguration on it, who is the Holy One; just as
            the land on which Moses was, and the city and temple of Jerusalem,
            and Mount Sion, and Sinai, are called "holy", from the presence of
            the holy God there, Exodus 3:5. Now such a declaration of the honour
            and glory of Christ, as the Son of God, being made by God the
            Father, in a voice from heaven, which the apostles heard with their
            ears, at the same time that they saw with their eyes his human body
            glorified in an amazing manner, was to them a confirming evidence
            that he would come again in power and glory; and upon this evidence
            they declared, and made known to the saints, the power and coming of
            Christ; though not on this evidence only, but also upon the more
            sure word of prophecy, which entirely agrees with it.
