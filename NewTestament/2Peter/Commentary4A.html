          <p>
            <em>But false prophets also arose among the people</em>. As well as
            holy men of God, who gave out prophecies, by the inspiration and
            impulse of the Holy Spirit; that is, among the people of the Jews,
            God's professing people, whose God was the Lord, and who had chosen
            them to be a special and peculiar people, above all people of the
            earth; and had distinguished them by his favours from all others:
            among these, though the Syriac version reads "in the world", there
            were false prophets, who ran, and were not sent; and who prophesied,
            and the Lord spake not to them: of these there were many in
            Jeremiah's time, and in the times of Ezekiel; and in Ahab's time,
            besides the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, slain by
            Elijah, there were four hundred that called themselves the prophets
            of the Lord; among whom went forth a lying spirit, encouraging Ahab
            to go up to Ramoth Gilead, promising him prosperity and success;
            Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah, with whom Micaiah, the true prophet,
            had much contention, was at the head of them; and such there were
            among that people in all ages, until the times of Christ, and in his
            likewise; see Matthew 7:15 now from these, by an easy transition,
            the apostle proceeds to another part of his design in this epistle,
            to describe the characters of false teachers under the present
            dispensation, that saints may beware, and avoid their pernicious
            principles and practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>As false teachers will also be among you</em>. Which need not to
            be wondered at, or stumble any, it being no new or strange thing,
            but what was always more or less the case of the people of God. This
            is a prophecy of what should be, and agrees with the prediction of
            our Lord, Matthew 24:11 and which regards not only the times
            immediately following, in which it had a remarkable fulfilment, for
            false teachers now began to arise, and appeared in great numbers in
            the age succeeding the apostles, but to all periods of time from
            hence, to the second coming of Christ; and these were to spring
            from, and be among such that bore the Christian name, and so regards
            not Mahometans and Deists; and it is to be observed, that the phrase
            is varied in this clause, and these are called not "prophets" but
            "teachers": because as prophecy was more peculiar to the former
            dispensation, so is teaching to the present.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who will secretly bring in destructive heresies</em>. Errors in
            the fundamental doctrines of the Gospel; such as relate to a trinity
            of persons in the Godhead; and to the person of Christ, to his
            proper deity, distinct personality, eternal sonship, and real
            humanity; and to his office as Mediator, rejecting him as the true
            Messiah, and as the only Saviour of sinners; denying his sacrifice
            and satisfaction, and the imputation of his righteousness; and to
            the Holy Spirit, his deity, personality, and divine influences and
            operations: these are "damnable", or "destructive", or "heresies of
            destruction"; which lead to eternal destruction both those that
            introduce and propagate them, and those that embrace and profess
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            For they remove, or attempt to remove, the foundation of eternal
            life and happiness: the manner in which these are usually introduced
            is "privily"; at unawares, secretly, under a disguise, and
            gradually, by little and little, and not at once, and openly; and
            which is the constant character and practice of such men, who lie in
            wait to deceive, creep into churches at unawares, and into houses
            privately; and insinuate their principles under specious pretences
            and appearances of truth, using the hidden things of dishonesty,
            walking in craftiness, handling the word of God deceitfully, and
            colouring things with false glosses and feigned words: and even
            denying the Lord that bought them; not the Lord Jesus Christ, but
            God the Father; for the word κυριος is not here used, which always
            is where Christ is spoken of as the Lord, but δεσποτης; and which is
            expressive of the power which masters have over their servants i,
            and which God has over all mankind; and wherever this word is
            elsewhere used, it is spoken of God the Father, whenever applied to
            a divine person, as in Luke 2:29 and especially this appears to be
            the sense, from the parallel text in Judges 1:4 where the Lord God
            denied by those men is manifestly distinguished from our Lord Jesus
            Christ, and by whom these persons are said to be bought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meaning is not that they were redeemed by the blood of Christ,
            for Christ is not intended; and besides, whenever redemption by
            Christ is spoken of, the price is usually mentioned, or some
            circumstance or another which fully determines the sense; see Acts
            20:28 whereas here is not the least hint of anything of this kind:
            add to this, that such who are redeemed by Christ are the elect of
            God only, the people of Christ, his sheep and friends, and church,
            and who are never left to deny him so as to perish eternally; for
            could such be lost, or deceive, or be deceived finally and totally
            by damnable heresies, and bring on themselves swift destruction,
            Christ's purchase would be in vain, and the ransom price be paid for
            nought; but the word "bought" regards temporal mercies and
            deliverance, which these men enjoyed, and is used as an aggravation
            of their sin in denying the Lord; both by words, delivering out such
            tenets as are derogatory to the glory of the divine perfections, and
            which deny one or other of them, and of his purposes, providence,
            promises, and truths; and by works, turning the doctrine of the
            grace of God into lasciviousness, being disobedient and reprobate to
            every good work.
          </p>
          <p>
            That they should act this part against the Lord who had made them,
            and upheld them in their beings and took care of them in his
            providence, and had followed them with goodness and mercy all the
            days of their lives; just as Moses aggravates the ingratitude of the
            Jews in Deuteronomy 32:6 from whence this phrase is borrowed, and to
            which it manifestly refers: "do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish
            people and unwise! is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? hath
            he not made thee, and established thee?" nor is this the only place
            the apostle refers to in this chapter, see 2 Peter 2:12 compared
            with Deuteronomy 32:5 and it is to be observed, that the persons he
            writes to were Jews, who were called the people the Lord had
            redeemed and purchased, Exodus 15:13 and so were the first false
            teachers that rose up among them; and therefore this phrase is very
            applicable to them.
          </p>
          <p><em>Denying even the Master who bought them</em>.</p>
          <p>
            <em>Bringing on themselves swift destruction</em>. Either in this
            life, being suddenly cut off in the midst of their days, and by the
            immediate hand of God, as Arius and other heretics have been; or
            eternal damnation in the other, which their tenets lead unto, and
            which will swiftly come upon them when they are promising themselves
            peace and safety.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Many will follow their immoral ways</em>. Their principles and
            their practices, which lead to destruction, The Complutensian
            edition, the Alexandrian copy, and six copies of Beza's, and others,
            read "their lasciviousnesses"; and so the Vulgate Latin version
            renders it, "their luxuries"; and all the Oriental versions seem to
            have read in like manner. The Syriac version renders it, "their
            impurity"; and the Arabic version, "their unchastities"; and the
            Ethiopic version, "their lust"; and which seems to have respect to
            the impure conversation of the followers of Simon Magus, the
            Nicolaitans, the Gnostics, Carpocratians, and others, who indulged
            themselves in all unnatural lusts and uncleanness; and generally,
            when men make shipwreck of faith, they also do of a good conscience,
            and become immoral in their conversations; and yet, as destructive
            as their principles, and as dishonourable and scandalous as their
            practices be, many were, and are their followers; so it was foretold
            by Christ, Matthew 24:11, and so it has been, Revelation 13:3. The
            road both of error and wickedness is a broad one, in which many
            walk; and a multitude is no proof of the truth of a church or of the
            principles of men, nor to be followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And as a result, the way of the truth will be maligned</em>.
            That is, either Christ, who is truth itself, and the true way to
            eternal life and happiness; or the Gospel, the word of truth, which
            holds forth Christ the truth, and points to him, and every other
            truth, and nothing but truth; or the Christian religion, which is
            the true way, in opposition to all sects and heresies; and is what
            should be blasphemed and spoken against, either by these men or
            their followers; for the phrase may be rendered, "by whom", as it is
            in the Vulgate Latin version, and the meaning be, that they should,
            in a blasphemous way, speak and write against Christ and his truths,
            reproach and revile them, and in a virulent manner oppose them, and
            trample them under foot: "or for the sake of them", as other
            versions read; and as we do; "by reason of them"; they should be the
            occasion, by their impure lives, of the name of Christ, and his
            doctrines, being blasphemed by profane and irreligious men; see
            Romans 2:24. The Alexandrian copy, and one of Stephens's, read "the
            glory of truth"; and so the Ethiopic version, "the glory of his
            truth".

            <em>In covetousness</em>. Which is generally a prevailing vice among
            false teachers, they having no other end in view than themselves;
            either to gain popular applause and vain glory, which they are
            always covetous of; or to amass riches to themselves, after which
            they have an insatiable desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>They will exploit you</em>. Deal with the souls of men, as
            merchants do with their goods, carry them to market and sell them;
            so false teachers deal with the souls of their followers, draw them,
            and sell them to Satan, and they themselves pay for it; see
            Zechariah 11:5 but in the issue, and that in a short time, they will
            be no gainers by such practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>With deceptive words</em>. Made words, words of their own
            devising, and not which the Holy Ghost teacheth; whereby they cover
            themselves, and privily introduce their pernicious principles; and
            therefore new words and phrases are always to be suspected and
            guarded against, especially in articles of moment and importance: or
            with flattering words and fair speeches, great swelling words of
            vanity, having men's persons in admiration, because of worldly
            advantage; and in this way they gain their point.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Whose sentence now from of old doesn’t linger</em>. That is,
            their condemnation, which God in righteousness has determined, "from
            the creation of the world", as the Ethiopic version reads, or from
            all eternity, see Judges 1:4, to bring them into, for their vile
            principles and practices, is not retarded and delayed; it does not
            linger and stay behind, or slacken its pace; it will not tarry, it
            will come upon them at the appointed time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And their destruction will not slumber</em>. An avenging God,
            who has appointed them to damnation for their sins, slumbers not;
            the justice of God is not asleep, nor careless and negligent, but is
            awake, and watches over them, to bring the evil upon them they have
            deserved, and is in reserve for them, and will hasten to perform it;
            the determined destruction does not lie dormant, but in a little
            time will be stirred up, and fall with dreadful weight on such
            sinners, as may be concluded from the following awful instances.
