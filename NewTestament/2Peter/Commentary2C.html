          <h2>
            Ver 8.
            <em
              >For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to not be
              idle or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For if these things are yours</em>. Are wrought in you by the
            Spirit of God, and exercised and performed by his assistance, who
            works in his people both to will and do.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And abound</em>. Increase in their acts and exercises by the
            frequent performance of them: they make you; both by way of
            influence and evidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>They make you to not be idle or unfruitful</em>. There is a
            knowledge of Christ which is barren and fruitless; and those that
            have it are so in their conversations, and it will be of no avail to
            them another day: and this is a mere notional and speculative
            knowledge, such as is not attended with any inward experience and
            application of Christ to themselves, or any fruits of righteousness
            in their lives, and is a bare theory of things relating to his
            person, offices, and works; but there is a knowledge of him that is
            spiritual and experimental, by which a soul not only approves of
            Christ, but places its trust and confidence in him, and appropriates
            him to himself, and practically observes his commands and ordinances
            in the faith of him; and in love to him he performs the above
            duties, and exercises the above graces; from whence it appears, that
            he is neither barren nor unfruitful himself in the profession of his
            knowledge of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ</em>. "Or in the
            acknowledgment of him", as it may be rendered; nor is that a vain,
            empty, and useless thing: he is not like the barren fig tree, or the
            earth that bears briers and thorns, and is nigh to cursing and
            burning, but like a tree planted by a river of water, and is green,
            flourishing, and fruitful. This is used as an argument to enforce
            the foregoing exhortation, to add to, that is, to exercise and
            perform the above graces and duties, in conjunction with each other.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 9.
            <em
              >For he who lacks these things is blind, seeing only what is near,
              having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For he who lacks these things</em>. Or in, and with whom, they
            are not; that is, these virtues, as the Arabic version reads, as
            faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly
            kindness, and charity; where the principles of those things are not,
            and they are not exercised and performed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Is blind</em>. Let him boast ever so much of his light and
            knowledge, and value himself upon it, and expect to be saved by it,
            let him live as he will; for he has no true knowledge of God, as in
            Christ, as the God of all grace, as his covenant God and Father; nor
            does he know what it is to have communion with him in Christ; he
            only professes to know him in words, while in works he denies him;
            nor has he any right knowledge of Christ, only notional and general,
            not spiritual, experimental, particular, and practical; he does not
            see the Son, so as truly to believe in him; he has no true sight of
            his beauty, suitableness, and fulness, and of him for himself; nor
            any experience of the work of the Spirit of God upon his heart, whom
            he neither receives, sees, nor knows spiritually, any more than the
            world itself does; nor does he see the plague of his own heart, the
            corruptions of his nature, and the exceeding sinfulness of sin; nor
            has he any true spiritual light into the Gospel, and the doctrines
            of it, only a form of godliness, without the power of it: and
            therefore, whatever natural understanding of things he has, he is
            spiritually blind.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Seeing only what is near</em>. At least, not the good land that
            is afar off, the kingdom of heaven; the invisible glories of the
            other world; things that are not seen, which are eternal, which one
            that has true faith has a glimpse and sight of; nor Christ, who is
            in heaven at the right hand of God, and the things of Christ, his
            blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, carried within the vail; nor
            even what is within himself, the sins of his heart, the pollution of
            his nature, and the evil that dwells there; he sees not that he is
            poor, and wretched, and miserable, but fancies himself to be rich,
            and in need of nothing; he sees nothing but outward things, the
            things of time and sense, worldly and earthly things, which are near
            him, and all around him, which he minds, on which his heart is set,
            and he pursues with rigour. The Vulgate Latin version renders it,
            "trying with the hand", as blind men do, feeling and groping to find
            the way; see Acts 17:27.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins</em>. Not by
            baptism, from the sins committed before it, for that does not purge
            from any sins, old or new, but that which it leads the faith of
            believers to, for pardon and cleansing, even the blood of Christ;
            but this also, and purification by it, is not meant here, though
            generally interpreters give this as the sense, and understanding it
            of the sin of ingratitude in such a person, who had received so
            great a benefit by Christ, and was unmindful of it; since it cannot
            be thought that one so described as above should ever have had his
            conscience purged by the blood of Christ from his old sins, or those
            before conversion, unless it be by profession; and then the sense
            is, that he has forgotten that he once professed to have been purged
            from all his sins by Christ; which, if he had, would have made him
            zealous of good works, and put him upon glorifying Christ both in
            body and spirit. The Ethiopic version renders it, "and he hath
            forgot to purge himself from old sins"; which he would have been
            concerned for, had he had a true and spiritual knowledge of Christ,
            and his Gospel, and an application of the exceeding great and
            precious promises of it, or had been made a partaker of the divine
            nature through them; see 2 Corinthians 7:1, but the words are better
            rendered agreeably to the original text, "and hath forgotten the
            purification of his old, or former sins"; or "sins of old"; as they
            are rendered by the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions; that
            is, he does not consider, nor think of it, that he was a sinner of
            old, a sinner in Adam, that he was conceived and shapen in sin, and
            went astray, and was called a transgressor from the womb; he does
            not think that he stands in any need of being purged from former
            sins; and is entirely unmindful of, and neglects, the purification
            of them by the blood of Christ.

            Ver 10.

              >Therefore, brothers, be more diligent to make your calling and
              election sure. For if you do these things, you will never

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Therefore, brothers, be more diligent</em>. To exercise the
            afore mentioned graces, and to perform the above duties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To make your calling and election sure</em>. By calling is not
            meant a call to any office in the church, nor an external call,
            either by the voice of nature, or by the ministry of the word; but
            an internal and effectual call by special grace, to grace here, and
            glory hereafter; instead of "calling", the Alexandrian copy reads,
            "comfort": and by "election" is meant, not a national, nor church
            election, but a particular and personal one, since scattered saints,
            and particular believers, are here written to, and each called upon
            to be diligent to make their own, and not another's, calling and
            election sure; nor is a choice of persons to an office designed,
            seeing the apostle writes not to officers of churches in particular,
            but to believers in common; nor a separation of persons from the
            world by the effectual calling, since these two are both mentioned
            here, and as distinct from each other, and to be made sure; but an
            election of particular persons to eternal life and salvation is here
            intended, which is an eternal act of God, arises from his free grace
            and favour, and is according to his sovereign will and pleasure; and
            is absolute, and independent of any condition, foreseen, or required
            in men, as faith, holiness, and good works; all which are fruits and
            effects, and not causes and conditions of electing grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            These may be made "sure", not in themselves, or with respect to God,
            for in this sense they cannot be made surer than they are: effectual
            calling is according to the purpose of God, which cannot be
            frustrated, and is, without repentance, irreversible, and
            irrevocable, and is inseparably connected with eternal glory; and
            election stands not upon the foot of works, but upon the free grace
            of God, which cannot be made void, and upon the will of God, which
            cannot be resisted; and is also closely connected with
            glorification; see Romans 8:30 nor are those to be made sure by
            saints, with respect to themselves; for though they may sometimes be
            at a loss about them, and may have some scruples and doubts in their
            minds concerning their interest in them, and an assurance of their
            being both called and chosen, may be after all attained unto by
            them; yet this is not their work, but it is the work of the Spirit
            of God, to certify and make sure unto them, or assure them of their
            calling and election of God: but the sense is, that diligence is to
            be used by the saints, to make their calling and election sure to
            others; not their election by their calling only, which is to
            themselves; for both are to be made sure, and that to others, and by
            some third thing; either to their fellow Christians, which they may
            do by giving them an account of the work of God upon their souls,
            joined with a testimony of their good lives and conversations; or
            rather to the world "by good works", as the Vulgate Latin version
            and two copies of Beza's read; or "by your good works", as the
            Alexandrian copy and the Syriac and Ethiopic versions read; or by
            the exercise of the graces, and the discharge of the duties before
            mentioned, whereby the men of the world may be certified and
            assured, by the best evidence the saints are capable of giving to
            them, or they of receiving, that they are the called and chosen of
            God, they profess themselves to be; and which is a reason why those
            things should be done.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For if you do these things, you will never stumble</em>. Or
            "sin", as the Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions render it; not that
            they should never fall at all, or in any sense, for in many things
            we all offend or fall; or should ever commit any act of sin, or fall
            into sin, for there is no man that lives, and sins not; or that they
            should not fall from a degree of the lively exercise of grace, or
            from a degree of steadfastness in the doctrine of faith, but that
            they should never sin the sin against the Holy Ghost, or fall
            totally and finally; for though they fall, they should rise again by
            faith and repentance, through the grace and power of Christ, who is
            able to keep them from falling: and besides, while they were
            exercising those graces, and doing those duties, they should not
            fall; for these are the means of final perseverance, and therefore
            the rather to be regarded. Another argument, strengthening the
            exhortation.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 11.
            <em
              >For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance into the

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>For thus you will be richly supplied with the entrance</em>. An
            abundant supply of grace and strength shall be freely afforded, to
            carry you through all the duties and trials of life; and when that
            shall be ended, an admission will be granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ</em
            >. Meaning, not the Gospel dispensation, or the spiritual kingdom of
            Christ, which is not of this world, but lies among his people, who
            are called out of it, in whom he reigns by his Spirit and, grace,
            according to laws of his own enacting; nor his personal kingdom on
            earth with his saints, which will last only a thousand years, and
            not be for ever; but the kingdom of heaven, or the ultimate glory,
            which will be everlasting; and is called a kingdom, to denote the
            glory and excellency of that state; and an everlasting one, because
            it will never end; and the kingdom of Christ, because it is in his
            possession, for his people; it is prepared by him, and he will
            introduce them into it, when they shall be for ever with him, and
            reign with him for ever and ever. Some copies read, "the heavenly
            kingdom".
          </p>
          <p>
            There is an entrance of separate souls into this kingdom at death;
            and which may be said to be ministered "abundantly" to them, or
            "richly" as the word signifies, when they depart out of this world
            with joy and comfort; triumphing over death, and the grave, in a
            full view by faith of their interest in the love of God, the grace
            of Christ, and the glories of another world; and there is an
            entrance into it at judgment, and which will be abundantly, when all
            the saints together, in their souls and bodies, shall be introduced
            by Christ into the full joy of their Lord. As the saints enter the
            kingdom through many tribulations, the gate is strait, and the way
            is narrow, and they are scarcely saved, and many of them so as only
            by fire; but when the abundant grace given unto them by the way to
            heaven, the great consolation many enjoy in their last moments, and
            especially the free and full admission of them, both at death and at
            judgment, to eternal happiness, are considered, the entrance
            ministered may be said to be abundantly; or, as the Arabic version
            renders it, "with a breadth"; the entrance is large and broad.
