          <p>
            <em>For if God didn’t spare angels when they sinned</em>. By whom
            are meant the devil and his angels; who are spirits created by God
            and as such were good; their first estate which they left was pure
            and holy, as well as high and honourable; they, were at first in the
            truth, though they abode not in it; they were once among the morning
            stars and sons of God, and were angels of light; their numbers are
            many, and therefore are here expressed in the plural number,
            "angels", though it cannot be said how large; a legion of them was
            in one man; one at first might be in the rebellion, and draw a large
            number with him into it, at least was at the head of it, who is
            called Beelzebub, the prince of devils: what their first sin was,
            and the occasion of it, is not easy to say; it is generally thought
            to be pride, affecting a likeness to, or an equality with God; since
            this was what man was tempted to by them, and by which he fell, as
            they are thought to do; and because this is the sin of such who fall
            into the condemnation of the devil; 1 Timothy 3:6 and is the sin,
            that goes before a fall in common; as it did before the fall of man,
            so it might before the fall of angels, Proverbs 16:18. The passage
            in John 8:44 seems most clearly of any to express their sin, which
            was "not abiding in the truth"; in the truth of the Gospel,
            particularly the great truth of the salvation of men, by the
            incarnate Son of God; and which they could by no means brook and
            which might spring from pride, they not bearing the thought that the
            human nature should be exalted above theirs; hence the Jews, in
            opposing Christ as the Messiah and Saviour, are said to be of their
            father the devil, and to do his lusts; and Judas that betrayed him,
            and fell from his apostleship, and the truth, is called a devil; and
            the heresies of men, respecting the person and office of Christ, are
            styled doctrines of devils; and men that have professed this truth,
            and afterwards deny it, are represented in the same irrecoverable
            and desperate case with devils, and must expect the same punishment,
            John 8:44, and also it may be observed on the contrary, that the
            good angels that stand, greatly love, value, esteem, and pry into
            the truths of the Gospel; particularly the scheme of man's
            salvation, by the incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death of
            Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now these God spared not; or "had no mercy on", as the Arabic
            version renders it; he did not forgive their sin, nor provide a
            Saviour for them; but directly, and at once, notwithstanding the
            dignity and excellency of their nature, in strict justice, and awful
            severity, without any mercy, inflicted due punishment on them;
            wherefore it cannot be thought that false teachers, who, as they,
            abide not in the truth, but deny and oppose it, should escape the
            vengeance of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But cast them down to Tartarus</em>. They were hurled out of
            heaven, from whence they fell as lightning, into the "lowest", or
            inferior places, as the Syriac version renders it; either into the
            air, as in Ephesians 2:2 or into the earth; as in Revelation 12:9 or
            into the deep, the abyss, the bottomless pit, where they are
            detained, as in a prison, Luke 8:31 though for certain reasons, and
            at certain times, are suffered to come forth, and rove about in this
            earth, and in the air: and these, when removed from their ancient
            seats in heaven, were not merely bid to go away, as the wicked will
            at the day of judgment; or were "drove" out, as Adam was from the
            garden of Eden; but "cast down"; with great power, indignation,
            wrath, and contempt, never to be raised and restored again.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And committed them to pits of darkness</em>. Leaving them under
            the guilt of sin, which is the power of darkness, and in black
            despair; shutting them up in unbelief, impenitence, and hardness of
            mind; being holden with the cords of their sins, and in the most
            dreadful state of bondage and captivity to their lusts, in just
            judgment on them; and in the most miserable and uncomfortable
            condition, being driven from the realms of light, deprived of the
            face and presence of God, in the utmost horror and trembling, and
            fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to consume
            them; and in utter darkness, without the least glimmering of light,
            joy, peace, and comfort; and where there is nothing but weeping,
            wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and being also under the restraints
            of the power and providence of God, and not able to stir or move, or
            do anything without divine permission; and being likewise, by the
            everlasting, unalterable, and inscrutable purposes and decrees of
            God, appointed to everlasting wrath and destruction; by which they
            are consigned and bound over to it, and held fast, that they cannot
            escape it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To be reserved for judgment</em>. To the day of judgment, to the
            last and general judgment; the judgment of torment, as the Syriac
            version here calls it; the words may be rendered, "and delivered
            them to be kept at judgment, in chains of darkness"; when they will
            be in full torment, which they are not yet in; and then they will be
            cast into the lake of fire prepared for them, and be everlastingly
            shut up in the prison of hell from whence they will never more be
            suffered to go out; till which time they are indeed under
            restraints, and are held in by Christ, who has the power of binding
            and loosing them at pleasure; and who then, as the Judge of men and
            devils, will bring them forth, and pass and execute sentence on
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jews give an account of the dejection, fall, and punishment of
            the angels, in a manner pretty much like this of Peter's, whom they
            speak of under different names; so of the serpent that deceived Adam
            and Eve, whom they call Samael, and because of that sin of his, they
            say that the Lord "cast down Samael and his company from the place
            of their holiness, out of heaven; and of Aza and Azael, angels, who,
            they say, sinned by lusting after the daughters of men, they
            frequently affirm, that God cast them down from their holiness l,
            and that he אפיל לון לתתא, "cast them down below in chains" m; and
            that God cast them down from their holiness from above; and when
            they descended, they were rolled in the air--and he brought them to
            the mountains of darkness, which are called the mountains of the
            east, and bound them "in chains" of iron, and the chains were sunk
            into the midst of the great deep n: and elsewhere they say o, that
            God cast them down from their holy degree, out of heaven--from their
            holy place out of heaven--and bound them in "chains" of iron, in the
            mountains of "darkness".

          <p>
            <em>And didn’t spare the ancient world</em>. In distinction from the
            present world, that now is; which was, as it were, formed anew out
            of that which was destroyed by the deluge. The Vulgate Latin version
            renders it, "the original world"; and the Ethiopic version, "the
            first world"; it designs the ancient inhabitants of the world, as it
            was from the beginning, before the flood; who, being wicked, were
            not spared by God, but had just punishment inflicted on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But preserved Noah with seven others</em>. Not the eighth from
            Adam, as Enoch is said to be the seventh from him, Judges 1:14 for
            he was the tenth; nor is it to be read with the following clause,
            "the eighth preacher of righteousness"; but he was the eighth
            person, or one of the eight persons, saved from the flood; see 1
            Peter 3:20 hence the Ethiopic version, rather as a paraphrase than a
            version, renders it, "but caused to remain seven souls with Noah;
            whom he saved"; Hottinger p and Dr. Hammond q observe, from the
            Arabic writers, that the mountain on which the ark rested, and a
            town near it, were called Themenim; that is, "the eight", from the
            number of persons then and there saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>A preacher of righteousness</em>. Of the righteousness of God,
            in all his ways and works, and in case he should destroy the world
            by a flood, as he had threatened; and of civil and moral
            righteousness among men, both by words, during the building of the
            ark, and by works, by his own example, in his righteous life and
            conversation; and of the righteousness of faith, or of Christ, by
            which he was justified and of which he was an heir, Hebrews 11:7,
            the Jews r say that Noah was a prophet; and they represent him also,
            as a preacher, and even tell us the very words he used in his
            exhortations to the old worlds, saying, "be ye turned from your evil
            ways and works, lest the waters of the flood come upon you, and cut
            off all the seed of the children of men:" but though Noah, a
            preacher of righteousness, was saved, false teachers cannot expect
            to escape divine vengeance; who only are transformed as ministers of
            righteousness, but in truth are ministers of unrighteousness;
            opposers of the righteousness of Christ, and live unrighteous lives
            and conversations, and so their end will be according to their
            works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly</em>. Though
            here it indeed means a whole world of wicked men, all but a very
            few, which were destroyed by the flood. This expresses both the
            wickedness of the men of that generation, the imagination of the
            thoughts of whose heart were evil continually; and whose lives were
            filled up with uncleanness, violence, rapine, oppression, injustice,
            and corruption, of all sorts; and likewise the large numbers of
            them, there was a whole world of them; and yet this did not secure
            them from the wrath of God, but served to stir it up the more;
            wherefore false teachers and their followers must not build upon
            their numbers, or hope to be screened from just punishment on that
            account; since a world of ungodly men were, for their wickedness, at
            once swept away, with a flood of God's bringing upon them; causing
            that very useful and serviceable element of water to be the means of
            their destruction; for this was not a casual thing, which came of
            itself, or by chance, but was of God himself, who broke up the
            fountains of the great deep, and opened the windows of heaven, and
            destroyed at once all mankind, men, women, and children, and every
            living creature, excepting what were with Noah in the ark: and since
            they were persons of such a character as here described, it is not
            to be thought their punishment is ended here; it is the general
            notion of the Jews, that "the generation of the flood shall have no
            part in the world to come, nor shall they stand in judgment."

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes</em>. By
            raining brimstone and fire upon them from heaven, Genesis 19:24
            which soon reduced them to ashes, with Admah and Zeboiim,
            Deuteronomy 29:25, cities delightfully situated, which were as the
            garden of God, and the land of Egypt, together with the inhabitants
            of them; and after they had received a signal mercy, in being
            rescued by Abraham from the kings who had carried them captive; and
            though Abraham, the friend of God, interceded for them, and
            righteous Lot dwelt among them. The first of these cities is in the
            Hebrew language called Sedom; Philo the Jew w calls it Sodoma, as in
            Romans 9:29 and in the Septuagint on Genesis 13:10 here it is said
            to be a city, and Josephus x always calls it the city of the
            Sodomites, but in Matthew 10:15 we read of the land of Sodom; and so
            Philo y the Jew speaks of χωρα, the region or country of the
            Sodomites; here the word is of the plural number, as in Matthew
            10:15 as it is also in the Septuagint in Genesis 10:19 and in Philo
            the Jew z, and so is Gomorrah in some copies of this, place, as in
            Matthew 10:15.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solinus, the historian, gives an account of these cities, in
            agreement with this; "a good way off of Jerusalem (he says a) is
            opened a sorrowful gulf, which the black ground, "in cinerem
            soluta", "reduced to ashes", shows it to be touched by heaven; there
            were two towns, or cities, the one called Sodom, and the other
            Gomorrah; where an apple is produced, which, although it has an
            appearance of ripeness, cannot be eaten; for the outward skin that
            encompasses it only contains a sort of soot, or embers within,
            which, ever so lightly squeezed, evaporates into smoke and dust;"
            and so the author of the book of Wisdom 10:7 speaking of the five
            cities, on which fire fell, says, "of whose wickedness, even to this
            day, the waste land that smoketh is a testimony; and plants bearing
            fruit, that never come to ripeness." Philo the Jew b says, that
            "there are showed to this day in Syria monuments of this unspeakable
            destruction that happened; as ruins, ashes, sulphur, smoke, and a
            weak flame, breaking forth as of a fire burning:"
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Condemned them to destruction</em>. By this sad "catastrophe"
            God condemned the sins of those men of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
            condemned their persons to everlasting damnation; of which their
            temporal punishment was an emblem and figure; see Judges 1:7, the
            word "overthrow" is generally used when this destruction is spoken
            of, Deuteronomy 29:23 and therefore retained by the apostle here.

            them, and declare them as they did; and especially that should live
            in the commission of the same sins, those unnatural lusts and
            uncleannesses, which to this day go by the name of "sodomy", and
            "sodomitical" practices; now the punishment of the inhabitants of
            these cities was an ensample to such wicked conduct, showing what
            they must expect, and was a representation of those everlasting
            burnings, which such sinners, as a righteous retaliation for their
            burning lusts, shall be cast into. The Jews say c the same of the
            men of Sodom and Gomorrah as of the old world; "the men of Sodom
            have no part in the world to come, as is said Genesis 13:13 "but the
            men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the Lord exceedingly";
            wicked in this world, and sinners in the world to come;"

            <em>And delivered righteous Lot</em>. Who was a just man, being
            justified by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him; and having
            the new man formed in him, which is created in righteousness and
            true holiness; and living soberly, righteously, and godly, though
            not without sin: for there is not a just man that lives and sinneth
            not; this righteous man was delivered from the burning of Sodom by
            the means of angels, Genesis 19:16. The Jews are very injurious to
            this good man's character, and give a very different one of him from
            this of the apostle's; they call him a wicked man, a perfect wicked
            man, as wicked as the inhabitants of Sodom d; and say, that because
            they abounded in sin, therefore Lot chose to dwell among them e; and
            affirm f, that all the time he was with Abraham, God did not join
            himself to him, and did not commune with Abraham on his account;
            but, when he was separated from him, did; they call him the evil
            imagination, and the old serpent that was accursed, and cursed Lot
            g; but Philo the Jew h speaks better of him, and says that he did
            not embrace and delight in the iniquities of the inhabitants, though
            he did not arrive to the perfection of wisdom; and the author of the
            book of Wisdom calls him the "righteous man", "When the ungodly
            perished, she delivered the righteous man, who fled from the fire
            which fell down upon the five cities." (Wisdom 10:6) as the apostle
            does here.

            <em>Who was very distressed by the lustful life of the wicked</em>.
            The inhabitants of Sodom, who had no regard to the laws of God or
            man, or to the law and light of nature; but as worse than brute
            beasts, lived daily in the commission of unnatural lusts; and
            therefore their conversation is rightly said to be filthy, and was a
            grievous burden to righteous Lot: for to a good man, not only his
            own sins, but the sins of others, whether professors or profane, are
            a burden, and make him groan under them, being grievously fatigued
            with them, as this good man was, and weary of life because of them,
            as Rebekah was, through the daughters of Heth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For that righteous man dwelling among them</em>. Which is
            sometimes the lot of good men, to their great sorrow and grief,
            Psalms 120:5. Upon mentioning those words in Genesis 13:12 "and
            pitched his tent towards Sodom", but the men of Sodom were wicked,
            c. says R. Eleazar "he is a righteous man that dwells between two
            wicked men, and does not learn their works;" and such an one was
            Lot, whatever they are elsewhere pleased to say of him: "in seeing
            and hearing"; the Vulgate Latin version reads this in connection
            with the word "righteous", thus, "in seeing and hearing he was
            righteous": he could not bear to see their filthy actions, and hear
            their obscene language, but turned away from them, and shut his
            eyes, and stopped his ears, by which he appears to be a righteous
            and good man; though rather this belongs to what follows, seeing
            their wicked practices, and hearing their filthy talk.

            continually, with their wicked actions.

              temptation</em
            >. That "fear him", as the Syriac version renders it; or that
            "rightly worship", as the Arabic; such as Noah and Lot, men that
            know God in Christ spiritually and experimentally; that believe in
            him, love him, fear him, worship him in spirit and truth, and live
            soberly, righteously, and godly. This verse is a conclusion from the
            preceding instances and examples, respecting both the mercy and
            justice of God; the mercy of God in delivering the godly and
            righteous "out of temptations"; by which are meant, not the
            temptations of Satan to sin, distrust, and despondency, though the
            Lord knows how, and is both able and willing to, and does deliver
            them from them; but afflictions and tribulations, such as Noah and
            Lot were exposed to; and which are so called, because they try the
            graces, particularly the faith and patience of the godly; and to
            deliver from these is the Lord's work: he grants his presence in
            them; he supports under them; he sanctifies them to them, and in his
            own time delivers out of them; for he knows how, and by what means,
            and when to do it, and is both able and willing: he has determined
            to do it, for the nature, measure, and duration of afflictions are
            fixed by him, and in his providence he does do it, as the instances
            before given prove.

              >And to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of
              judgment</em
            >. This is that part of the conclusion from the above premises,
            respecting the justice of God; and by "the unjust" are designed,
            persons without a righteousness, and that are full of all
            unrighteousness, and take pleasure in it, and live unrighteous
            lives, committing acts of injustice, both with respect to God and
            men; and the Lord, that has reserved the fallen angels in chains of
            darkness unto judgment, knows how to reserve "in prison", as the
            Arabic version renders it, the souls of those in hell, and their
            bodies in the grave "unto the day of judgment"; of the last and
            general judgment, when Christ shall judge both quick and dead, and
            bring every secret thing to light, which that day shall declare, God
            has appointed to judge the world in; in order "to be punished" in
            soul and body, with everlasting and complete destruction, which, as
            yet, is not. This phrase, "the day of judgment", is used in Judith
            and is a Jewish one. "Woe to the nations that rise up against my
            kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of
            judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall
            feel them, and weep for ever." (Judith 16:17).

            <em>But chiefly those who walk after the flesh</em>. Not merely
            after the dictates of corrupt nature, as all men, and even God's
            elect do, in a state of unregeneracy; but "after strange flesh", as
            Judges 1:7 expresses it, after the flesh of men.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the lust of defilement</em>. Not of fornication and adultery,
            but of sodomy, and sodomitical practices; sins exceeding great, not
            only contrary to the law and light of nature, but dishonourable to
            human nature; and are what prevail where idolatry, infidelity,
            errors, and heresies do; and which, as they are sins of the deepest
            dye, deserve the greater damnation, and are chiefly and more
            especially punished by God with great severity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And despise authority</em>. Of parents, to whom these proud
            boasters and blasphemers are generally disobedient; and of masters,
            pretending it to be contrary to their Christian liberty; and of
            magistrates on the same account, and as being a restraint upon their
            lusts; which is to despise the ordinance of God, his
            representatives, and to introduce anarchy and confusion, and to open
            a door to all manner of sin; and also the government of Christ, as
            head of the church, and King of Zion, whom they will not have to
            reign over them, and therefore reject his laws, and submit not to
            his ordinances; and likewise the government of the world itself by
            God; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "despise their
            Creator"; denying his omniscience and his providence, giving out
            that he neither sees, observes, and takes notice of what is done in
            the world; nor does he himself do either good or evil, or concern
            himself about what is done by men.
