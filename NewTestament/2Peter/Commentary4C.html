          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Daring</em>. Bold and daring, not fearing to speak against men
            of the most exalted character on earth, and against God himself in
            heaven; see Psalms 73:8.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Self-willed</em>. Pleased with themselves, and their own
            conceits, their dogmas and opinions, with their high sense and
            profound judgment; and being obstinate in their sentiments, and
            resolutely bent to retain and defend them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries</em>. Or
            "glories"; of the apostles, who were set in the first place in the
            church, and were the glory of Christ, 1 Corinthians 12:28; or of
            angels, styled thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers; or
            rather of civil magistrates, set in high places, and to whom glory
            and honour are due; which to do is contrary to the law of God, and
            of dangerous consequence, Exodus 22:28.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Whereas angels, though greater in might and power</em>. Which is
            not to be understood of evil angels, or devils; for, besides that
            they are greatly weakened and impaired by their fall, they are the
            accusers of men, and railers and slanderers of the best and greatest
            of men, and the origin of all the blasphemies that are vented
            against God or men; but of good angels, who excel in strength, who
            are not only guardians to particular men, and encamp about the
            saints, but preside over provinces and kingdoms, for which their
            power and might do abundantly qualify them; and in which they are
            greater, that is, not than the devils, or than the false teachers,
            though both are true, but than dominions and dignities, than kings,
            princes, and civil magistrates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Don’t bring a slanderous judgment against them before the
              Lord</em
            >. Either "against themselves", as the Arabic version and one of
            Beza's copies read; against one another, against those of their own
            species, that are in a higher or lower class or office than
            themselves; and therefore men ought not to despise magistracy, or
            the higher powers that are over them: or else against the fallen
            angels, the devils, as should seem from Judges 1:9, or rather
            against civil magistrates, kings, and princes of this world, who,
            though so much below them, they vouchsafe to take under their care,
            and protect them, even Heathen princes, Daniel 10:20; and though
            there may be oftentimes many things unbecoming in them, yet they do
            not accuse them, or rail against them before the Lord; and even
            when, by his orders, they inflict punishment on their persons, as on
            Sennacherib, and Herod, and others, yet they do not speak evil of
            their office; and therefore, since angels, who are so much above
            men, even above the most dignified among them, behave in this
            manner, it must be an aggravation of the sin of these persons, who
            are so much below them, to speak evil of them.

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>But these, as unreasoning creatures</em>. So far are these men
            from acting like the angels, that they are sunk below their own
            species, and are like beasts, and become brutish in their knowledge
            and behaviour; are like the horse and the mule, without
            understanding, act as if they were without reason; yea, are more
            stupid and senseless than the ox, or the ass, which know their
            owner, and their crib; and even in those things which they might,
            and do know by the light of nature, they corrupt themselves; and
            being given up to judicial blindness, and a reprobate mind, call
            good evil, and evil good, and do things that are not convenient, and
            which even brute beasts do not; and like as they are guided by an
            instinct in nature, to do what they do, so these men are led and
            influenced by the force and power of corrupt nature in them, to
            commit all manner of wickedness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Born natural animals to be taken and destroyed</em>. Or, as it
            may be rendered, "to take and destroy"; as beasts and birds of prey,
            such as lions, tigers, wolves, bears, vultures, hawks, c. to which
            abusers of themselves with mankind, ravishers of women,
            extortioners, oppressors, thieves, robbers, and plunderers of men's
            properties, may be compared: or "to be taken and destroyed" that is,
            they are made or appointed to be taken in the net and snare of
            Satan, are vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, and are afore
            ordained to condemnation and ruin.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant</em>.
            Either of angels, of whose nature, office, and dignity, they are
            ignorant; and blaspheme them, by either ascribing too much to them,
            as the creation of the world, and divine worship, as were by some
            ancient heretics; or by speaking such things of them as were below
            them, and unworthy of them; or of civil magistrates, not knowing the
            nature and end of magistracy and civil government, and therefore
            spoke evil of them, when they ought to pray, and be thankful for
            them, and live peaceable and quiet lives under them; or of the
            ministers of the word, whose usefulness for the conversion of
            sinners and edification of saints were not known, at least not
            acknowledged by these men; hence they were traduced, and went
            through ill report among them, being as unknown by them; or of the
            Scriptures of truth, which heretical men do not truly know and
            understand, but wrest to their own destruction, or deny; and of the
            Gospel and the mysteries of it, which are things not seen, known,
            and understood by carnal men, and therefore are blasphemed, reviled,
            and reproached by them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Will in their destroying surely be destroyed</em>. Of which they
            are servants, 2 Peter 2:19, in their moral corruption, in their
            filthy and unnatural lusts, which are the cause of their everlasting
            perdition and destruction, to which they are righteously appointed
            of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Receiving the wages of unrighteousness</em>. Due punishment,
            both in body and soul, for all their injustice to God and men; which
            will be a just recompense of reward they shall receive at the
            righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according to
            his works: the justice of which appears by what follows.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>People who count it pleasure to revel in the daytime</em>. Who
            place all their satisfaction and happiness in sensual delight, in
            rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness, day after
            day; putting away the evil day far from them, supposing that
            tomorrow will be as this day, and that there will be no future
            judgment nor state; and therefore do not take the night for their
            revels, as other sinners do, but being without all shame, declare
            their sin as Sodom, and hide it not.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Spots and defects</em>. Which defile themselves, their minds and
            consciences, their souls and bodies, with sin, and defile others by
            their evil communications, and bring dishonour and disgrace upon the
            ways, doctrines, and interest of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Reveling in their deceit</em>. With their sins and lusts, by
            which they deceive themselves and others, it being a sport to them
            to commit sin; and in which they take great pleasure and pastime,
            and not only delight in their own sins, but in those of others, and
            in them that do them. Some versions, as the Vulgate Latin and
            Arabic, instead of απαταις, "deceivings", read αγαπαις, love feasts,
            as in Judges 1:12, and so the Alexandrian copy; in which they
            behaved in a very scandalous manner, indulging themselves in luxury
            and intemperance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>While they feast with you</em>. At the above feasts, or at the
            Lord's table, or at their own houses, which shows that they were of
            them, and among them, as in 2 Peter 2:1; and carries in it a tacit
            reproof for the continuance of them, when they were become so bad in
            their principles, and so scandalous in their lives.
          </p>

              >having eyes full of adultery, and who can’t cease from sin,
              enticing unsettled souls, having a heart trained in greed,
              accursed children!</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Having eyes full of adultery</em>. For the seventh command is
            not only violated by unclean actions, and obscene words, but also by
            unchaste looks: and so the Jews explain that precept, "thou shalt
            not commit adultery", Exodus 20:14; you shall not go after your
            hearts, nor after "your eyes"; says R. Levi, the heart and the "eye"
            are sin's two brokers." Hence we read l of נואף בעיניו, "one that
            commits adultery with his eyes"; Exodus 20:14; compare Job 31:1.
            Some read the words, "having eyes full of the adulteress": that is,
            having a lewd and infamous woman always in mind and sight,
            continually looking at her and lusting after her.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And who can’t cease from sin</em>. Which may be understood
            either of these wicked men, who are like the troubled sea, that
            cannot rest, but are continually casting up the mire and dirt of sin
            out of their polluted heart; who live and walk in sin, and are
            always committing it, their conversation being nothing else but one
            continued series of sinning; nor can they do otherwise, since they
            are slaves to their lusts, and are carried away with the force and
            power of them: or of their eyes, which were always rolling after
            unlawful objects; their eyes and their hearts were only, and always,
            for their lust, as the prophet says of others, that they were but
            for their covetousness, Jeremiah 22:17; a sin also which reigned in
            these men.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Enticing unsettled souls</em>. Such as were unsteady in their
            principles, and unstable in their ways; were like children tossed to
            and fro with every wind of doctrine, not being rooted in Christ, nor
            established in the faith; these, as the serpent beguiled Eye, they
            corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ; imposed false
            doctrines on them, and deceived them by false glosses and outward
            appearances; and by fair words and good speeches, and by their
            wanton looks and carnal lusts, they allured them into the sin of
            adultery; or ensnared them, drew them into the net and snare of
            Satan, and so they were taken and led captive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Having a heart trained in greed</em>. An immoderate love of
            money, a covetous desire after it, is the root of all evil, the bane
            of religion, and source of heresy, and is a vice which has always
            prevailed among false teachers; and the character here given well
            agrees with Simon Magus, the father of heresies, and his followers:
            hence care is always taken to insert, among, the characters and
            qualifications of Gospel ministers, that they be not greedy of
            filthy lucre, 1 Timothy 3:3; this iniquity, when it is a reigning
            one, and is become an habit, as it was in the persons here
            described, for it had its seat in their heart, they were habituated
            to it, and continually exercised it in a multitude of instances and
            wicked practices, is insatiable and damnable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Accursed children</em>! Or "children of the curse"; which may be
            understood either actively, children that do curse, as children of
            disobedience are such as commit acts of disobedience; so these were
            cursing children, who, though their mouths might not be full of
            cursing and bitterness, as openly profane sinners be, yet they
            inwardly, and from their hearts, cursed the true followers of
            Christ, and their principles; or passively, cursed children who were
            under the curse of the law, and from which there was no redemption
            for them, but at the last day will have the awful sentence
            pronounced on them, Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.

            and the life; the true way to eternal life, and which is the right

            salvation by Christ, the Christian faith, and the doctrine of it,
            which they once professed, but now relinquished.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>They went astray</em>. From the right way, the way of truth and
            holiness, into the paths of error and profaneness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor</em>. Which
            Jude calls his error, Judges 1:11, and is the path of covetousness,
            uncleanness, and idolatry, sins which he was either guilty of
            himself, or taught, advised, and seduced others to; see Revelation
            2:14. The Vulgate Latin version reads "Balaam [out of] Bosor",
            taking "Bosor" for the name of a place, of which "Balaam" was; but
            not "Bosor", but "Pethor", was the place of Balaam's residence,
            Numbers 22:5. The Arabic and Ethiopic versions supply, as we do,
            "the son of Bosor"; and the Syriac version reads, "the son of Beor",
            as in Numbers 22:5; for Beor and "Bosor" are the same names; the
            "sheva" being pronounced by "o", as it is by "oa" in "Boanerges",
            and the "ain" by "s". Moreover, the letters צ and ע are sometimes
            used for one another, as in צאן and עאן, ארץ and ארע, and so ע and
            ש, especially in the Chaldean dialect; and Peter now being at
            Babylon in Chaldea, see 1 Peter 5:13; it is no wonder that he so
            pronounced.

            or soothsaying, and may well be called unrighteous wages, since it
            was for doing unrighteous things, or things in an unrighteous
            manner; and these he loved, desired, and greedily coveted, and fain
            would he have taken Balak's gold and silver, and have cursed Israel,
            but was restrained by the Lord: he showed a good will to it, in
            going along with the messengers, and in building altars, and
            offering sacrifice in one place after another, in which there was a
            great resemblance between him and the men here spoken of.

          <p>
            <em>But he was rebuked for his own disobedience</em>. Which was not
            merely going along with the messengers of Balak, for he had leave
            from the Lord so to do, Numbers 22:20; but going along with them
            with a desire to curse Israel, when it was the will of God he should
            go and bless them, in order to get Balak's money; so that his
            governing iniquity was covetousness, which led him to other sins;
            and for this he was rebuked by the angel, Numbers 22:32, as well as
            reproved by his ass, Numbers 22:28.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>A speechless donkey</em>. It was naturally so, the donkey on
            which he rode.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Spoke with a man’s voice</em>. Which was supernatural and
            miraculous, for it was God that opened the mouth of the ass: the
            mouth of that ass is said, by the Jews m, to be one of the ten
            things created between the two evenings on the sixth day of the
            creation; that is, as the gloss on it says, concerning which it was
            decreed, that its mouth should be opened to speak what this ass
            said; and the occasion of it may be seen in Numbers 22:22.
            Lactantius n observes, that there are two stars in the constellation
            of Cancer, which the Greeks call the "asses"; and which, the poets
            feign, are those that carried Liberus over a river, when he could
            not pass it; to one of which he gave this for a reward, "ut humana
            voce loqueretur", "that it should speak with man's voice"; a fable,
            no doubt, hatched from the sacred history, and said in imitation of
            this ass.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And stopped the madness of the prophet</em>. And so Balaam,
            though a diviner and soothsayer, is called by the Jewish writers o;
            who, they say, was first a prophet, and then a soothsayer, from whom
            Jerom p seems to have received the tradition; who says, that he was
            first a holy man, and a prophet of God, and afterwards, through
            disobedience, and a desire of gifts, was called a diviner; for his
            eyes were opened, and he saw the vision of the Almighty; and the
            Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied many things
            concerning Israel, and the Messiah, and others, Numbers 24:4. His
            madness lay in going with the messengers of Balak, Numbers 22:21, in
            order to curse Israel, contrary to the will of God, Numbers 22:12;
            and it is madness in any to oppose God in his counsels, purposes,
            providences, and precepts; and every sin, which is an act of
            hostility against God, has madness in it; and this of Balaam's was
            forbid by his ass, and he was convinced of it. Very appropriately is
            mention made of this dumb ass, when the persons here spoken of were
            as natural brute beasts, and worse than them, 2 Peter 2:12.
