            Ver 5.
            <em
              >Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence,
              in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence,

          <p>
            <em
              >Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all
              diligence</em
            >. Bestow all your labour, diligence, and care; namely, on what
            follows, and that from the consideration of what goes before; for
            nothing can more strongly animate, and engage to the diligent
            exercise of grace and discharge of duty, than a consideration of the
            high favours, and free grace gifts of God, and the exceeding great
            and precious promises of his Gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In your faith supply moral excellence</em>. They had faith, even
            like precious faith with the apostles, not of themselves, but by the
            gift of God, and which is the first and principal grace; it leads
            the van, or rather the "chorus", as the word rendered "add"
            signifies; and though it is in itself imperfect, has many things
            lacking in it, yet it cannot be added to, or increased by men;
            ministers may be a means of perfecting what is lacking in it, and of
            the furtherance and joy of it, but it is the Lord only that can
            increase it, or add unto it in that sense, and which is not the
            meaning here: but the sense is, that as it is the basis and
            foundation of all good works, it should not stand alone, there ought
            to be virtue, or good works along with it, by which it may be
            perfected, not essentially, but evidentially, or might appear to be
            true and genuine; for by virtue may be either meant some particular
            virtue, as justice towards men, to which both the grace and doctrine
            of faith direct; and indeed pretensions to faith in Christ, where
            there is not common justice done to men, are of little account; or,
            as others think, beneficence to men; and so the Ethiopic version
            renders it, "proceed to bounty by your faith"; and faith does work
            by love and kindness to fellow creatures and Christians; but this
            seems rather designed by brotherly kindness and charity, in 2 Peter
            1:7 or boldness, courage, constancy, and fortitude, which ought to
            go along with faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where there is true faith in Christ, there should be a holy boldness
            to profess it, and constancy in it, and courage to fight the good
            fight of faith, and firmness of mind to stand fast in it,
            notwithstanding all difficulties and discouragements; or virtue in
            general here meant, not mere moral, but Christian virtues, which are
            the fruits of the Spirit of God, and of his grace; and differ from
            the other, in that they spring from the grace of God, are done in
            faith, by the assistance of the Spirit of Christ, and by strength
            received from him, and in love to him, and with a view to the glory
            of God; whereas moral virtues, as exercised by a mere moral man,
            spring from nature, and are performed by the mere strength of it,
            and are destitute of faith, and so but "splendida peccata", splendid
            sins, and proceed from self-love, from sinister ends, and with
            selfish views.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And in moral excellence, knowledge</em>. Not of Christ,
            mentioned 2 Peter 1:8 and which is included in faith, for there can
            be no true faith in Christ, were there not knowledge of him; but of
            the will of God, which it is necessary men should be acquainted
            with, in order to perform it; or else though they may seem zealous
            of good works, their zeal will not be according to knowledge; they
            ought to know what are virtues or good works in God's account, and
            what are the nature and use of them, lest they should mistake and
            misapply them; or of the Scriptures of truth, and of the mysteries
            of the Gospel, which should be diligently searched, for the increase
            and improvement of knowledge in divine things, and which has a
            considerable influence on a just, sober, and godly living; or by
            knowledge may be meant prudence and wisdom, in ordering the external
            conversation aright towards those that are without, and in showing
            good works out of it, to others, by way of example, and for the
            evidence of the truth of things, with meekness of wisdom.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 6.
            <em
              >and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control,
              perseverance; and in perseverance, godliness;</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And in knowledge, self-control</em>. Avoiding all excess in
            eating and drinking, and all impure and unclean lusts; for it
            signifies nothing what a man knows, or professes to know, if his
            life is a scene of intemperance and debauchery: this seems to be
            levelled against the followers or Simon Magus, who ascertained
            salvation to knowledge, though the life was ever so impure,
            Moreover, this may include abstinence, not only from hurtful lusts,
            but from the use of things indifferent, when the peace and comfort
            of a weak brother are endangered; for then to knowledge must be
            added love, otherwise that knowledge will not be right, at least not
            rightly used; see 1 Corinthians 8:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And in self-control, perseverance</em>. Which is necessary to
            the running of the Christian race, which is attended with many
            difficulties and exercises; and under affliction from the hand of
            God, that there be no murmuring nor repining; and under reproaches
            and persecutions from men, that they faint not, and are not
            discouraged by them; and in the expectation of the heavenly glory:
            this is proper to be superadded to the former, because there may be
            intemperance in passion, as well as in the use of the creatures; a
            man may be inebriated with wrath and anger, and overcome with
            impatience, as well as with wine and strong drink. Either internal,
            which is distinguished from bodily exercise, or outward worship, and
            lies in the inward and powerful exercise of grace, as faith, hope,
            love, fear, &c. and the Syriac version here renders it, "the fear of
            God": or rather external, and intends the whole worship of God, as
            prayer, praise, hearing of the word, and attendance on all
            ordinances.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And in perseverance, godliness</em>. Either internal, which is
            distinguished from bodily exercise, or outward worship, and lies in
            the inward and powerful exercise of grace, as faith, hope, love,
            fear, &c. and the Syriac version here renders it, "the fear of God":
            or rather external, and intends the whole worship of God, as prayer,
            praise, hearing of the word, and attendance on all ordinances.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 7.
            <em
              >and in godliness, brotherly affection; and in brotherly
              affection, love.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And in godliness, brotherly affection</em>. Without which,
            godliness, or external worship, or a profession of religion, is a
            vain show; for this is both the evidence of regeneration, and of the
            truth and power of real godliness; and also the beauty, comfort, and
            security of Christian society and worship, and without which they
            cannot be maintained with peace, profit, and honour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And in brotherly affection, love</em>. That is, to all men,
            enemies, as well as to the household of faith; and to God and
            Christ, to his house, worship, ordinances, people and truths.
            Charity is more extensive in its objects and acts than brotherly
            kindness or love. As faith leads the van, charity brings up the
            rear, and is the greatest of all.
