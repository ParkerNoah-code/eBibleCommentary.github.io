        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          The external testimony in favor of the Pauline authorship is in no way
          deficient. Marcion included the letter in his canon, and the
          Muratorian Fragment mentions it as one of the Pauline writings. It is
          contained in the old Latin and Syriac Versions; and from the time of
          Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian it is regularly quoted
          by name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internal evidence also clearly points to Paul as the writer. The
          Epistle comes to us under the name of Paul; and those that were
          associated with him in writing it, viz. Silvanus (Silas) and
          Timotheus, are known to have been Pauls companions on the second
          missionary journey. It is marked by the usual Pauline blessing,
          thanksgiving and salutation, and clearly reflects the character of the
          great apostle to the Gentiles. Although it has been subject to attack,
          it is now defended by critics of nearly every school as an authentic
          production of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schrader and Baur were the first ones to attack it in 1835. The great
          majority of critics, even those of Baur’s own school, turned against
          them; such men as Hilgenfeld, Pfleiderer, Holtzmann, Davidson, Von
          Soden and Julicher defending the genuineness of the letter. They found
          followers, however, especially in Holsten and Van der Vies. Of the
          objections brought against the Epistle the following deserve
          consideration: (1) As compared with the other writings of Paul, the
          contents of this Epistle are very insignificant, not a single
          doctrine, except that in 1 Thes 4:13-18, being made prominent. In the
          main it is but a reiteration of Pauls work among the Thessalonians,
          and of the circumstances attending their conversion, all of which they
          knew very well. (2) The letter reveals a progress in the Christian
          life that is altogether improbable, if a period of only a few months
          had elapsed between its composition and the founding of the church,
          cf. 1 Thes 1:7-8; 1 Thes 4:10. (3) The passage 1 Thes 2:14-16 does not
          fit in the mouth of him who wrote Romans 9—11 and who was himself at
          one time a fierce persecutor of the Church. Moreover it implies that
          the destruction of Jerusalem was already a thing of the past. (4) The
          Epistle is clearly dependent on some of the other Pauline writings,
          especially I and II Corinthians. Compare 1 Thes 1:5 with 1 Cor 2:4 ;—
          1 Thes 1:6 with 1 Cor 11:1;— 1 Thes 2:4 ff. with 1 Cor 2:4; 1 Cor 4:3
          ff; 1 Cor 9:15 ff.; 2 Cor 2:17; 2 Cor 5:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cogency of these arguments is not apparent. Paul’s letters have an
          occasional character, and the situation at Thessalonica did not call
          for an exposition of Christian doctrine, save a deliverance on the
          parousia; but did require words of encouragement, guidance and
          exhortation, and also, in view of the insinuations against the
          apostle, a careful review of all that he had done among them. Looked
          at from that point of view the Epistle is in no sense insignificant.
          The words of 1 Thes 1:7-8 and 1 Thes 4:10 do not imply a long
          existence of the Thessalonian church, but simply prove the intensity
          of its faith and love. Three or four months were quite sufficient for
          the report of their great faith to spread in Macedonia and Achaia.
          Moreover the very shortcomings of the Thessalonians imply that their
          religious experience was as yet of but short duration. In view of what
          Paul writes in II Corinthians and Galatians respecting the Judaeizers,
          we certainly need not be surprised at what he says in 1 Thes 2:14-16.
          If the words are severe, let us remember that they were called forth
          by a bitter and dogged opposition that followed the apostle from place
          to place, and on which he had brooded for some time. The last words of
          this passage do not necessarily imply that Jerusalem had already been
          destroyed. They are perfectly intelligible on the supposition that
          Paul, in view of the wickedness of the Jews and of the calamities that
          were already overtaking them, Jos. Ant. XX 2, 5, 6, had a lively
          presentiment of their impending doom. The last argument is a very
          peculiar one. It is tantamount to saying that the Epistle cannot be
          Pauline, because there are so many Pauline phrases and expressions in
          it. Such an argument is its own refutation, and is neutralized by the
          fact that in the case of other letters dissimilarity leads the critics
          to the same conclusion.
        </p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          1. This Epistle is like that to the Philippians one of the most letter
          like of all the writings of Paul. It is, as Deissmann says, “full of
          moving personal reminiscences.” The practical interest greatly
          predominates over the doctrinal; and though the polemical element is
          not altogether absent, it is not at all prominent. The letter is
          primarily one of practical guidance, instruction and encouragement,
          for a faithful, persecuted church, whose knowledge is still deficient,
          and whose weak and faint-hearted and idlers greatly need the counsel
          of the apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Doctrinally I Thessalonians is one of the eschatological Epistles
          of Paul. It refers very little to Christ’s coming in the flesh to give
          himself a ransom for sin, but discusses all the more his future coming
          as the Lord of Glory. There are at least six references to the
          parousia in this short letter, two of which are rather extensive
          passages, 1 Thes 1:10; 1 Thes 2:19; 1 Thes 3:13; 1 Thes 4:13-18; 1
          Thes 5:1-11; 1 Thes 5:23. This doctrine is at once the impelling
          motive for the exhortations of the apostle, and the sufficient ground
          for the encouragement of his readers, who expected the return of
          Christ in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Epistle never appeals to the Old Testament as an authority, and
          contains no quotations from it. We find a reference to its history,
          however, in 1 Thes 2:15, and probable reminiscences of its language in
          1 Thes 2:16; 1 Thes 4:5-6; 1 Thes 4:8-9; 1 Thes 5:8. The language of 1
          Thes 4:15-17 shows some similarity to 2Es_5:42, but the thought is
          quite different.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The style of this letter is thoroughly Pauline, containing an
          abundance of phrases and expressions that have parallels in the other
          Epistles of Paul, especially in those to the Corinthians. Comparing it
          with the other polemical writings of the apostle, we find that it is
          written in a quiet unimpassioned style, a style, too, far more simple
          and direct than that of Ephesians and Colossians. There are 42 words
          peculiar to it, of which 22 are not found elsewhere in the New
          Testament, and 20 are, but not in the writings of Paul.
        </p>
        <h2>The Church at Thessalonica</h2>
        <p>
          Thessalonica, originally called Thermae (Herodotus), and now bearing
          the slightly altered name Saloniki, a city of Macedonia, has always
          been very prominent in history and still ranks, after Constantinople,
          as the second town in European Turkey. It is situated on what was
          formerly known as the Thermaic gulf, and is built “in the form of an
          amphitheater on the slopes at the head of the bay.” The great Egnatian
          highway passed through it from East to West. Hence it was of old an
          important trade center and as such had special attraction for the
          Jews, who were found there in great numbers. Cassander, who rebuilt
          the city in 315 B. C. in all probability gave it the name Thessalonica
          in honor of his wife. In the time of the Romans it was the capital of
          the second part of Macedonia and the seat of the Roman governor of the
          entire province.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy, came to that city, after they
          had left Philippi about the year 52. As was his custom, he repaired to
          the synagogue to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. The result of this
          work was a spiritual harvest consisting of some Jews, a great number
          of proselytes (taking the word in its widest significance) and several
          of the city’s chief women. From the Acts of the Apostles we get the
          impression (though it is not definitely stated) that Pauls labors at
          Thessalonica terminated at the end of three weeks; but the Epistles
          rather favor the idea that his stay there was of longer duration. They
          pre-suppose a flourishing, well organized congregation, 1 Thes 5:12,
          whose faith had become a matter of common comment, 1 Thes 1:7-9; and
          show us that Paul, while he was in Thessalonica, worked for his daily
          bread, 1 Thes 2:9; 2 Thes 3:8, and received aid at least twice from
          the Philippians, Phil 4:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fruitful labor was cut short, however, by the malign influence of
          envious Jews, who attacked the house of Jason, where they expected to
          find the missionaries, and failing in this, they drew Jason and some
          of the brethren before the rulers, πολιτάχας (a name found only in
          Acts 17:6; Acts 17:8, but proved absolutely correct by inscriptions,
          cf. Ramsey, St. Paul the Traveler and the Roman Citizen p. 227) and
          charged them with treason. “The step taken by the politarchs was the
          mildest that was prudent in the circumstances; they bound the accused
          over in security that peace should be kept.” (Ramsay) As a result the
          brethren deemed it advisable to send Paul and his companions to Berea,
          where many accepted the truth, but their labors were again interrupted
          by the Jews from Thessalonica. Leaving Silas and Timothy here, the
          apostle went to Athens, where he expected them to join him shortly.
          From the narrative in the Acts it seems that they did not come to the
          apostle until after his arrival at Corinth, but 1 Thes 3:1 implies
          that Timothy was with him at Athens. The most natural theory is that
          both soon followed the apostle to Athens, and that he sent Timothy
          from there to Thessalonica to establish and comfort the church, and
          Silas on some other mission, possibly to Philippi, both returning to
          him at Corinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the data in Acts 17:4 and 1 Thes 1:9; 1 Thes 2:14 we may infer
          that the church of Thessalonica was of a mixed character, consisting
          of Jewish and Gentile Christians. Since no reference is made in the
          Epistles to the tenets of the Jews and not a single Old Testament
          passage is quoted, it is all but certain that its members were mostly
          Christians of the Gentiles. Only three of them are known to us from
          Scripture, viz. Jason, Acts 17:5-9, and Aristarchus and Secundus, Acts
          20:4. The congregation was not wealthy, 2 Cor 8:2-3; with the
          exception of a few women of the better class, it seems to have
          consisted chiefly of laboring people that had to work for their daily
          bread, 1 Thes 4:11; 2 Thes 3:6-12. They had not yet parted company
          with all their old vices, for there was still found among them
          fornication 1 Thes 4:3-5, fraud 1 Thes 4:6 and idleness 1 Thes 4:11.
          Yet they were zealous in the work of the Lord and formed one of the
          most beloved churches of the apostle.
        </p>
        <h2>Occasion and Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          What led Paul to write this letter, was undoubtedly the report Timothy
          brought him respecting the condition of the Thessalonian church. The
          apostle felt that he had been torn away from them all too soon and had
          not had sufficient time to establish them in the truth. Hence he was
          greatly concerned about their spiritual welfare after his forced
          departure. The coming of Timothy brought him some relief, for he
          learnt from that fellow-laborer that the church, though persecuted,
          did not waver, and that their faith had become an example to many. Yet
          he was not entirely at ease, since he also heard that the Jews were
          insinuating that his moral conduct left a great deal to be desired,
          while he had misled the Thessalonians for temporal gain and vainglory,
          1 Thes 2:3-10; that some heathen vices were still prevalent in the
          church; and that the doctrine of the parousia had been misconstrued,
          giving some occasion to cease their daily labors, and others, to feel
          concerned about the future condition of those who had recently died in
          their midst. That information led to the composition of our Epistle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of all these things it was but natural that the apostle should
          have a threefold purpose in writing this letter. In the first place he
          desired to express his gratitude for the faithful perseverance of the
          Thessalonians. In the second place he sought to establish them in
          faith, which was all the more necessary, since the enemy had sown
          tares among the wheat. Hence he reminds them of his work among them,
          pointing out that his conversation among them was above reproach, and
          that as a true apostle he had labored among them without covetousness
          and vainglory. And in the third place he aimed at correcting their
          conception of the Lords return, emphasizing its importance as a motive
          for sanctification,
        </p>
        <h2>Time and Place</h2>
        <p>
          There is little uncertainty as to the time and place of composition,
          except in the ranks of those who regard the Epistle as a forgery. When
          Paul wrote this letter, the memory of his visit to Thessalonica was
          still vivid, 1 Thes 1:1-10 and 1 Thes 2:1-20; and he was evidently in
          some central place, where he could keep posted on the state of affairs
          in Macedonia and Achaia, 1 Thes 1:7-8, and from where he could easily
          communicate with the Thessalonian church. Moreover Silas and Timothy
          were with him, of which the former attended the apostle only on his
          second missionary journey. and the latter could not bring him a report
          of conditions at Thessalonica, until he returned to the apostle at
          Corinth, Acts 18:5. Therefore the Epistle was written during Paul’s
          stay in that city. However it should not be dated at the beginning of
          Paul’s Corinthian residence, since the faith of the Thessalonians had
          already become manifest throughout Macedonia and Achaia, and some
          deaths had occurred in the church of Thessalonica. Neither can we
          place it toward the end of that period, for II Thessalonians was also
          written before the apostle left Corinth. Most likely it was composed
          towards the end of A. D. 52.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          In this letter we behold Paul, the missionary, in the absence of any
          direct controversy, carefully guarding the interest of one of his most
          beloved churches, comforting and encouraging her like a father. He
          strengthens the heart of his persecuted spiritual children with the
          hope of Christ’s return, when the persecutors shall be punished for
          their evil work, and the persecuted saints, both the dead and the
          living, shall receive their eternal reward in the Kingdom of their
          heavenly Lord. And thus the apostle is an example worthy of imitation;
          his lesson is a lesson of permanent value. The glorious parousia of
          Christ is the cheering hope of the militant church in all her
          struggles to the end of time.
        </p>
        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          In the first Epistle to the Thessalonians we distinguish two parts:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Pauls Apologia, 1 Thes 1:1-10, 1 Thes 2:1-20, 1 Thes 3:1-13. The
          letter opens with the usual apostolic blessing and thanksgiving, 1
          Thes 1:1-4. This thanksgiving was called forth by the fact that the
          apostles work in Thessalonica had not been in vain, but had resulted
          in a faith that was spoken of throughout Macedonia and Achaia, 1 Thes
          1:5-10. The writer reminds the readers of his labors among them,
          emphasizing his suffering, good moral behavior, honesty, faithfulness,
          diligence and love, 1 Thes 2:1-12. He thanks God that they had
          received him and his message and had suffered willingly for the cause
          of Christ at the hands of the Jews, and informs them that he had often
          intended to visit them, 1 Thes 2:13-20. His great love to them had
          induced him to send Timothy to establish them and to strengthen them
          in their affliction, 1 Thes 3:1-5; who had now returned and gladdened
          his heart by a report of their steadfastness, 1 Thes 3:6-10. He prays
          that the Lord may strengthen them, 1 Thes 3:11-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Practical Exhortations and Instruction regarding the Parousia, 1
          Thes 4:1-18, 1 Thes 5:1-28. The apostle exhorts the Thessalonians that
          they follow after sanctification, abstaining from fornication and
          fraud, and exercising love, diligence and honesty, 1 Thes 4:1-12. He
          allays their fears respecting the future of those that have died in
          Christ, 1 Thes 4:13-18, and admonishes the Thessalonians in view of
          the sudden coming of Christ to walk as children of the light that they
          may be prepared for the day of Christ’s return, 1 Thes 5:1-11. After
          exhorting the brethren to honor their spiritual leaders, and urging
          them to warn the unruly, to comfort the feeble-minded, to support the
          weak, and to practice all Christian virtues, the apostle closes his
          Epistle by invoking on the Thessalonians the blessing of God, by
          expressing his desire that the Epistle be read to all the brethren,
          and with the usual salutations, 1 Thes 5:12-28.
