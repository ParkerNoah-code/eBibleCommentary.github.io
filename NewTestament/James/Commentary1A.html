              >James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the

          <p>
            <em>To the twelve tribes</em>. When the ten tribes were banished,
            the Assyrian king placed them in different parts. Afterwards, as it
            usually happens in the revolutions of kingdoms (such as then took
            place,) it is very probable that they moved here and there in all
            directions. And the Jews had been scattered almost unto all quarters
            of the world. He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he could not
            personally address, because they had been scattered far and wide.
            But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him,
            the reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had
            already been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so
            much of doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations.
