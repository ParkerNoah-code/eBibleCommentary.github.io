        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Even were it possible for us to perform works absolutely pure, yet one
          sin is sufficient to efface and extinguish all remembrance of former
          righteousness: “Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in
          one point, is guilty of all,” (James 2:10). And since this mortal life
          is never entirely free from the taint of sin, whatever righteousness
          we could acquire would ever and anon be corrupted, overwhelmed, and
          destroyed, by subsequent sins, so that it could not stand the scrutiny
          of God, or be imputed to us for righteousness. In short, whenever we
          treat of the righteousness of works, we must look not to the legal
          work but to the command.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits
          iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked
          man does, should he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done
          will be remembered. In his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his
          sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die." (Ezek 18:24).
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>A. Can that Faith Save Him? (2:14-17)</p>
        <p>
          The apostle argues from the unprofitableness of faith itself without
          works (14), and which he exemplifies in the case of a poor brother or
          sister who are wished well, but nothing given them; which good words,
          without deeds, are of no profit (15-16), so in like manner, faith
          without works is a dead faith (17), nor indeed can it be made out that
          a man has faith, if he has not works.
        </p>
        <p>B. Response and Reiteration (2:18-20)</p>
        <p>
          If he has not works, his faith is a dead faith. He does not have such
          a faith as has justification and salvation connected with it (18); his
          faith, at most, is no better than that of the devils, who are damned
          (19), and that such a faith is a dead faith (20).
        </p>
        <p>C. Explanation: Abraham and Rahb (2:21-26)</p>
        <p>
          That true faith is attended with, and evidenced by works, the apostle
          proves by two instances; the one is that of Abraham, whose faith
          appeared to be genuine, and he to be a justified person, by the works
          he did; particularly by offering up his son Isaac; in which way his
          faith operated, and showed itself to be sincere and hearty; and the
          Scripture was fulfilled that Abraham was a believer; and had
          righteousness imputed to him, and was a friend of God, and a justified
          person (21-24), and the other instance is that of Rahab, whose faith
          was also shown by her works, and so a justified person, by receiving
          the spies with peace, and dismissing them with safety (25), and then
          the apostle explains what he means, by saying more than once, that
          faith without works is dead; which he illustrates by the simile of a
          man's body being dead, without the spirit or soul in it (26).
        </p>
        <h2>James and Paul</h2>
        <p>
          Since Paul and James were inspired by the same Spirit, they cannot be
          said to oppose each other on the doctrine of justification, so that
          one should ascribe justification to faith alone and the other to works
          also. The reconciliation is not difficult, if the design of each be
          considered and the natures of faith and of justification (concerning
          which both treat) be attended:
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul disputes against the Pharisees, who urged the merits of works;
          James disputes against the Libertines and Epicureans, who, content
          with a profession of faith alone, denied not only the merits of works,
          but also their necessity. Against the former, Paul rightly urges faith
          alone for justification. Against the latter, James properly commends
          the necessity of works for the confirmation of justification. Paul
          speaks of a living and efficacious faith; James of an idle and dead
          faith which cannot be demonstrated by works (v. 18); Paul of
          justification a priori and constitutively; James of the same a
          posteriori and declaratively; Paul properly constitutes the former in
          faith alone; James rightly places the latter in works, by which the
          reality of our faith and justification is declared not only before
          men, but also before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, when faith is said “to have wrought with works in Abraham,
          and by works to have been made perfect” (v. 22), this ought to be
          understood in relation to the efficacy of faith, which exerted itself
          by works and by which also it was consummated and made perfect. It
          ought not to be understood essentially, for this it has by its own
          nature (but declaratively) because it is proven to be perfect and
          sincere; just as “the power of God” is said to be “made perfect in our
          weakness” (2 Cor. 12:9), i.e., known and declared to be perfect.
