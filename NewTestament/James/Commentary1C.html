          <em
            >But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to
            all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</em

        </h2>
        <p>
          If you are acquainted with the context, you will at once perceive that
          this verse has a special reference to persons in trouble. Much-tempted
          and severely-tried saints are frequently at their wits’ end, and
          though they may be persuaded that in the end good will come out of all
          their afflictions, yet for the present they may be so distracted as
          not to know what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If any of you lacks wisdom</em>. This text might be peculiarly
          comforting to some of you who are working for God. You cannot work
          long for your heavenly Lord without perceiving that you need a greater
          wisdom than your own. Why, even in directing an inquirer to the cross
          of Christ, simple work as that may seem to be, we shall often discover
          our own inability and folly. In rebuking the backslider, in comforting
          the desponding, in restoring the fallen, in guiding the ignorant, we
          shall need to be taught of God, or else we shall meet with more
          failures than successes. To every honest Christian worker this text
          speaks with all the soft melody of an angel’s whisper. “If any of you
          lack wisdom, let him ask of God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ask God</em>. I beg to caution all of you against stopping short
          of really asking of God. Be not content with asking the pastor, the
          deacons, and elders—God has made many of them wise in helping souls
          out of difficulties. Do not be satisfied with the advice of any man,
          however godly and holy, but go directly to the Lord God of heaven and
          earth, and say unto Him, “Lord, teach Thou me! Show me Your way, O
          God! Teach me in Your truth!”
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not bid to go to any second-hand source of wisdom, but to God
          the only Wise, who alone can direct you. Moreover, remember that there
          is one blessed person of the divine Unity who makes it His special
          office to teach us! Hence, if you go to God for wisdom, you only go
          for that which it is His nature and His office to give. The Holy
          Spirit is given to this end, “He shall teach you all things, and bring
          all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Who gives to all</em>. By <em>all</em>, he means those who ask;
          for they who seek no remedy for their wants, deserve to pine away in
          them. However, this universal declaration, by which every one of us is
          invited to ask, without exception, is very important; hence no man
          ought to deprive himself of so great a privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Liberally</em>. The beggar asks for alms. You are to ask as the
          beggar asks of you in the street, and God will give to you far more
          liberally than you give to the poor. You must confess that you have no
          merit of your own. If you will not acknowledge that, neither will God
          hear your prayers. But come now with the acknowledgment of ignorance,
          with the confession of sin, and believing that God is the rewarder of
          them that diligently seek Him, and He will even now give you the
          wisdom which saves the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Without reproach</em>. This is added, lest any one should fear to
          come too often to God. Those who are the most liberal among men, when
          any one asks often to be helped, mention their former acts of
          kindness, and thus excuse themselves for the future. Hence, a mortal
          man, however open-handed he may be, we are ashamed to weary by asking
          too often. But James reminds us, that there is nothing like this in
          God; for he is ready ever to add new blessings to former ones, without
          any end or limitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>It will be given to him</em>. Do you think God does not mean what
          He says? O sinner, will you add to all your other sins this sin of
          thinking that God would lie? O man, He invites you to ask of Him
          wisdom, and He says He will give it to you. Doubt not the Lord,
          distrust not the veracity of Jehovah, but come at once humbly,
          tremblingly, to the foot of the Savior’s cross.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 6.
          <em
            >But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts
            is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Ask in faith</em>. Faith is a grace that one expression supposes
          and another expressly requires: "Knowing this, that the trial of your
          faith" (James 1:3); and; "Let him ask in faith" (James 1:6). There
          must be a sound believing of the great truths of Christianity, and a
          resolute cleaving to them, in times of trial. That faith which is
          spoken of here as tried by afflictions consists in a belief of the
          power, and word, and promise of God, and in fidelity and constancy to
          the Lord Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Without any doubting</em>. This principle, then, we hold, that our
          prayers are not heard by the Lord, except when we have a confidence
          that we shall obtain. The case is the same as with a tree, which has
          struck firm roots; it shakes, indeed, through the blowing of the wind,
          but is not rooted up; on the contrary, it remains firm in its own
          place. Through the infirmity of our flesh we are tossed by various
          temptations, so that no one is found who does not vacillate and
          tremble according to the feeling of his flesh; but temptations of this
          kind are at length to be overcome by faith.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 7.
          <em
            >For that man shouldn’t think that he will receive anything from the
            Lord.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          If a man asks of God riches, that is not what He has promised to give.
          If he asks of God good health, that may be granted to him, but still,
          the promise is concerning wisdom, and that is what the man needs,
          therefore, let him with all his heart pray, “Lord, give me wisdom.” I
          think our prayers would succeed much better if we were not so wavering
          about what it is that we really require, and if we were not dubious as
          to whether God could give us that very thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is wisdom that you need, it will be essential, when you ask for
          that wisdom, that you decidedly believe that this Book, through which
          God teaches us wisdom, is really inspired, so that what it teaches is
          distinctly and unquestionably true—and is received by you as the
          utterance of infallibility. Ask of God in the full belief that it is
          so, or else I do not see how you can pray to be guided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the Author of the Bible is prepared to teach you concerning
          the things which are written in this Book, and it is essential, when
          you ask for wisdom, that you should believe that the Holy Spirit is
          able to enlighten you and is willing to instruct you concerning those
          things which now perplex you. Go, then, to God in prayer, believing in
          His Word and believing in His Holy Spirit.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 8. <em>He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>He is a double-minded man</em>. The man of a double mind here is
          the man who hesitates between faith and unbelief, because faith is the
          subject of the passage. When again used, in James 4:8, it means a
          hesitation between God and the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This verse follows as the conclusion of the preceding doctrine; and
          thus there is an implied contrast between the simplicity or liberality
          of God, mentioned before, and the double-mindedness of man. He then
          says that the unbelieving and doubting are unstable; because they are
          never firm or fixed, but at one time they swell with the confidence of
          the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of despair.
