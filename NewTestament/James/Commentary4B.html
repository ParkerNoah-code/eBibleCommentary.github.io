          <h2>
            Ver 18.
            <em
              >Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me
              your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my
              works.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.”</em> It
            is the same as though he had said, "Thou hast faith only, I have
            also works in addition to my faith; now, prove to me that you have
            true faith without having works connected with it (which was
            impossible, hence he is called a 'vain man,' or empty-headed, in
            2:20), and I will prove my faith by its fruits, even good works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Show me your faith without works</em>. If you can, see what
            ways, means, and methods you can make use of to make it appear to
            me, or any other, that you have the faith you talk of. These words,
            though spoken rightly, are a sort of sarcasm and jeer upon the man,
            calling upon him to do that which is impossible to do, and thereby
            exposing his vain boast; for faith is an inward principle in the
            heart. It is a hidden thing and cannot be seen and known but by
            external acts. Where it is right, it is operative, and shows itself
            by works, which is not practicable in those who have none.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>I will show you my faith by my works</em>. There may be indeed
            an appearance of good works, where there is no faith, as in the
            Heathens, in the Scribes and Pharisees, and in the Papists, and
            others; and on the other hand, there may be the principle of faith
            implanted, where there is not an opportunity of showing it by a
            series of good works, or a course of godly living, as in elect
            infants dying in infancy, and in those who are converted in their
            last moments, as the thief upon the cross; wherefore works are not
            infallible proofs and evidences of faith, yet they are the best we
            are capable of giving of it to men, or they of receiving. In short,
            works may deceive, and do not infallibly prove truth of faith, yet
            it is certain, that where they are not, but persons live in a
            continued course of sinning, there cannot be true faith.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 19.
            <em
              >You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also
              believe—and shudder.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            From this one sentence it appears evident that the whole dispute is
            not about faith as the term is usually used, but of the common
            knowledge of God, which can no more connect man with God, than the
            sight of the sun can carry him up to heaven; but it is certain that
            by faith we come nigh to God. Besides, it would be ridiculous were
            any one to say, that the devils have faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>You believe that God is one</em>. These words are a continuation
            of the address of the man that has no works and yet boasts of his
            faith. He points out that a main article of the faith, that there is
            one God in the Christian sense, is indeed held in some way by the
            man. He believes things relating to God: that there are three
            persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, and that these three are the one
            God; of God the Father, his being and perfections, of Christ, as
            God, and the Son of God, and the Messiah, and to the Holy Spirit and
            to believe all this is right. But to believe there is one God, is
            not merely to give into this article, in opposition to the
            polytheism of the Gentiles, or barely to confess the God of Israel,
            as believed on by the Jews. For, as he will point out, the demons
            believe these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>You do well</em>. For that there is but one God, is to be proved
            by the light of nature, and from the works of creation and
            providence, and has been owned by the wisest of the Heathens
            themselves; and is established, by divine revelation, in the books
            both of the Old and of the New Testament; what has been received by
            the Jews, and is well known by Christians, to whom it is set in the
            clearest light, and who are assured of the truth of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The demons also believe</em>. They believe the same truth; they
            know and believe there is but one God, and not many; and they know
            that the God of Israel is He; and that the Father, Son, and Spirit,
            are the one God; they know and believe him to be the most high God,
            whose servants are the ministers of the Gospel; and they know and
            believe that Jesus is the Holy One of God, the Son of God, and the
            Messiah (Acts 16:17).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And shudder</em>. They tremble at the wrath of God, which they
            now feel, and at the thought of future torments, which they expect
            (Mk 5:7), and which is more than some men do; and yet these shall
            not be saved, their damnation is certain and inevitable (2 Pet 2:4),
            wherefore it follows, that a bare historical faith will not profit,
            and cannot save any; a man may have all faith of this kind, and be
            damned; and therefore it is not to be boasted of, nor trusted to.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 20.
            <em
              >But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is
              dead?</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>But do you want to know</em>. These are the words of the apostle
            resuming the argument, that faith without works is dead, useless,
            and unprofitable for the man that boasts of his faith, and has no
            works to show it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vain man</em>. He calls him a "vain man," meaning an empty one,
            a sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal; empty vessels make the
            greatest sound. Such are proud boasters, vainly puffed up by their
            fleshly mind, but are empty of the true saving knowledge of God, and
            of the faith of Christ, and of the grace of the Spirit. Such a one
            betrays his ignorance in spiritual things by his conceit and vain
            triflings of faith without works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That faith apart from works is dead?</em>. We must understand
            the state of the question, for the dispute here is not respecting
            the cause of justification, but only what avails a profession of
            faith without works, and what opinion we are to form of it. Absurdly
            then do they act who strive to prove by this passage that man is
            justified by works, because James meant no such thing, for the
            proofs which he subjoins refer to this declaration, that no faith,
            or only a dead faith, is without works. No one will ever understand
            what is said, nor judge wisely of words, except he who keeps in view
            the design of the writer.
