          </h2>
          <p>
            We must understand the state of the question, for the dispute here
            is not respecting the cause of justification, but only what avails a
            profession of faith without works, and what opinion we are to form
            of it. It would be absurd to try to prove by this passage that man
            is justified in a legal sense by works, because James meant no such
            thing. For the proofs which he subjoins refer to this declaration,
            that no faith, or only a dead faith, is without works. No one will
            ever understand what is said, nor judge wisely of words, except he
            who keeps in view the design of the writer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Justified</em>. We must take notice of the two fold meaning of
            the word justified. Paul means by it the gratuitous imputation of
            righteousness before the tribunal of God; and James, the
            manifestation of righteousness by the conduct, and that before men,
            as we may gather from the preceding words, "Show to me thy faith,"
            etc. In this sense we fully allow that man is justified by works, as
            when any one says that a man is enriched by the purchase of a large
            and valuable chest, because his riches, before hid, shut up in a
            chest, were thus made known.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works</em>? Not as the
            causes of his justification (see Rom 4:2), but as effects of it,
            showing the truth of his faith, and the reality of his
            justification: he had both faith and works, and the former were
            known by the latter; and even the faith which he had expressed years
            ago was manifested, demonstrated, and confirmed to be true and
            genuine, by the instance of his obedience to God, here produced; by
            which it appeared he was a true believer, a justified person,
            approved of God, and loved by him. Now if this was the case of
            Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, yea, the father of the
            faithful, of all that believe, he is, and must be a vain man, that
            talks of faith without works; and his faith must be a dead one, and
            he be very unlike the father of them that believe.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar</em>. For when
            he was bid to take his son, his only and beloved son, Isaac, and
            offer him up on one of the mountains, that should be shown him, he
            made haste to do it; he provided everything for it; he split the
            wood, and carried it with him, and fire in his hand; he built an
            altar, laid the wood on it, bound his son, laid the wood on the
            altar, and his son on the wood, and stretched out his hand, with his
            knife in it, to slay him; so that it was all one, with respect to
            his intention and will, as if he had actually offered him, and was a
            full trial and proof of his obedience to God.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was not the only act of obedience, or good work, which he
            performed; but this being a very eminent one, the apostle instances
            in it, as a very considerable evidence of his faith in God, and love
            to him; and which showed him to be a justified person, as he was
            long before he performed this action, even before Isaac was born;
            see Genesis 15:6 and therefore it can never be the apostle's
            meaning, that he was justified before God by this, or any other good
            work or works, as cause or causes of it; but only that he was
            declared to be so; or, in other words, that his faith was attended
            with good works, and evidenced by them.
