        <p>
          <em>Blessed is a person who endures temptation</em>. Or affliction,
          which is designed by temptation, as in James 1:2 and the man that
          endures it is he that so bears it, and bears up under it, as not to be
          offended at it, and stumble in the ways of Christ, and fall away from
          the truth, and a profession of it, as temporary believers in a time of
          temptation do; but manfully and bravely stands up under it, and does
          not sink under the weight of it, or faint on account of it; and
          endures afflictions in such manner as not to murmur and repine at
          them, but is quiet and still, and bears them patiently and constantly,
          and so endures to the end. Such expect afflictions, and when they
          come, they are not moved by them, but, notwithstanding them, continue
          in the ways and work of the Lord; and such are happy persons; they are
          happy now, and shall be hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saints are happy under afflictions, and even on account of them, for
          they are tokens of God's love to them, and evidences of their sonship;
          and especially they are happy under them, when they enjoy the presence
          of God in them, when they are instructive to them, and are saner,
          lifted, when they learn from them the useful lessons of faith,
          patience, humility, and resignation to the will of God, and are made
          more partakers of his holiness;
        </p>
        <p>
          For when he is tried; by the fire of afflictions, as gold is tried in
          the fire; when God hereby has tried what is in his heart, and the
          truth of grace in him, as faith, love, patience and the like, and has
          purged away his dross and tin, and has refined and purified him, as
          gold and silver are refined and purified in the furnace, or refining
          pot: and when being thus tried and proved, and found genuine, and
          comes forth as gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>For when he has been approved</em>. We cannot say that we are
          blessed till our graces have been tried and proved, and when they have
          been tried and proved, and we have endured the test in God’s great
          proof-house, then are we blessed, but not till then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a man who has received a file of what looks to be bank notes,
          and he thinks he is very rich. Have you tried to pass one of them?
          Have you taken one of them to a bank? No, poor fool! He does not wish
          to have his fine fortune tried, he is angry when you suggest a doubt.
          And yet his wealth is mere fiction, those flimsy papers are bank notes
          of the Bank of Elegance, and if he were to attempt to pass them, he
          might rather be suspected to be a thief, than be judged to be a rich
          man. Much faith in this world is no better than that, and he is not
          blessed, but blinded, that possesses it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is blessed who has tried his faith, who has gone to God with a
          promise, and received an answer to his prayer. He is blessed who has
          had his faith tried, who, having been put into the furnace has by that
          faith in God been made to walk safely amid the flaming coals, and to
          come out unharmed. Untried faith is questionable faith. Is it faith at
          all? Was there ever in this world a believer altogether without
          trouble, or a grain of faith which had undergone no trial?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>He will receive the crown of life</em>. Of course the allusion is
          to the Grecian games. See how the man runs! Every muscle is strained.
          There is not a part of his body but what is violently exercised. He
          tries to pass his fellows. He flies to the goal; he reaches it, and
          then he receives a crown. A crown of laurel, or of ivy, or, perhaps,
          of parsley, was put upon his head. For the crown follows the contest.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, then, it be our chief happiness to be crowned in the kingdom of
          God, it follows, that the contests with which the Lord tries us, are
          aids and helps to our happiness. Thus the argument is from the end or
          the effect: hence we conclude, that the faithful are harassed by so
          many evils for this purpose, that their piety and obedience may be
          made manifest, and that they may be thus at length prepared to receive
          the crown of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a crown of glory that fadeth not away, an incorruptible one; and
          differs from the corruptible crown given to the victors in the above
          mentioned games, which were made of fading herbs, and leaves of trees:
          and now the man that bears up under afflictions, and holds out unto
          the end, shall have this crown put upon him, and he shall "receive
          it"; not as merited by him, by his works or sufferings, for neither of
          them are worthy to be compared or mentioned with this crown of life
          and glory; but as the free gift of God, as it will be given him by the
          righteous Judge, as a reward of grace, and not of debt
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Which the Lord promised</em>. This promise he made before the
          world was, who cannot lie, nor deceive, and who is able to perform,
          and is faithful, and will never suffer his faithfulness to fail (see
          James 2:5); so that this happiness is certain, and may be depended
          upon: besides, the promise of this crown of life is in Christ, where
          all the promises are yea and amen; yea, the crown itself is in his
          hands, where it lies safe and secure for "them that love him"; either
          the Lord Jesus Christ, his person, his people, his truths, and
          ordinances, and his glorious appearing (2 Tim 4:8) or God the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>To those who love him</em>. Not that their love is the cause of
          this crown of life, or eternal life, for then it would not be the free
          gift of God, as it is said to be; nor of the promise of it, for that
          was made before the world was, and when they had no love unto him; but
          this phrase is descriptive of the persons to whom God manifests his
          love now, admits to near communion and fellowship with himself, makes
          all things, even their afflictions, to work for their good.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then reminds us that the conquerors of all temptations are those
          who love God, and that we fail when we are tried, for no other cause
          than because the love of the world prevails in us.
