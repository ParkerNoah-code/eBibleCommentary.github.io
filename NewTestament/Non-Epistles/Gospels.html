        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>THE TITLE OF THE GOSPELS</h2>
        <p>
          The shortest form of the title is κατὰ Ματθᾶιον, κατὰ Μάρχον, etc. The
          Textus Receptus and some of the Mnn. have τὸ κατὰ Ματθᾶιον
          εὐανγγέλιον; but the greater part of the Mjj. read εὐανγγέλιον κατὰ
          Ματθᾶιον, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word εὐανγγέλιον passed through three stages in the history of its
          use. In the older Greek authors it signified a reward for bringing
          good tidings; also, a thank offering for good tidings brought. Next in
          later Greek it indicated the good news itself. And finally it was
          employed to denote the books in which the gospel of Jesus Christ is
          presented historic form. It is used very extensively in the New
          Testament, and always in the second sense, signifying the good news of
          God, the message of salvation. This meaning is also retained in the
          title of the gospels. The first trace of the word as indicating a
          written gospel is found in the didache, the Teaching of the Twelve
          Apostles, discovered in 1873 and in all probability composed between
          the years 90 and 100 A. D. This contains the following exhortation in
          15:3: “And reprove one another not in wrath but in peace, as ye have
          it in the Gospel. Here the word ευανγγελιον evidently refers to a
          written record. It is very explicitly and repeatedly applied to a
          written account of the life of Christ about the middle of the second
          century. The plural euanggelia, signifying the four Gospels, is first
          found in Justin Martyr, about 152 A. D.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expression κατὰ Ματθᾶιον, κατὰ Μάρχον, etc., has often been
          misinterpreted. Some maintained that κατὰ simply indicated a genitive
          relation so that we should read: the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of
          Mark, etc. But if this is the idea intended, why was not the simple
          genitive used, just as it is employed by Paul, when he expresses a
          similar idea, τὸ εὐανγγέλιὸν μου, Rom_2:16; Rom_16:25? Moreover, it
          cannot be maintained that the preposition kata is equivalent to the
          Hebrew Lamed of possession, for the Septuagint never renders this by
          κατὰ. Others inferred from the use of this expression that the Gospels
          were not written by the person named but were shaped after the Gospel
          as they preached it. But on this interpretation it seems very peculiar
          that the second and third Gospels were not called κατὰ Πέτρον and κατὰ
          Παῦλον, seeing that they were fashioned after their type of preaching.
          The expression must be explained from the Church’s consciousness that
          there is but one Gospel of Jesus Christ, and indicates that in these
          writings we have that Gospel, as ti was shaped (i. e. in writing) by
          the persons whose names they bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the early Church caught the idea of the unity of the Gospel is
          quite evident. It is true, the plural of ευανγγελιον is sometimes
          employed, but the singular prevails. Justin Martyr speaks of the
          Memoirs that are called Gospels, but he also expresses himself thus:
          “the precepts in what is called the Gospel,” “it is written in the
          Gospel.” Irenaeus in one of his writings states his theme as: “The
          Gospel is essentially fourfold.” Clement of Alexandria speaks of “the
          Law, the Prophets and the Gospel,” and Augustine, of “the four
          Gospels, or rather, the four books of the one Gospel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The English word Gospel is derived from the Anglo Saxon godspell,
          composed of god=God and spel=story, thus indicating the story of the
          life of God in human flesh. It is not improbable, however, that the
          original form of the Anglo-Saxon word was godspell, from god=good and
          spel=story, this being a literal translation of the Greek εὐανγγέλιον.
          It denotes the good tidings of salvation in Christ for a perishing
          world.
        </p>
        <h2>THE NUMBER OF THE GOSPELS RECOGNIZED BY THE EARLY CHURCH</h2>
        <p>
          In view of the fact that the first Christian century produced many
          Gospels besides those which are included in our canon, and that many
          at the present day deny the authority of some or all of our Gospels,
          it is important to know, how many the early Church received as
          canonic. The apostolic fathers, though often quoting the Gospels do
          not mention their authors, nor do they enumerate them. They testify to
          the substance and canonicity of the Gospels therefore, but not, except
          indirectly, to their authenticity and number. In all probability the
          earliest evidence that the Church of the first ages accepted the four
          Gospels that we now possess as canonic, is furnished by the Peshito,
          which most likely dates from the first half of the second century. And
          being a translation, it points to the fact that even before its origin
          our four Gospels were received into the canon, while all others were
          left out. Another early witness is found in the Muratorian Fragment, a
          mutilated work of which the real character cannot now be determined,
          and that was probably written about 170 A. D. It commences with the
          last words of a sentence that seemingly belongs to a description of
          Marks Gospel, and then tells us that “Luke’s Gospel stands third in
          order, having been written by Luke, the physician, the companion of
          Paul.” After making this statement it proceeds to assign the fourth
          place to “the Gospel of John, a disciple of the Lord.” The conclusion
          seems perfectly warranted that the first two Gospels, of which the
          description is lost, are those of Matthew and Mark. An important
          witness, really the first one to a fourfold Gospel, i. e. to a Gospel
          that is four and yet is one, is Tatian, the Assyrian. His Diatessaron
          was the first harmony of the Gospels. The exact date of its
          composition is not known; the meaning of its name is obviously [the
          Gospel ]by the Four. This, no doubt, points to the fact that it was
          based on four Gospels, and also implies that these four were our
          canonical Gospels, since they constituted the only collection in
          existence that needed no other description than “the Four.” The
          testimony of Eusebius is in harmony with this when he says “Tatian,
          the former leader of the Encratites, having put together in some
          strange fashion a combination and collection of the Gospels, gave it
          the name of the Diatessaron, and the work is still partially current.”
          Church History, IV, 29. Very important testimony to our four Gospels
          is found in the writings of Irenaeus (c. 120-200) and of Tertullian
          (c. 150-130). The former was a disciple of Polycarp, who in turn had
          enjoyed the personal instruction of the apostle John. He preached the
          Gospel to the Gauls and in 178 succeeded Pothinus as bishop of Lyons.
          In one of his books he has a long chapter entitled: “Proofs that there
          can be neither more nor fewer than four Evangelists.” Looking at the
          Gospels as a unit, he called them “the Gospel with four Faces.” And he
          searched to find mystic reasons for this quadruple form, thus showing
          how strongly he and his age were persuaded that there were but four
          canonical Gospels. He compares the quadriform Gospel (τετράμορφον) to
          the four regions of the earth, to the four universal spirits, to the
          cherubim with four faces, etc. The testimony of Tertullian is equally
          explicit. This famous church father received a liberal education at
          Rome, lived on in heathen darkness until about his thirtieth or
          fortieth year, when he was converted and entered the ministry.
          Embittered by the treatment he received at the hands of the Church, he
          went into the fold of the Montanists about the beginning of the third
          century. He wrote numerous works in defense of the Christian religion.
          In his work against Marcion he says, after stating that the Gospel of
          Luke had been maintained from its first publication: “The same
          authority of the apostolic churches will uphold the other Gospels
          which we have in due succession through them and according to their
          usage, I mean those of [the apostles] Matthew and John; although that
          which was published by Mark may also be maintained to be Peters, whose
          interpreter Mark was: for the narrative of Luke also is generally
          ascribed to Paul: since it is allowable that that which scholars
          publish should be regarded as their masters work.” Just as those that
          went before him Tertullian appealed to the testimony of antiquity as
          proving the canonicity of our four Gospels and the other Scriptural
          books; and his appeal was never gainsaid. Another significant
          testimony is that of Origin, the great teacher of Alexandria of whom
          Eusebius records that in the first book of his commentaries on the
          Gospel of Matthew he asserts that he knows of only four Gospels, as
          follows: “I have learnt by tradition concerning the four Gospels,
          which alone are uncontroverted in the Church of God spread under
          heaven, that according to Matthew, who was once a publican but
          afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, was written first; . . . that
          according to Mark second; . . . that according to Luke third; . . .
          that according to John last of all.” Church History VI, 25. Eusebius
          himself, who was the first historian of the Christian Church, in
          giving a catalogue of the New Testament writings, says: “First then we
          must place the holy quaternion of the Gospels.”
        </p>
        <p>
          From the testimony which we have now reviewed the conclusion seems
          perfectly warranted that the Church from the earliest times knew four
          and only four canonical Gospels; and that these four are the same that
          she has recognized ever since. It is true that the heretic Marcion
          acknowledged only the Gospel of Luke, and this in mutilated form, but
          his attitude toward the Gospels finds a ready explanation in his
          dogmatic bias.
        </p>
        <h2>THE LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE GOSPELS.</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospels have a literary character all their own; they are sui
          generIsa. There is not another book or group of books in the Bible to
          which they can be compared. They are four and yet one in a very
          essential sense; they express four sides of the one εὐαγγέλιον of
          Jesus Christ. In studying them the question naturally arises, how we
          must conceive of them. Now we need not argue that they are not mere
          collections of myths and fables, with or without a historical basis,
          as many Rationalists would have us believe. Nor is it necessary to
          show at length that they are not four biographies of Jesus. If their
          authors intended them to be such, they would be very disappointing
          indeed. There is, however, another misconception against which we must
          warn, because it is quite prevalent in the circles of those who accept
          these writings unquestionably as a part of the Word of God, and since
          it is a positive hindrance to a true understanding of these priceless
          records. We refer to the conviction that the writers of the Gospels
          were minded to prepare for following generations more or less complete
          histories of the life of Christ. In reading these writings we soon
          find that, looked at as histories, they leave a great deal to be
          desired. In the first place they tell us comparatively little of that
          rich and varied life of Christ, of which they knew so much, Cf.
          Joh_20:30; Joh_21:25. The historical facts narrated by John only
          represent the work of a few days. His Gospel would thus be a life of
          Jesus with yawning gaps. The same is true of the other Gospels. In the
          second place the materials, except those at the beginning and at the
          end of Christ’s life are not arranged in chronological order. Any
          possible doubt that we may have on this point is soon dispelled, when
          we compare the Gospels. The same facts are often narrated in
          altogether different connections. Closely allied with this is a third
          feature that deserves attention. The casual relation of the important
          events that are narrated is not traced, except in a few instances, and
          yet this just what one expects in histories. And finally if they were
          really meant to be histories, why was it necessary that we should have
          four of them?
        </p>
        <p>
          The harmonists generally proceeded on the erroneous conception to
          which we refer. They were aware indeed that there were great lacunae
          in all the Gospels, but thought they might remedy matters by supplying
          from one Gospel what was wanting in the other. Thus the relation of
          the Gospels to one another was conceived of as supplemental. But their
          work was doomed to failure; it did violence to the exquisite
          compositions on which they operated, and marred the characteristic
          beauty of those literary productions. They were always uncertain as;
          to the true order of events, and did not know which one of the
          evangelists was the best chronological guide. Some preferred Matthew,
          others chose Mark, and still others followed Luke. And after all their
          efforts to combine the four Gospels into one continuous narrative with
          the facts arranged in the exact order in which they occurred, their
          work must be pronounced a failure. The Gospels are not histories of
          the life of Christ, nor do they, taken together, form one history.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what are they, if they are neither biographies nor histories? They
          are four pen-pictures, or better, a four fold portraiture of the
          Saviour a fourfold representation of the apostolic κήρυγμα; fourfold
          witness regarding our Lord. It is said that the great artist Van Dyke
          prepared a threefold portrait of Charles I for the sculptor, that the
          latter might fashion an absolutely faithful likeness of the king.
          These three portraits were necessary; their differences and agreements
          were all required to give a true representation of the monarch. So it
          is in the case of the Gospels. Each one of them gives us a certain
          view of the Lord, and only the four taken together present to us his
          perfect likeness, revealing him as the Saviour of the world. The
          apostolic χήρυγμα had taken a wide flight. Its central content was the
          cross and the resurrection. But in connection with this the words and
          deeds of the Saviour and his history also formed the subject of the
          apostles preaching. And when this apostolic χηρυγμα was reduced to
          writing, it was found necessary to give it a fourfold form, that it
          might answer to the needs of four classes of people viz. to those of
          the Jews, to those of the Romans, to those of the Greeks and to those
          of the people who confessed Christ as Lord; needs that were typical of
          the spiritual requirements of all future ages. Matthew wrote for the
          Jews and characterized Christ as the great King of the house of David.
          Mark composed his Gospel for the Romans and pictured the Saviour as
          the mighty Worker, triumphing over sin and evil. Luke in writing his
          Gospel had in mind the needs of the Greeks and portrayed Christ as the
          perfect man, the universal Saviour. And John, composing his Gospel for
          those who already had a saving knowledge of the Lord and stood in need
          of a more profound understanding of the essential character of Jesus,
          emphasized the divinity of Christ, the glory that was manifested in
          his works. Each Gospel is complete in itself and acquaints us with a
          certain aspect of the Lords life. Yet it is only the fourfold Gospel
          that furnishes us with a complete, a perfect image of him whom to know
          is life eternal. And it is only, when we grasp the different features
          that are mirrored in the Gospels and see how they blend harmoniously
          in that noblest of all lives, the life of Christ, that we have found
          the true harmony of the Gospels.
        </p>
        <h2>THE SYNOPTIC PROBLEM.</h2>
        <p>
          The first three Gospels are known as the Synoptics, and their authors
          are called the Synoptists. The name is derived from the Greek σύν and
          ὄψις, and is applied to these Gospels, since they, as distinguished
          from the fourth, give us a common view of the life of our Lord. But
          notwithstanding the great similarity by which these Gospels are
          characterized, they also reveal very striking differences. This
          remarkable agreement on the one hand, and these manifest
          dissimilarities on the other, constitute one of the most difficult
          literary problems of the New Testament. The question is, whether we
          can account for the origin of these Gospels in such a manner that we
          can explain both the close resemblances and the often surprising
          differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place the general plan of these Gospels exhibits a
          remarkable agreement. Only Matthew and Luke contain a narrative of the
          infancy of our Lord and their accounts of it are quite distinct; but
          the history of Christ’s public ministry follows very much the same
          order in all the Synoptics. They treat successively of the Lords
          preparation for the ministry, John the Baptist, the baptism, the
          temptation, the return to Galilee, the preaching in its villages and
          cities, the journey to Jerusalem, the entrance into the Holy City, the
          preaching there, the passion and the resurrection. The details that
          fit into this general plan are also arranged in quite a uniform
          manner, except in some places, especially of the first Gospel. The
          most striking differences in the arrangement of the material results
          from the narrative of a long series of events connected with the
          Galilean ministry, which is peculiar to Matthew and Mark,
          Mat_14:21-36, Mat_15:1-39, Mat_16:1-12; Mar_6:45-56, Mar_7:1-37,
          Mar_8:1-26; and from the history of another series of events related
          to the journey to Jerusalem that is found only in Luk_9:51-62,
          Luk_10:1-42, Luk_11:1-54, Luk_12:1-59, Luk_13:1-35, Luk_14:1-35,
          Luk_15:1-32, Luk_16:1-31, Luk_17:1-37, Luk_18:1-14.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is not only similarity in the broad outlines of those
          Gospels; the particular incidents that are narrated are also in many
          cases the same in substance and similar if not identical in form. The
          amount of agreement that we find in this respect is represented by
          Norton, Genuineness of the Gospels p. 373, and by Westcott,
          Introduction to the Study of the Gospels p. 201, in the following
          manner: If the total contents of the Gospel is represented by 100, the
          following result is obtained: Mark has 7 peculiarities and—93
          coincidences Matthew has 42 peculiarities and—58 coincidences Luke has
          59 peculiarities and—41 coincidences If the extent of all the
          coincidences be represented by 100 their proportionate distribution
          will be: Matthew, Mark and Luke 53 Matthew and Luke 21 Matthew and
          Mark 20 Mark and Luke 6 Still another estimate, viz, that by verses,
          is suggested by Reuss, History of the New Testament, I p. 177: Matthew
          out of a total of 971 verses has 330 peculiar to him. Mark out of a
          total of 478 verses has 68 peculiar to him. Luke out of a total of
          1151 verses has 541 peculiar to him. The first two have 170 to 180
          verses that are lacking in Luke; Matthew and Luke, 230 to 240 wanting
          in Mark; Mark and Luke about 50 wanting in Matthew. The number common
          to all three is 330 to 370.
        </p>
        <p>
          The preceding statements refer to the subject-matter of the Synoptics.
          Taken by itself this might give us an exaggerated idea of the
          similarity of these Gospels. As a corrective it is necessary to bear
          in mind that the verbal coincidences, though they are remarkable
          indeed, are nevertheless considerably less than one would expect. Dr.
          Schaff and his son, after some calculations based on Rushbrookes
          Synopticon, get the following results: “The proportion of words
          peculiar to the Synoptics is 28,000 out of 48,000, more than one-half.
          In Matthew 56 words out of every 100 are peculiar. In Mark 40 words
          out of every 100 are peculiar. In Luke 67 words out of every 100 are
          peculiar. The number of coincidences common to all three is less than
          the number of divergences. Matthew agrees with the other two gospels
          in 1 word out of 7. Mark agrees with the other two gospels in 1 word
          out of 4½. Luke agrees with the other two gospels in 1 word out of
          8.But comparing the Gospels two by two, it is evident that Matthew and
          Mark have most in common, and Matthew and Luke are most divergent.
          One-half of Mark is found in Matthew. One-fourth of Luke is found in
          Matthew. One-third of Mark is found in Luke. The general conclusion
          from these figures is that all three Gospels widely diverge from the
          common matter, or triple tradition, Mark the least so and Luke the
          most (almost twice as much as Mark). On the other hand, both Matthew
          and Luke are nearer Mark than Luke and Matthew to each other.” Church

        <p>
          In connection with the preceding we should bear in mind that these
          verbal agreements are greatest, not in the narrative, but in the
          recitative parts of the Gospels. About one fifth of them is found in
          the narrative portion of the Gospel, and four fifths in the recital of
          the words of our Lord and others. This statement will create a false
          impression, however, unless we bear in mind the proportion in which
          the narrative parts stand to the recitative element, which is as
          follows: Narrative Recitative Matthew 25 75 Mark 50 Luke 34 66. From
          what has now been said it is perfectly clear that the Synoptics
          present an intricate literary problem. Is it possible to explain the
          origin in such a manner that both the resemblances and differences are
          accounted for? During the last century many scholars have applied
          themselves with painstaking diligence to the arduous task of solving
          this problem. The solution has been sought along different lines;
          several hypotheses have been broached, of which we shall name only the
          four most important ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place there is what has been called (though not
          altogether correctly) ~the mutual dependance theory
          (Benutzungshypothese, Augustine, Bengel, Bleek, Storr). According to
          this theory the one Gospel is dependent on the other, so that the
          second borrowed from the first and the third from both the first and
          the second. On this theory, of course, six permutations are possible
          viz.: Matthew, Mark, Luke. Matthew, Luke, Mark. Mark, Matthew, Luke.
          Mark, Luke, Matthew. Luke, Matthew, Mark. Luke, Mark, Matthew. In
          every possible form this theory has found defenders, but it does not
          meet with great favor at present. True, it seems to account for the
          general agreement in a very simple manner but serious difficulties
          arise when one seeks to determine which one of the Gospels was first,
          which second and which third. This is perfectly evident from the
          difference of opinion among the adherents of this hypothesIsa. Again
          it fails to account for the divergencies; it does not explain why one
          writer adopts the language of his predecessor(s) up to a certain
          point, and then suddenly abandons it. Of late it is tacitly admitted,
          however, that it does contain an element of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second place the hypothesis of oral tradition
          (Traditions-hypothese, Gieseler, Westcott, Wright), should be
          mentioned. This theory starts from the supposition that the Gospel
          existed first of all in an unwritten form. It is assumed that the
          apostles repeatedly told the story of Christ’s life, dwelling
          especially on the most important incidents of his career, and often
          reiterating the very words of their blessed Lord. These narratives and
          words were eagerly caught up by willing ears and treasured in faithful
          and retentive memories, the Jews making it a practice to retain
          whatever they learnt in the exact form in which they received it. Thus
          a stereotyped tradition arose which served as the basis for our
          present Gospels. Several objections have been urged against this
          theory. It is said that, as a result of the apostles preaching in the
          vernacular, the oral tradition was embodied in the Aramaic language,
          and hence cannot account for the verbal coincidences in the Greek
          Gospels. Again it is urged that the more stereotyped the tradition
          was, the harder it becomes to account for the differences between the
          Synoptics. Would anyone be apt to alter such a tradition on his own
          authority? Moreover this hypothesis offers no explanation of the
          existence of the two-fold, the triple and the double tradition, i. e.
          the tradition that is embodied in all three of the Gospels and that
          which is found only in two of them. The majority of scholars have now
          abandoned this theory, although it has ardent defenders even at
          present. And no doubt, it must be taken into account in the solution
          of this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third place we have the hypothesis of one primitive Gospel
          (Urevangeliums-Hypothese) from which all three of the Synoptists drew
          their material. According to G. E. Lessing this Gospel, containing a
          short account of the life of Jesus for the use of traveling
          missionaries, was written in the popular language of Palestine.
          Eichhorn, however, following him, held that it was translated into
          Greek, worked over and enriched in various ways, and soon took shape
          in several redactions, which became the source of our present Gospels.
          There is very little agreement among, the defenders of this theory
          regarding the exact character of this original source. At present it
          finds little favor in scientific circles, but has been discarded for
          various reasons. There is absolutely no trace of such an original
          Gospel, nor any historical reference to it, which seems peculiar in
          view of its unique significance. And if the existence of such a source
          be postulated, how must the arbitrary alteration of it be explained,
          how did these different recensions come into existence. It is evident
          that by this theory the problem is not solved, but simply shifted to
          another place. Moreover while in its original form this hypothesis
          accounted very well for the agreement, but not for the differences
          found in the Synoptics, in its final form it was too artificial and
          too complicated to inspire confidence and to seem anything like a
          natural solution of the Synoptic problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fourth place the so-called double source, or two document
          theory (Combinations-hypothese, Weisse, Wilke, Holtzmann, Wendt)
          deserves mention since it is the favorite theory of New Testament
          scholars today. This hypothesis holds that, in order to explain the
          phenomena of the Gospels, it is necessary to postulate the existence
          of at least two primitive documents, and recognizes the use of one
          Gospel in the composition of the others. The form in which this theory
          is most widely accepted at present is the following: The Gospel of
          Mark was the first one to be written and, either in the form in which
          we now have it, or in a slightly different form was the source of the
          triple tradition. For the double tradition, which is common to Matthew
          and Luke, these writers used a second source that, for want of
          definite knowledge regarding it, is simply called Q (from the German
          Quelle). This Q may have been the λόγια of Matthew mentioned by
          Papias, and was probably a collection of the sayings of our Lord. The
          differences between Matthew and Luke in the matter of the double
          tradition finds its explanation in the assumption that, while Matthew
          drew directly from Q, Luke derived the corresponding matter from Q and
          other sources, or from a primitive Gospel based on Q. On the last
          supposition the relation of Matthew and Luke to Q would be as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          But even so the use of some inferior sources by both Matthew and Luke
          must be assumed. The double source theory presupposes the existence of
          a rather large precanonical literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some evident objections to this theory also. The assumption
          that the λόγια of Matthew was anything else than the Hebrew or Aramaic
          original of our Greek Matthew is a baseless supposition; it has no
          historical foundation whatever. Furthermore the theory offers no
          explanation of the fact that the writers in some cases faithfully
          copied their original and in others altered the text rather freely or
          even departed from it entirely. And by postulating the development of
          a somewhat extensive Gospel literature previous to the composition of
          Matthew and Luke, it has naturally led to the position that our
          Gospels were written late, and therefore in all probability not by
          their reputed authors. Moreover it also requires us to believe that
          Luke included the Gospel of Mark in the number of the attempted Gospel
          stories which his Gospel was meant to supersede.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of the theories broached up to the present time has proved
          satisfactory. There is still a great deal of uncertainty and confusion
          in the study of the Synoptic problem; we do not seem to be nearer to
          its solution now than we were fifty years ago. The great aim has
          always been to explain the origin of the Synoptics without taking into
          account the supernatural factor that entered into their composition.
          Now we do not doubt the value of these studies; they have already
          taught us a good many things regarding the origin of these Gospels;
          but they have proven themselves insufficient to lead to a final
          solution of the problem. It is, of course, folly to rule this problem
          out of existence by simply appealing to the supernatural agency of the
          Holy Spirit. It is true, if one believes in the mechanical inspiration
          of the Bible, there is no Synoptic problem. This is quite different,
          however, for those who believe that the Scriptures have been inspired
          in an organic way. The more naturally we conceive of the origin of
          these writings, the better it is, if we only do not lose sight of the
          operation of the divine factor, of the directing, the guiding
          influence of the Holy Spirit. Cf. Kuyper, Encyclopedie III p. 51 f. It
          is hardly sufficient to say with Urquhart, New Biblical Guide VII p.
          357, that the key to the problem is found in the fact that the
          Synoptic Gospels are all the work of one author, and that each book is
          serving a distinct purpose. Yet this statement contains two important
          truths that we should continually bear in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any attempt to account for the similarities of the synoptics great
          allowance should be made for the influence of oral tradition It is
          very natural to suppose that, since the apostles for some time labored
          together at Jerusalem with Peter at the head, a particular, perhaps
          Petrine type of tradition became the common property of these early
          preachers and of their first hearers. And because the life of Christ
          entered as a very important element into the life of his apostles, and
          they felt the supreme significance of his words, it is also reasonable
          to assume that they aimed at inculcating the teachings of our Lord on
          their hearers in the exact form in which He gave it. It is equally
          rational to suppose that, at a comparatively early time, the desire to
          escape the uncertainty that always attends oral transmission, led to
          the composition of brief gospel narratives, containing especially the
          sayings and discourses of our Lord. These suppositions are entirely in
          harmony too with the opening verses of the Gospel of Luke: “Forasmuch
          as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those
          matters which have been fulfilled among us, even as they delivered
          them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers
          of the word, it seemed good to me also, etc.” Some of these early
          documents may have been written in Aramaic and others in Greek. The
          groundwork thus furnished and drawn upon by the writers of our
          Gospels, explains in a very natural way most of the agreements that
          are found in the Synoptics. And those that cannot be accounted for in
          that manner may have resulted directly from the guiding influence of
          the Holy Spirit, who led the writers also in the choice of their
          words. These three Gospels are in a very real sense the work of one
          Author.
        </p>
        <p>
          In seeking to explain the differences that are found in the Synoptic
          Gospels, we should bear in mind first of all that they are no
          histories, but memoirs, historical arguments. In composing them each
          one of the writers had his own purpose. Matthew, writing for the Jews,
          made it his aim to present Christ as the King, the great Son of David;
          Mark, intending his Gospel for the Romans, endeavored to draw a vivid
          picture of the powerful Worker, conquering the forces of evil; and
          Luke, addressing the Greeks and adjusting his Gospel to their needs,
          sought to describe Christ as the universal Saviour, as a person with
          wide sympathies. This diversity of aim accounts to a great extent for
          the variations exhibited in the Gospels, i. e. for omissions on the
          one hand and additions on the other, for differences in the
          distribution and arrangement of the material, etc. The writers of the
          Gospels selected from the great mass of early traditions the material
          that was suited to their purpose and used it to advantage. The
          difference between the Synoptics is not accidental, is not the result
          of the chance use of certain sources. And where the identical
          teachings of Christ are sometimes found in different forms, we should
          remember, first, that the Lord may have uttered the same truth at
          different times in varying forms; and secondly, that the Synoptists do
          not always give the identical words of the Saviour, but were so guided
          by the Holy Spirit that they do give an exact representation of the
          Lords teachings, perhaps in a form better adapted to their purpose
          than the original would have been. Cf. Kuyper, Diet. Dogm., Locus de
          Sacra Scriptura II p. 131 f.; Gregory, Why Four Gospels; Van Leeuwen,
          Literatuur en Schriftuur p. 14 ff.; Urquhart, New Biblical Guide VII

        <h2>THE RELATION OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN TO THE SYNOPTICS.</h2>
        <p>
          After pointing out the remarkable agreement between the synoptic
          Gospels and referring to some of the attempted explanations of this
          feature, we must consider the equally striking difference that exists
          between the Synoptics on the one hand and the Gospel of John on the
          other. This difference is so great that even untrained minds
          immediately feel it. Hence the question naturally arises: How can we
          account for it? This is in substance the Johannine problem. The
          differences that are found may conveniently be arranged under two
          heads:1. Differences touching the external course of events in the
          Lords ministry; and 2. Differences in regard to the form and contents
          of Christ’s teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Differences touching the external course of events in the Lord’s
          ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. According to the Synoptics the principal scene of the Lords
          activity is Galilee. He repairs to this Northern province soon after
          the imprisonment of John the Baptist, and apparently does not return
          to Judea until the last Passover. The representation that is found in
          the Gospel of John is quite different. Very little is said about the
          Galilean ministry, while the activity of Christ in Judea looms large
          on his pages. Most of the work of which John speaks was done at
          Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The first three Gospels mention but one Passover in their narrative
          of Christ’s public ministry, viz. that at the end of his life. This
          led many to the conviction that the Lord’s public ministry was limited
          to a period of one year. In the Gospel of John, on the other hand, we
          find three Passovers definitely mentioned, while a fourth is probably
          referred to in Joh_5:1. Judging by this the length of the Lords
          ministry was at least two and possibly three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The people with whom Jesus deals primarily are not the same in the
          Synoptics and in the Gospel of John. In the first three Gospels we see
          Jesus moving along the Galilean peasantry and preaching to them the
          gospel of the Kingdom, while in the fourth the Jews (by which John
          means the leaders of the people, i. e. Chief Priests, Scribes and
          Pharisees) are generally in the foreground, and certain individuals,
          that are not named, or are merely names, in the Synoptics, are very
          prominent, such as Philip, Nathanael, the Samaritan woman, Mary
          Magdalena and Thomas.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The attitude of the Jews towards Jesus appears to be quite
          different in the synoptic Gospels and in the Gospel of John. According
          to the Synoptics Jesus meets with great success at first. The
          multitudes flock unto him, are delighted to hear him and marvel at his
          teachings and work. And it is only after He has clearly shown that He
          had not come to establish an earthly kingdom that their enthusiasm
          dies away, and that He begins to prepare his disciples for his coming
          suffering and death. The Gospel of John makes it appear that from the
          beginning of Christ’s ministry at Jerusalem the hearts of the Jews
          were filled with a hatred that gradually grew, reaching its highest
          pitch after the raising of Lazarus, and that finally issued in the
          crucifixion of the Lord of glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. There are also several details in which the Gospel of John does not
          agree with the Synoptics. We shall only mention a couple of the most
          important examples. In the synoptic Gospels we find the cleansing of
          the temple at the end of Christ’s public ministry, while John places
          this at the very beginning. Then there is also a the representation of
          the of the Lord’s death. The Synoptics convey the impression that
          Christ ate the Passover in the evening of the 14th of Nisan, and was
          therefore crucified on the 15th; while the Gospel of John seems to say
          with equal explicitness that He ate it a day in advance of the regular
          time and died at the very hour, when the symbolic Paschal lamb was
          slain.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Differences in respect to the form and contents of our Lord’s
          teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. There is a striking diversity in the form in which the teaching of
          Jesus is cast. In the Synoptics we have short incisive sayings of the
          Lord, which in some cases are and in others are not connected with
          what immediately precedes or follows. In the Gospel of John, on the
          other hand, we find long and labored discourses, closely connected
          with the signs, the miracles of our Lord. The first three Gospels
          contain a goodly number of parables, which are strangely absent from
          the fourth Gospel, where we have instead a few allegories, such as the
          Door of the Sheepfold, the good Shepherd, and the true Vine. The style
          of the Gospel of John too is quite different from that of the
          Synoptics. It is a more Hebraic style, in which the statements are
          brief, the construction is simple and the sentences are usually
          connected with the conjunction and. This style is carried through also
          in the discourses of Christ, so that in some cases it is very hard, if
          not impossible, to tell just where the words of the Lord come to an
          end and those of the evangelist begin, or vice versa. Notice this
          especially in the third chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. There is an equally great difference in the contents of the Lords
          teaching. In the Synoptics the central theme on which Christ dwells is
          the Kingdom of God. He speaks of its origin, its nature, its subjects,
          its King, its requirements, its righteousness, its enemies and its
          future glory. In vain do we turn to the fourth Gospel for a
          corresponding line of thought. The Kingdom of God is mentioned but
          once there, viz, in the conversation of our Lord with Nicodemus.
          Christ himself is the main theme of the discourses found in the Gospel
          of John. The Lord speaks of his heavenly origin, of his essential
          character and of his return to glory. He presents himself to the Jews
          as the Messiah, the Son of God, the heavenly manna, the water of life,
          the true liberator, the light of the world, the good Shepherd, the
          resurrection and the life, etc. In the Synoptics we find that Jesus
          only occasionally, and then towards the end of his ministry, speaks of
          himself. In connection with this we may remark that the
          self-revelation of Christ both by his words and works differs greatly
          in the Synoptics and in the fourth Gospel. In the former Jesus begins
          by speaking of the Kingdom and makes little mention of the King. Only
          gradually does He reveal his true character and it is not until He is
          well along in the course of his public ministry that Peter is led up
          to the confession: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
          Only in the last week of his life does Jesus throw off all reserve and
          speaks clearly of himself as the Messiah sent from God. In the Gospel
          of John however, everything is quite clear from the beginning. John
          the Baptist points to Christ as “the Lamb of God that taketh away the
          sin of the world ;” to the Samaritan woman Jesus says: “I am He ;” and
          to the Jews attending the unnamed feast he speaks clearly of the
          unique relation in which He stands to the Father. This is closely
          connected with another fact. In the synoptic Gospels the humanity of
          Christ is made very prominent. We behold him there primarily as the
          Saviour who is taken on our nature, shares in our infirmities, and is
          tempted even as we are, though without sin. The fourth Gospel, on the
          other hand, brings the divinity of Christ into strong Revelation. We
          notice this at the very beginning of the Gospel: “In the beginning was
          the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” It strikes
          us in the signs which Christ gave to reveal his glory, and in the
          discourses that speak at length of his essential nature, of his
          descending out of glory, his being in glory, and his returning to the
          glory that He possessed from the foundation of the world; and it rings
          in our ears as we listen to the confession of Thomas: “My Lord and my
          God.”
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many critics at the present time who magnify these
          differences into discrepancies, and find in them a ground on which to
          reject the authorship of John. They maintain that the fourth Gospel is
          a treatise written with marked theological bias, inspired by the
          controversy about the person of Christ in the second century. The
          great stumbling block for them is the very clear teaching contained in
          this Gospel respecting the divinity of Christ. This, they hold, could
          only be the fruit of theological preconceptions. And the great desire
          on the part of the author to establish this beyond the shadow of a
          doubt is said to explain a good many of the other special features
          that characterize this gospel. This explanation contains both a
          falsehood and a truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          A careful study of the Gospel of John, a study that takes its true
          character in consideration, does not bear out the contention that
          several of the differences between the Gospel of John and the
          Synoptics amount to discrepancies. Neither does it reveal differences
          that cannot be accounted for in a perfectly natural way. We desire to
          point out first of all that there are not only dissimilarities but
          also correspondences between these Gospels. The incidents that we find
          mentioned in all the Gospels are the following: The baptism of John ,
          the feeding of the five thousand, the walking on the sea, the
          anointing at Bethany, the triumphal entry, the last supper, the
          betrayal, the trial, the crucifixion, the burial and the resurrection.
          Of course in some cases the details of the narrative vary. Besides
          these parallel narratives there are many passages in which we find
          imagery, sayings or words that find their counterpart in the synoptic
          Gospels. Davidson says that about one-third of the matter in John
          agrees with that in the Synoptics.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is evident from the foregoing that the diversity is greater than
          the similarity, and the great question is: How must we account for the
          differences? In pointing out the way in which we must look for a
          solution of this problem we call attention to several particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We should not lose sight of the true character of John’s writing.
          Neither it nor the other Gospels are meant to be complete histories of
          what the Lord did and said during his life in the flesh. If this were
          its claim, it would be disappoint in the extreme, since all that John
          narrates happened in a few days. Like the Synoptics the Gospel of John
          is a pen-picture of the Lord, is a witness to him from a particular
          point of view, and represents a phase of the apostolic χήρυγμαι. We
          must allow for the principle of selection and of selective arrangement
          in the composition of this work. It was John’s aim to describe the
          Lord from a particular point of view. Hence he chose from the great
          mass of apostolic tradition, whether oral or written, the materials
          that suited his purpose best, and arranged them in the most effective
          way, taking in consideration as much as possible the chronological
          order in which the events occurred. This general truth must be borne
          in mind continually, if we would understand the differences between
          the Gospel of John and the Synoptics.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The great controlling factor, however, in the construction of this
          Gospel, was the aim of the writer. Therefore it is necessary that we
          have some understanding of thIsa. Happily we need not guess at it,
          because John himself tells us what purpose he had in writing his
          Gospel. He says in Joh_20:31 : “But these things are written that ye
          might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that
          believing ye might have life through His name.” According to this
          statement the apostle had a twofold aim, the one theoretical and the
          other practical, the one his proximate, the other his ulterior aim.
          The theoretical aim of the evangelist was twofold: he wanted to show
          in a convincing manner that the historical Jesus was the Christ sent
          from God for the salvation of the world; and that this Christ was not
          a mere man, but the very Son of God, who in his pre-existent state
          shared in the divine glory, a glory which He radiated even while He
          dwelt among men in the form of a servant, and that would again shine
          forth in heavenly splendor after He had finished his task. It was the
          desire of the writer further, to present this Christ, this Son of God,
          to his readers in such a manner that they might be led to believe in
          him, and that they, being united to him the fountain of life by faith,
          might have life everlasting. With this end in view John, of course,
          selected those signs and discourses of the Lord that were best adapted
          to bring out his glory and to lead others to faith in him. He almost
          seems to tell us this himself, when he concludes his narrative of the
          first miracle performed by our Lord at Cana with the words: “This
          beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his
          glory; and his disciples believed on Him.” John views the miracles of
          which he speaks as shmeiathat exhibit the divine greatness of Christ.
          And he limits himself almost exclusively to those of which he can say
          definitely that they led men to believe on Christ, or of which Christ
          himself points out the symbolic significance in His discourses, as:
        </p>
        <p>
          The changing of water into wine at Cana (“and his disciples believed
          on Him.”)
        </p>
        <p>
          The healing of the rulers son at Cana (Capernaum) (“and himself
          believed and his whole house.”)
        </p>
        <p>
          The healing of the impotent man at the pool Bethesda (Christ the
          restorer of life).
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeding of the five thousand near Bethsaida (Christ the spiritual
          food, the heavenly manna).
        </p>
        <p>
          The restoring of the blind mans sight at Jerusalem (Christ the light
          of the world).
        </p>
        <p>
          The raising of Lazarus at Bethany (Christ the resurrection and the
          life).
        </p>
        <p>
          In harmony with his aim too the evangelist records such discourses of
          the Lord as serve to explain the shmeia to bring. out the unique
          relation in which Christ stands to the Father, to accentuate Christ’s
          authority, to emphasize the divine character of his mission. etc.
          Moreover he introduces several individuals to show us how Jesus
          labored to bring them to the conviction that He was the Christ, the
          Son of God, as Nathanael, Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman and Thomas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if we bear these things in mind, many of the differences between
          this Gospel and the Synoptics are immediately explained. The aim of
          John being what it is, he naturally speaks of Christ rather than of
          the Kingdom of God, introduces whatever accentuates the divinity of
          our Lord, and brings out as much as possible that Christ revealed
          himself as the Messiah from the very beginning of his public career.
          But doing this in a historical way, he cannot represent the Galilean
          peasants but only the leaders of the Jews at Jerusalem as the
          recipients of this revelation, for it was only to them, who were
          versed in the Scriptures, that Christ spoke so explicitly from the
          outset, and it was primarily for them that He expressed his thought in
          profound discourses rather than in parables. This in turn determines
          the time of which John speaks in his gospel and also explains how it
          is that he mentions so many feasts, because it was almost exclusively
          on these occasions that Jesus visited Jerusalem and came in contact
          with the Scribes and the Chief Priests. It also sheds light on the
          difference in the attitude of the Jews toward Jesus. For a long time
          the Galileans were attached to Christ and marveled at his words and
          works; the spirit of opposition was aroused in them especially towards
          the end of Christ’s labors among them and mostly by the machinations
          of the Pharisees that came from Jerusalem. The leaders of the Jews in
          Judea, on the other hand, hated Jesus almost from the beginning of his
          public ministry. Their hatred kept pace with the knowledge they
          received of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Every attempt at solving the Johannine problem must also make
          allowance for the fact that John was acquainted with the other Gospels
          and avoided as much as was consistent with his aim the repetition of
          facts that were already generally known. We have no doubt that John
          had read the other Gospels before he wrote his own. There are certain
          features in his Gospel that we can understand only on that
          supposition. According to Joh_21:19 John wrote his Gospel after the
          death of Peter and therefore comparatively late. Now he certainly
          would not be such a stranger in his own world of thought as not to
          know the Gospels that had already been composed. Then we find that in
          several places the evangelist trusts to the previous knowledge of his
          readers. He does not describe the institution of the Lords supper in
          his Gospel; yet he clearly assumes in Joh_6:5 that his readers were
          acquainted with it. Though he does not give a description of the
          ascension, he proceeds on the assumption that this fact is well known,
          Joh_6:62; Joh_20:17. Cf. further Joh_1:40; Joh_3:24; Joh_6:70, etc. In
          several cases in which the persons introduced in the Gospel
          misunderstand the Lord, the writer does not deem it necessary to
          explain for his readers what Jesus really meant, because he knew that
          they themselves were able to correct the mistake, Cf. Joh_7:35-36;
          Joh_3:4; Joh_4:15; Joh_6:52. It is a very weighty consideration in
          this connection too that John does not deign to answer objections that
          are brought against the Messiahship of Christ. Notice Joh_1:45-46;
          Joh_7:41-42; Joh_7:52. The evangelist does not give a single hint of
          the solution of the difficulty thus raised repeatedly. We can
          understand this only on the supposition that he was aware of the fact
          that his readers knew from the other Gospels how to solve the problem.
          John evidently read the other Gospels and this explains how he could
          avoid to such a great extent what they had already brought to the
          knowledge of the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Finally we must also bear in mind that the individuality of the
          author is stamped his literary production. John was a profound
          meditative spirit, who drank deeply at the fountain of life. He
          searched for the mainspring of action in the career of our Saviour; he
          pondered on the hidden background of the mysterious, the wonderful
          life of his Master. He was the best qualified of all the apostles to
          describe the divine greatness of the Lord. And it was no small
          achievement of his, that he presented the profoundest truths in the
          most simple manner. The simplicity of its language is a very striking
          feature of the fourth Gospel. It is due in part, no doubt, to Johns
          idiosyncrasy, and in part to his habit of contemplating Christianity
          in its most fundamental relations. It need not surprise us that we
          find the same style in the discourses of Christ, for in these also the
          style is to a great extent Johns. Neither John nor the other
          evangelists always give us the exact words of Jesus. It is true that
          he generally employs direct discourse in introducing the words of the
          Saviour, but this is merely an oriental custom and does not imply that
          the words were used exactly in that way. But the Spirit of God so
          guided the writer that he reproduces, though possibly in a slightly
          different form, the exact truths which Jesus sought to inculcate on
          his hearers. And this Spirit, which is also the Spirit of Christ,
          vouching for these words, makes them just as really the words of
          Christ, as if they had been an exact reproduction of the words Jesus
          had used in addressing the Jews.
        </p>
        <h2>THE INSPIRATION OF THE GOSPELS.</h2>
        <p>
          During the past century the human origin of the Gospels has been
          carefully investigated. With a great deal of patience and ingenuity
          every chapter and verse of these writings has been scrutinized and
          referred to its supposed ultimate source. The discussion of the divine
          factor that operated in the composition of these books, however, has
          been conspicuously absent from these studies. And this neglect is not
          the result of chance, but of a very deliberate plan. A large number of
          scholars today do not believe in any special inspiration of these
          writings; others, who do not wish to deny their divine inspiration,
          nevertheless maintain that their claim to this prerogative should be
          waived in the historical investigation of their origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the preceding century many were wont to label the Gospels
          sneeringly as fictitious narratives, written by a few religious
          fanatics, who deliberately lied about Jesus. This crude and baseless
          opinion does not meet with great favor today. People intuitively
          recoil from that position and feel that they must take a more
          respectful attitude towards the Gospels. They now regard these as the
          product of the reverent and in part unconscious invention of the
          Church; or as the expression of the corporate consciousness and the
          corporate mood of the first Christian community. Even so, of course,
          they are simply human productions that contain besides a large quota
          of truth a great deal of mythical and legendary matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over against this position we hold that the Gospels were written by
          men who were inspired by the Holy Spirit, and that they are therefore
          absolutely trustworthy and authoritative accounts of the life of our
          Lord. They are inspired records. They constitute one of the most
          precious fruits of the apostolic inspiration, since they are one and
          all the literary embodiment of the apostolic chrugma. The substance of
          what the apostles preached is contained in these writings. Now as well
          as the prophets in the old dispensation, the apostles in the new were
          inspired by the Holy Spirit. This is quite evident from the New
          Testament. Consider the promises which our Lord gave to His disciples:
          Mat_10:19-20 ”.... for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye
          shall speak; for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your
          Father that speaketh in you.” Joh_14:26, “But the Comforter, which is
          the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, He shall teach
          you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
          have said unto you.” Joh_16:13-14, “Howbeit when the Spirit of truth
          is come, He will guide you into all truth; for He shall not speak of
          himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak; and He
          will show you things to come. He shall glorify me; for He shall
          receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.” Notice too that these
          promises found their initial fulfilment on the day of Pentecost. We
          read in Act_2:4 : “And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
          ‘began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
          utterance.” And after this day the apostles were conscious of being
          guided by the Spirit of God. Paul says in 1Co_2:11-13, “For what man
          knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?
          even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now
          we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is
          of God; that we might know the things which are freely given us of
          God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which mans wisdom
          teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual
          things with spiritual.” And in 2Co_13:2-3, “—and being absent now I
          write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if
          I come again, I will not spare; since ye seek a proof of Christ
          speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.”
          These few passages, which might easily be multiplied, must suffice for
          the present.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some who admit the inspiration of the prophets, do not believe the
          apostles were also inspired, because in their case they do not hear
          the familiar formula “thus saith the Lord,” nor behold the
          characteristic phenomena that accompanied the inspiration of the
          prophets. They do not distinguish between different kinds of
          inspiration. There are especially three points of interest between the
          inspiration of the prophets and that of the apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Under the Old Covenant the Holy Spirit did not yet dwell in the
          Church, but operated on believers from without. So it was also in the
          case of the prophets. The Holy Spirit took possession of them,
          sometimes suppressed their personality to a. certain degree, and then
          employed their consciousness for his purpose. In the new dispensation,
          however, He took up his abode in The Church, and first of all in the
          apostles, who were to be the Church’s foundation; and then,
          identifying himself to a great extent with their conscious life, used
          them as instruments to produce his revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the case of the prophets it was the entrance of a foreign
          element, a foreign power into their lives, and something extraordinary
          in their career that impelled them to prophesy. It was a power that
          they could not resist, because it became as a fire burning within
          them. With the apostles, on the other hand, it was the indwelling
          Spirit in connection with their official task that led them to speak
          the Word of God. The inspiration of the prophets was intermittent;
          that of the apostles, continuous in the performance of their regular
          apostolic duties.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The prophets often spoke of unknown and unseen things, while the
          apostles discoursed on things which they knew and saw. In connection
          with this the Holy Spirit did not operate through the same faculty in
          both the prophets and the apostles. In the former it was the
          imagination, in the latter the understanding, especially memory and
          reflection, that constituted the medium of divine revelation. Hence
          the prophets generally spoke in poetic and in symbolic language, while
          the apostles as a rule clothed their thought in ordinary prose. In the
          case of the Gospels the inspiration of the apostles has above all the
          character of a ὑπόμνησις. Cf. Joh_14:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          This apostolic inspiration gave birth to the χήρυγμα of the apostles,
          but does not yet account for the infallible records we have of this in
          the Gospels. Besides the apostolic we must take into consideration a
          separate graphical or transcriptive inspiration, if we would fully
          understand the divine origin of the Gospels. The authors were led by
          the spirit of God in composing these writings, in giving to the
          preaching of the apostles a definite written form. They were guided in
          the selection of their material and its proper arrangement, and in the
          choice of their words and expressions, so that their records are truly
          a part of the Word of God for the Church of all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question naturally arises, whether we have any reasons to think
          that the Gospels were so inspired. In answer would say that we have,
          though we do not flatter ourself with the idea that these reasons
          would convince anyone who is disinclined to accept the Scriptures as
          the very Word of God.

          1. The contents of the Gospels testify to their divine origin. We find
          in them a fourfold portraiture of the Saviour. There are many
          differences in the individual pictures, yet together they form a grand
          unity. Four writers, each one portraying the life of Christ in his own
          way, to a great extent without knowing each others writings or drawing
          on them, so that their individual portraits blend perfectly into a
          harmonious whole,—it is marvelous, it can only be understood, if we
          assume that these four writers were all guided unerringly by the same
          superintending Spirit. The Gospels are really the work of one author.
          And the life that is pictured in them is a divine life, unfathomable,
          mysterious, far surpassing human understanding. And yet that
          incomparable, that divine life has been so faithfully portrayed, with
          such a profound insight into its real character and hidden depths, in
          such a simple, natural, artless manner, that it has been the marvel of
          ages. Could man, unaided by higher power, describe such a life? No,
          only they who were inspired by the Holy Spirit, were equal to the
          task.

          2. Taking for granted the inspiration of the Old Testament, which is
          conclusively proved by the words of Jesus and the apostles we feel
          that it calls for an inspired complement. It covers the period of
          preparation that is prophetic of a future completion, the time in
          which the Church was in its infancy, that points forward to the
          maturity of a coming age. It is filled with prophecies that await
          fulfilment; it contains the shadow that is cast before the coming
          body, growing more distinct as the ages roll on, until at last it
          seems as if the body will presently appear, yet it does not—the Old
          Testament requires a compliment. And in harmony with it this too must
          be inspired. Of what avail would the inspiration of the Old Testament
          be, if that in which it culminates is not inspired. The divine surety
          would be wanting.

          3. At least two of our Gospels were written by apostles who in
          speaking to their contemporaries, were inspired by the Spirit of God.
          Now it would be an anomaly that they should be guided by the Holy
          Spirit in their oral witnessing to Christ, and be without that divine
          guidance in perpetuating their testimony for all future ages. It was
          the will of God that people until the end of the world should believe
          on him through the word of the apostles, Joh_17:20; 1Jn_1:3. Hence it
          was of the greatest importance that there should be an infallible
          record of their testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. There are some Scripture passages that point to the inspiration of
          the gospel records. The older Lightfoot, (Works IV p. 1193, 114; XII
          p. 7, and following him Urquhart, The Bible its Structure and Purpose
          1 Chronicles 5), find a proof for the inspiration of Luke’s Gospel in
          Luk_1:3, where they would translate the words παρηχολουθηχότι ἄνωθεν
          by “having had perfect understanding of all things from above.” This
          interpretation is favored by the fact that ἄνωθεν has this meaning in
          eight of the thirteen times that it occurs in the New Testament, and
          in three of the remaining instances means again, while it is
          translated “from the beginning” only here and in Act_26:4. The
          expressed purpose of Luke in writing his Gospel also falls in
          exceedingly well with the rendering from above. It is, he writes to
          Theophilus, that you may have the certainty of those things in which
          you have been instructed.” Yet the verb παραχολουθέω, meaning, to
          follow up carefully, and thus, to obtain knowledge, argues decisively
          against it. What is of greater significance for us, is the fact that
          the Gospel of Luke is quoted as ὴ γραφή in 1Ti_5:18, where we read:
          “For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
          out the corn, and, The laborer is worthy of his hire.” The only place
          in the entire Bible where the last words are found, is Luk_10:7.
          Finally we call attention to 2Pe_3:15-16, where the apostle says: ”. .
          . even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given
          unto him hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking
          of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which
          they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other
          Scriptures, unto their own destruction.” Here we find that the
          writings of Paul are placed on a level with other inspired writings,
          which Peter calls, “the other Scriptures.” There is good reason to
          believe that this expression refers to the books of the Old Testament,
          and to those of the New Testament that were already composed, when
          Peter wrote his second epistle, among which we may also reckon the
          Gospels of Matthew and Luke.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The fact that the early Church from the very beginning accepted
          these Gospels as canonical, is also a proof of their inspired
          character, for in it the communal consciousness of the Church
          expressed itself in regard to these writings; and it is said of
          believers in their corporate existence that they, taught by the Holy
          Ghost, know all things. Dean Alford says: “The apostles being raised
          up for the special purpose of witnessing to the gospel history,—and
          these memoirs having been universally received in the early Church as
          embodying that their testimony, I see no escape left from the
          inference that they come to us with inspired authority. The Greek
          Testament, Vol. I, Prolegomena Section VI.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Finally the Holy Spirit testifies in the heart of every believer to
          the divine character of the Gospels, so that they feel assured that
          these writings contain the very Word of God. Under the influence of
          the Holy Spirit they realize that these Gospels too minister to the
          deepest needs of their spiritual life, they realize their infinite
          value, marvel at their exquisite beauty and find in them ever
          increasingly the words of everlasting life. Thus they cannot but speak
          their “Amen” to the contents of these books.

        <h2>THE CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GOSPELS AS A WHOLE.</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospels are of course, closely related to the Old Testament
          Scriptures. They describe in a vivid manner the initial stage of the
          fulness of time, showing how all the prophecies that pointed to Christ
          and to a new and more spiritual dispensation began to be fulfilled.
          Rather than enlarge on this relation, however, we shall here briefly
          describe the peculiar function of the Gospels in the New Testament
          revelation. These writings are related to the rest of the New
          Testament, as the Pentateuch is to the following books of the Old
          Testament. Both are of a fundamental character, laying foundations on
          which an imposing superstructure is raised. In the case of the Gospels
          this is clearly indicated by the opening words of Luke in the Acts of
          the Apostles: “The former treatise have I written, Theophilus, of all
          that Jesus began both to do and to teach.” In this passage the word
          ἤρξατο is not pleonastic, as was held by some, but emphatic. According
          to this word the Gospel contained the narrative only of what Jesus
          began to do and to teach, which would prove to be the solid foundation
          and the germinating principle of all that He would continue to do on
          earth (through His apostles) and in heaven. The Gospels mark but an
          initial stage in New Testament revelation; they lack finality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The form, the method and the substance of Christ’s teaching in the
          Gospels,—it all bears the stamp of an incipient stage. Everyone that
          reads the Gospels and compares them with the epistles is struck by the
          simple manner in which Christ presents his teachings to the multitude.
          He gave his instruction primarily in the form of parables and
          proverbial sayings. Now it is the essence of proverbial speech that it
          detaches itself from particular occasions, and is therefore best
          adapted to the expression of general fundamental truths. Because
          parables and proverbs set forth the truth in a lively and concrete
          way, they were very appropriate in teaching those that were just
          initiated in the spiritual truths of the new dispensation. Since they
          generally disclose the truth but partially, they stimulate the spirit
          of inquiry. A very suitable way of instructing beginners indeed! We
          notice that the disciples gradually longed for a different form of
          instruction, and towards the end of his life Christ says to them:
          “These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh,
          when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you
          plainly of the Father.” Joh_16:25.—The method of Jesus’ work points to
          the same general conclusion. His teaching has a fragmentary character.
          He speaks a word here and a word there, discourses now with this
          person and then with that one, just as a missionary among the gentiles
          is apt to do, expressing the deepest truths in a sporadic way.
          Important doctrines were thus uttered without any attempt to relate
          them to other truths. All this is in perfect harmony with the initial
          character of Christ’s work.—The contents of Christ’s teaching also are
          primitive and fundamental. Many of the most important truths are
          indeed taught in the Gospels, but they are not elaborated, nor set
          forth in all their significance, as the doctrine of the atonement, of
          justification by faith, of the forgiveness of sins, of the Kingship of
          Christ, etc. Other truths were suppressed, because, as the Lord
          himself says, even the best of his hearers were not yet able to bear
          them, Joh_16:12. The works of Christ were also initiatory. His
          miracles contained within them. the promise of still greater works in
          the future. He says to his disciples: “He that believeth on me, the
          works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall
          he-do, because I go unto my Father,” Joh_14:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the writers of the Gospels simply narrated this initial work of
          Christ, as they remembered it. They do not make mention of the greater
          works that followed after Christ had gone to heaven, nor do they
          (except in very rare instances) reflect on or seek to interpret the
          life and teachings of the Saviour. This remains to be done in later
          writings.
