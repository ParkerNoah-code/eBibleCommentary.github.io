        <h1>A. Introduction (1:1-4)</h1>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets
            at many times and in various ways,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>God, having formerly spoken...</em> This beginning is for the
          purpose of commending the doctrine taught by Christ; for it shows that
          we ought not only reverently to receive it, but also to be satisfied
          with it alone. That we may understand this more clearly, we must
          observe the contrast between each of the clauses. First, the Son of
          God is set in opposition to the prophets; then we to the fathers; and,
          thirdly, the various and manifold modes of speaking which God had
          adopted as to the fathers, to the last revelation brought to us by
          Christ. But in this diversity he still sets before us but one God,
          that no one might think that the Law militates against the Gospel, or
          that the author of one is not the author of the other. That you may,
          therefore, understand the full import of this passage, the following
          arrangement shall be given, --
        </p>
        <p>
          Formerly by the Prophets => Now by the Son;<br />
          Then to the Fathers => But now to us;<br />
          Then at Various times => Now as at the end of the times.
        </p>
        <p>
          This foundation being laid, the agreement between the Law and the
          Gospel is established; for God, who is ever like himself, and whose
          word is the same, and whose truth is unchangeable, has spoken as to
          both in common.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we must notice the difference between us and the fathers; for God
          formerly addressed them in a way different from that which he adopts
          towards us now. And first indeed as to them he employed the prophets,
          but he has appointed his Son to be an ambassador to us. Our condition,
          then, in this respect, is superior to that of the fathers. Even Moses
          is to be also classed among the prophets, as he is one of the number
          of those who are inferior to the Son. In the manner also in which
          revelation was made, we have an advantage over them. For the diversity
          as to visions and other means adopted under the Old Testament, was an
          indication that it was not yet a fixed state of things, as when
          matters are put completely in order. Hence he says,
          <em>many times and in various ways</em>. God would have indeed
          followed the same mode perpetually to the end, had the mode been
          perfect and complete. It hence follows, that this variety was an
          evidence of imperfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two words I thus understand: I refer <em>multifariously</em> to a
          diversity as to times but <em>various ways</em> points out a
          diversity, as I think, in the very manner itself. And when he speaks
          of the last times, he intimates that there is no longer any reason to
          expect any new revelation; for it was not a word in part that Christ
          brought, but the final conclusion. It is in this sense that the
          Apostles take the last times and the last days. And Paul means the
          same when he says, "Upon whom the ends of the world are come." (1
          Corinthians 10:11.) If God then has spoken now for the last time, it
          is right to advance thus far; so also when you come to Christ, you
          ought not to go farther: and these two things it is very needful for
          us to know. For it was a great hindrance to the Jews that they did not
          consider that God had deferred a fuller revelation to another time;
          hence, being satisfied with their own Law, they did not hasten forward
          to the goal. But since Christ has appeared, an opposite evil began to
          prevail in the world; for men wished to advance beyond Christ. What
          else indeed is the whole system of Popery but the overleaping of the
          boundary which the Apostle has fixed? As, then, the Spirit of God in
          this passage invites all to come as far as Christ, so he forbids them
          to go beyond the last time which he mentions. In short, the limit of
          our wisdom is made here to be the Gospel.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he
            appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the
            worlds.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Whom he appointed heir...</em> He honors Christ with high
          commendations, in order to lead us to show him reverence; for since
          the Father has subjected all things to him, we are all under his
          authority. He also intimates that no good can be found apart from him,
          as he is the heir of all things. It hence follows that we must be very
          miserable and destitute of all good things except he supplies us with
          his treasures. He further adds that this honor of possessing all
          things belongs by right to the Son, because by him have all things
          been created. At the same time, heirship and creation are ascribed to
          Christ for different reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world was created by him, as he is the eternal wisdom of God,
          which is said to have been the director of all his works from the
          beginning; and hence is proved the eternity of Christ, for he must
          have existed before the world was created by him. If, then, the
          duration of his time be inquired of, it will be found that it has no
          beginning. Nor is it any derogation to his power that he is said to
          have created the world, as though he did not by himself create it.
          According to the most usual mode of speaking in Scripture, the Father
          is called the Creator; and it is added in some places that the world
          was created by wisdom, by the word, by the Son, as though wisdom
          itself had been the creator, or the word, or the Son. But still we
          must observe that there is a difference of persons between the Father
          and the Son, not only with regard to men, but with regard to God
          himself. But the unity of essence requires that whatever is peculiar
          to Deity should belong to the Son as well as to the Father, and also
          that whatever is applied to God only should belong to both; and yet
          there is nothing in this to prevent each from his own peculiar
          properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the word <em>heir</em> is ascribed to Christ as manifested in the
          flesh; for being made man, he put on our nature, and as such received
          this heirship, and that for this purpose, that he might restore to us
          what we had lost in Adam. For God had at the beginning constituted
          man, as his Son, the heir of all good things; but through sin the
          first man became alienated from God, and deprived himself and his
          posterity of all good things, as well as of the favor of God. We hence
          only then begin to enjoy by right the good things of God, when Christ,
          the universal heir, admits to a union with himself; for he is an heir
          that he may endow us with his riches. But the Apostle now adorns him
          with this title, that we may know that without him we are destitute of
          all good things.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his
            substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who,
            when he had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the
            right hand of the Majesty on high,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          It is not the direct and immediate design of the apostle to treat
          absolutely of either nature of Christ, his divine or human, but only
          of his person. Hence, though the things which he mentions and
          expresses may be the properties of his divine nature, some of his
          human, yet none of them are spoken of as such, but are all considered
          as belonging unto his person. He intends not to speak directly and
          absolutely of either nature of Christ; but treating of his person. And
          therefore the method and order of the apostle is not to be inquired
          after in what relates in his expressions to this or that nature of
          Christ, but in the progress that he makes in the description of his
          person and offices; which alone he had undertaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>His Son is the radiance of his glory...</em> The Son is said to be
          "the brightness of his glory", and "the impress of his substance:"
          they are words borrowed from nature. For nothing can be said of things
          so great and so profound, but by similitudes taken from created
          things. There is therefore no need refinedly to discuss the question
          how the Son, who has the same essence with the Father, is a brightness
          emanating from his light. We must allow that there is a degree of
          impropriety in the language when what is borrowed from created things
          is transferred to the hidden majesty of God. But still the things
          which are indent to our senses are fitly applied to God, and for this
          end, that we may know what is to be found in Christ, and what benefits
          he brings to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It ought also to be observed that frivolous speculations are not here
          taught, but an important doctrine of faith. We ought therefore to
          apply these high titles given to Christ for our own benefit, for they
          bear a relation to us. When, therefore, thou hear that the Son is the
          brightness of the Father's glory, think thus with thyself, that the
          glory of the Father is invisible until it shines forth in Christ, and
          that he is called the impress of his substance, because the majesty of
          the Father is hidden until it shows itself impressed as it were on his
          image. They who overlook this connection and carry their philosophy
          higher, weary themselves to no purpose, for they do not understand the
          design of the Apostle; for it was not his object to show what likeness
          the Father bears to the Son; but, as I have said, his purpose was
          really to build up our faith, so that we may learn that God is made
          known to us in no other way than in Christ: for as to the essence of
          God, so immense is the brightness that it dazzles our eyes, except it
          shines on us in Christ. It hence follows, that we are blind as to the
          light of God, until in Christ it beams on us. It is indeed a
          profitable philosophy to learn Christ by the real understanding of
          faith and experience. The same view, as I have said is to be taken of
          "the impress;" for as God is in himself to us incomprehensible, his
          form appears to us only in his Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And upholding all things...</em>
          To uphold or to bear here means to preserve or to continue all that is
          created in its own state; for he intimates that all things would
          instantly come to nothing, were they not sustained by his power. For
          as that power in Him, that is influencing and giving existence, life,
          motion, and guidance unto all things, is clearly expressed by
          “upholding and disposing of all things”; so is the exercise and
          issuing of it forth by the spirit of life in all things, to guide them
          certainly and regularly, by these words, “the word of his power:” both
          denoting the unspeakable facility of omnipotent power in its
          operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By the word of his power</em>... This work is peculiarly assigned
          to the Son, not only as he is the eternal power and wisdom of God, but
          also because by his interposition, as undertaking the work of
          mediation, he reprieved the world from an immediate dissolution upon
          the first entrance of sin and disorder, that it might continue, as it
          were, the great stage for the mighty works of God's grace, wisdom, and
          love, to be wrought on. Hence the care of the continuance of the
          creation and the disposal of it is delegated unto him, as he that hath
          undertaken to bring forth and consummate the glory of God in it,
          notwithstanding the great breach made upon it by the sin of angels and
          men. He affirms that all things have also their present consistency in
          him and by his power, and must have so, until the work of
          reconciliation of all things unto God being accomplished, the glory of
          God may be fully retrieved and established for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>When he had by himself purified us of our sins</em> When he says,
          <em>by himself</em>, there is to be understood here a contrast, that
          he had not been aided in this by the shadows of the Mosaic Law. He
          shows besides a difference between him and the Levitical priests; for
          they also were said to expiate sins, but they derived this power from
          another. In short, he intended to exclude all other means or helps by
          stating that the price and the power of purgation were found only in
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Sat down on the right hand...</em> as though he had said, that
          having in the world procured salvation for men, he was received into
          celestial glory, in order that he might govern all things. And he
          added this in order to show that it was not a temporary salvation he
          has obtained for us; for we should otherwise be too apt to measure his
          power by what now appears to us. He then reminds us that Christ is not
          to be less esteemed because he is not seen by our eyes; but, on the
          contrary, that this was the height of his glory, that he has been
          taken and conveyed to the highest seat of his empire.
          <em>The right hand</em> is by a similitude applied to God, though he
          is not confined to any place, and has not a right side nor left. The
          session then of Christ means nothing else but the kingdom given to him
          by the Father, and that authority which Paul mentions, when he says
          that in his name every knee should bow (Philippians 2:10). Hence to
          sit at the right hand of the Father is no other thing than to govern
          in the place of the Father, as deputies of princes are wont to do to
          whom a full power over all things is granted. And the word
          <em>majesty</em> is added, and also <em>on high</em>, and for this
          purpose, to intimate that Christ is seated on the supreme throne
          whence the majesty of God shines forth. As, then, he ought to be loved
          on account of his redemption, so he ought to be adored on account of
          his royal magnificence.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Having become as much better...</em>
          After having raised Christ above Moses and all others, he now
          amplifies His glory by a comparison with angels. It was a common
          notion among the Jews, that the Law was given by angels; they
          attentively considered the honorable things spoken of them everywhere
          in Scripture; and as the world is strangely inclined to superstition,
          they obscured the glory of God by extolling angels too much. It was
          therefore necessary to reduce them to their own rank, that they might
          not overshadow the brightness of Christ. And first he proves from his
          name, that Christ far excelled them, for he is called the Son of God.
