        <h1>A. Introduction (1:1-4)</h1>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets
            at many times and in various ways,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>God, having formerly spoken...</em> This
          beginning is for the purpose of commending the doctrine taught by
          Christ; for it shows that we ought not only reverently to receive it,
          but also to be satisfied with it alone. That we may understand this
          more clearly, we must observe the contrast between each of the
          clauses. First, the Son of God is set in opposition to the prophets;
          then we to the fathers; and, thirdly, the various and manifold modes
          of speaking which God had adopted as to the fathers, to the last
          revelation brought to us by Christ. But in this diversity he still
          sets before us but one God, that no one might think that the Law
          militates against the Gospel, or that the author of one is not the
          author of the other. That you may, therefore, understand the full
          import of this passage, the following arrangement shall be given, --
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>Formerly by the Prophets => Now by the
          Son;<br />
          <span class="tab"></span>Then to the Fathers => But now to us;<br />
          <span class="tab"></span>Then at Various times => Now as at the end of
          the times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          This foundation being laid, the agreement between the Law and the
          Gospel is established; for God, who is ever like himself, and whose
          word is the same, and whose truth is unchangeable, has spoken as to
          both in common.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          But we must notice the difference between us and the fathers; for God
          formerly addressed them in a way different from that which he adopts
          towards us now. And first indeed as to them he employed the prophets,
          but he has appointed his Son to be an ambassador to us. Our condition,
          then, in this respect, is superior to that of the fathers. Even Moses
          is to be also classed among the prophets, as he is one of the number
          of those who are inferior to the Son. In the manner also in which
          revelation was made, we have an advantage over them. For the diversity
          as to visions and other means adopted under the Old Testament, was an
          indication that it was not yet a fixed state of things, as when
          matters are put completely in order. Hence he says,
          <em>many times and in various ways</em>. God would have indeed
          followed the same mode perpetually to the end, had the mode been
          perfect and complete. It hence follows, that this variety was an
          evidence of imperfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>
          The two words I thus understand: I refer <em>multifariously</em> to a
          diversity as to times but <em>various ways</em> points out a
          diversity, as I think, in the very manner itself. And when he speaks
          of the last times, he intimates that there is no longer any reason to
          expect any new revelation; for it was not a word in part that Christ
          brought, but the final conclusion. It is in this sense that the
          Apostles take the last times and the last days. And Paul means the
          same when he says, "Upon whom the ends of the world are come." (1
          Corinthians 10:11.) If God then has spoken now for the last time, it
          is right to advance thus far; so also when you come to Christ, you
          ought not to go farther: and these two things it is very needful for
          us to know. For it was a great hindrance to the Jews that they did not
          consider that God had deferred a fuller revelation to another time;
          hence, being satisfied with their own Law, they did not hasten forward
          to the goal. But since Christ has appeared, an opposite evil began to
          prevail in the world; for men wished to advance beyond Christ. What
          else indeed is the whole system of Popery but the overleaping of the
          boundary which the Apostle has fixed? As, then, the Spirit of God in
          this passage invites all to come as far as Christ, so he forbids them
          to go beyond the last time which he mentions. In short, the limit of
          our wisdom is made here to be the Gospel.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he
            appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the
            worlds.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>Whom he appointed heir...</em> He honors
          Christ with high commendations, in order to lead us to show him
          reverence; for since the Father has subjected all things to him, we
          are all under his authority. He also intimates that no good can be
          found apart from him, as he is the heir of all things. It hence
          follows that we must be very miserable and destitute of all good
          things except he supplies us with his treasures. He further adds that
          this honor of possessing all things belongs by right to the Son,
          because by him have all things been created. At the same time,
          heirship and creation are ascribed to Christ for different reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>The world was created by him, as he is the
          eternal wisdom of God, which is said to have been the director of all
          his works from the beginning; and hence is proved the eternity of
          Christ, for he must have existed before the world was created by him.
          If, then, the duration of his time be inquired of, it will be found
          that it has no beginning. Nor is it any derogation to his power that
          he is said to have created the world, as though he did not by himself
          create it. According to the most usual mode of speaking in Scripture,
          the Father is called the Creator; and it is added in some places that
          the world was created by wisdom, by the word, by the Son, as though
          wisdom itself had been the creator, or the word, or the Son. But still
          we must observe that there is a difference of persons between the
          Father and the Son, not only with regard to men, but with regard to
          God himself. But the unity of essence requires that whatever is
          peculiar to Deity should belong to the Son as well as to the Father,
          and also that whatever is applied to God only should belong to both;
          and yet there is nothing in this to prevent each from his own peculiar
          properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>But the word <em>heir</em> is ascribed to
          Christ as manifested in the flesh; for being made man, he put on our
          nature, and as such received this heirship, and that for this purpose,
          that he might restore to us what we had lost in Adam. For God had at
          the beginning constituted man, as his Son, the heir of all good
          things; but through sin the first man became alienated from God, and
          deprived himself and his posterity of all good things, as well as of
          the favor of God. We hence only then begin to enjoy by right the good
          things of God, when Christ, the universal heir, admits to a union with
          himself; for he is an heir that he may endow us with his riches. But
          the Apostle now adorns him with this title, that we may know that
          without him we are destitute of all good things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>If you take <em>all</em> in the masculine
          gender, the meaning is, that we ought all to be subject to Christ,
          because we have been given to him by the Father. But I prefer reading
          it in the neuter gender; then it means that we are driven from the
          legitimate possession of all things, both in heaven and on earth,
          except we be united to Christ.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his
            substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who,
            when he had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the
            right hand of the Majesty on high,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span
          ><em>His Son is the radiance of his glory...</em> These things are
          said of Christ partly as to his divine essence, and partly as a
          partaker of our flesh. When he is called the brightness of his glory
          and the impress of his substance, his divinity is referred to; the
          other things appertain in a measure to his human nature. The whole,
          however, is stated in order to set forth the dignity of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>But it is for the same reason that the Son is
          said to be "the brightness of his glory", and "the impress of his
          substance:" they are words borrowed from nature. For nothing can be
          said of things so great and so profound, but by similitudes taken from
          created things. There is therefore no need refinedly to discuss the
          question how the Son, who has the same essence with the Father, is a
          brightness emanating from his light. We must allow that there is a
          degree of impropriety in the language when what is borrowed from
          created things is transferred to the hidden majesty of God. But still
          the things which are indent to our senses are fitly applied to God,
          and for this end, that we may know what is to be found in Christ, and
          what benefits he brings to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>It ought also to be observed that frivolous
          speculations are not here taught, but an important doctrine of faith.
          We ought therefore to apply these high titles given to Christ for our
          own benefit, for they bear a relation to us. When, therefore, thou
          hear that the Son is the brightness of the Father's glory, think thus
          with thyself, that the glory of the Father is invisible until it
          shines forth in Christ, and that he is called the impress of his
          substance, because the majesty of the Father is hidden until it shows
          itself impressed as it were on his image. They who overlook this
          connection and carry their philosophy higher, weary themselves to no
          purpose, for they do not understand the design of the Apostle; for it
          was not his object to show what likeness the Father bears to the Son;
          but, as I have said, his purpose was really to build up our faith, so
          that we may learn that God is made known to us in no other way than in
          Christ: for as to the essence of God, so immense is the brightness
          that it dazzles our eyes, except it shines on us in Christ. It hence
          follows, that we are blind as to the light of God, until in Christ it
          beams on us. It is indeed a profitable philosophy to learn Christ by
          the real understanding of faith and experience. The same view, as I
          have said is to be taken of "the impress;" for as God is in himself to
          us incomprehensible, his form appears to us only in his Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span
          ><em>And upholding (or bearing) all things...</em> To uphold or to
          bear here means to preserve or to continue all that is created in its
          own state; for he intimates that all things would instantly come to
          nothing, were they not sustained by his power. Though the pronoun his
          may be referred to the Father as well as to the Son, as it may be
          rendered "his own," yet as the other exposition is more commonly
          received, and well suits the context, I am disposed to embrace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span>When he further says, <em>by himself</em>,
          there is to be understood here a contrast, that he had not been aided
          in this by the shadows of the Mosaic Law. He shows besides a
          difference between him and the Levitical priests; for they also were
          said to expiate sins, but they derived this power from another. In
          short, he intended to exclude all other means or helps by stating that
          the price and the power of purgation were found only in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span><em>Sat down on the right hand...</em> as
          though he had said, that having in the world procured salvation for
          men, he was received into celestial glory, in order that he might
          govern all things. And he added this in order to show that it was not
          a temporary salvation he has obtained for us; for we should otherwise
          be too apt to measure his power by what now appears to us. He then
          reminds us that Christ is not to be less esteemed because he is not
          seen by our eyes; but, on the contrary, that this was the height of
          his glory, that he has been taken and conveyed to the highest seat of
          his empire. <em>The right hand</em> is by a similitude applied to God,
          though he is not confined to any place, and has not a right side nor
          left. The session then of Christ means nothing else but the kingdom
          given to him by the Father, and that authority which Paul mentions,
          when he says that in his name every knee should bow (Philippians
          2:10). Hence to sit at the right hand of the Father is no other thing
          than to govern in the place of the Father, as deputies of princes are
          wont to do to whom a full power over all things is granted. And the
          word <em>majesty</em> is added, and also <em>on high</em>, and for
          this purpose, to intimate that Christ is seated on the supreme throne
          whence the majesty of God shines forth. As, then, he ought to be loved
          on account of his redemption, so he ought to be adored on account of
          his royal magnificence.

        <p>
          <span class="tab"></span
          ><em>Having become as much better...</em> After having raised Christ
          above Moses and all others, he now amplifies His glory by a comparison
          with angels. It was a common notion among the Jews, that the Law was
          given by angels; they attentively considered the honorable things
          spoken of them everywhere in Scripture; and as the world is strangely
          inclined to superstition, they obscured the glory of God by extolling
          angels too much. It was therefore necessary to reduce them to their
          own rank, that they might not overshadow the brightness of Christ. And
          first he proves from his name, that Christ far excelled them, for he
          is called the Son of God.
