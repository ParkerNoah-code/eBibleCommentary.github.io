        <h2>
          Ver 5.
          <em>For to which of the angels did he say at any time, “You are my
            Son.
            Today I have become your father?” and again, “I will be to him a
            Father, and he will be to me a Son?”</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>
        <h2>
          Ver 6.
          <em>When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let
            all the angels of God worship him.”</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>
        <h2>
          Ver 7.
          <em>Of the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, and his
            servants
            a flame of fire.”</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>
        <h2>
          Ver 8-9.
          <em>But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
            The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom. You have
            loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has
            anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>
        <h2>
          Ver 10-12.
          <em>And, “You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the
            earth. The heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish,
            but you continue. They all will grow old like a garment does. You
            will roll them up like a mantle, and they will be changed; but you
            are the same. Your years won’t fail.”</em>
        </h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span></p>
        <h2>
          Ver 13.
          <em>But which of the angels has he told at any time, “Sit at my right
            hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?”</em>

          Ver 14.

            sake of those who will inherit salvation?</em>
