        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          The author of the epistle does not mention his name. Many a
          supposition has been made as to who the author might have been: Paul,
          Luke, Barnabas (so says Tertullian), Apollos (so says Martin Luther),
          Silas or even Aquila and Priscilla have been suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the modern scientists refuse to accept Paul as the author
          because contents, structure and language of the epistle are not
          typical for him. And yet the old Alexandrian tradition ascribes this
          epistle to the apostle Paul. The fact that the author knew Timothy
          well (Heb 13:23) and that Peter who also wrote to Jewish Christians
          mentions an epistle of Paul to them (2 Pet 3:15) speak for the
          Alexandrian tradition. However the addressees of the epistle were
          Jewish Christians in Palestine whereas Peter wrote to the scattered
          strangers (1 Pet 1:1) who lived outside Palestine. If Paul was the
          author one reason for not mentioning his name might be that he was an
          apostle to the nations whereas Peter was an apostle to the Jews (Gal
          2:7-8).
        </p>
        <p>
          As a matter of fact the author of the epistle remains unknown. The
          Holy Spirit who inspired this epistle deliberately wanted to introduce
          the Lord Jesus only as apostle and high priest of our profession (Heb
          3:1). The church father Origines (around 185 to 254 AD) appropriately
          wrote: Only God knows in truth who the author is.
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          The opinions regarding the time of writing differ as much as they do
          in respect to the authorship of the epistle. It is certain though that
          a writing of Clement of Rome (around 95 AD) shows many references from
          the epistle to the Hebrews. From Hebrews itself we see that the Old
          Testament service of offerings in the temple was still in existence
          (Heb 9:6-7; 10:11). The temple and the city of Jerusalem were
          destroyed by the Roman general and later emperor Titus in the year 70
          AD. Many who refuse Paul's authorship conclude for reason of Hebrews
          2:3 and 13:7 that the epistle must not have been written for some time
          after the apostles' death. Saying this, they obviously overlook the
          fact that the apostle Paul himself did not belong to the apostles who
          had seen and heard the Lord Jesus during His ministry.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience, Occasion, and Background</h2>
        <p>
          The epistle starts off as a written sermon and closes in the form of
          an epistle. Neither author nor addressee is mentioned in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title "to the Hebrews" only appears in the 2nd century with
          Clemens of Alexandria (around 150 - 215 AD). As there is no other name
          known for the epistle it probably goes back to a very old tradition.
          But who were these Hebrews, and where did they live?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hebrews" is a name for the Israelites and for the descendants of
          Abraham (cf Gen 14:13; Phil 3:5). And yet the epistle cannot have
          received its name for the fact only that there are so many references
          to the OT in it. The addressees must not only have been very familiar
          with the OT but they are also frequently addressed as originating from
          the people of Israel. To this fact such expressions as "the fathers",
          "the prophets" (Heb 1:1), "the elders" (Heb 11:2) would point. Also
          the mention of Moses, Joshua and Aaron, who all belonged to the chosen
          people of God, confirm the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addressees however had come to the conclusion that God's way of
          salvation was not the divine service of the OT but faith in the Lord
          Jesus Christ (Heb 2:1-4; 3:1; 3:6; 4:1-2; 4:14-16; 6:1-3; 10:13-25).
          The apostle Paul calls such Christians "a remnant according to the
          election of grace" (Rom 11:1-5). These Christians however were
          partially in danger to withdraw from Christendom and to go back to
          Judaism because of the heavy outward pressure of persecution (Heb
          6:4-8; 10:26-31). These were in particular people who had professed to
          be Christians but had no true faith in the Saviour Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to "the scattered strangers" that are the converted Jews
          of the Diaspora (see 1 Pet 1:1) the addressees of the epistle to the
          Hebrews lived in Palestine (Heb 10:11; 10:34; cf Acts 8:1). They were
          taught, admonished and encouraged by this epistle.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          This, in a word, was to instruct Jewish believers that Judaism had
          been superceded by Christianity. Unlike the Gentiles, who, for long
          centuries past, had lost all knowledge of the true God, and, in
          consequence, worshipped idols, the Jews had a Divine religion, and a
          Divinely-appointed place of worship. To be called upon to forsake
          these, which had been venerated by their fathers for over a thousand
          years, was to make a big demand upon them. It was natural that even
          those among them who had savingly believed on Christ should want to
          retain the forms and ceremonies amid which they had been brought up;
          the more so, seeing that the Temple still stood and the Levitical
          priesthood still functioned. An endeavor had been made to link
          Christianity on to Judaism, and as Acts 21:20 tells us there were many
          thousands of the early Jewish Christians who were "zealous of the
          law"â€”as the next verses clearly show, the ceremonial law.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to their natural prejudices, the temporal circumstances of
          the believing Jews became increasingly discouraging, yea, presented a
          sore temptation for them to abandon the profession of Christianity. We
          can scarcely realize the piercing sword which thus wounded their
          inmost heart. That by clinging to the Messiah they were to be severed
          from Messiah's people, was, indeed, a great and perplexing trial; that
          for the hope of Israel's glory they were banished from the place which
          God had chosen, and where the divine Presence was revealed, and the
          symbols and ordinances had been the joy and strength of their fathers;
          that they were to be no longer children of the covenant and of the
          house, but worse than Gentiles, excluded from the outer court, cut off
          from the commonwealth of Israel. This was indeed a sore and mysterious
          trial. Cleaving to the promises made unto their fathers, cherishing
          the hope in constant prayer that their nation would yet accept the
          Messiah, it was the severest test to which their faith could be put,
          when their loyalty to Jesus involved separation from all the sacred
          rights and privileges of Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the need for an authoritative, lucid, and systematic setting
          forth of the real relation of Christianity to Judaism was a pressing
          one. Satan would not miss the opportunity of seeking to persuade these
          Hebrews that their faith in Jesus of Nazareth was a mistake, a
          delusion, a sin. Were they right, while the vast majority of their
          brethren, according to the flesh, among whom were almost all the
          respected members of the Sanhedrim and the priesthood, wrong? Had God
          prospered them since they had become followers of the crucified One?
          or, did not their temporal circumstances evidence that He was most
          displeased with them? Their situation was critical, and there was an
          urgent need that their faith should be strengthened, their
          understanding enlightened, and a fuller explanation be given them of
          Christianity in the light of the Old Testament. It was to meet this
          need that God, in His tender mercy, moved His servant to write this
          Epistle to them.
