        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          I, without hesitation, class it among apostolical writings; nor do I
          doubt but that it has been through the craft of Satan that any have
          been led to dispute its authority. There is, indeed, no book in the
          Holy Scriptures which speaks so clearly of the priesthood of Christ,
          so highly exalts the virtue and dignity of that only true sacrifice
          which he offered by his death, so abundantly treats of the use of
          ceremonies as well as of their abrogation, and, in a word, so fully
          explains that Christ is the end of the Law. Let us not therefore
          suffer the Church of God nor ourselves to be deprived of so great a
          benefit, but firmly defend the possession of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writings that proceed from divine inspiration receive no addition of
          authority from the reputation or esteem of them by whom they were
          written; and this the Holy Ghost hath sufficiently manifested by
          shutting up the names of many of them from the knowledge of the church
          in all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, as to its author, we need not be very solicitous. Some think
          the author to have been Paul, others Luke, others Barnabas, and others
          Clement, as Jerome relates; yet Eusebius, in his sixth book of his
          Church History, mentions only Luke and Clement. I well know that in
          the time of Chrysostom it was everywhere classed by the Greeks among
          the Pauline Epistles; but the Latins thought otherwise, even those who
          were nearest to the times of the Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inability of assigning the writing of this Epistle to any other
          than Paul with any probable arguments induces me to leave it to him
          whose of old it was esteemed to be; for when men began to take to
          conjecture in this matter, they could neither make an end themselves,
          nor fix any bounds unto the imagination of others. Having once lost
          its true author, no other could be asserted with any such evidence, or
          probability, but that instantly twenty more, with as good grounds and
          reasons, might be entitled unto it. It may not, then, be expected that
          now, after so long a season, we put forward any author with certainty,
          but that we content ourselves with affirming it's apostolicity and
          inspiration.
