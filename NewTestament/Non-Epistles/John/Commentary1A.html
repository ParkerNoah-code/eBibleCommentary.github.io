          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to
            be, that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of
            God sent in order to reveal his Father&#x27;s mind to the world.
            What the evangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts
            His existence in the beginning, and His coexistence with the Father.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Word was with God. All things were made by him, and without any
            instrument. Without him was not anything made that was made, from
            the highest angel to the lowest worm. This shows how well qualified
            he was for the work of our redemption and salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The light of reason, as well as the life of sense, is derived from
            him, and depends upon him. This eternal Word, this true Light
            shines, but the darkness comprehends it not. Let us pray without
            ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to behold this Light, that we
            may walk in it; and thus be made wise unto salvation, by faith in
            Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <h2>Devotion</h2>
          <p>
            There is much in these first five verses which is above our reason
            but there is nothing contrary to it. There is much that we cannot
            explain, and must be content humbly to believe. Let us however never
            forget that there are plain practical consequences flowing from the
            passage, which we can never grasp too firmly, or know too well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1.</b> Would we know, for one thing, the exceeding sinfulness of
            sin? Let us often read these first five verses of John&#x27;s
            Gospel. Let us mark what kind of Being the Redeemer of mankind must
            needs be, in order to provide eternal redemption for sinners. If no
            one less than the Eternal God, the Creator and Preserver of all
            things, could take away the sin of the world, sin must be a far more
            abominable thing in the sight of God than most men suppose. The
            right measure of sin&#x27;s sinfulness is the dignity of Him who
            came into the world to save sinners. If Christ is so great, then sin
            must indeed be sinful!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2.</b> Would we know, for another thing, the strength of a true
            Christian&#x27;s foundation for hope? Let us often read these first
            five verses of John&#x27;s Gospel. Let us mark that the Savior in
            whom the believer is bid to trust is nothing less than the Eternal
            God, One able to save to the uttermost all that come to the Father
            by Him. He that was &quot;with God,&quot; and &quot;was God,&quot;
            is also &quot;Emmanuel, God with us.&quot; Let us thank God that our
            help is laid on One that is mighty. (Psalm 89:19). In ourselves we
            are great sinners. But in Jesus Christ we have a great Savior. He is
            a strong foundation-stone, able to bear the weight of a world&#x27;s
            sin. He that believes on Him shall not be confounded. (1 Peter 2:6).
