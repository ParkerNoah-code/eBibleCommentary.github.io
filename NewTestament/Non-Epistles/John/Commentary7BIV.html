              Jesus’ discourse on the vine and the branches, the believer and
              the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              <b>15:1-10</b><br />
              Jesus is the true vine, in which the life of believers, as abiding
              branches, is hid. Abiding in Him, the believer is able to walk in
              purity of life, with Christ sharing in all the interests of his
              life, taking all burdens to Him, and drawing all wisdom and
              strength from Him. It is only the abiding life that bears fruit to
              the glory of the Father.
            </p>
            <p><b>15:9-11</b><br /></p>
            <p>
              <b>15:12-17</b><br />
              Christ proved His love to the world by laying down His life for it
              (1 Jn 3:16) in redemption work. His love to us should ever be the
              standard of measure of our love to others in service for Him.
            </p>
            <h2>Old Testament</h2>
            <p>
              In the Old Testament the vine is the type of Israel, planted by
              the Almighty as the husbandman to adorn, refresh, and quicken the
              earth (Psalms 80; Isa 5:1; 27:2; Jer 2:21; Ezek 19:10; Hos 10:1).
              But Israel proved itself ‘the degenerate plant of a strange vine’
              (Jer 2:21). Jesus, therefore, is here the ‘true vine,’ because He
              is the true Israel of God, in whom is fulfilled all that is
              demanded of the true vine, whether for blessing to the world, or
              for glory to the husbandman (vine-dresser).
            </p>
            <h2>Union with Christ</h2>
            <p>
              1. The relation of the disciples to Christ is one of living union
              as branches in the vine (Jn 15:1-11).
            </p>
            <p>
              2. The result of this union in the lives of the disciples is love
              (Jn 15:12-17).
            </p>
            <p>
              3. And union with Chirst in the midst of an unbelieving world
              (John 15:18-27).
            </p>
            <h2>Cross References</h2>
            <p>
              Jesus uses various metaphors to illustrate himself and his work
              (the bread of life Jn 6:35; the light Jn 8:12; the door Jn 10:7;
              the shepherd Jn 10:11; the vine Jn 15:1).
            </p>
            <p>
              "And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring
              them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one
              flock, one shepherd." (Jn 10:16 ESV).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a
              wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share
              in the nourishing root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant
              toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who
              support the root, but the root that supports you... They were
              broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through
              faith." (Rom 11:17-18, 20 ESV).
            </p>
            <p>
              "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
              creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on
              earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or
              rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for
              him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold
              together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the
              beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he
              might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was
              pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all
              things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood
              of his cross." (Col 1:15-20 ESV).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field, God’s
              building." (1 Cor 3:9 ESV).
            </p>
            <p>
              "The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the
              blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of
              the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who
              are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of
              bread. Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don’t those who eat
              the sacrifices participate in the altar?" (1 Cor 10:16-18).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on
              Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
              free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in
              Christ Jesus." (Gal 3:27-28).
            </p>
            <p>
              "'For this cause a man will leave his father and mother and will
              be joined to his wife. Then the two will become one flesh.' [Gen
              2:24] This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and the
              assembly." (Eph 5:31-32).
