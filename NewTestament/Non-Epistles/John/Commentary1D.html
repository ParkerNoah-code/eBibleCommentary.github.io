          <p>
            As to the order of time and entrance on his work, Christ came after
            John, but in every other way he was before him. The expression
            clearly shows that Jesus had existence before he appeared on earth
            as man. All fullness dwells in him, from which alone fallen sinners
            have, and shall receive, by faith—all that renders them wise,
            strong, holy, useful, and happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our receivings by Christ are all summed up in this one word, grace;
            we have received &quot;even grace,&quot; a gift so great, so rich,
            so invaluable; the good will of God towards us, and the good work of
            God in us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The law of God is holy, just, and good; and we should make the
            proper use of it. But we cannot derive from it pardon,
            righteousness, or strength. It teaches us to adorn the doctrine of
            God our Savior, but it cannot supply the place of that doctrine. As
            no mercy comes from God to sinners but through Jesus Christ, no man
            can come to the Father but by him; no man can know God, except as he
            is made known in the only begotten and beloved Son.
