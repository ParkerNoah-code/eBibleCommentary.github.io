          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            John, after beginning his gospel with a statement of our Lord&#x27;s
            nature as God, proceeds to speak of His forerunner, John the
            Baptist. The contrast between the language used about the Savior,
            and that used about His forerunner, ought not to be overlooked. Of
            Christ we are told that He was the eternal God—the Creator of all
            things—the source of life and light. Of John the Baptist we are told
            simply, that &quot;there was a man sent from God, whose name was
            John.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Men discover their weaknesses to those most familiar with them, but
            it was not so with Christ; those most intimate with him saw most of
            his glory. Although he was in the form of a servant, as to outward
            circumstances—yet, in respect of graces, his form was like the Son
            of God. His Divine glory appeared in the holiness of his doctrine,
            and in his miracles. He was full of grace, fully acceptable to his
            Father, therefore qualified to plead for us; and full of truth,
            fully aware of the things he was to reveal.
          </p>
          <h2>Devotion</h2>
          <p>
            John the Baptist came to bear witness concerning Jesus. Nothing more
            fully shows the darkness of men&#x27;s minds, than that when the
            Light had appeared, there needed a witness to call attention to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christ was the true Light; that great Light which deserves to be
            called so. By his Spirit and grace he enlightens all that are
            enlightened to salvation; and those who are not enlightened by him,
            perish in darkness. Christ was in the world when he took our nature
            upon him, and dwelt among us. The Son of the Highest was here in
            this lower world. He was in the world, but not of it. He came to
            save a lost world, because it was a world of his own making. Yet the
            world knew him not.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he comes as a Judge, the world shall know him. Many say that
            they are Christ&#x27;s own, yet do not receive him, because they
            will not part with their sins, nor have him to reign over them. All
            the children of God are born again. This new birth is through the
            word of God as the means (1 Peter 1:23) and by the Spirit of God as
            the Author. By his Divine presence Christ always was in the world.
            But now that the fullness of time was come, he was, after another
            manner, God manifested in the flesh.
