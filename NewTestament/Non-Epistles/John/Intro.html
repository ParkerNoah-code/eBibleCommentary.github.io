        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to recognize the fact that the author of the Gospel of
          John was an eyewitness to the events he records. The author's identity
          as John the apostle, the son of Zebedee, is virtually unainmous in the
          early tradition.<sup>1</sup> The title, “The Gospel According to
          John,” was likely used from the time it began being circulated because
          there are no extant manuscripts with other names.<sup>2</sup> If
          instead the gospel was originally published anonymously as some claim,
          this is in distinction from the apocryphal gospels which were
          originally published with false names.<sup>3</sup> And as Criag Keener
          notes, "there appears to be unanimity regarding the authorship of the
          four Gospels, suggesting the traditions are early."<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal evidence: The “disciple whom Jesus loves” (Jn 13:23; 19:26;
          20:2; 21:20) is “the disciple who testifies about these things, and
          wrote these things.” (Jn 21:24). This disciple “whom Jesus loved, was
          at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast” at the Last Supper (Jn
          13:23). The Synoptics only mention the disciples and Jesus at this
          celebration (Mk 14:12-26; Mat 26:17-30; Lk 22:7-23). He is standing by
          the cross when Jesus says, “Woman, behold your son!” thus
          commissioning him to care of Mary (Jn 19:27). He is also the one that
          raced Peter to look inside the empty tomb (Jn 20:2-8). It should be
          clear from these verses that the author was not only an eyewitness but
          one of the Twelve. The most notable objection against the internal
          evidence is that John couldn’t have written such fluent Greek, but D.
          A. Carson writes that “the argument no longer stands” pointing out
          that John had years to learn how to write, John's Greek “is not
          elegant,” and he mostly uses the language of the Septuagint (the Greek
          translation of the OT).<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          External evidence: There is a strong tradition that the apostle John
          was the author of this Gospel that has been accepted by nearly all
          throughout church history. Irenaeus, in about 180 AD, writes,
          “Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon
          His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at
          Ephesus in Asia” (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Against Heresies</a
          >, 3.1.1). Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp who was a disciple of
          John the apostle, so his testimony is particularly strong. Clement of
          Alexandria (150-215 AD), who's testimony is saved by Eusebius, says,
          "But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external facts had been
          made plain in the Gospel...composed a spiritual Gospel" (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Church History</a
          >, 6.14.7).
        </p>
        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          Since John was undoubtedly the writer of the fourth Gospel, we have an
          upper limit of A. D. 98, for Irenaeus says that John lived to the time
          of Trajan, who began his reign in that year. The testimony of Jerome
          is to the same effect: “The apostle John lived in Asia to the time of
          Trajan, and dying at a great age in the sixty-eighth year of our Lords
          passion, was buried near the city of Ephesus.” The same writer places
          the death of John in A. D. 100.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all probability, John wrote his Gospel several years before his
          death, since its style is that of a matured, but not of an aged
          writer. We may be sure that the apostle did not compose the Gospel
          until after the death of Paul in A. D. 68. Tradition teaches that John
          wrote later than the Synoptics. The congregations of Asia Minor were
          the special charge of the great apostle of the Gentiles, and he never
          makes any mention in his Epistles of Johns being in their midst, nor
          does he send him a single salutation; and when he parted from the
          Ephesian elders, he evidently did not anticipate the coming of an
          apostle among them. Moreover we infer from Jn 21:19 that John knew of
          the manner in which Peter died, and presupposes this knowledge in his
          readers. Therefore it is unlikely that the Gospel was written before
          A. D. 70. John’s utter silence regarding the destruction of the city
          favors the idea that he wrote the Gospel several years after that
          calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important considerations that led many rationalistic critics
          to the conclusion that the fourth Gospel was written in the second
          century, are the following: (1) The theology of the Gospel, especially
          its representation of Christ, is developed to such a degree that it
          points beyond the first and reflects the consciousness of the Church
          of the second century. (2) The Gospel was evidently written under the
          influence of the philosophic and religious tendencies that were
          prevalent in the second century, such as Montanism, Docetism and
          Gnosticism. (3) The great difference between the fourth Gospel and the
          Synoptics appears to be the result of second century cavilling
          respecting the nature of Christ, and of the Paschal controversy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the idea that the Gospel of John is a second century product goes
          counter to both the internal evidence to which we already referred,
          and to the external testimony, which is exceptionally strong and which
          can be traced back to the very beginning of the second century. Some
          of the Epistles of Ignatius show the influence of John’s Christology,
          and the writings of both Papias and Polycarp contain allusions to the
          first Epistle of John, which was evidently written at the same time as
          the Gospel. The latter was in existence, therefore, in the beginning
          of the second century. The theology of the Gospel of John is no more
          developed than that of Paul’s Epistles to the Ephesians and the
          Colossians, that were written between A. D. 61 and 63. Critics
          generally ceased to place any reliance on the so-called Montanistic
          features of the Gospel, and although they still maintain that some
          passages contain traces of a Docetic Gnosticism, these are purely
          imaginary and readily vanish, when the light of exegesis is turned on.
          The connection of the Gospel with the Paschal controversy is now
          admitted to be very dubious. And the difference between it and the
          Synoptics can be satisfactorily explained without regarding it as a
          work of the second century.
        </p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Of the characteristics that mark the fourth Gospel the following
          especially are to be noted:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The gospel of John emphasizes more than any of the others the
          Divinity of Christ. It has no historical starting-point, like the
          Synoptics, but recedes back into the depths of eternity, and starts
          out with the statement sublime in its simplicity: “In the beginning
          was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”
          Positively, the Logos-doctrine is peculiar to this Gospel; negatively,
          every indication of Christ’s human development and of his gradually
          awakening self-consciousness is strikingly absent from it. We find no
          genealogy here, no description of Christ’s birth with it’s attendant
          circumstances, and no narrative of his baptism and temptation. John
          the Baptist testifies to his Divinity, as soon as He enters on the
          scene, and He himself publicly claims this prerogative almost from the
          beginning of his public ministry, cf. Joh_3:13; Joh_5:17 ff; Joh_6:32;
          Joh_6:40 ff., etc. The miracles of the Lord, narrated in this Gospel,
          are of such a character that they give great prominence to his divine
          power. The nobleman’s son was cured from a distance, Joh_4:46 ff.; the
          man at Bethesda had been infirm thirty-eight years, Joh_5:5; the blind
          man at Jerusalem had been born blind, Joh_9:1; and Lazarus had already
          lain in the grave four days, Joh_11:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The teaching of Christ greatly predominates in Johns Gospel, but
          this is quite different from that contained in the Synoptics. We find
          no parables here but elaborate discourses, which also contain a couple
          of allegories. The all absorbing topic is not the Kingdom of God but
          the Person of the Messiah. The simple rudimentary teaching regarding
          the Kingdom is here replaced by a more penetrating (though not
          developed) instruction in the deeper realities of faith. In connection
          with his miracles or other historical facts Christ presents himself as
          the source of life, 4:46—5:47; the spiritual nourishment of the soul,
          Joh_6:22-65; the water of life, Joh_4:7-16; Joh_7:37-38; the true
          liberator, Joh_8:31-58; the light of the world, Joh_9:5; Joh_9:35-41;
          and the living principle of the resurrection, Joh_11:25-26. The
          farewell discourses of the Saviour, besides containing many profound
          truths respecting his personal relation to believers, are also
          significant on account of their clear references to the coming
          Paraclete.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The scene of action in this Gospel is quite different from that in
          the Synoptics. In the latter the work of Christ in Galilee is narrated
          at length, while He is seen at Jerusalem only during the last week of
          His life. In the Gospel of John, on the other hand, the long ministry
          of Christ in Galilee is presupposed rather than narrated, while his
          work and teaching in Judea and particularly at Jerusalem is made very
          prominent. The great feasts afforded the occasion for this work and
          are therefore distinctly mentioned. John speaks of three, possibly
          four, Passovers, Joh_2:13; Joh_5:1; Joh_6:4; Joh_13:1; of the feast of
          Tabernacles, Joh_7:2; and of the feast of the Dedication, Joh_10:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Gospel of John is far more definite than the Synoptics in
          pointing out the time and place of the occurrences that are narrated;
          it is in a certain sense more chronological than the other Gospels. We
          are generally informed as to the place of Christ’s operation. Definite
          mention is made of Bethany, Joh_1:28; Cana, Joh_2:1; Capernaum,
          Joh_2:12; Jerusalem, Joh_2:13; Sychar, Joh_4:5; Bethesda, Joh_5:2,
          etc. The designations of time are equally distinct, sometimes the hour
          of the day being given. The chronological framework of the gospel is
          found in its reference to the great feasts. John the Baptist sees
          Christ coming to him the day after he had met the delegation from
          Jerusalem, Joh_1:29; and again on the following day, Joh_1:35. A day
          later Christ called Philip and Nathanael, Joh_1:43-51; on the third
          day there was a marriage in Cana, Joh_2:1; it was at the sixth hour
          that Christ sat down at the well, 4:6; at the seventh, that the
          nobleman’s son was cured, Joh_4:52; in the midst of the feast that
          Jesus went into the temple, Joh_7:14; and again on the last great day,
          Joh_7:37; and about the sixth hour that Christ was delivered unto the
          Jews by Pilate, Joh_19:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The style of the fourth Gospel is not like that of the other three.
          It is peculiar in that “it contains, on the one hand, except in the
          prologue and χαρᾷ χαίρειin Joh_3:29, hardly any downright Hebraisms,”
          Simcox, The Writers of the New Testament p. 73, while, on the other
          hand, it approaches the style of Old Testament writers more than the
          style of any other New Testament writing does. John evidently
          commanded a fairly good Greek vocabulary, but does not attempt any
          elaborate sentences. Rather than do this, he will repeat part of a
          previous statement and then add a new element to it. His sentences are
          generally connected in the most simple way by καί, δε or οὖν, and his
          descriptions are often elaborate and repetitious. He exhibits a
          special fondness for contrasts and for the use of the parallelismus
          membrorum. A very characteristic expression of his is ζωὴ αἰώνος,
          which occurs 17 times in the Gospel. For other phrases and expressions
          see Simcox. He also employs several Aramaean words, as ῥαββί, κηφᾶς,
          μεσσίας, Γαββαθά, Γολγοθά, ἀμὴν ἀνήν.
        </p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospel of John was in all probability written primarily for the
          Christians of Asia Minor, among whom especially the heresy of
          Cerinthus had arisen. Early tradition has it that John wrote it at the
          request of the bishops of Asia to combat that heresy. Internal
          evidence certainly favors the hypothesis that it was composed for
          Greek readers. The author carefully interprets Hebrew and Aramaic
          words, as in Joh_1:38; Joh_1:41-42; Joh_9:7; Joh_11:16; Joh_19:13;
          Joh_19:17; Joh_20:16. He makes it a point to explain Jewish customs
          and geographical designations, Joh_1:28; Joh_2:1; Joh_4:4-5; Joh_7:37;
          Joh_11:54, . . . Joh_19:31; Joh_19:40; Joh_19:42. Moreover,
          notwithstanding his characteristically Hebrew style, he usually quotes
          from the Septuagint.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          It was not John’s purpose to furnish a supplement to the Synoptics,
          though his Gospel certainly contains a good deal of supplemental
          matter; neither did he mean to produce a direct polemic against the
          Cerinthian heresy, even if this did to a certain degree determine his
          special way of stating the truth. He did not aim at conciliating the
          discordant parties of the second century by leading them up to a
          higher unity, as the Tubingen school asserted; nor at refuting “Jewish
          objections and invectives,” and at providing “his fellow-Christians
          with weapons ready to hand ;” a hypothesis of which Wrede asserts:
          “This view is on the whole a recent one, but it is making victorious
          progress among scholars.” The Origin of the New Testament, p. 84.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle himself gives expression to his purpose, when he says:
          “These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the
          Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life in his
          name,” Joh_20:31. His aim is twofold, therefore, theoretical and
          practical. He desires to prove that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
          God, and to lead believers to a life of blessed communion with him.
          The means he employs to that end are: (1) The miracles of the Lord, on
          which special emphasis is placed, cf. Joh_20:30; Joh_21:25; and which
          are contemplated as σημεῖα, as signs of the divine glory of Christ.
          (2) The long discourses of the Saviour, which serve to interpret his
          signs and to describe the unique relation in which He stands to the
          Father. And (3) the narratives touching Jesus dealing with
          individuals, such as Nathaniel, Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman,
          Philip, Mary Magdalena and Thomas, showing, how He led them to faith,
          a faith culminating in the confession of Thomas: “My Lord and my God.”
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The great significance of this Gospel in Holy Writ is that it places
          prominently before us the Son of Man as the Son of God, as the eternal
          Word that became flesh. According to this Gospel Christ is the Son of
          God, who descended from the Father, stood in a unique relation to the
          Father, had come to do the Father’s will on earth, and would return to
          the glory that He had eternally possessed with the Father, that He
          might send the Holy Spirit from the Father to abide with his Church
          throughout all ages. In that Spirit He himself returns to his
          followers to dwell in them forever. He is the highest revelation of
          God, and our relation to him, either of faith or of unbelief,
          determines our eternal destiny. Before this Christ the Church bows
          down in adoration with Thomas and calls out: “My Lord and my God.”
