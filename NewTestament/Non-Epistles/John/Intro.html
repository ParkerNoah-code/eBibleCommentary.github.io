        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to recognize the fact that the author of the Gospel of
          John was an eyewitness to the events he records. The author's identity
          as John the apostle, the son of Zebedee, is virtually unainmous in the
          early tradition.<sup>1</sup> The title, “The Gospel According to
          John,” was likely used from the time it began being circulated because
          there are no extant manuscripts with other names.<sup>2</sup> If
          instead the gospel was originally published anonymously as some claim,
          this is in distinction from the apocryphal gospels which were
          originally published with false names.<sup>3</sup> And as Criag Keener
          notes, "there appears to be unanimity regarding the authorship of the
          four Gospels, suggesting the traditions are early."<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal evidence: The “disciple whom Jesus loves” (Jn 13:23; 19:26;
          20:2; 21:20) is “the disciple who testifies about these things, and
          wrote these things.” (Jn 21:24). This disciple “whom Jesus loved, was
          at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast” at the Last Supper (Jn
          13:23). The Synoptics only mention the disciples and Jesus at this
          celebration (Mk 14:12-26; Mat 26:17-30; Lk 22:7-23). He is standing by
          the cross when Jesus says, “Woman, behold your son!” thus
          commissioning him to care of Mary (Jn 19:27). He is also the one that
          raced Peter to look inside the empty tomb (Jn 20:2-8). It should be
          clear from these verses that the author was not only an eyewitness but
          one of the Twelve. The most notable objection against the internal
          evidence is that John couldn’t have written such fluent Greek, but D.
          A. Carson writes that “the argument no longer stands” pointing out
          that John had years to learn how to write, John's Greek “is not
          elegant,” and he mostly uses the language of the Septuagint (the Greek
          translation of the OT).<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          External evidence: There is a strong tradition that the apostle John
          was the author of this Gospel that has been accepted by nearly all
          throughout church history. Irenaeus, in about 180 AD, writes,
          “Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon
          His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at
          Ephesus in Asia” (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Against Heresies</a
          >, 3.1.1). Irenaeus was a student of Polycarp who was a disciple of
          John the apostle, so his testimony is particularly strong. Clement of
          Alexandria (150-215 AD), who's testimony is saved by Eusebius, says,
          "But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external facts had been
          made plain in the Gospel...composed a spiritual Gospel" (<a
            href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Church History</a
          >, 6.14.7). The strongest argument against that claim comes from the
          dating of the book which will be examined in the next section.
        </p>
        <h2>Comparison to the Synoptics</h2>
        <p>
          The Gospel according to John stands out from the Synoptics (Matthew,
          Mark, and Luke) in many ways, providing a unique perspective on the
          life, ministry, and teachings of Jesus. John’s style is highly poetic
          and symbolic. John's symbolism includes images such as light and
          darkness, bread and wine, vine and branches, and shepherd and sheep
          which provide memorable pictures that convey deep spiritual truths
          about Jesus and his mission. John’s Gospel is structured thematically
          around seven signs or miracles that continue to emphasize theological
          truths, especially of Jesus’ divinity.

        <h2>Structure and Outline</h2>
        <p>
          Edward W. Klink III's <em>John</em>, ZECNT is very helpful for
          understanding the structure of John.
