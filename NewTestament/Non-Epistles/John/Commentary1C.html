          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Christ was the true Light; that great Light which deserves to be
            called so. As in the material world there is but one source of light
            to all the heavenly bodies; so in the spiritual world there is one
            Sun of Righteousness, that lights every man that comes into the
            world. There are other lights: John himself was a burning and a
            shining light. But he, and all the rest, shined with a borrowed
            luster. Christ is the only true source both of light and life as
            John has told us.
          </p>
          <p>
            By his Spirit and grace he enlightens all that are enlightened to
            salvation; and those who are not enlightened by him, perish in
            darkness. Christ was in the world when he took our nature upon him,
            and dwelt among us. The Son of the Highest was here in this lower
            world. He was in the world, but not of it. He came to save a lost
            world, because it was a world of his own making. Yet the world knew
            him not.
          </p>
          <h2>Devotion</h2>
          <p>
            Christ is to the souls of men what the sun is to the world. He is
            the center and source of all spiritual light, warmth, life, health,
            growth, beauty, and fertility. Like the sun, He shines for the
            common benefit of all mankind—for high and for low, for rich and for
            poor, for Jew and for Greek. Like the sun, He is free to all. All
            may look at Him, and drink health out of His light.
          </p>
          <p>
            If millions of mankind were mad enough to dwell in caves
            underground, or to bandage their eyes, their darkness would be their
            own fault, and not the fault of the sun. So, likewise, if millions
            of men and women love spiritual &quot;darkness rather than
            light,&quot; the blame must be laid on their blind hearts, and not
            on Christ. &quot;Their foolish hearts are darkened.&quot; (John
            3:19; Rom 1:21). But whether men will see or not, Christ is the true
            sun, and the light of the world. There is no light for sinners
            except in the Lord Jesus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christ was in the world invisibly, long before He was born of the
            Virgin Mary. He was there from the very beginning, ruling, ordering,
            and governing the whole creation. By Him all things are held
            together (Col 1:17). He gave to all life and breath, rain from
            heaven, and fruitful seasons. By Him kings reigned, and nations were
            increased or diminished. Yet men knew Him not, and honored Him not.
            They &quot;worshiped and served the creature rather than the
            Creator&quot; (Rom 1:25). Well may the natural heart be called
            &quot;wicked!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            But Christ came visibly into the world, when He was born at
            Bethlehem, and fared no better. He came to the very people whom He
            had brought out from Egypt, and purchased for His own. He came to
            the Jews, whom He had separated from other nations, and to whom He
            had revealed Himself by the prophets. He came to those very Jews who
            had read of Him in the Old Testament Scriptures—seen Him under types
            and figures in their temple services and professed to be waiting for
            His coming. And yet, when He came, those very Jews received Him not.
            They even rejected Him, despised Him, and slew Him. Well may the
            natural heart be called &quot;desperately wicked!&quot;
