        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
          The contents of this book is naturally divided into two parts; in each
          of which the main topic is the establishment of the Church from a
          certain center:
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The establishment of the Church from Jerusalem, Act_1:1-26,
          Act_2:1-47, Act_3:1-26, Act_4:1-37, Act_5:1-42, Act_6:1-15,
          Act_7:1-60, Act_8:1-40, Act_9:1-43, Act_10:1-48, Act_11:1-30,
          Act_12:1-25. In this part we first have the last discourse of Christ
          to his disciples, the ascension, the choice of an apostle in the place
          of Judas, the fulfilment of the promise in the outpouring of the Holy
          Spirit and the conversion of three thousand, Act_1:1-26, Act_2:1-47.
          Then follows the healing of the lame man by Peter and John; their
          faithful witnessing for Christ in the temple, for which they were
          taken captive by the priests, the captain of the temple and the
          Sadducees; their release, since the enemies feared the people; and
          their thanksgiving for deliverance, Act_3:1-26, Act_4:1-31. Next the
          condition of the Church is described: they had all things in common,
          and severe punishment was meted out to Ananias and Sapphira for their
          deception, Act_4:32-37, Act_5:1-11. On account of their words and
          works the apostles were again imprisoned, but delivered by the angel
          of the Lord; they were brought before the council of the Jews and
          dismissed after a warning, Act_5:12-42. The murmuring of the Grecians
          leads to the appointment of seven deacons, one of which, viz. Stephen,
          wrought miracles among the people, and after witnessing for Christ
          before the council, became the first Christian martyr, Act_6:1-15,
          Act_7:1-60. This is followed by a description of the persecution of
          the Church and the resulting scattering of believers, of the work of
          Philip in Samaria, of Saul’s conversion, and of Peters healing of
          Eneas and raising of Tabitha, Act_8:1-40, Act_9:1-43. Then we have
          Peters vision of the descending vessel, his consequent preaching to
          the household of Cornelius, and the defense of his course before the
          brethren in Judea, Act_10:1-48, Act_11:1-18. The narrative of the
          establishment of the Church at Antioch, of James martyrdom, and of the
          imprisonment and miraculous deliverance of Peter concludes this
          section, Act_11:19-30, Act_12:1-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Establishment of the Church from Antioch. Act_13:1-52,
          Act_14:1-28, Act_15:1-41, Act_16:1-40, Act_17:1-34, Act_18:1-28,
          Act_19:1-41, Act_20:1-38, Act_21:1-40, Act_22:1-30, Act_23:1-35,
          Act_24:1-27, Act_25:1-27, Act_26:1-32, Act_27:1-44, Act_28:1-31. From
          Antioch Barnabas and Saul set out on the first missionary journey,
          including visits to Cyprus, Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and
          Derbe, from where they returned to Antioch, Act_13:1-52, Act_14:1-28.
          Then an account is given of the council of Jerusalem and its decisions
          affecting the Gentiles, Act_15:1-34. After his contention with
          Barnabas, Paul starts out on the second missionary journey with Silas,
          passing through the Cilician gates to Derbe, Lystra, Iconium and
          Troas, whence he was directed by a vision to pass into Europe, where
          he visited Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens and Corinth,
          preaching the gospel and establishing churches. From Corinth he again
          returned to Jerusalem and Antioch, Act_15:35-41, Act_16:1-40,
          Act_17:1-34, Act_18:1-22. Shortly after Paul began his third
          missionary journey, going through Asia Minor, staying at Ephesus for
          over two years, and passing into Corinth, from where he again returned
          to Jerusalem by way of Troas, Ephesus and Cesarea, Act_18:23-28,
          Act_19:1-41, Act_20:1-38, Act_21:1-16. At Jerusalem the Jews sought to
          kill him, his defense both on the steps of the castle and before the
          Sanhedrin merely inciting greater rage and leading to a positive
          determination to kill him, Act_21:17-40, Act_22:1-30, Act_23:1-14. A
          conspiracy leads to Paul’s deportation to Cesarea, where he defends
          his course before Felix, Festus and Agrippa, and on account of the
          unfair treatment received at the hands of these governors, appeals to
          Caesar, Act_23:15-35, Act_24:1-27, Act_25:1-27, Act_26:1-32. From
          Cesarea he is sent to Rome, suffers shipwreck on the way, performs
          miracles of healing on the island Melita, and on reaching his
          destination preaches the gospel to the Jews and remains a prisoner at
          Rome for two years, Act_27:1-44, Act_28:1-31.
        </p>
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          1. The great outstanding feature of this book is that it acquaints us
          with the establishment of Christian churches, and indicates their
          primary organization. According to it churches are founded at
          Jerusalem, Act_2:41-47; Judea, Galilee and Samaria, Act_9:31; Antioch,
          Act_11:26; Asia Minor, Act_14:23; Act_16:5; Philippi, Act_16:40;
          Thessalonica, Act_17:10; Berea, Act_17:14; Corinth, Act_18:18, and
          Ephesus, Act_20:17-38. From the sixth chapter we learn of the
          institution of the deacons office, and from Act_14:23 and Act_20:17-38
          it is clear that elders, also called bishops, were already appointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The narrative which it contains centers about two persons, viz.
          Peter and Paul, the first establishing the Jewish, the second the
          Gentile churches. Consequently it contains several discourses of these
          apostles, as Peters sermon on the day of Pentecost, Act_2:14-36; and
          in the temple, Joh_3:12-26; his defenses before the Jewish council,
          Act_4:8-12; Act_5:29-32; his sermon in the house of Cornelius,
          Act_10:34-43; and his defense before the brethren in Judea,
          Act_11:4-18. And of Paul the book contains the sermons preached at
          Antioch, Act_13:16-41; at Lystra, Act_14:15-18; and at Athens,
          Act_17:22-31; his address to the Ephesian elders, Joh_20:18-31; and
          his defenses before the Jews on the stairs of the castle, Act_22:1-21;
          before the Sanhedrin Act_23:1-6; and before Felix and Agrippa,
          Act_24:10-21; Act_26:2-29.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The many miracles recorded in this writing constitute one of its
          characteristic features. Besides the miracles that are not described
          and of which there were many “signs and wonders” by the apostles,
          Act_2:43; Act_5:12; Act_5:15-16; by Stephen, Act_6:8; by Philip,
          Act_8:7; by Paul and Barnabas, Act_14:3; and also by Paul alone,
          Act_19:11-12; Act_28:1-9 ;—the following miracles are specifically
          described: the gift of tongues, Act_2:1-11; the lame man cured,
          Act_3:1-11; the shaking of the prayer hall, Act_4:31; the death of
          Ananias and Sapphira, Act_5:1-11; the apostles delivered from prison,
          Act_5:19; the translation of Philip, Act_8:39-40; Eneas made whole,
          Act_9:34; Dorcas restored to life, Act_9:36-42; Pauls sight restored,
          Act_9:17; the deliverance of Peter from prison, Act_12:6-10; the death
          of Herod, Act_12:20-23; Elymas, the sorcerer, struck blind,
          Act_13:6-11; the lame man at Lystra cured, Act_14:8-11; the damsel at
          Philippi delivered , Act_16:16-18; the jail at Philippi shaken,
          Act_16:25-26; Eutychus restored to life, Act_20:9-12; Paul unhurt by
          the bite of a poisonous viper, Act_28:1-6; the father of Publius and
          many others healed, Act_28:8-9.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The style of this book is very similar to that of the third Gospel,
          though it contains less Hebraisms. Simcox says that “the Acts is of
          all the books included in the New Testament the nearest to
          contemporary, if not to classical literary usage,—the only one, except
          perhaps the Epistle to the Hebrews, where conformity to a standard of
          classical correctness is consciously aimed at.” The Writers of the New
          Testament, p. 16. The tone is most Hebraic in the first part of the
          book, especially in the sermons in chs. 2 and 13 and in the defense of
          Stephen ch. 7, in all of which the Old Testament element is very large
          ;—and it is most Hellenic in the last part of the book, as in the
          epistle of the church at Jerusalem, the letter of Lysias, the speech
          of Tertullus, and the defense of Paul before Agrippa. This is
          undoubtedly due to the fact that the first part of the book deals
          primarily with Jewish, and last part especially with Gentile
          Christianity.
        </p>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>
          The Greek title of the book is πράξεις ἀποστόλων, Acts of Apostles.
          There is no entire uniformity in the MSS. in this respect. The
          Sinaiticus has simply πράξειςalthough it has the regular title at the
          close of the book. Codex D is peculiar in having πράξις ἀποστόλων, Way
          of acting of the Apostles. We do not regard the title as proceeding
          from the author, but from one of the transcribers; nor do we consider
          it a very happy choice. On the one hand the title, if translated, as
          is done in both the Authorized and the Revised Version, by “The Acts
          of the Apostles,” is too comprehensive, since there are but two
          apostles whose acts are recorded in this book, viz. Peter and Paul. On
          the other hand it is too restricted, because the book contains not
          only several acts, but also many words of these apostles; and also,
          since it records besides these acts and words of other persons, such
          as Stephen, Philip and Barnabas.
        </p>
        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          The voice of the ancient Church is unanimous in ascribing this book to
          Luke, the author of the third Gospel. Irenaeus in quoting passages
          from it repeatedly uses the following formula: “Luke the disciple and
          follower of Paul says thus.” Clement of Alexandria, quoting Paul’s
          speech at Athens, introduces it by, “So Luke in the Acts of the
          Apostles relates.” Eusebius says: “Luke has left us two inspired
          volumes, the Gospel and the Acts.” The external testimony for the
          Lukan authorship is as strong as we could wish for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the question arises, whether the internal evidence agrees with
          thIsa. The book does not directly claim to have been written by Luke.
          Our Scriptural evidence for the authorship is of an inferential
          character. It seems to us that the Lukan authorship is supported by
          the following considerations:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The we-sections. These are the following sections, Act_16:10-17;
          Act_20:5-15; and Act_27:1 to Act_28:16, in which the pronoun of the
          first person plural is found, implying that the author was a companion
          of Paul in part of the apostles travels. Since Paul had several
          associates, different names have been suggested for the author of this
          book, as Timothy, Silas, Titus and Luke, who according to Col_4:14;
          Phm_1:24; and 2Ti_4:11, was also one of the apostles companions and
          best friends. The first two persons named are excluded, however, by
          the way in which they are spoken of in Act_16:19 and Act_20:4-5. And
          so little can be said in favor of Titus that it is now quite generally
          agreed that Luke was the author of the we-sections. But if this is
          true, he is also the author of the book, for the style of the book is
          similar throughout; there are cross-references from the we-sections to
          the other parts of the book, as in Act_21:8, where Philip is
          introduced as one of the seven, while we know only from ch. 6 who the
          seven were, and from Act_8:40, how Philip came to be in Caesarea; and
          it is inconceivable that a later writer should have incorporated the
          we-sections in his work in such a skillful manner that the lines of
          demarcation cannot be discovered, and should at the same time leave
          the tell-tale pronoun of the first person undisturbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The medical language. Dr. Hobart has clearly pointed out this
          feature in both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. Some
          make light of this argument, but Zahn says: “W. K. Hobart hat fur
          Jeden, dem flberhaupt etwas zu beweisen ist, bewiesen, dass der
          Verfasser des lucanischen Werks em mit der Kunstsprache der
          griechischen Medicin vertrauter Mann, em griechischer Arzt gewesen
          ist.” Einl. II p. 429. We find instances of this medical language in
          ἀclύv Act_13:11;paralelumέnov;, Act_8:7; Act_9:33;puretoῖv kaὶ
          dusenterίa sunerxόmenon, Act_25:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Assuming that Luke wrote the third Gospel, a comparison of Acts
          with that work also decidedly favors the Lukan authorship, for: (1)
          The style of these two books is similar, the only difference being
          that the second book is less Hebraistic than the first,—a difference
          that finds a ready explanation in the sources used and in the authors
          method of composition. (2) Both books are addressed to the same
          person, viz. Theophilus, who was, so it seems, a special friend of the
          author. (3) In the opening verse of Acts the author refers to a first
          book that he had written. Taking the points just mentioned in
          consideration, this can be no other than our third Gospel, though
          Baljon, following Scholten, denies thIsa. Geschiedenis v/d Boeken des
          N. V. p. 421.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The book contains clear evidence of having been written by a
          companion of Paul. This follows not only from the we-sections, but
          also from the fact that, as even unfriendly critics admit, the author
          shows himself well acquainted with the Pauline diction. We have
          reasons to think that he did not derive this acquaintance from a study
          of Pauls Epistles; and if this is true, the most rational explanation
          is that he was an associate of Paul and heard the great apostle speak
          on several occasions. Moreover the authors characterization of Paul is
          so detailed and individualized as to vouch for personal acquaintance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The authorship of Luke has not found general acceptance among New
          Testament scholars. The main objections to it appear to be the
          following: (1) The book is said to show traces of dependence on the
          Antiquities of Josephus, a work that was written about A. D. 93 or 94.
          The reference to Theudas and Judas in Act_5:36-37 is supposed to rest
          on a mistaken reading of Josephus, Ant. XX, V, 1, 2. (2) The
          standpoint of the author is claimed to be that of a second century
          writer, whose Christianity is marked by universality, and who aims at
          reconciling the opposing tendencies of his time. (3) The work is held
          by some to be historically so inaccurate, and to reveal such a
          wholesale acceptance of the miraculous, that it cannot have been
          written by a contemporary. There is supposedly a great conflict
          especially between Acts 15 and Galatians 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot enter on a detailed examination of these objections; a few
          remarks anent them must suffice. It is by no means proven that the
          author read Josephus, nor that he wrote his work after the Jewish
          historian composed his Antiquities. Gamaliel, who makes ‘the statement
          regarding Theudas and Judas, may very well have derived his knowledge
          from a different source; and his supposed mistake (which may not be a
          mistake after all) does not affect the authorship, nor the
          trustworthiness of the book. That the standpoint of the author is more
          advanced than that of the Pauline Epistles (Baljon) is purely
          imaginary; it is in perfect harmony with the other New Testament
          writings. And the idea of a struggle between the Petrine and Pauline
          factions is now generally discarded. Historical inaccuracy does not
          necessarily imply that a book was written a considerable time after
          the events. Moreover in the book of Acts there is no such inaccuracy.
          On the contrary, Ramsay in his, St. Paul the Traveler and the Roman
          Citizen has conclusively proved that this book is absolutely reliable
          and is a historical work of the highest order. It may be that some
          difficulties have not yet found an altogether satisfactory solution,
          but this does not militate against the authorship of Luke.
        </p>
        <h2>Composition</h2>
        <p>
          1. Readers and Purpose. It is not necessary to speak at length about
          the readers for whom this book was first of all intended, because like
          the Gospel of Luke it is addressed to Theophilus, and like it too it
          was undoubtedly destined for the same wider circle of readers, i. e.
          the Greeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what was the purpose of the author in writing this book? This is a
          very much debated question. The book of Acts is really a continuation
          of the third gospel and was therefore, in all probability, also
          written to give Theophilus the certainty of the things narrated. We
          notice that in this second book, just as in the first, the author
          names many even of the less important actors in the events, and brings
          out on several occasions the relation of these events to secular
          history. Cf. Act_12:1; Act_18:2; Act_23:26; Act_25:1. Of what did Luke
          want to give Theophilus certainty? From the fact that he himself says
          that he wrote the first book to give his friend the certainty of the
          things that Jesus began to do and to teach, we infer that in the
          second book he intended to give him positive instruction regarding the
          things that Jesus continued to do and to teach through his apostles.
          It seems that he found his program in the words of the Saviour,
          Act_1:8 : “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is
          come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in
          all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.”
          In harmony with this program he describes the march of Christianity
          from Jerusalem, the center of the Jewish Theocracy, to Rome, the
          center of the world. With Paul in Rome, therefore, the authors task is
          finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opposed to this view are those that regard the book as a tendency
          writing, in which history has been falsified with a definite purpose.
          As such we have:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The theory of the Tubingen school, that the book was written to
          conciliate the Petrine and Pauline factions in the early Church, and
          therefore represents Peter as more liberal, and Paul as more Judaistic
          than is in harmony with their own writings. The supposed parallelism
          between Peter and Paul, according to some, ministers to the same
          purpose. This theory in the bald form in which it was broached by
          Baur, is now generally abandoned, and has been modified in various
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The view defended by some later scholars, such as Overbeck and
          Straatman, that the book of Acts is really an apology for Christianity
          over against the Gentiles, especially the Romans. Hence the author
          gives the Romans due honor, and clearly brings out the advantages
          which Paul derived from his Roman citizenship. He desires to convey
          the impression that the doctrine taught by Paul, who was protected by
          the mighty arm of Rome, who was acquitted of false charges by Roman
          governors, and who with a good conscience appealed to Caesar himself,
          could not be regarded as dangerous to the state. Wrede considers this
          a subordinate purpose of the author.
        </p>
        <p>
          The abiding merit of these theories is that they contemplate the book
          of Acts as an artistic whole. For the rest, however, they do not
          commend themselves to our serious consideration. The basis on which
          they rest is too uncertain; they are not borne out by the facts; they
          are inimical to the well established historicity of the book; and they
          come to us with the unreasonable demand, born of unbelief and aversion
          to the miraculous, to consider the author as a falsifier of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. As to the time, when the book was composed little
          can be said with certainty. It must have been written after A. D. 63,
          since the author knows that Paul staid in Rome two years. But how long
          after that date was it written? Among conservative scholars, such as
          Alford, Salmon, Barde e. a. the opinion is generally held that Luke
          wrote his second book before the death of Paul and the destruction of
          Jerusalem, because no mention whatever is made of either one of these
          important facts. Zahn and Weiss naturally date it about A. D. 80,
          since they regard this date as the terminus ad quem for the
          composition of the third gospel. Many of the later rationalistic
          critics too are of the opinion that the book was written after the
          destruction of Jerusalem, some even placing it as late as A. D. 110
          (Baljon) and 120 (Davidson). Their reasons for doing this are: (1) the
          supposed dependence of Luke on Josephus; (2) the assumption, based on
          Luk_21:20; Act_8:26 ff. that Jerusalem was already destroyed; and (3)
          the supposed fact that the state of affairs in the book points to a
          time, when the state had begun to persecute Christians on political
          grounds. None of these reasons are conclusive, and we see no reasons
          to place the book later than A. D. 63.
        </p>
        <p>The place of composition was in all probability Rome.</p>
        <p>
          3. Method. The problem of the sources used by Luke in the composition
          of this book has given rise to several theories, that we cannot
          discuss here. And it is not necessary that we should do this, because,
          as Zahn maintains, none of these repeated attempts has attained any
          measure of probability; and Headlam says: “The statement of them is
          really a sufficient condemnation.” Hastings D. B. Art. Acts of the
          Apostles. For a good discussion of the various theories of Van Manen,
          Sorof, Spitta and Clemen cf. Knowlings Introduction to Acts in the
          Expositors Greek Testament. With Blass we believe that, if Luke is the
          author, the question of sources for the greater part of the book need
          not be raised. The writer may have learnt the early history of the
          Jerusalem church from Barnabas at Antioch and from several others who
          found refuge in that city after the persecution; from Philip, whose
          guest he was for several days, Act_21:8-15, and with whom he must have
          had frequent intercourse during Pauls later stay at Caesarea; and from
          Mnason, an old disciple, Act_21:16. And regarding the missionary
          journeys of Paul he, in all probability, received full information
          from the apostle himself, and could partly draw on his own memory or
          memorandum. It is quite possible that the author had written records
          of the speeches of Peter and Paul, but he certainly did not reproduce
          them literally but colored them in part with his own style.
        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          The book of Acts is a part of the inspired Word of God. We have in it
          the fruit of apostolic inspiration, in so far as we find here speeches
          of some of the apostles and of Stephen, who was filled with the Holy
          Ghost, when he defended his course before the Jewish council, Act_6:5;
          Act_6:10. And in the composition of his book Luke was guided by the
          Holy Spirit, so that the whole work must be regarded as a product of
          graphical inspiration. This follows from the fact that this book is a
          necessary complement of the Gospels, which are, as we have seen,
          inspired records. It is a continuation of the Gospel of Luke, that is
          quoted as Scripture in 1Ti_5:18 (cf. Luk_10:7). If the Gospel is
          inspired, then,. assuredly, the work that continues its narrative is
          also written by inspiration. Moreover we find that the Church fathers
          from the earliest time appeal to this book as of divine authority,—as
          an inspired work.
        </p>
        <h2>Canonical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The place of Acts in the canon of Holy Scripture has never been
          disputed by the early Church, except by such heretical sects as the
          Marcionites, the Ebionites and the Manichaeans, and then only on
          dogmatical grounds. Traces of acquaintance with it are found in the
          apostolic fathers, as also in Justin and Tatian. Irenaeus, Clement of
          Alexandria and Tertullian frequently quote from this book. It is named
          in the Muratorian canon, and is also contained in the Syriac and old
          Latin Versions. These testimonies are quite sufficient to show that it
          was generally accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an integral part of Scripture it is inseparably connected with the
          Gospels, and reveals to us, how the Gospel was embodied in the life
          and institution of the Church. We here see that the sowing of the
          precious seed that was entrusted to the apostles resulted in the
          planting and extension of the Church from three great racial centers
          of the world, from Jerusalem, the center of the Jewish Theocracy, from
          Antioch, the center of Greek culture, and from Rome, the capital of
          the world. The Gospels contain a revelation of what Jesus began to do
          and to teach; the book of Acts shows us what he continued to do and to
          teach through the ministry of men. There is an evident advance in the
          teaching of the apostles; they have learnt to understand much that was
          once a mystery to them. In the Gospels we find that they are forbidden
          to tell anyone that Jesus is the Messiah; here we read repeatedly that
          they preach Christ and the resurrection. They now exhibit Christ in
          his true character as the Prince of Life and as the King of Glory. And
          the effect of their teaching was such as to bear striking evidence to
          the regenerating power of Him, who by the resurrection from the dead
          was powerfully declared to be the Son of God.
