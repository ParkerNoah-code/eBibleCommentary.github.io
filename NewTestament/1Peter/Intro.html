        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Location of Writing</h2>
        <p>
          As to the place from which he wrote, all do not agree. There is,
          however, no reason that I see why we should doubt that he was then at
          Babylon, as he expressly declares. But as the persuasion had
          prevailed, that he had moved from Antioch to Rome, and that he died at
          Rome, the ancients, led by this sole argument, imagined that Rome is
          here allegorically called Babylon. But as without any probable
          conjecture they rashly believed what they have said of the Roman
          episcopate of Peter, so also this allegorical figment ought to be
          regarded as nothing. It is indeed much more probable that Peter,
          according to the character of his apostleship, traveled over those
          parts in which most of the Jews resided; and we know that a great
          number of them were in Babylon and in the surrounding countries.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          The design of Peter in this Epistle is to exhort the faithful to a
          denial of the world and a contempt of it, so that being freed from
          carnal affections and all earthly hindrances, they might with their
          whole soul aspire after the celestial kingdom of Christ, that being
          elevated by hope, supported by patience, and fortified by courage and
          perseverance, they might overcome all kinds of temptations, and pursue
          this course and practice throughout life.
