        <h2>Canonical Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          The canonicity of the Epistle is abundantly attested by early
          Christian literature. It is the first one of the New Testament
          writings that is cited by name by one of the apostolic fathers.
          Clement of Rome says in his first Epistle to the Corinthians: “Take
          the Epistle of the blessed Paul the apostle into your hands etc.” The
          writings of the other apostolic fathers, viz. Barnabas, Hermas,
          Ignatius and Polycarp show clear traces of the use of this Epistle.
          From Irenaeus on it is quoted as Holy Scripture. The Gnostics regarded
          it with special favor. It was found in Marcion’s canon, in the
          Muratorian Fragment etc. The testimony to it is very full and clear.
        </p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>
          In the Epistle to the Romans we have a statement of the way of
          salvation with special reference to the legalistic Romans; in this
          Epistle we find an exposition of it particularly with a view to the
          philosophically inclined Greeks. It clearly reveals that the way of
          worldly wisdom is not the way of life, a valuable lesson for the
          Church of all ages. But there is still another phase that gives the
          Epistle permanent value; it contains the doctrine of the cross in its
          social application. In it we see the church of God in the world with
          all its glitter and show, its temptations and dangers, its errors and
          crimes, and are taught to apply the principles of the Christian
          religion to the diversified relations of life, as we meet them in the
          bustle of a great and wicked city.
