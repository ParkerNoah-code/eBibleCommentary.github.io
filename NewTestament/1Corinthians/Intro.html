        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>CONTENTS</h2>
        <p>The contents of this Epistle may be divided into five parts:</p>
        <p>
          I. Condemnation of the Factions in the Church, 1Co_1:1-31, 1Co_2:1-16,
          1Co_3:1-23, 1Co_4:1-21. After a brief introduction in 1Co_1:1-9 Paul
          states that he had heard of the divisions among the Corinthians,
          1Co_1:11-12. In arguing against these he points out that his conduct
          was free from party spirit, since this is opposed by the gospel and
          forbidden by the character of Christ, 1Co_1:13-31. Moreover he reminds
          the Corinthians that his preaching had been free from all partisanship
          which glories in the wisdom of man, because the gospel is the message
          of divine wisdom, is revealed by the Spirit and is understood only
          through the Spirit; white party spirit misapprehends the nature of the
          ministry, 1Co_2:1-16, 1Co_3:1-23. He concludes this argument by
          pointing to his own example, 1Co_4:1-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The Necessity of Church Discipline urged, 1Co_5:1-13, 1Co_6:1-20.
          The Corinthians are exhorted to cast out the incestuous person,
          1Co_5:1-13; to desist from lawsuits before the unrighteous,
          1Co_6:1-11; and to flee from fornication, Rom_6:12-20.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Answer to Inquiries sent from the Church, 1Co_7:1-40, 1Co_8:1-13,
          1Co_9:1-27, 1Co_10:1-33, 1Co_11:1-34, 1Co_12:1-31, 1Co_13:1-13,
          1Co_14:1-39. Here we find a discussion of the lawfulness of marriage
          and its duties; directions about mixed marriages and an apostolic
          advice to the unmarried, 1Co_7:1-40. Then follows a discussion of
          Christian liberty in the participation of food offered to the idols,
          in which love must rule, and one must beware of any participation in
          idolatrous practices. The apostle illustrates this principle at length
          by pointing to his own example, 1Co_8:1-13, 1Co_9:1-27, 1Co_10:1-33,
          1Co_11:1. Next the place of woman in the assemblies of the church, and
          the proper observance of the Lord’s supper is considered, 1Co_11:2-34.
          And finally the spiritual gifts manifest in the congregation come in
          for consideration. Their source and diversity, their functions, the
          superiority of love over the extraordinary gifts, and of prophecy over
          the speaking of tongues, and the right service of God,—all receive due
          treatment, 1Co_12:1-31, 1Co_13:1-13, 1Co_14:1-40.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. A Discussion of the Resurrection, 1Co_15:1-58. The apostle shows
          that the resurrection of Christ is an essential article of the
          apostolic testimony, and is the pledge of our resurrection; and
          answers various objections, describing the nature of the resurrection
          body and the final victory over death.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Conclusion, 1Co_16:1-24. In this chapter the apostle commends to
          the Corinthians the collection for the saints at Jerusalem, bespeaks a
          good reception for Timothy, and ends his epistle with friendly
          admonitions and salutations.
        </p>
        <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>
          1. This Epistle is the most comprehensive of all the writings of Paul.
          It is just about as long as the letter to the Romans, and contains the
          same number of chapters; but, while the Epistle to the Romans
          systematically treats a single theme, this letter discusses a great
          variety of subjects, such as party spirit, church discipline, marriage
          and celibacy, Christian liberty, the place of woman in the church, the
          significance and use of the charismata, and the resurrection of the
          dead. And the apostle treats of these matters in a very orderly way,
          first taking up the accusations contained in the report of those from
          the household of Chloe, and then answering the questions that were put
          to him in the letter sent by the Corinthians.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Closely connected with the first is a second characteristic, viz,
          that this Epistle is the most practical of all the Pauline letters. It
          reveals to us, as no other New Testament writing does, the snares and
          pitfalls, the difficulties and temptations to which a church just
          emerging from heathendom and situated in a wicked city, is exposed.
          Many of the problems that arose in the Corinthian church constantly
          recur in city congregations. As important as the Epistle to the Romans
          is for instruction in Christian doctrine, the first Epistle to the
          Corinthians is for the study of social relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Little need be said regarding the language of Paul in this Epistle;
          it is the Greek of a Hellenistic Jew. We cannot call it Hebraistic;
          neither is it literary Greek. It is rather the Greek of Paul’s own
          period, containing, aside from a few Hebrew loanwords, such as πάσχα,
          very few words that are found exclusively in the Septuagint. Findlay
          says: “Paul has become in this epistle more than elsewhere τοῖς
          ̔́Ελλησιν ὡς ̔́Ελλην.“ Exp. Gk. Test. II p. 748. The argumentative form
          too in which the apostles thought is cast here, as elsewhere, is far
          more Greek than Hebrew, more Western than Oriental.
        </p>
        <h2>AUTHORSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          This epistle also claims to have been written by Paul, 1Co_1:1-2, and
          bears upon the face of it the earmarks of the great apostle. The
          language, the style, the doctrine, and the spirit which it
          breathes,—are all his; and the historical allusions in 1Co_9:1-27 and
          1Co_16:1-24 fit in exactly with what we know of his life and
          acquaintances from other sources. Besides this there is an imposing
          body of external evidence from Clement of Rome down to the
          authenticity of the letter. Hence it, like that written to the Romans,
          has been remarkably free from hostile attacks. Robertson and Plummer
          truly say in the Introduction to their Commentary on this Epistle p.
          XVI: “Both the external and the internal evidence for the Pauline
          authorship are so strong that those who attempt to show that the
          apostle was not the writer succeed chiefly in proving their own
          incompetence as critics.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The free-lance Bruno Bauer was the first, and for a long time the only
          one, to attack the genuineness of I Corinthians. But in the last two
          decennia of the preceding century the Dutch critics Loman, Pierson,
          Naber and Van Manen, and the Swiss professor Steck chimed in with a
          most irresponsible kind of criticism, founded on supposed
          inconsistencies and evidences of composite authorship found in the
          Epistle, and on imaginary conflicts between it and the Acts of the
          Apostles. No critic of name takes their argument serious; according to
          the general estimate they are scarcely worth the paper on which they
          are written.
        </p>
        <h2>THE CHURCH AT CORINTH</h2>
        <p>
          1. Its Origin. After Paul left Athens on his second missionary
          journey, he came to the capital of Achaia,—to Corinth, a city situated
          on the isthmus of the Peloponnese between the Ionian and the Aegean
          sea. It was not the old Corinth, since this had been destroyed by
          Mummius in 146 B. C., but Corinth redivivus, Corinth rebuilt by Ceasar
          just a hundred years later, that had rapidly risen in fame, and now
          had a population of between six and seven hundred thousand, consisting
          of Romans, Greeks, Jews and people of such other nationalities as were
          attracted by the commercial advantages of Corinth. The East and the
          West met there, and it soon became the mart of the world, where
          unparalleled riches were found alongside of the deepest poverty. And
          with the increase of riches and luxury came a life of ease and
          licentiousness. Worldly wisdom and great moral degradation went hand
          in hand. On the Acropolis shotie the temple of Venus, where a thousand
          maidens devoted themselves to the sensual service of the goddess.
          Corinthian immorality became a byword; and the expression to live like
          a Corinthian (κορινθιάζειν) was indicative of the greatest
          licentiousness. Farrar says: “Corinth was the Vanity Fair of the Roman
          Empire, at once the London and the Paris of the first century after
          Christ.” St. Paul I p. 556.
        </p>
        <p>
          To that worldly-wise profligate Corinth Paul wended his way with a sad
          heart in A. D. 52. Depressed in spirit because of past experiences, he
          began his labors in the synagogue, preaching to the Jews; but when
          they opposed him, he turned to the Gentiles and taught them in the
          house of a certain Justus. Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, became
          one of his first converts, and many others believed and were baptized,
          Act_18:1-8. Encouraged by a vision, he now began a ministry of a year
          and a half in that city. The Jews, filled with hatred, brought him
          before Gallio, the proconsul of Achaia, but did not succeed in making
          out a case against him. Even after this incident he labored a long
          time in Corinth and the adjacent country and undoubtedly established
          the Corinthian church on this occasion, Act_18:18; 1Co_1:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Its Composition and Character. We may be sure that the church
          consisted primarily of Christians from the Gentiles. This impression
          is conveyed by the account of Pauls work in Corinth, preserved for us
          in Act_18:1-28, and is strengthened by a careful study of the epistle.
          The apostle says of the congregation, describing it according to its
          main constituent element: “Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away
          unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led,” 1Co_12:1. Yet the church
          also comprised many Jews, as we may infer from Act_18:8; 1Co_1:12;
          1Co_7:18; 1Co_12:13. The majority of the converts were of the poorer
          classes, 1Co_1:26; but there were also Crispus, the ruler of the
          synagogue, Act_18:8; 1Co_1:14, Erastus, the chamberlain of the city
          and Gaius, Paul’s host, Rom_16:23, and several others that were in
          more favorable circumstances, as we may infer from 1Co_11:21-22.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as the complexion of the church is concerned we find that it
          bore the impress of its surroundings. There was a shallow
          intellectualism, coupled with a factiousness that was “the inveterate
          curse of Greece.” Lax morals and unseemly conduct disgraced its life.
          Christian liberty was abused and idolatrous practices were tolerated.
          Even the gifts of the Holy Spirit gave rise to vainglory; and a false
          spiritualism led, on the one hand, to a disregard of bodily sin, and,
          on the other, to a denial of the bodily resurrection. But these faults
          should not blind us to the fact that there was a great deal in the
          church of Corinth that was praiseworthy. The social relations among
          the Corinthians had already undergone to a certain degree the
          elevating and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit; the church was
          rich in spiritual gifts, and was willing to impart of its substance to
          the poor saints at Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The divisions at Corinth deserve more than a passing notice, since
          they are made so prominent in the Epistle. The question is, whether we
          can determine the character of the existing parties. In attempting
          this we desire to point out first of all that they were no parties in
          the strict sense of the word, each with an organization of its own,
          but merely dissensions in the church, representing a difference of
          opinion. They had not led to an absolute split in the ranks of
          believers, for Paul distinctly recognizes a certain feeling of unity
          in the church of Corinth, since he mentions meetings of the whole
          church repeatedly, 1Co_11:18; 1Co_14:23. Yet there were four divisions
          of which each one had his own slogan.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Some said: “I am of Paul!” This party is mentioned first, not
          necessarily because it comes first in chronological order. Since the
          church had been founded by Paul, it would seem that a separate party,
          using the apostles name as their shibboleth, could only arise in
          opposition to another. It consisted most likely of those
          serious-minded believers who had regard to the contents of the gospel
          preaching rather than to its form; and who heartily accepted the
          simple doctrine of the cross, as Paul preached it, who had come to
          them without wisdom of words that the cross of Christ might not be
          made of non-effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Others said: “I am of Apollos!” We do not believe that the
          preaching of Apollos differed essentially from that of Paul, nor that
          he was to blame for the dissension that arose as a result of his work.
          Paul himself bears witness to his perfect unity of spirit with
          Apollos, where he says that Apollos watered what he had planted, and
          that he that planteth and he that watereth are one, 1Co_3:6-8; and
          that he had greatly desired to send Apollos with Timothy and the other
          brethren to Corinth, 1Co_15:12. And is it not likely that Apollos
          refused to go, just because he feared that it might foster the party
          spirit? The Apollos Christians were in all probability those cultured
          Greeks who, while they were in accord with the doctrine of free grace,
          greatly preferred a speculative and oratorical presentation of it to
          the simple preaching of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Still others said: “I am of Cephas!” While the two former parties
          undoubtedly constituted the bulk of the congregation, there were also
          some who had scruples regarding the doctrine of free grace. They were
          conservative Jewish believers that adhered to the decisions of the
          council of Jerusalem and persisted in certain legal observances.
          Naturally they in spirit rallied around Peter, the apostle of
          circumcision. It may be that the tradition preserved by Dionysius of
          Corinth is true that Peter has at one time visited Corinth. If it is,
          this helps to explain their watchword.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Finally there were also those who said: “I am of Christ!” This
          party has always been the most difficult to characterize, and, as a
          result, a great number of theories have been broached. After F. C.
          Baur many interpreted this “of Christ” in the light of 2Co_10:7, where
          the opponents of whom Paul speaks are ultra-Judaists. On that theory
          the Christ-party would be even more strictly Jewish than the party of
          Peter. Others, such as Hilgenfeld and Hausrath maintain that it
          consisted of those that had been in personal relation with the Lord,
          and probably belonged to the five hundred of 1Co_15:5. Godet suggests
          that they were such as were embued with the spirit of Cerinthus, and
          believed in Christ in distinction from the human Jesus. He identifies
          them with those who would call Jesus accursed, 1Co_12:3. We prefer to
          think with Meyer, Ellicott, Alford, Findley (Exp. Gk. Test.) and
          Biesterveld that it consisted of the ultra-pious ones who, despising
          all human leadership, arrogated the common watchword as their own
          private property, and by so doing made it a party slogan. They
          regarded themselves as the ideal party, were filled with spiritual
          pride, and thus became a great stumbling block for the apostle. The
          key to this interpretation is found in 1Co_3:22-23, where the apostle
          offers a corrective for the party spirit, when he says: “Whether Paul,
          or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
          present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Christ’s and
          Christ is God’s.” Findlay correctly remarks that “the catholic ὑμεῖς
          Χριστοῦ swallows up the self-assertive and sectarian Εγὼ δὲ Χριστοῦ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Pauls Communications with it. There are two questions that call for
          consideration under this heading: a. How often did Paul visit Corinth?
          and b. Did he write more letters to the Corinthian church than we now
          possess?
        </p>
        <p>
          a. We know that Paul visited Corinth in A. D. 52, Act_18:1, and again
          in 57, Act_20:2. Are there traces of any other visits? The allusions
          in 2Co_2:1; 2Co_12:14; 2Co_13:1 seem to imply that he had been in
          Corinth twice before he wrote II Corinthians, and hence prior to the
          visit of A. D. 57. In all probability we must assume a visit not
          recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. The question is, however,
          whether we must place it before the writing of I Corinthians, or
          between this and the composition of II Corinthians. This cannot be
          decided absolutely with the data at hand, but we consider it
          preferable to place it before the first Epistle: (1) because the time
          intervening between the two letters is so short that a trip to Corinth
          in that time is exceedingly improbable; (2) Since, Timothy and Titus
          having been in Corinth a part of that time, we cannot understand, what
          could make it imperative for Paul to make such a hasty visit; and (3)
          II Corinthians constantly refers to things written in the first
          Epistle in a way that would not have been necessary if Paul had
          already been in Corinth himself. In favor of placing it after the
          writing of the first Epistle, it is urged that I Corinthians does not
          refer to a visit that shortly preceded it.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It seems to us that Paul unquestionably wrote more epistles to the
          Corinthians than those which we now possess. In 1Co_5:9 the author
          clearly refers to an earlier letter, forbidding intercourse with
          immoral persons. That letter had been misunderstood, and therefore the
          impression it made is now corrected by the apostle. Very likely it
          also spoke of the collection for the saints at Jerusalem, 1Co_16:1,
          and conveyed the apostles intention to visit Corinth both before and
          after his visit to Macedonia, to which 2Co_1:15-16 refers, and which
          he changed before writing I Corinthians (cf. 1Co_16:5), thereby
          unwittingly exposing himself to the calumny of his enemies,
          2Co_1:15-18. From 2Co_7:6-8 some infer that another letter, far more
          censorious than I Corinthians intervened between the two canonical
          letters, and caused the apostles uneasiness; but the evidence is not
          strong enough to warrant the conclusion.
        </p>
        <h2>COMPOSITION</h2>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. This letter was occasioned by reports which
          Paul received from Corinth and by a series of questions that were put
          to him by the Corinthians. Those who were of the house of Chloe told
          him of the divisions in their home church, 1Co_1:11, and common report
          had it that fornication and even incest was permitted in the
          congregation, 1Co_5:1. Moreover the church sent a letter, probably by
          the hand of Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus, 1Co_16:17, asking the
          apostles opinion in several matters, as marriage, 1Co_7:1; the eating
          of meat offered to the idols, 1Co_8:1; the proper conduct in the
          church, 1Co_11:2; the right use of the spiritual gifts, 1Co_12:1; and
          in all probability also respecting the doctrine of the resurrection,
          1Co_15:1-58.
        </p>

          In harmony with this occasion the purpose of the Epistle is especially
          twofold: In the first place the apostle desires to quench the party
          spirit that was rife among the Corinthians that he might lead them all
          to the unity of faith that is in Jesus Christ; and to correct the
          other evils that were found in the church, such as the case of incest
          and the irregularities that disgraced their Agapae, which culminated
          in the Lords Supper. And in the second place it was his aim to give
          the young church, struggling with temptations and baffled by many
          difficult questions, further instruction along the lines indicated by
          them in their letter. With great diligence and care and solicitude for
          the welfare of the congregation the apostle applies himself to this
          task. In answer to the question, whether he also intended to defend
          his apostleship over against his enemies we would say that, though
          this was not altogether absent from his mind (cf. 1Co_4:1-21 and
          1Co_9:1-27), he does not aim at this directly like he does in writing
          II Corinthians, when the hostility of the false teachers has become
          far more pronounced.

          2. Time and Place. The place, where this Epistle was written, is
          clearly indicated in 1Co_16:8, and therefore does not call for further
          discussion. This also aids us in determining the time of writing. The
          only stay of Paul at Ephesus of any duration is described in
          Act_19:1-41. If our chronological calculations are correct, he came
          there in A. D. 54 and, after a stay of three years, left there again
          in 57. According to 1Co_16:8 he wrote the epistle toward the end of
          his Ephesian ministry, before Pentecost of A. D. 57, and therefore
          probably in the early part of that year. We cannot conclude from
          1Co_5:7 that it was when the feast of unleavened bread was celebrated,
          although it is very well possible that the nearness of that feast gave
          rise to the line of thought developed in that chapter.

        <h2>CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <p>
          The canonicity of the Epistle is abundantly attested by early
          Christian literature. It is the first one of the New Testament
          writings that is cited by name by one of the apostolic fathers.
          Clement of Rome says in his first Epistle to the Corinthians: “Take
          the Epistle of the blessed Paul the apostle into your hands etc.” The
          writings of the other apostolic fathers, viz. Barnabas, Hermas,
          Ignatius and Polycarp show clear traces of the use of this Epistle.
          From Irenaeus on it is quoted as Holy Scripture. The Gnostics regarded
          it with special favor. It was found in Marcion’s canon, in the
          Muratorian Fragment etc. The testimony to it is very full and clear.

        <p>
          In the Epistle to the Romans we have a statement of the way of
          salvation with special reference to the legalistic Romans; in this
          Epistle we find an exposition of it particularly with a view to the
          philosophically inclined Greeks. It clearly reveals that the way of
          worldly wisdom is not the way of life, a valuable lesson for the
          Church of all ages. But there is still another phase that gives the
          Epistle permanent value; it contains the doctrine of the cross in its
          social application. In it we see the church of God in the world with
          all its glitter and show, its temptations and dangers, its errors and
          crimes, and are taught to apply the principles of the Christian
          religion to the diversified relations of life, as we meet them in the
          bustle of a great and wicked city.
