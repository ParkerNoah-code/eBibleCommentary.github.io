        <h2>CONTENTS</h2>
        <p>The contents of this Epistle falls into three parts:</p>
        <p>
          I. Considerations to strengthen Timothy’s Courage, 2Ti_1:1-18,
          2Ti_2:1-13. After the greeting, 2Ti_1:1-2, the apostle urges Timothy
          to stir up his ministerial gift, to be bold in suffering, and to hold
          fast the truth entrusted to him, 2Ti_1:3-14, enforcing these appeals
          by pointing to the deterrent example of the unfaithful and the
          stimulating example of Onesiphorus, 2Ti_1:15-18. Further he exhorts
          him to be strong in the power of grace, to commit the true teaching to
          others, and to be ready to face suffering, 2Ti_2:1-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Exhortations primarily dealing with Timothy’s Teaching,
          2Ti_2:14-26, 2Ti_3:1-17, 2Ti_4:1-18. Timothy should urge Christians to
          avoid idle and useless discussions, and should rightly teach the
          truth, shunning vain babblings, 2Ti_2:14-21. He must also avoid
          youthful passions, foolish investigations, and false teachers who, for
          selfish purposes, turn the truth of God into unrighteousness,
          2Ti_2:22-26, 2Ti_3:1-9. He is further exhorted to abide loyally by his
          past teaching, knowing that sufferings will come to every true soldier
          and that deceivers will grow worse, 2Ti_3:10-17; and to fulfill his
          whole duty as an evangelist with sobriety and courage, especially
          since Paul is now ready to be offered up, 2Ti_4:1-8.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Personal Reminiscences, 2Ti_4:9-22. Paul appeals to Timothy to
          come to Rome quickly, bringing Mark and also taking his cloak and
          books, and to avoid Alexander, 2Ti_4:9-15. He speaks of his desertion
          by men, the protection afforded him by the Lord, and his trust for the
          future, 2Ti_4:16-18. With special greetings, a further account of his
          fellow-laborers, and a final salutation the apostle ends his letter,
          2Ti_4:19-22.
        </p>
        <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
        <p>
          1. II Timothy is the most personal of the Pastoral Epistles.
          Doctrinally it has no great importance, though it does contain the
          strongest proof-passage for the inspiration of Scripture. In the main
          the thought centers about Timothy, the faithful co-laborer of Paul,
          whom the apostle gives encouragement in the presence of great
          difficulties, whom he inspires to noble, self-denying efforts in the
          Kingdom of God, and whom he exhorts to fight worthily in the spiritual
          warfare against the powers of darkness, that he may once receive an
          eternal reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is the last Epistle of Paul, the swan-song of the great apostle,
          after a life of devotion to a noble cause, a life of Christian
          service. We see him here with work done, facing a martyr’s death.
          Looking back his heart is filled with gratitude for the grace of God
          that saved him from the abyss that yawned at his feet, that called and
          qualified him to be a messenger of the cross, that protected him when
          dangers were threatening, and that crowned his work with rich
          spiritual fruits. And as he turns his eyes to the future, calm
          assurance and joyous hope are the strength of his soul, for he knows
          that the firm foundation of God will stand, since the Lord will punish
          the evil-doers and be the eternal reward of his children. He already
          has visions of the heavenly Kingdom, of eternal glory, of the coming
          righteous Judge, and of the crown of righteousness, the blessed
          inheritance of all those that love Christ’s appearance.
        </p>
        <h2>COMPOSITION</h2>
        <p>
          1. Occasion and Purpose. The immediate occasion for writing this
          Epistle was the apostles presentiment of his fast approaching end. He
          was anxious that Timothy should come to him soon, bringing Mark with
          him. In all probability he desired to give his spiritual son some
          fatherly advice and some practical instruction before his departure.
          But we feel that this alone did not call for a letter such as II
          Timothy really Isa. Another factor must be taken in consideration.
          Paul was not sure that Timothy would succeed in reaching Rome before
          his death, and yet realized that the condition of the Ephesian church,
          the danger to which Timothy was there exposed, and the importance of
          the work entrusted to this youthful minister, called for a word of
          apostolic advice, encouragement and exhortation. It seems that the
          Ephesian church was threatened by persecution, 2Ti_1:8; 2Ti_2:3;
          2Ti_2:12; 2Ti_3:12; 2Ti_4:5; and the heresy to which the apostle
          referred in his first epistle was evidently still rife in the circle
          of believers. There were those who strove about words, 2Ti_2:14, were
          unspiritual, 2Ti_2:16, corrupted in mind, 2Ti_3:8, indulging in
          foolish and ignorant questionings, 2Ti_2:23, and fables, 2Ti_4:4,
          tending to a low standard of morality, 2Ti_2:19, and teaching that the
          resurrection was already past, 2Ti_2:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence the object of the Epistle is twofold. The writer wants to warn
          Timothy of his impending departure, to inform him of his past
          experiences at Rome and of his present loneliness, and to exhort him
          to come speedily. Besides this, however, he desired to strengthen his
          spiritual son in view of the deepening gloom of trials and persecution
          that were threatening the church from without; and to fore-arm him
          against the still sadder danger of heresy and apostasy that were
          lurking within the fold. Timothy is exhorted to hold fast the faith,
          2Ti_1:5; 2Ti_1:13; to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
          Christ, 2Ti_2:3-10; to shun every form of heresy, 2Ti_2:16-18; to
          instruct in meekness those that withstand the Gospel, 2Ti_2:24-26; and
          to continue in the things he had learnt, 2Ti_3:14-17.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Time and Place. From 2Ti_1:17 it is perfectly evident that this
          letter was written at Rome. The apostle was again a prisoner in the
          imperial city. Though we have no absolute certainty, we deem it
          probable that he was re-arrested at Troas in the year 67. The
          situation in which he finds himself at Rome is quite different from
          that reflected in the other epistles of the captivity. He is now
          treated like a common criminal, 2Ti_2:9; his Asiatic friends with the
          exception of Onesiphorus turned from him, 2Ti_1:15; the friends who
          were with him during his first imprisonment are absent now,
          Col_4:10-14; 2Ti_4:10-12; and the outlook of the apostle is quite
          different from that found in Philippians and Philemon. It is
          impossible to tell just how long the apostle had already been in
          prison, when he wrote the Epistle, but from the fact that he had had
          one hearing, 2Ti_4:16 (which cannot refer to that of the first
          imprisonment, cf. Php_1:7; Php_1:12-14), and expected to be offered up
          soon, we infer that he composed the letter towards the end of his
          imprisonment, i. e. in the fall of A. D. 67.
        </p>
        <h2>CANONICAL SIGNIFICANCE</h2>
        <p>
          The canonicity of this Epistle has never been questioned by the
          Church; and the testimony to its early and general use is in no way
          deficient. There are quite clear traces of its language in Clement of
          Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, The Acts of Paul and Thecla,
          and Theophilus of Antioch. The letter is included in all the MSS., the
          old Versions and the Lists of the Pauline Epistles. The Muratorian
          Fragment names it as a production of Paul, and from the end of the
          second century it is quoted by name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistle has some permanent doctrinal value as containing the most
          important proof-passage for the inspiration of Scripture, 3:16, and
          also abiding historical significance in that it contains the clearest
          Scriptural testimony to the life of Paul after his first Roman
          imprisonment. But Lock truly says that “its main interest is one of
          character, and two portraits emerge from it.” We have here (1) the
          portrait of the ideal Christian minister, busily engaged in the work
          of his Master, confessing His Name, proclaiming His truth, shepherding
          His fold, defending his heritage, and battling with the powers of
          evil; and (2) the “portrait of the Christian minister, with his work
          done, facing death. He acquiesces gladly in the present, but his eyes
          are turned mainly to the past or to the future.” (Lock in Hastings D.
          B. Art. II Timothy) He is thankful for the work he was permitted to
          do, and serenely awaits the day of his crowning.
