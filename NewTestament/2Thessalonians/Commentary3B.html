            The rebellion refers to the religious falling away (apostasy) which
            takes place in the latter days:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will
              hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will lead
              many astray. Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many
              will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved." (Mat
              24:10-13).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall
              away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and
              doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,
              branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding
              marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to
              be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the
              truth." (1 Tim 3:1-3).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come.
              For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
              arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
              without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without
              self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, traitors, headstrong,
              conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding a
              form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from
              these, also. For some of these are people who creep into houses
              and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by
              various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the
              knowledge of the truth. Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
              so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who
              concerning the faith are rejected." (2 Tim 3:1-8).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that
              the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen.
              By this we know that it is the final hour. They went out from us,
              but they didn’t belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they
              would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be
              revealed that none of them belong to us." (1 Jn 2:18-19).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This
              is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son." (1 Jn
              2:22).
            </p>
            <p>
              "and every spirit who doesn’t confess that Jesus Christ has come
              in the flesh is not of God; and this is the spirit of the
              Antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the
              world already." (1 Jn 4:3).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t
              confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver
              and the Antichrist." (2 Jn 7).

            John Calvin comments, "Paul, however, does not speak of one
            individual, but of a kingdom, that was to be taken possession of by
            Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in the midst of
            God's temple--which we see accomplished in Popery. The revolt, it is
            true, has spread more widely, for Muhammad, as he was an apostate,
            turned away the Turks, his followers, from Christ. All heretics have
            broken the unity of the Church by their sects, and thus there have
            been a corresponding number of revolts from Christ." (<a

            John Gill comments, "but [the rebellion] is to be understood of a
            more general defection in the times of the Papacy; when not only the
            eastern churches were perverted and corrupted by Muhammad, and drawn
            off to his religion, but the western churches were most sadly
            depraved by the man of sin, by bringing in errors of all sorts in
            doctrine, making innovations in every ordinance, and appointing new
            ones, and introducing both Judaism and Paganism into the churches;
            which general defection continued until the times of the
            reformation, and is what the apostle has respect to in 1 Timothy 4:1
            where he manifestly points out some of the Popish tenets, as
            forbidding marriage to priests, and ordering abstinence from meats
            on certain days, and at certain times of the year: this was one
            thing that was to precede the coming of Christ" (<a

            Charles Spurgeon comments, "I believe that, to a large extent, this
            has already happened, and that this 'man of sin' has been revealed.
            This 'son of perdition' has had a long, dark, and terrible reign
            over myriads of men, and still he sits on the seven hills of Rome,
            and rules over multitudes of his fellow sinners. But Paul held that
            it was consistent to expect the Lord to come quickly, and yet to
            know that certain events must occur before He did come. That is just
            the condition, I think, to which a man’s mind will come if he
            diligently and impartially reads the Scriptures, especially the
            prophetic parts of them. The Lord will come in such an hour as we
            think not, yet there are clear indications of certain things which
            are to happen before He does come." (<a

            Gary Shogren comments, "We need not restrict 'lawlessness' (ἀνομία)
            to a meaning such as 'without the Mosaic law.' Rather, it refers
            more broadly to the refusal to submit to the authority of God as
            creator, the refusal to acknowledge God as God." (1 & 2

            James Coffman comments, "Sitteth… This is a most peculiar verb to be
            used in such a context; and this writer, who has seen the Pope borne
            into the Basilica of St. Peter, hoisted above the people and
            elevated above the high altar upon the shoulders of those who carry
            him (literally 'sitting') into the sanctuary cannot escape the deep
            impression that a prophecy of that very spectacle is imbedded in
            this remarkable verb. Who else, ever, in the history of humanity,
            always entered the church house 'sitting,' and even taking the
            Lord’s Supper 'sitting'? Luther was outraged by this, and said, 'Let
            the Pope stand up to take the Lord’s Supper, like any other stinking
            sinner.'" (<a

            F. F. Bruce comments, "few would have thought it necessary to think
            of a literal throne; it would simply have been regarded as a graphic
            way of saying that he plans to usurp the authority of God." (Word

            G. K. Beale comments, "Consequently, 2:3-4 teaches that the
            latter-day assailant will come into the midst of the church and
            cause it to become predominantly apostate and unbelieving... In
            essence, the antichrist pretends to be the ultimate Lawgiver, and
            the laws he gives contradict the God of the Bible's laws" (1-2
            Thessalonians, IVP: Downers Grove, 2003).

            Gene L. Green comments, "Whether we understand the final clause of
            v. 7 as active or passive, the verse in no way indicates that the
            Holy Spirit or the church will in some way be taken out of the
            world. This is hardly an adequate foundation for the commonly held
            teaching that the rapture of the church will happen sometime before
            the antichrist is revealed!" (The Letters to the Thessalonians,

            his reminder that Jesus will ultimately triumph is intended to
            reinforce the Thessalonians' hope for the future." (The Story of

            Michael W. Holmes comments, "The parallel with the coming of Jesus

            Antichrist, an evil parody of the true coming of the genuine Christ,

            John Calvin comments, "He means that errors will not merely have a
            place, but the wicked will be blinded, so that they will rush
            forward to ruin without consideration. For as God enlightens us
            inwardly by his Spirit, that his doctrine may be efficacious in us,
            and opens our eyes and hearts, that it may make its way thither, so
            by a righteous judgment he delivers over to a reprobate mind (Romans
            1:28) those whom he has appointed to destruction, that with closed
            eyes and a senseless mind, they may, as if bewitched, deliver
            themselves over to Satan and his ministers to be deceived. And
            assuredly we have a notable specimen of this in the Papacy. No words
            can express how monstrous a sink of errors there is there, how gross
            and shameful an absurdity of superstitions there is, and what
            delusions at variance with common sense. None that have even a
            moderate taste of sound doctrine, can think of such monstrous things
            without the greatest horror. How, then, could the whole world be
            lost in astonishment at them, were it not that men have been struck
            with blindness by the Lord, and converted, as it were, into stumps?"

            John Gill comments, "So that they call evil good, and good evil, and
            do not appear to have the common sense and reason of mankind, at
            least do not act according to it; and by giving them up to judicial
            blindness and hardness of heart, and to the god of this world, to
            blind their minds; and without this it is not to be accounted for,
            that the followers of antichrist should give into such senseless
            notions as those of transubstantiation, works of supererogation, or
            into such stupid practices as worshipping of images, praying to
            saints departed, and paying such a respect to the pretended relics
            of saints, as they do; but a spirit of slumber is given them, and
            eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear,
            because of their rejection of the Gospel." (<a
