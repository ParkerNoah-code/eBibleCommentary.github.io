          <p>
            *Following the NASB, I'm using "apostasy" instead of "rebellion."
            The greek ἀποστασία (apostasia), from which we get the english word
            apostasy, can refer to a political or religious rebellion,
            defection, revolt, apostasy. Most modern commentators agree that the
            context in verses 3-4 makes it clear that Paul is referring to a
            religious apostasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            **Following most modern translations, I'm using "the man of
            lawlessness" as opposed to "the man of sin" (see
            <a
              href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm"
              target="_blank"
              >BibleHub</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Let no one deceive you in any way</em>. By any of the above
            means: by pretending to a revelation from the Spirit; or to have had
            it from the mouth of anyone of the apostles; or to have a letter as
            from them, declaring the day of Christ to be instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The apostasy</em>. The apocalyptic context suggests the
            rebellion Paul is referring to is a religious rebellion as opposed
            to a political rebellion. The apostle speaks of some very great
            apostasy, not only of some converted Jews or Gentiles, but such as
            should be very general, and should give occasion to the revelation
            of rise of antichrist, that man of sin. Though the apostacy is
            universal in nature, yet it is not absolute because a few witnesses
            will survive (Rev. 11:3). This is revealed so that believers may
            diligently guard against being seduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was so in the Old-Testament church. For example, soon after men
            began to call upon the name of the Lord all flesh corrupted their
            way,--soon after the covenant with Noah the Babel-builders bade
            defiance to heaven,--soon after the covenant with Abraham his seed
            degenerated in Egypt,--soon after the Israelites were planted in
            Canaan, when the first generation was worn off, they forsook God and
            served Baal,--soon after God's covenant with David his seed
            revolted, and served other gods,--soon after the return out of
            captivity there was a general decay of piety, as appears by the
            story of Ezra and Nehemiah; and therefore it was no strange thing
            that after the planting of Christianity there should come a falling
            away.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The man of lawlessness</em>. Not meaning that this man is
            without the Mosaic law but that he is characterized by his refusal
            to submit to God's law. Lawlessness has a connotation of pagan
            influence. It recalls the prophecy in Daniel 11:21-45 about
            Antiochus Epiphanes who thought of himself as God, plundered the
            temple, and killed many Jews.
          </p>

          <h2>
            4.
            <em
              >He opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or
              that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God,
              setting himself up as God.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em
              >He opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God or
              that is worshiped</em
            >. The veneration demanded by the Roman emperor, the
            self-exaltation, refusal to submit to God, the persecution of God's
            people, and the evils of paganism are all pictures we get from this
            language. Just as the emperor would compel men to be subject to him,
            this figure will impose his authority on all, opposing the real God
            and the proper worship of Him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>So that he sits as God... setting himself up as God</em>. This
            figure not only opposes God's law but makes himself out to be God.
            He will try to subvert God's law by setting up his own. The man of
            lawlessness will promote a worship even worse than the worst kind of
            paganism. In other words, he sets himself up as the Ultimate
            Lawgiver, Judge, Ruler, Savior, and object of attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In the temple of God</em>. This latter-day assailant will be
            seated in the midst of God's people. The church is the body of
            Christ and the true temple of God (1 Cor 3:16; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph.
            2:22; 2 Thes. 2:4; Heb. 8:2). In the New Covenant, Old Testament
            concepts shed their external, national meaning and become manifest
            in their spiritual and eternal sense. "The church enjoys the
            presense of God through the indwelling Spirit, and the church
            administers forgiveness of sins through the gospel, experiencing a
            foretaste of the age to come, having been made a regenerated (Matt
            19:28; Titus 3:5) new creation (2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15) by the
            life-giving Spirit."
          </p>
          <p>
            Masses of people in the church will be following him to destruction.
            Because this figure is set up in the church, it suggests he will be
            a wolf in sheep's clothing who has infiltrated the church. This
            final Antichrist, who is the culmination of lawlessness and the
            culmination of the series of antichrists throughout history that
            have plagued the church, will be in the center of a majority of the
            visible apostate church.

          <p>
            He won't be working in a veiled way any longer but still many people
            won't recognize him. "But that power of lawlessness will then have a
            singular public, human face that is essentially the reverse image of
            the singular, public human face of the Jew from Nazareth in which
            the glory, holiness, and character of God were displayed [2 Cor
            4:6]."
          </p>
          <p>
            He seems to speak of his rise, which should be occasioned by the
            general apostasy he had mentioned, and to intimate that all sorts of
            false doctrines and corruptions should centre in him which will be
            revealed before put to an end.

          <p>
            "Indeed, the sign of Jesus's death together with what 1 John 2:18
            and 2 Thess. 2:6-7 have said makes it clear that the great
            tribulation, when the anti-christ will come, has already begun to
            take place... At that time [the end of the age], persecution and
            deception, which formerly have affected only part of the church
            throughout history, will be present throughout the worldwide church,
            at which point Christ will return a final time [see Rev. 11:1-13;
            20:1-10]."
          </p>
          <p>
            "According to the Synoptic passages Mark 13:10-14 and Matt.
            24:13-16, it is this very Antichrist who comes after the preaching
            to the Gentiles, just as, according to II Thess. 2:6ff., he will
            come after that which 'still restrains'... other New Testament
            passages would suffiently attest the faith's fundamental viewpoint,
            according to which the mission constitutes the real meaning of the
            present period of redemptive history."

            "These ideas [the coming of the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven
            in Mat 24:3-31 and Mk 13:26-27] are based in turn on Daniel, where
            in chapter 7 the little horn from the fourth beast persecutes God’s
            people until he is suddenly destroyed, the son of man receives the
            kingdom, and his saints rule with him [Dan. 7:8, 11–14, 18, 23–27]."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Breath</em>. "The image that Paul presents with this OT
            allusion, therefore, is not one whereby the man of lawlessness will
            be easily blown over by the mere breath of the Lord Jesus, but
            rather one whereby breath is a potent and fearful weapon used by the
            returning Christ to destroy this eschatological enemy."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Manifestation</em>. "As with 1 Thessalonians 1:10, this appears
            to be an allusion to Christ as Messiah, speaking of him as presently
            in heaven awaiting his role in the final judgment of the wicked...
            where 'manifestation' is intended to emphasize not just the fact of
            his coming, but especially its unmistakable and evidential
            character."

            The rebellion refers to the religious falling away (apostasy) which
            takes place in the latter days:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will
              hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will lead
              many astray. Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many
              will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved." (Mat
              24:10-13).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall
              away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and
              doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,
              branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding
              marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to
              be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the
              truth." (1 Tim 3:1-3).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come.
              For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
              arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
              without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without
              self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, traitors, headstrong,
              conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding a
              form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from
              these, also. For some of these are people who creep into houses
              and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by
              various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the
              knowledge of the truth. Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
              so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who
              concerning the faith are rejected." (2 Tim 3:1-8).

          <p>Many antichrists will continue to arise in the end times:</p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that
              the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen.
              By this we know that it is the final hour. They went out from us,
              but they didn’t belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they
              would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be
              revealed that none of them belong to us." (1 Jn 2:18-19).

            <p>
              "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This
              is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son." (1 Jn
              2:22).
            </p>
            <p>
              "and every spirit who doesn’t confess that Jesus Christ has come
              in the flesh is not of God; and this is the spirit of the
              Antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the
              world already." (1 Jn 4:3).
            </p>
            <p>

              and the Antichrist." (2 Jn 7).

            Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in the midst of
            God's temple--which we see accomplished in Popery. The revolt, it is
            true, has spread more widely, for Muhammad, as he was an apostate,
            turned away the Turks, his followers, from Christ. All heretics have
            broken the unity of the Church by their sects, and thus there have
            been a corresponding number of revolts from Christ." (<a

            be one man. For Christ, the Head of the Church, liveth for ever
            himselfe: and therefore is one person. But Antichrist, the Head of
            Babel, is mortall and (continuing to the end of the world) must
            therfore be perpetuated by <em>successiō</em>: we haue instances in
            this kind. The High Priest, was the Type of Christ. The High Priest,
            that Type of Christ, was not one Person, but the succession. The
            Pope is (called) the Vicar of Christ, not one Person, but the
            succession.

            Matthew Henry comments, "By this apostasy we are not to understand a
            defection in the state, or from civil government, but in spiritual
            or religious matters, from sound doctrine, instituted worship and
            church government, and a holy life. The apostle speaks of some very
            great apostasy, not only of some converted Jews or Gentiles, but
            such as should be very general, though gradual, and should give
            occasion to the revelation of rise of antichrist, that man of sin...
            It was so in the Old-Testament church... for example, soon after men
            began to call upon the name of the Lord all flesh corrupted their
            way,--soon after the covenant with Noah the Babel-builders bade
            defiance to heaven,--soon after the covenant with Abraham his seed
            degenerated in Egypt,--soon after the Israelites were planted in
            Canaan, when the first generation was worn off, they forsook God and
            served Baal,--soon after God's covenant with David his seed
            revolted, and served other gods,--soon after the return out of
            captivity there was a general decay of piety, as appears by the
            story of Ezra and Nehemiah; and therefore it was no strange thing
            that after the planting of Christianity there should come a falling
            away." (<a

            eastern churches were perverted and corrupted by Muhammad, and drawn
            off to his religion, but the western churches were most sadly
            depraved by the man of sin, by bringing in errors of all sorts in
            doctrine, making innovations in every ordinance, and appointing new
            ones, and introducing both Judaism and Paganism into the churches;
            which general defection continued until the times of the
            reformation, and is what the apostle has respect to in 1 Timothy 4:1
            where he manifestly points out some of the Popish tenets, as
            forbidding marriage to priests, and ordering abstinence from meats
            on certain days, and at certain times of the year: this was one

            This 'son of perdition' has had a long, dark, and terrible reign
            over myriads of men, and still he sits on the seven hills of Rome,
            and rules over multitudes of his fellow sinners. But Paul held that
            it was consistent to expect the Lord to come quickly, and yet to
            know that certain events must occur before He did come. That is just
            the condition, I think, to which a man’s mind will come if he
            diligently and impartially reads the Scriptures, especially the
            prophetic parts of them. The Lord will come in such an hour as we

            continuation of true Israel in the midst of which pseudo-covenant
            keepers could exist. This is why Paul can apply prophecies about
            Israel to the church throughout his writings, including the Daniel
            11 prophecy about Israel’s eschatological falling away." (The Temple

            operating within the church... Now that the church is aware that the
            'latter days' or the 'last hour' has begun, they are to remain sober

            through the indwelling Spirit, and the church administers
            forgiveness of sins through the gospel, experiencing a foretaste of
            the age to come, having been made a regenerated (Matt 19:28; Titus

            Antichrist is a secret adversary, foure wayes. First from the last
            verse, Antichrist is termed the Apostasie or the Apostate. Now
            Apostates are Heretikes, and Heretikes pretend open observance, and
            obedience unto Christ: Howsoever by their doctrine they oppose him
            secretly. Therfore since Antichrist is an Apostate, and an Heretike,
            hee is a secret adversary. Secondly, in this fourth verse...
            Antichrist shall sit in the Temple, that is, hee shall place his
            Throne in the Church. Antichrist therefore shall be a secret
            adversary in the Church: not an open adversary of the Church.
            Thirdly, in the 7 verse, the feates of Antichrist... blinde the
            Eyes, that they cannot see, and stop the mouth that they dare not
            say any thing concerning those secret mysteries... Finally in the 8
            verse, Antichrist is sayd to be revealed. It is ridiculous to bring
            a Torch to behold him who doth shew himselfe in the streets, and in
            the sunshine. And as ridiculous it is to imagine a revelation of a
            manifest, professed and open adversary. But Antichrist must be

            bishops of Rome not only opposed God's authority, and that of the
            civil magistrates, who are called gods, but have exalted themselves
            above God and earthly governors, in demanding greater regard to
            their commands than to the commands of God or the magistrate. (2.)
            As God, he sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is
            God. As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and is
            in and with his church now, so the antichrist here mentioned is some
            usurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims
            divine honours; and to whom can this better apply than to the

            elevated above the high altar upon the shoulders of those who carry
            him (literally 'sitting') into the sanctuary cannot escape the deep
            impression that a prophecy of that very spectacle is imbedded in
            this remarkable verb. Who else, ever, in the history of humanity,
            always entered the church house 'sitting,' and even taking the
            Lord’s Supper 'sitting'? Luther was outraged by this, and said, 'Let

            arrive at its height; and so it was in effect that the universal
            corruption of doctrine and worship in the Romish church came in by
            degrees, and the usurpation of the bishops of Rome was gradual, not
            all at once; and thus the mystery of iniquity did the more easily,
            and almost insensibly, prevail. The apostle justly calls it a
            mystery of iniquity, because wicked designs and actions were
            concealed under false shows and pretences, at least they were
            concealed from the common view and observation. By pretended
            devotion, superstition and idolatry were advanced; and, by a
            pretended zeal for God and his glory, bigotry and persecution were
            promoted. And he tells us that this mystery of iniquity did even
            then begin, or did already work. While the apostles were yet living,
            the enemy came, and sowed tares; there were then the deeds of the
            Nicolaitans, persons who pretended zeal for Christ, but really
            opposed him. Pride, ambition, and worldly interest of church-pastors
            and church-rulers, as in Diotrephes and others, were the early
            working of the mystery of iniquity, which, by degrees, came to that
            prodigious height which has been visible in the church of Rome." (<a

            the working of Satan. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are
            pretended; by these the papal kingdom was first set up, and has all
            along been kept up, but they have false signs to support false
            doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles that have
            served their cause, things false in fact, or fraudulently managed,
            to impose upon the people: and the diabolical deceits with which the
            antichristian state has been supported are notorious. The apostle
            calls it all deceivableness of unrighteousness. Others may call them
            pious frauds, but the apostle called them unrighteous and wicked
            frauds; and, indeed, all fraud (which is contrary to truth) is an
            impious thing. Many are the subtle artifices the man of sin has

            and opens our eyes and hearts, that it may make its way thither, so
            by a righteous judgment he delivers over to a reprobate mind (Romans

            and shameful an absurdity of superstitions there is, and what
            delusions at variance with common sense. None that have even a
            moderate taste of sound doctrine, can think of such monstrous things
            without the greatest horror. How, then, could the whole world be
            lost in astonishment at them, were it not that men have been struck
            with blindness by the Lord, and converted, as it were, into stumps?"

            John Squire comments, "Here I must undertake an unpleasing taske:
            unpleasing to the Papists, unpleasing to some Protestants, and
            unpleasing to my selfe also. The Papists I know will entertaine this
            discourse, as the Iewes did Saint Stevens rough Sermon Act. 7. 54.
            it cutteth their hearts, & maketh them to gnash their teeth: it may
            be if their Hands were not tyed, they would hale mee out of the
            City, and stone me for my labour. Some Protestants also will be
            somewhat disaffected to this discourse: for—Veritas odium parit,
            right Protestants have many crooked adversaries. Finally, for my
            selfe: Brethren, my hearts desire, and prayer for England is, that
            they may bee saved. And I had rather a thousandfold preach Gods
            mercies, then his judgements: and mans salvation, then his
            damnation. But bee it never so displeasing, to never so many, and
            never so much: unto them, and unto my selfe: howsoever, as Ezekiel
            speaketh, Ezek. 31. 17. Since God hath made mee a watchman, the word
            I heare from his mouth I must give them warning of: I must say to
            the wicked, Thou shalt surely dye. Hereby liberabo animam meam, I
            shall deliver mine owne soule: and would it might please the Lord of
            heaven, that I might doe the like for them also." (<a

            Matthew Henry comments, "The persons are described who are his
            willing subjects, or most likely to become such. They are such as
            love not the truth that they may be saved. They heard the truth (it
            may be), but they did not love it; they could not bear sound
            doctrine, and therefore easily imbibed false doctrines; they had
            some notional knowledge of what was true, but they indulged some
            powerful prejudices, and so became a prey to seducers. Had they
            loved the truth, they would have persevered in it, and been
            preserved by it; but no wonder if they easily parted with what they
            never had any love to. And of these persons it is said that they
            perish or are lost; they are in a lost condition, and in danger to
            be lost for ever." (<a

            John Gill comments, "So that they call evil good, and good evil, and
            do not appear to have the common sense and reason of mankind, at
            least do not act according to it; and by giving them up to judicial
            blindness and hardness of heart, and to the god of this world, to
            blind their minds; and without this it is not to be accounted for,
            that the followers of antichrist should give into such senseless
            notions as those of transubstantiation, works of supererogation, or
            into such stupid practices as worshipping of images, praying to
            saints departed, and paying such a respect to the pretended relics
            of saints, as they do; but a spirit of slumber is given them, and
            eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear,
            because of their rejection of the Gospel." (<a
