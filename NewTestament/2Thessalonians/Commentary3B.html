            The rebellion refers to the religious falling away (apostasy) which
            takes place in the latter days:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will
              hate one another. Many false prophets will arise and will lead
              many astray. Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many
              will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved." (Mat
              24:10-13).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall
              away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and
              doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,
              branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding
              marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to
              be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the
              truth." (1 Tim 3:1-3).
            </p>
            <p>
              "But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come.
              For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
              arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
              without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without
              self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, traitors, headstrong,
              conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding a
              form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from
              these, also. For some of these are people who creep into houses
              and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by
              various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the
              knowledge of the truth. Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
              so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who
              concerning the faith are rejected." (2 Tim 3:1-8).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that
              the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen.
              By this we know that it is the final hour. They went out from us,
              but they didn’t belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they
              would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be
              revealed that none of them belong to us." (1 Jn 2:18-19).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This
              is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son." (1 Jn
              2:22).
            </p>
            <p>
              "and every spirit who doesn’t confess that Jesus Christ has come
              in the flesh is not of God; and this is the spirit of the
              Antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it is in the
              world already." (1 Jn 4:3).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t
              confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver
              and the Antichrist." (2 Jn 7).

            John Calvin comments, "Paul, however, does not speak of one
            individual, but of a kingdom, that was to be taken possession of by
            Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in the midst of
            God's temple--which we see accomplished in Popery. The revolt, it is
            true, has spread more widely, for Muhammad, as he was an apostate,
            turned away the Turks, his followers, from Christ. All heretics have
            broken the unity of the Church by their sects, and thus there have
            been a corresponding number of revolts from Christ." (<a

              target="_blank"

          </p>
          <p>
            Matthew Henry comments, "By this apostasy we are not to understand a
            defection in the state, or from civil government, but in spiritual
            or religious matters, from sound doctrine, instituted worship and
            church government, and a holy life. The apostle speaks of some very
            great apostasy, not only of some converted Jews or Gentiles, but
            such as should be very general, though gradual, and should give
            occasion to the revelation of rise of antichrist, that man of sin...
            It was so in the Old-Testament church... for example, soon after men
            began to call upon the name of the Lord all flesh corrupted their
            way,--soon after the covenant with Noah the Babel-builders bade
            defiance to heaven,--soon after the covenant with Abraham his seed
            degenerated in Egypt,--soon after the Israelites were planted in
            Canaan, when the first generation was worn off, they forsook God and
            served Baal,--soon after God's covenant with David his seed
            revolted, and served other gods,--soon after the return out of
            captivity there was a general decay of piety, as appears by the
            story of Ezra and Nehemiah; and therefore it was no strange thing
            that after the planting of Christianity there should come a falling
            away." (<a

          <p>
            John Gill comments, "but [the rebellion] is to be understood of a
            more general defection in the times of the Papacy; when not only the
            eastern churches were perverted and corrupted by Muhammad, and drawn
            off to his religion, but the western churches were most sadly
            depraved by the man of sin, by bringing in errors of all sorts in
            doctrine, making innovations in every ordinance, and appointing new
            ones, and introducing both Judaism and Paganism into the churches;
            which general defection continued until the times of the
            reformation, and is what the apostle has respect to in 1 Timothy 4:1
            where he manifestly points out some of the Popish tenets, as
            forbidding marriage to priests, and ordering abstinence from meats
            on certain days, and at certain times of the year: this was one
            thing that was to precede the coming of Christ" (<a

            Charles Spurgeon comments, "I believe that, to a large extent, this
            has already happened, and that this 'man of sin' has been revealed.
            This 'son of perdition' has had a long, dark, and terrible reign
            over myriads of men, and still he sits on the seven hills of Rome,
            and rules over multitudes of his fellow sinners. But Paul held that
            it was consistent to expect the Lord to come quickly, and yet to
            know that certain events must occur before He did come. That is just
            the condition, I think, to which a man’s mind will come if he
            diligently and impartially reads the Scriptures, especially the
            prophetic parts of them. The Lord will come in such an hour as we
            think not, yet there are clear indications of certain things which
            are to happen before He does come." (<a

            Gary Shogren comments, "We need not restrict 'lawlessness' (ἀνομία)

            As God, he sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is
            God. As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and is
            in and with his church now, so the antichrist here mentioned is some
            usurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims
            divine honours; and to whom can this better apply than to the
            bishops of Rome, to whom the most blasphemous titles have been
            given, as Dominus Deus noster papa--Our Lord God the pope; Deus

            into the Basilica of St. Peter, hoisted above the people and
            elevated above the high altar upon the shoulders of those who carry
            him (literally 'sitting') into the sanctuary cannot escape the deep
            impression that a prophecy of that very spectacle is imbedded in
            this remarkable verb. Who else, ever, in the history of humanity,
            always entered the church house 'sitting,' and even taking the

            Matthew Henry comments, "This mystery of iniquity was gradually to
            arrive at its height; and so it was in effect that the universal
            corruption of doctrine and worship in the Romish church came in by
            degrees, and the usurpation of the bishops of Rome was gradual, not
            all at once; and thus the mystery of iniquity did the more easily,
            and almost insensibly, prevail. The apostle justly calls it a
            mystery of iniquity, because wicked designs and actions were
            concealed under false shows and pretences, at least they were
            concealed from the common view and observation. By pretended
            devotion, superstition and idolatry were advanced; and, by a
            pretended zeal for God and his glory, bigotry and persecution were
            promoted. And he tells us that this mystery of iniquity did even
            then begin, or did already work. While the apostles were yet living,
            the enemy came, and sowed tares; there were then the deeds of the
            Nicolaitans, persons who pretended zeal for Christ, but really
            opposed him. Pride, ambition, and worldly interest of church-pastors
            and church-rulers, as in Diotrephes and others, were the early
            working of the mystery of iniquity, which, by degrees, came to that
            prodigious height which has been visible in the church of Rome." (<a

            The apostle assures the Thessalonians that the Lord would consume
            and destroy him; the consuming of him precedes his final
            destruction, and that is by the Spirit of his mouth, by his word of
            command; the pure word of God, accompanied with the Spirit of God,

            the working of Satan. Signs and wonders, visions and miracles, are
            pretended; by these the papal kingdom was first set up, and has all
            along been kept up, but they have false signs to support false

            served their cause, things false in fact, or fraudulently managed,
            to impose upon the people: and the diabolical deceits with which the
            antichristian state has been supported are notorious. The apostle
            calls it all deceivableness of unrighteousness. Others may call them
            pious frauds, but the apostle called them unrighteous and wicked
            frauds; and, indeed, all fraud (which is contrary to truth) is an

            and opens our eyes and hearts, that it may make its way thither, so
            by a righteous judgment he delivers over to a reprobate mind (Romans

            assuredly we have a notable specimen of this in the Papacy. No words
            can express how monstrous a sink of errors there is there, how gross
            and shameful an absurdity of superstitions there is, and what
            delusions at variance with common sense. None that have even a
            moderate taste of sound doctrine, can think of such monstrous things
            without the greatest horror. How, then, could the whole world be
