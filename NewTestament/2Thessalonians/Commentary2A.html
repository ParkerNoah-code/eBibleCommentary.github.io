            The church refers not to a building but to an assembly of people:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Greet the assembly that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my
              beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ. Greet Mary,
              who labored much for us. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives
              and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who
              were also in Christ before me. Greet Amplias, my beloved in the
              Lord. Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my
              beloved. Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who
              are of the household of Aristobulus. Greet Herodion, my kinsman.
              Greet them of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
              Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis,
              the beloved, who labored much in the Lord. Greet Rufus, the chosen
              in the Lord, and his mother and mine. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon,
              Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.
              Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas,
              and all the saints who are with them. Greet one another with a
              holy kiss. The assemblies of Christ greet you." (Rom 16:5-16).
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>There are many local assemblies:</p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
              in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thes 1:1).
            </p>
            <p>
              "I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the
              assembly that is at Cenchreae" (Rom 16:1).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
              God, and our brother Sosthenes, to the assembly of God which is at
              Corinth" (1 Cor 1:1-2).
            </p>
            <p>
              "I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might
              serve you." (2 Cor 11:8).
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Though there are many different local assemblies, there is one
            universal body of Christ that consists of all believers:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members
              don’t have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in
              Christ, and individually members of one another, having gifts
              differing according to the grace that was given to us" (Rom
              12:4-6).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle
              wall of separation, having abolished in his flesh the hostility,
              the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might
              create in himself one new man of the two, making peace, and might
              reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having
              killed the hostility through it." (Eph 2:14-16).
            </p>
          </section>

          <p>
            Local assemblies should reflect the universal assembly, the body of
            Christ, by only accepting believers for baptism, the Lord's Supper,
            and membership:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship do
              righteousness and iniquity have? Or what fellowship does light
              have with darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial?
              Or what portion does a believer have with an unbeliever? What
              agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a
              temple of the living God. Even as God said, 'I will dwell in them
              and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.'
              Therefore<br />
              “‘Come out from among them,<br />
              and be separate,’ says the Lord.<br />
              ‘Touch no unclean thing.<br />
              I will receive you.<br />
              I will be to you a Father.<br />
              You will be to me sons and daughters,’<br />
              says the Lord Almighty.”" (2 Cor 6:14-18).
            </p>
            <p>
              "These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly, but
              if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave
              themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living
              God, the pillar and ground of the truth." (1 Tim 3:14-15).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in
              the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will
              receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and
              to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the
              Lord our God will call to himself'... Then those who gladly
              received his word were baptized." (Acts 2:38-39, 41).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
              unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in
              the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, in whom he also went and
              preached to the spirits in prison, who before were disobedient
              when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was
              being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through
              water. This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the
              putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
              conscience toward God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
              who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels
              and authorities and powers being made subject to him." (1 Pet
              3:18-22).
            </p>
            <p>
              "The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the
              blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of
              the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who
              are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of
              bread." (1 Cor 10:16-17).
            </p>
            <p>
              "So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are
              fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, being
              built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus
              himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom the whole building,
              fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you
              also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."
              (Eph 2:19-22).
            </p>
            <p>
              "He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
              evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers; for the perfecting
              of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the
              body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and
              of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the
              measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may no
              longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with
              every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness,
              after the wiles of error; but speaking truth in love, we may grow
              up in all things into him who is the head, Christ, from whom all
              the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every
              joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each
              individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of
              itself in love." (Eph 4:11-16).

            Nevertheless, a certain amount unbelievers will remain in the local
            assemblies during the Church Age:
          </p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in
              which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the
              assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own
              blood. For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will
              enter in among you, not sparing the flock." (Acts 20:28-29).
