          <p>
            Paul is writing to "brothers" whose faith and love is abounding in
            the midst of persecutions. Having just reminded them of the
            righteous judgment of God at the coming of Jesus Christ to the end
            that they may endure and be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, he
            proceeds to correct certain wrong views about eschatology in 2:1-12.
            He states his focus in 2:1-17 which is the Second Coming of Christ
            and our gathering together to meet Him.

            By spirit: that is by a prophetic spirit supposedly coming from God.
            God's revelation cannot contradict itself or contain error. All
            claims must be tested by scripture which is most certainly from God.
            Demons are able to perform signs and Satan is able to decieve, so
            signs, miracles, and spirits must be tested. Any attempts of others
            to set a time, whether century, decade, year, day, or hour, to
            Christ's second coming must not be heeded since his coming will be
            as a thief in the night.
          </p>
          <p>
            By word: that is by reasoning. We must not be carried away by the
            wisdom of men. Reason and arguments, mathematical and astronomical
            calculations, or any other attempt that goes beyond or against the
            Word. Even that which seems to carry a large amount of probability.
          </p>
          <p>
            By letter: that is by misusing Scripture or mis-alledging what the
            Scriptures are. This is done by forging and counterfeiting letters,
            by passing non-scriptural books off as Scripture, by plausible,
            enticing interpretations and arguments which are in fact false, or
            by counsels, traditions of men, teaching offices, or anything else
            that is put on level of God's Word which is not.

            John Squire comments, "Here then we discover three fountaines of
            errours, and false doctrine: Inspiration, Disputation, and
            Quotation. By Inspiration, and the Spirit, they deceive the
            Ignorant: By Disputation and Word they deceive the Learned: By
            Quotation, or Letter, or mis-alledging the Scriptures, they deceive
            both the Learned and the Ignorant: S. Paul doth arme them against
            all these, with this Caveat: Bee not shaken in minde, nor troubled,
            neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by Letter as from us." (<a
