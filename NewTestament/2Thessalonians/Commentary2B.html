            Gary Shogren comments, "Once again, almost causually, an attribute
            of Yahweh is attributed to the Lord Jesus. The Lord of hosts, who
            comes with the armies of heaven, is now seen to be the Lord Jesus,
            who comes with his angelic army" (1 & 2 Thessalonians, ZECNT: Grand
            Rapids, 2012).
