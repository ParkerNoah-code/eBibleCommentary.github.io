        <h2>I. Salutation (1:1-2)</h2>
        <p>
          Though this Epistle is later than the other, it is not much later. The
          Apostle has still the same companions, Silas and Timothy, to join in
          his Christian greeting. The greeting with which the Epistle opens is
          almost word for word the same as that of the First Epistle. It is a
          church which is addressed. A church subsisting in God the Father and
          in the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul desires that the Thessalonians would
          enjoy the grace and peace of God which is the end of our calling.

            <em>Paul</em>. Paul greets the believers in Thessalonica by
            presenting himself along with his two co-workers, Silas and Timothy,
            who played a key role in founding this church.
          </p>
          <p><em>Silvanus</em>.</p>
          <p><em>Timothy</em>.</p>
          <p>
            <em>To the assembly of the Thessalonians</em>. We ought not to look
            in the Christian assembly for what it was never meant to be: for a
            society to further the temporal interests of its members; for an
            educational institution, aiming at the general enlightenment of
            those who frequent its meetings; for a purveyor of innocent
            amusements. All these are simply beside the mark; the Church is not
            called to any such functions; her whole life is in God and Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</em>. An apostolic
            interest in the Church is the interest of one who cares only for the
            relation of the soul to Christ; she can say nothing and do nothing
            for any man until his life has been brought to this source and
            centre. John demonstrates this attitude when he says to Gaius,
            "Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in
            health, even as thy soul prospereth."
          </p>

          <h2>
            2.
            <em
              >Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
              Christ.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace to you and peace</em>. It is in accordance with this
            Spirit that the Apostle wishes the Thessalonians not any outward
            advantages, but grace and peace. Grace and peace are related as
            cause and effect. Grace is God’s unmerited love, His free and
            beautiful goodness to the sinful; and when men receive it, it bears
            the fruit of peace. Peace is a far bigger word in the Bible than in
            common usage; and it has its very largest sense in these
            salutations, where it represents the old Hebrew greeting "Shalom."
            Properly speaking, it means completeness, wholeness, health-the
            perfect soundness of the spiritual nature. This is what the Apostle
            wishes for the Thessalonians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there is a narrower sense of peace, in which it means the
            quieting of the perturbed conscience, the putting away of the
            alienation between the soul and God; but that is only the initial
            work of grace, the first degree of the great peace which is in view
            here. When grace has had its perfect work, it results in a more
            profound and steadfast peace, -a soundness of the whole nature, a
            restoration of the shattered spiritual health, which is the crown of
            all God’s blessings. There is a vast difference in the degrees of
            bodily health between the man who is chronically ailing, always
            anxious, nervous about himself, and unable to trust himself if any
            unexpected drain is made upon his strength, and the man who has
            solid, unimpaired health, whose heart is whole within him, and who
            is not shaken by the thought of what may be.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is this radical soundness which is really meant by peace;
            thorough spiritual health is the best of God’s blessings in the
            Christian life, as thorough bodily health is the best in the natural
            life. Hence the Apostle wishes it for the Thessalonians before
            everything else; and wishes it, as alone it can come, in the train
            of grace. The free love of God is all our hope. Grace is love
            imparting itself, giving itself away, as it were, to others, for
            their good. Only as that love comes to us, and is received in its
            fulness of blessing into our hearts, can we attain that stable
            spiritual health which is the end of our calling.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</em>. The free
            love of God is all our hope. Grace is love imparting itself, giving
            itself away, as it were, to others, for their good. Only as that

              "For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members

              Christ, and individually members of one another, having gifts
              differing according to the grace that was given to us" (Rom
              12:4-6).
            </p>
            <p>
              "For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle
              wall of separation, having abolished in his flesh the hostility,
              the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might
              create in himself one new man of the two, making peace, and might
              reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having
              killed the hostility through it." (Eph 2:14-16).

            Local assemblies should reflect the universal assembly, the body of
            Christ, by only accepting believers for baptism, the Lord's Supper,
            and membership:

              "Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship do
              righteousness and iniquity have? Or what fellowship does light
              have with darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial?
              Or what portion does a believer have with an unbeliever? What
              agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a
              temple of the living God. Even as God said, 'I will dwell in them
              and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.'
              Therefore<br />
              “‘Come out from among them,<br />
              and be separate,’ says the Lord.<br />
              ‘Touch no unclean thing.<br />
              I will receive you.<br />
              I will be to you a Father.<br />
              You will be to me sons and daughters,’<br />
              says the Lord Almighty.”" (2 Cor 6:14-18).
            </p>
            <p>
              "These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly, but
              if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave
              themselves in God’s house, which is the assembly of the living
              God, the pillar and ground of the truth." (1 Tim 3:14-15).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in
              the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will
              receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and
              to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the
              Lord our God will call to himself'... Then those who gladly
              received his word were baptized." (Acts 2:38-39, 41).
            </p>
            <p>
              "Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the
              unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in
              the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, in whom he also went and
              preached to the spirits in prison, who before were disobedient
              when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship was
              being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through
              water. This is a symbol of baptism, which now saves you—not the
              putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
              conscience toward God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
              who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels
              and authorities and powers being made subject to him." (1 Pet
              3:18-22).

              "The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the
              blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of
              the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who
              are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of
              bread." (1 Cor 10:16-17).

            <p>
              "So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are
              fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, being
              built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus
              himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom the whole building,
              fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you
              also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit."

              of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the
              body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and
              of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the
              measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may no
              longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with
              every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness,
              after the wiles of error; but speaking truth in love, we may grow
              up in all things into him who is the head, Christ, from whom all
              the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every
              joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each
              individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of
              itself in love." (Eph 4:11-16).
