        <h2>I. Salutation (1:1-2)</h2>
        <p>
          Though this Epistle is later than the other, it is not much later. The
          Apostle has still the same companions, Silas and Timothy, to join in
          his Christian greeting. The greeting with which the Epistle opens is
          almost word for word the same as that of the First Epistle. It is a
          church which is addressed. A church subsisting in God the Father and
          in the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul desires that the Thessalonians would
          enjoy the grace and peace of God which is the end of our calling.
        </p>

            1.
            <em
              >Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of the Thessalonians
              in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</em

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Paul</em>. Paul greets the believers in Thessalonica. His name
            being listed first is a sign that he was the primary author of this
            letter though certainly in agreement with Silvanus and Timothy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Silvanus, and Timothy</em>. Paul presents himself along with his
            two co-workers, Silas and Timothy, who played a key role in founding
            this church. One would likely have been Paul's amanuensis while the
            other one would have been the letter carrier.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To the assembly of the Thessalonians</em>. By a Church in God
            and Christ is meant one that has not merely been gathered together
            under the banner of faith, for the purpose of worshipping one God
            the Father, and confiding in Christ, but is the work and building as
            well of the Father as of Christ, because while God adopts us to
            himself, and regenerates us, we from him begin to be in Christ.
            Therefore we ought not to look in the Christian assembly for what it
            was never meant to be: for a society to further the temporal
            interests of its members; for an educational institution, aiming at
            the general enlightenment of those who frequent its meetings; for a
            purveyor of innocent amusements. All these are simply beside the
            mark; the Church is not called to any such functions; her whole life
            is in God and Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>In God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</em>. An apostolic
            interest in the Church is the interest of one who cares only for the
            relation of the soul to Christ; she can say nothing and do nothing
            for any man until his life has been brought to this source and
            centre. John demonstrates this attitude when he says to Gaius,
            "Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in
            health, even as thy soul prospereth."
          </p>

          <h2>
            2.
            <em
              >Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
              Christ.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace to you and peace</em>. It is in accordance with this
            Spirit that the Apostle wishes the Thessalonians not any outward
            advantages, but grace and peace. Grace and peace are related as
            cause and effect. Grace is God’s unmerited love, His free and
            beautiful goodness to the sinful; and when men receive it, it bears
            the fruit of peace. Peace is a far bigger word in the Bible than in
            common usage; and it has its very largest sense in these
            salutations, where it represents the old Hebrew greeting "Shalom."
            Properly speaking, it means completeness, wholeness, health-the
            perfect soundness of the spiritual nature. This is what the Apostle
            wishes for the Thessalonians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there is a narrower sense of peace, in which it means the
            quieting of the perturbed conscience, the putting away of the
            alienation between the soul and God; but that is only the initial
            work of grace, the first degree of the great peace which is in view
            here. When grace has had its perfect work, it results in a more
            profound and steadfast peace, -a soundness of the whole nature, a
            restoration of the shattered spiritual health, which is the crown of
            all God’s blessings. There is a vast difference in the degrees of
            bodily health between the man who is chronically ailing, always
            anxious, nervous about himself, and unable to trust himself if any
            unexpected drain is made upon his strength, and the man who has
            solid, unimpaired health, whose heart is whole within him, and who
            is not shaken by the thought of what may be.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is this radical soundness which is really meant by peace;
            thorough spiritual health is the best of God’s blessings in the
            Christian life, as thorough bodily health is the best in the natural
            life. Hence the Apostle wishes it for the Thessalonians before
            everything else; and wishes it, as alone it can come, in the train
            of grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</em>. The free
            love of God is all our hope. Grace is love imparting itself, giving
            itself away, as it were, to others, for their good. Only as that
            love comes to us, and is received in its fulness of blessing into
            our hearts, can we attain that stable spiritual health and peace
            which is the end of our calling.

          <p>Background from Acts about the Thessalonians:</p>
          <section>
            <p>
              "Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
              came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. Paul, as
              was his custom, went in to them; and for three Sabbath days
              reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and
              demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from
              the dead, and saying, 'This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the
              Christ.'
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas: of the
              devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.
              But the unpersuaded Jews took along some wicked men from the
              marketplace and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar.
              Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to
              the people. When they didn’t find them, they dragged Jason and
              certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, 'These who
              have turned the world upside down have come here also, whom Jason
              has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar,
              saying that there is another king, Jesus!' The multitude and the
              rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.
              When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let
              them go.
            </p>
            <p>
              The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to
              Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
              received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the
              Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. Many of them
              therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a
              few men. But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the
              word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there
              likewise, agitating the multitudes. Then the brothers immediately
              sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy
              still stayed there. But those who escorted Paul brought him as far
              as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they
              should come to him very quickly, they departed." (Acts 17:1-15).
