        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Internal evidence: The contents in the Epistle to the Galatians
          strongly suggest Pauline authorship. The author identifies himself as
          Paul and exhibits distinct Pauline style, vocabulary, and theological
          emphases, which are consistent with his other letters. The passionate
          and forceful tone of the letter reflects Paul's personal investment in
          the Galatian churches and his authoritative stance as an apostle.
          Moreover, Paul's personal experiences, as mentioned in the letter,
          align with what is known about his life from other sources. He refers
          to his conversion experience (Gal 1:11-17) and his meeting with the
          apostles in Jerusalem (Gal 2:1-10). These accounts correspond with
          details found in the Book of Acts and Paul's other letters,
          reinforcing the link between the author of Galatians and the
          historical figure of Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          External evidence: The information derived from early Christian
          writings and historical testimonies, further supports Pauline
          authorship of the Epistle to the Galatians. The earliest extant
          Christian sources consistently attribute the letter to Paul. Early
          Church fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria
          recognized the letter as Paul's work, demonstrating the widespread
          recognition and acceptance of its authorship in the early Christian
          community. Additionally, the letter's inclusion in the canon of the
          New Testament, alongside other Pauline letters, attests to its
          authenticity. The early church also recognized the theological and
          doctrinal coherence between Galatians and Paul's other letters,
          further affirming this fact.
        </p>

        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
          While there is some uncertainty surrounding the date of Galatians
          because of the limited historical information available and the
          complexities of reconstructing the timeline of Paul's missionary
          activities, scholars generally agree that the letter was written in
          the late 40s or early 50s AD. There are three primary views (note that
          views 1 and 2 sometimes overlap): (1) Proponents of the early date, in
          the late 40s or early 50's AD, argue that the meeting in Jerusalem
          mentioned in Galatians 2:1-10 corresponds to the Jerusalem Council
          described in Acts 15 which is dated around 48-49 AD and typically
          follow the South Galatian view. (2) Proponents of a middle dating, in
          the early to mid 50's AD, typically follow the North Galatian view in
          which case it would have taken Paul a longer time to reach them. (3)
          Proponents of a late dating, in the late 50's or early 60's AD, often
          believe the gravity of the issues at stake necessitate a longer
          timeframe.
        </p>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The matter of whether the Epistle was intended for the churches in
          North or South Galatia is an ongoing question. Although there is no
          consensus among scholars, the evidence appears to lean towards the
          South Galatian view. If the Epistle to the Galatians was directed to
          the churches in Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, there is
          important historical, geographical, literary, and epigraphic data to
          better understand the letter.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>

        <h2>Occasion and Background</h2>
        <p>
          Paul had previously established churches in this region during his
          missionary journeys. The occasion that prompted Paul to write this
          letter was the arrival of false teachers who were promoting a
          distorted version of the Gospel among the Galatian believers. These
          teachers, often referred to as "Judaizers," insisted that Gentile
          converts to Christianity needed to be circumcised and adhere to Jewish
          laws in order to be justified before God. The Judaizers sought to
          undermine Paul's authority and discredit his message, causing
          confusion and division among the believers. Recognizing the gravity of
          the situation and the potential danger of the Galatians abandoning the
          true Gospel, Paul writes Galatians as a passionate defense of his
          apostleship and a clear articulation of the Gospel of grace. Paul
          maintains the purity of the Gospel message of faith in Jesus Christ in
          opposition to the false apostles whose doctrine was corrupted by false
          additions.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose and Message</h2>
        <p>
          The overarching message of Galatians is the central theme of
          justification by faith. Paul emphasizes that a person is declared
          righteous before God, not by observing the law, but through faith in
          Jesus Christ. Salvation is a gift of God's grace, received by faith
          alone, and not by human effort or merit. Paul emphasizes the freedom
          that believers have in Christ enabling them to live in a new covenant
          of grace, as opposed to the bondage and futility of trying to attain
          righteousness through the law. In the new covenant of grace, there is
          neither Jew nor Gentile, but all who have faith in Christ are one
          family, heirs to the promise given to Abraham. It serves as a forceful
          reminder of the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and the undeserved
          nature of salvation.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Themes</h2>
        <p>
          Justification: The theme of justification by faith is a central and
          foundational concept in the Epistle to the Galatians. Throughout the
          letter, the apostle Paul passionately argues that justification is by
          faith in Christ for salvation and rejects any form of reliance on
          works of the law (Gal 3:28) or human effort (Gal 3:11). Paul
          vehemently opposes the necessity of observing Jewish laws (2:16),
          particularly circumcision (Gal 5:6), as a requirement for salvation
          and asserts that justification—being declared righteous before God—is
          solely by faith in Jesus Christ. It is Christ and his redemptive work
          on the cross that reconciles humanity with God (Gal 1:4) and grants
          them justification as a result of God's grace through faith (Gal
          2:21).
        </p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>
          This Epistle too has abiding significance for the Church of God. It is
          essentially a defense of the doctrine of free grace, of the Christian
          liberty of New Testament believers over against those that would bring
          them under the law in its Old Testament application, and would place
          them under the obligation to submit to circumcision and to participate
          in the shadowy ceremonies of a by-gone day. The great central
          exhortation of this letter is: “Stand fast in the liberty wherewith
          Christ has made us free, and be not tangled again with the yoke of
          bondage.” The way of the ritualist is not the way of life, is the
          lesson that should be remembered by all those who are inclined to
          over-emphasize the outward form of religion to the neglect of its
          spirit and essence.
        </p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
          I. Pauls Defense of his Apostleship, Gal 1:1-24, Gal 2:1-21. After the
          usual introduction the apostle states the occasion of his writing, Gal
          1:1-10. In defense of his apostleship he points out that he has been
          called by God himself and received his Gospel by direct revelation,
          and had no occasion to learn it from the other apostles, Gal 1:11-24;
          that the apostles showed their agreement with him by not demanding the
          circumcision of Titus and by admitting his mission to the gentiles.
          Gal 2:1-10; and that he had even rebuked Peter, when this “pillar of
          the church” was not true to the doctrine of free grace, Gal 2:11-21.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. His Defense of the Doctrine of Justification, Gal 3:1-29, Gal
          4:1-31. Here the apostle clearly brings out that the Galatians
          received the gift of the Spirit by faith, Gal 3:1-5; that Abraham was
          justified by faith, Gal 3:6-9; that delivery from the curse of the law
          is possible only through faith, Gal 3:10-14; and that the law has
          merely a parenthetic character, coming, as it does, between the
          promise and its fulfillment, Gal 3:15-29. He compares Judaism to a son
          who is minor, and Christianity to a son that has attained his
          majority, Gal 4:1-7; admonishes the Galatians that, realizing their
          privilege, they should not return to the beggarly elements of
          knowledge, Gal 4:8-20; and says that the Jew is like the child of
          Hagar, while the Christian resembles the child of Sara, Gal 4:21-31.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Practical Exhortations, Gal 5:1-26, Gal 6:1-18. The Galatians are
          exhorted to stand in their Christian liberty, Gal 5:1-12, a liberty
          that is not license but obedience, Gal 5:13-18. The works of the flesh
          and the fruits of the Spirit are described that the Galatians may
          avoid the former and yield the latter, Gal 5:19-26. The right way of
          treating the erring and weak is pointed out, and also the relation of
          what one sows to what one reaps, Gal 5:1-10. With a brief summary and
          benediction Paul ends his letter, Gal 6:11-18.
