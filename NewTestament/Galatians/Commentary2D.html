        <h2>D. Authority: Properly Resists Peter (2:11-14)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 11.
          <em
            >But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because
            he stood condemned.</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>But when Peter came to Antioch</em>. The exact timing of Peter's
          visit to Antioch remains uncertain. Some speculate it might have
          occurred before the Jerusalem council that discussed the necessity of
          circumcision for salvation. This is based on the assumption that after
          the council's decree, Peter would not have behaved as described in
          this account. However, it's important to note that the council's
          decree only pertained to Gentiles, not Jews. Thus, Peter and other
          Jewish believers could still adhere to the Mosaic law's rituals and
          ceremonies. Based on the sequence of events and the order of the
          narrative, it appears likely that Peter's visit to Antioch occurred
          after the council which aligns with Acts 15:30 and the ensuing events.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I resisted him to his face</em>. This wasn't a mere outward show
          or pretense, as some ancient scholars suggested. The intention wasn't
          for Jews to overhear their conversation and come to appreciate the
          appropriateness of eating with Gentiles, thus avoiding offense. Such
          duplicity would be unjust, as it would mirror the very dissimulation
          Paul was challenging in Peter. Paul's opposition was sincere and
          honest. He did not engage in gossip, whispering, or backbiting.
          Instead, he addressed him to his face, candidly expressing his
          thoughts, steadfastly challenging his behavior, and striving to
          persuade him of his error and halt his actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Because he stood condemned</em>. The word condemned is best
          redendered <em>to be blamed</em>, which shows that the apostle did not
          oppose him for opposition sake, rashly, and without any foundation;
          there was a just reason for it, he had done that which was culpable,
          and for which he was blameworthy. Paul accommodated himself to the
          Jews no farther than was consistent with the doctrine of liberty; and
          therefore he refused to circumcise Titus, that the truth of the gospel
          might remain unimpaired. But Peter Judaized in such a manner as to
          "compel the Gentiles" to suffer bondage, and at the same time to
          create a prejudice against Paul's doctrine. He did not, therefore,
          observe the proper limit; for he was more desirous to please than to
          edify, and more solicitous to inquire what would gratify the Jews than
          what would be expedient for the whole body.
