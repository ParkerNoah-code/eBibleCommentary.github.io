        <h2>A. Works of Law or Faith? (3:1-9)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth,
            before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as
            crucified?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Foolish Galatians</em>. Referring not to any national character,
          as some have thought, by which they were distinguished from others for
          their rudeness in knowledge, their ignorance and folly, as the Cretans
          for their lying (Titus 1:2), nor to their former state in
          unregeneracy, it being common to all men, to God's elect themselves,
          before conversion, to be foolish in a moral and spiritual sense but to
          their present stupidity about the article of justification, it being
          an instance of most egregious folly to leave Christ for Moses, the
          Gospel for the law, and the doctrine of free justification by the
          righteousness of Christ, which brings so much solid peace and comfort
          with it, for the doctrine of justification, by the works of the law,
          which naturally leads to bondage. Now this was said, not rashly, nor
          in anger, or on purpose to reproach and provoke, and so not at all
          contrary to Matthew 5:22 but in like manner as Christ said to his
          disciples, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe" (Lk 24:25).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Who has bewitched you</em>? Some false teacher or another had, or
          it cannot be conceived how their heads should ever have been turned
          this way which must be understood, not in a literal and proper sense,
          as Simon Magus bewitched the people of Samaria with his sorceries
          (Acts 8:9-24), but in a figurative and improper one; that as sorcerers
          and enchanters cast a mist before people's eyes, or, by some evil arts
          or juggling tricks, deceive their sight, and make objects seem to
          appear which do not, or in a different form than they really do, so
          these deceitful workers, who had transformed themselves into the
          apostles of Christ, as Satan sometimes transforms himself into an
          angel of light (1 Cor 11:14), had set this doctrine in a false light
          before them, thereby to corrupt their minds from the simplicity that
          is in Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the apostle reproves the Galatians for their folly and weakness
          in giving in so easily to such deceptions, yet he imputes the chief
          fault unto, and lays the greatest blame on the false teachers; whom he
          represents as sorcerers and enchanters, and their doctrine,
          particularly that of justification by works, as witchcraft; it being
          pleasing to men, a gratifying of carnal reason, and operating as a
          charm upon the pride of human nature. What Samuel said to Saul, may be
          applied to the present case, "to obey" the truth "is better than
          sacrifice", than all the rituals of the ceremonial law: "and to
          hearken" to the Gospel of Christ, "than the fat of rams", or any of
          the legal institutions; "for rebellion" against, and opposition to any
          of the doctrines of the Gospel, and especially to this of
          justification by the righteousness of Christ, "is as the sin of
          witchcraft" (1 Sam 15:22). The false apostles, envying their light and
          knowledge in the Gospel, their faith, peace, comfort, and happiness,
          had endeavoured to introduce another doctrine among them, subversive
          of all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Not to obey the truth</em>. By "the truth" is meant, either the
          whole Gospel, often so called, in opposition to the law, and the types
          and shadows of it; and because it is contained in the Scriptures of
          truth, and comes from the God of truth; the substance of it is Christ,
          who is the truth, and is what the Spirit of truth leads into; or else
          particularly the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of
          Christ, which is the truth the apostle is establishing, and these
          Galatians seemed to be going off from, through the artful insinuations
          of the false teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formerly these people had not only heard this truth, but embraced it:
          they received the love of it, were strongly affected to it, and firmly
          believed but now they began to hesitate and doubt about it; they were
          not so fully persuaded of it as heretofore; they seemed ready to let
          it go, at least did not hold it fast, and the profession of it,
          without wavering as before; they were fallen from some degree of the
          steadfastness of their faith in, and of the obedience of it to this
          truth, which is what was the design of the false apostles, and is here
          charged upon the Galatians.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you</em
          >. Meaning in the ministry of the Gospel, in the clear preaching of it
          by the apostle; Jesus Christ was the sum and substance of his
          ministry, in which he was set forth and described, and, as it were,
          painted to the life by him; the glories and excellencies of his divine
          person, the nature of his office, as Mediator, the suitableness of him
          as a Saviour, the fulness of his grace, the efficacy of his blood,
          sacrifice, and righteousness, were so fully, and in such a lively
          manner expressed, that it was as if Christ was personally and visibly
          present with them; yea, he was so described in his sufferings and
          death, as hanging, bleeding, dying on the accursed tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>As crucified</em>. For this cannot be understood literally, for he
          was crucified without the gates of Jerusalem; nor does it respect the
          sin of the Galatians in departing from the Gospel, as if that was a
          crucifying of him again, and a putting him to open shame; nor their
          sufferings for the sake of Christ, as if he, in that sense, was
          crucified in them, and with them: but it intends the clear Gospel
          revelation of a crucified Christ, in the preaching of him by the
          apostle, which was such that no picture, no image, no crucifix would
          come up to, and which, where such preaching is, are altogether vain
          and needless; and the clear view these saints had, by faith, in the
          glass of the Gospel of Christ, and him crucified, which so realized
          the object, as if it was present and before the natural eye. Now this
          was an aggravation of their weakness and folly, that after such clear
          preaching, and clear sight, they had of the Gospel, and of Christ in
          it, that they should in the least degree depart from it.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by
            the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>I just want to learn this from you</em>. Though there were many
          things he could have put to them, yet he would only ask this one
          question, which, if rightly attended to, and honestly answered, must
          expose their folly, and put an end to the controversy upon this head:
          "Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of
          faith?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing
            of faith</em
          >? This question supposes they had received the Spirit; that is, the
          Spirit of God, as a spirit of wisdom and knowledge in the revelation
          of Christ; as a spirit of regeneration and sanctification; as a spirit
          of faith and adoption; and as the earnest, seal, and pledge of their
          future glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law</em>? Now the
          apostle asks, whether they received this Spirit "by the works of the
          law"; meaning, either whether they could imagine that they, by their
          obedience to the law, had merited and procured the Spirit of God; or
          whether they thought that the Spirit came to them, and into their
          hearts, through the doctrine or preaching of the law: the former could
          not be true, for if they could not obtain righteousness and life by
          the works of the law, then not the Spirit; besides, works done without
          the Spirit of God, are not properly good works: for though by the law
          is the knowledge of sin, yet this leaves nothing but a sense of wrath
          and damnation in the conscience; it is the killing letter, and a
          ministration of condemnation and death, and not of the Spirit, and of
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Or by hearing of faith</em>? Spirit and life belong to the Gospel,
          "or the hearing of faith"; for by "faith" is meant the Gospel, and
          particularly the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ's
          righteousness; and by "the hearing" of it, the preaching of it, the
          report of it. Now in this way the Spirit of God is received; while the
          Gospel is preaching he falls on them that hear it, conveys himself
          into their hearts, and begets them again by the word of truth: and in
          this way the Galatians came by the Spirit, and which is another
          aggravation of their folly, that they should enjoy so great an
          advantage by the Gospel, and yet be so easily removed from it.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now
            completed in the flesh?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Are you so foolish</em>? Is it possible you should be so stupid?
          and do you, or can you continue to be so?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Having begun in the Spirit</em>. That is, either in the Spirit of
          God, whom they had received through the preaching of the Gospel. They
          set out in a profession of religion in the light, under the influence,
          and by the assistance of the Spirit; they began to worship the Lord in
          spirit, and in truth, without any confidence in the flesh; they
          entered upon the service of God, and a newness of life, a different
          conversation than before, a spiritual way of living in a dependence on
          the grace and help of the divine Spirit: or in the Gospel, which is
          the Spirit that gives life, is the ministration of the Spirit of God,
          and contains spiritual doctrines, and gives an account of spiritual
          blessings, and is attended with the Holy Ghost, and with power. This
          was first preached unto them, and they embraced it; this they begun
          and set out with in their Christian profession, and yet it looked as
          if they sought to end with something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Are you now completed in the flesh</em>? Not in carnality, in the
          lusts of the flesh, as if they now walked and lived after the flesh,
          in a carnal, dissolute, wicked course of life; for the apostle is not
          charging them with immoralities, but complaining of their principles:
          wherefore, by "the flesh" is meant, either the strength of mere
          nature, in opposition to the Spirit of God, by which they endeavoured
          to perform obedience to the law; or else the law itself, in
          distinction from the Gospel; and particularly the ceremonial law, the
          law of a carnal commandment, and which consisted of carnal ordinances,
          and only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; and also their
          obedience to it; yea, even all their own righteousness, the best of
          it, which is but flesh, merely external, weak, and insufficient to
          justify before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a third aggravation of their folly, that whereas they begun
          their Christian race depending upon the Spirit and grace of God, now
          they seemed to be taking a step as if they thought to finish it in the
          mere strength of nature; and whereas they set out with the clear
          Gospel of Christ, and sought for justification only by his
          righteousness, they were now verging to the law, and seeking to make
          their justifying righteousness perfect, by joining the works of the
          law unto it, which needed them not, but was perfect without them.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 4.
          <em
            >Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Did you suffer so many things in vain</em>? These Galatians had
          suffered great reproach, many afflictions and persecutions for the
          sake of the Gospel, as all that embrace it must expect to do; and
          which to them that persevere in the faith of the Gospel will not be in
          vain, they will be followed with eternal life and glory; not that
          these things are meritorious of such happiness, or deserve such a
          reward; the reward of them is not of debt, but of grace. But, if such
          who have made a profession, and have suffered for it, should after all
          relinquish it, their sufferings for it are in vain; they will come
          short of that glory which is promised to them that suffer for
          righteousness sake: and this is another aggravation of the folly of
          these persons, that they should suffer so much persecution for the
          Gospel, which, if not true, they must have suffered in vain, and might
          as well have avoided it; and, if true, by relinquishing it not only
          sustain a great loss, but bring great hurt and damage to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If it is indeed in vain</em>? By which words the apostle does, as
          it were, correct himself, and expresses his hope of them, that they
          would see their mistake, revoke their error, and abide by the truth of
          the Gospel.

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you</em>. By whom he means
          not himself, nor any other minister of the Gospel, in whose power it
          does not lie to minister the Spirit, either the ordinary or the
          extraordinary gifts of it unto men; but either God or Christ who had
          ministered, and still continued to minister the grace of the Spirit
          through the preaching of the Gospel; or rather the extraordinary gifts
          of the Spirit, which were manifested at the first preaching of the
          Gospel to them for the confirmation of it, and which they were still
          supplied with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And does miracles among you</em>. So that this is a distinct
          argument from that in Galatians 3:2 and a further proof and
          aggravation of the folly and stupidity of the members of this church,
          who had not only received through the Gospel the Spirit, as a spirit
          of regeneration, at least many of them, but had seen the Gospel
          confirmed by the extraordinary gifts, signs, and wonders of the Holy
          Ghost, and which were still among them; and yet they were departing
          from this Gospel, through which all this was done.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith</em
          >? The apostle's meaning is, that these extraordinary gifts of the
          Spirit, and these miracles done among them, did not attend the
          preaching of the law, or the doctrine of justification by works,
          taught by the false apostles, but the doctrine of faith, of
          justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ, delivered by
          him and others, for the truth of which he appeals to themselves; and
          therefore they must be guilty of the most egregious folly, once to
          think of, or take any one step towards a departure from that doctrine.

        <p>
          <em>Even so, Abraham</em>. The apostle having observed, that the
          special grace and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit were received not
          through the preaching of the law, but through the doctrine of faith;
          by an easy transition, passes on to a further confirmation of the
          doctrine of justification by faith, by producing the instance of
          Abraham, what the Scripture says of him, and the promise made unto
          him; which is very appropriate to his purpose, since Abraham was
          certainly a righteous man, the first of the circumcision, and the head
          of the Jewish nation; and whom the false teachers much gloried in, and
          boasted of their being his seed, and of being circumcised as he was;
          and would fain have persuaded the Gentiles to the same practice, in
          imitation of him, and as necessary to their justification before God;
          whereas the apostle here shows, referring to Genesis 15:6 that Abraham
          was justified by faith, and not by any works whatever, much less by
          circumcision; for what he here refers to, was many years before his
          circumcision; and since therefore he was a justified person, declared
          to be so, before it and without it, it was not necessary to his
          justification, nor is it to any other person's.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Believed God</em>. The object of faith is God, Father, Son, and
          Spirit; here Jehovah the Son seems principally intended, who in
          Genesis 15:1 is called the "Word of the Lord"; the essential Word, who
          was with God from everlasting, and was God, and in the fulness of time
          was made flesh and dwelt among men; and "Abraham's shield", the same
          the apostle in Ephesians 6:16 calls "the shield of faith"; meaning not
          the grace of faith, but Christ the object of faith; which faith lays
          hold on, and makes use of as a shield against the temptations of
          Satan: and also his "exceeding great reward"; his all in all, being
          made to him, as to all believers, wisdom, righteousness,
          sanctification, and redemption: him he believed, not only that he was
          God, but he believed his word of promise, and in his power and
          faithfulness to fulfil it; which regarded not only his natural
          offspring, and a numerous race, the enjoyment of the land of Canaan,
          and many temporal good things in it, but the Messiah, and spiritual
          blessings in him: he "believed in the Lord", Genesis 15:6 in Jehovah
          the Word, in him as his shield, and exceeding great reward, in him as
          the Lord his righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>And it was counted to him for righteousness</em>. That is, by God,
          whom he believed; for the sense is, not that Abraham ascribed
          righteousness to God, and celebrated his justice and faithfulness, as
          some; nor, as others, that Abraham was accounted a righteous man by
          the world; but that something was accounted by God to Abraham as his
          righteousness, which could not be the act of his faith; for faith is
          not a man's righteousness, neither in whole nor in part; faith and
          righteousness are two distinct things, and are often distinguished one
          from another in Scripture: besides, that which was accounted to
          Abraham for righteousness, is imputed to others also; see Romans 4:23
          which can never be true of the act of his faith; but is of the object
          of it, the word of the Lord, his shield and exceeding great reward,
          the Lord his righteousness and strength, who is made or accounted, as
          to him, so to others, righteousness. The righteousness of Christ, whom
          he believed in, was accounted to him as his justifying righteousness
          now for faith to be accounted for righteousness, is all one as to be
          justified by faith; that is, by Christ, or by his righteousness
          imputed and received by faith; and if Abraham was justified this way,
          as he was, the apostle has his argument against the false teachers.

          <em>That those who are of faith</em>. Of the faith of Abraham, as in
          Romans 4:16 have the same faith as he had, for nature and kind; though
          it may not be to the same degree, yet exercised on the same object,
          Jehovah the Word, the Lord our righteousness, and wrought by the same
          Spirit; or who are of the faith of Christ, believers in him with all
          their hearts, and for themselves; who look to him for righteousness
          and life, who seek for justification by his righteousness, and trust
          in him alone for it, and not in the works of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Are children of Abraham</em>. His spiritual seed, though they may
          not be his natural offspring; for he is the father of all that
          believe, whether of the circumcision or the uncircumcision, and of
          none else in a spiritual sense: in this the apostle strikes at the
          false teachers, who boasted of their being the seed of Abraham, his
          natural descendants, which they might be, and yet not his spiritual
          children; for none are such, but they that are of faith, or seek for
          righteousness by faith; not they that are of the law, or seek for
          justification by the works of it, and so not heirs of the blessing;
          were they, faith would be made void, and the promise of none effect,
          Romans 5:14 and his view herein is to prove, that the Gentiles, who
          believe, are the true seed of Abraham, the children of the promise,
          those in many nations, he was promised to be the father of; and his
          further view is to observe, that as the father of the faithful was
          justified, so are all his children; and that as he was justified by
          faith, so are they.

            faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you

        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>The Scripture, foreseeing</em>. What he had said in a general
          manner is now applied expressly to the Gentiles; for the calling of
          the Gentiles was a new and extraordinary occurrence. Doubts existed as
          to the manner in which they should be called. Some thought that they
          were required "to be circumcised and to keep the law," (Acts 15:24,)
          and that otherwise they were shut out from having a share in the
          covenant. But Paul shews, on the other hand, that by faith they arrive
          at the blessing, and by faith they must be "in grafted" (Romans 11:17,
          24,) into the family of Abraham. How does he prove this? Because it is
          said, In thee shall all nations be blessed. These words unquestionably
          recall that all must be blessed in the same manner as Abraham; for he
          is the model, nay, the rule, to be universally observed. Now, he
          obtained the blessing by faith, and in the same manner must it be
          obtained by all.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That God would justify the Gentiles by faith</em>. That is, that
          whereas a righteousness would be wrought out, and brought in, for the
          justification of all God's elect, and the doctrine of it be preached
          among the Gentiles, to whom faith would be given to lay hold on, and
          receive this righteousness, God would hereby, and hereupon pronounce
          the sentence of justification in the court of conscience; from whence
          follow peace and joy in the Holy Ghost; the Scripture, the author, and
          substance of it, God the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham</em>. For not to the
          Father or the Spirit, as to the Son, can preaching be so well
          ascribed: Christ was the first preacher of the Gospel that ever was;
          he first preached it to Adam and Eve in the garden, and afterwards to
          Abraham: it was Gospel, it was good news to him, that the Messiah
          should spring from him, and all nations be blessed in him; he rejoiced
          at it, and by faith saw Christ's day and was glad and particularly
          that part of the Gospel, and which is a principal part of it,
          justification by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it concerned the Gentiles, was preached unto him; and before his
          circumcision, of which that was a sign and seal, namely, that the
          righteousness of faith should be upon the uncircumcised Gentiles; and
          before the law of works was given on Mount Sinai, and long before the
          doctrine of justification by faith was preached unto the Gentiles, and
          they enjoyed the comfort of it; which shows this to be the Gospel, and
          to be no new doctrine, nor different from what was so early taught;
          the sum and substance of which lies in these words, "in thee shall all
          nations be blessed"; the passage referred to, is in Genesis 12:3 and
          is repeated Genesis 18:18 and in Genesis 22:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”</em> With the
          words "Abraham believed" Paul describes a spiritual Abraham, renewed
          by faith and regenerated by the Holy Ghost, that he should be the
          spiritual father of many nations. In that way all the Gentiles could
          be given to him for an inheritance. The Scriptures ascribe no
          righteousness to Abraham except through faith. The Scriptures speak of
          Abraham as he stands before God, a man justified by faith. Because of
          his faith God extends to him the promise: "In thee shall all nations
          be blessed."

        <p>
          <em>So then, those who are of faith</em>. This is the apostle's
          conclusion upon the whole, from the instance of Abraham, and, the
          promise made to him; and is an explanation of the preceding clause,
          and shows that it must be taken in a limited sense, and understood not
          of every individual; only of those who are of the same faith with
          Abraham, are believers in Christ, and seek for justification by faith
          in him, and not by the works of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Are blessed with the faithful Abraham</em>. They are blessed with
          a justifying righteousness in Christ as he was, and will be blessed
          with eternal life as he is; they shall sit with him, and with Isaac
          and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. The character of "faithful" given
          to him, respects not his uprightness and integrity among men, but his
          faith in God; and does not suppose that he was blessed for his faith,
          but that it was through faith that he received the blessing of
          justification, and not by the works of the law; and that in the same
          way, all that believe enjoy the same favour, for to them it is limited
          and restrained.
