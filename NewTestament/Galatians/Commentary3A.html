            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Foolish Galatians</em>. Referring not to any national character,
            as some have thought, by which they were distinguished from others
            for their rudeness in knowledge, their ignorance and folly, as the
            Cretans for their lying (Titus 1:2), nor to their former state in
            unregeneracy, it being common to all men, to God's elect themselves,
            before conversion, to be foolish in a moral and spiritual sense but
            to their present stupidity about the article of justification, it
            being an instance of most egregious folly to leave Christ for Moses,
            the Gospel for the law, and the doctrine of free justification by
            the righteousness of Christ, which brings so much solid peace and
            comfort with it, for the doctrine of justification, by the works of
            the law, which naturally leads to bondage. Now this was said, not
            rashly, nor in anger, or on purpose to reproach and provoke, and so
            not at all contrary to Matthew 5:22 but in like manner as Christ
            said to his disciples, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe" (Lk
            24:25).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who has bewitched you</em>? Some false teacher or another had,
            or it cannot be conceived how their heads should ever have been
            turned this way which must be understood, not in a literal and
            proper sense, as Simon Magus bewitched the people of Samaria with
            his sorceries (Acts 8:9-24), but in a figurative and improper one;
            that as sorcerers and enchanters cast a mist before people's eyes,
            or, by some evil arts or juggling tricks, deceive their sight, and
            make objects seem to appear which do not, or in a different form
            than they really do, so these deceitful workers, who had transformed
            themselves into the apostles of Christ, as Satan sometimes
            transforms himself into an angel of light (1 Cor 11:14), had set
            this doctrine in a false light before them, thereby to corrupt their
            minds from the simplicity that is in Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though the apostle reproves the Galatians for their folly and
            weakness in giving in so easily to such deceptions, yet he imputes
            the chief fault unto, and lays the greatest blame on the false
            teachers; whom he represents as sorcerers and enchanters, and their
            doctrine, particularly that of justification by works, as
            witchcraft; it being pleasing to men, a gratifying of carnal reason,
            and operating as a charm upon the pride of human nature. What Samuel
            said to Saul, may be applied to the present case, "to obey" the
            truth "is better than sacrifice", than all the rituals of the
            ceremonial law: "and to hearken" to the Gospel of Christ, "than the
            fat of rams", or any of the legal institutions; "for rebellion"
            against, and opposition to any of the doctrines of the Gospel, and
            especially to this of justification by the righteousness of Christ,
            "is as the sin of witchcraft" (1 Sam 15:22). The false apostles,
            envying their light and knowledge in the Gospel, their faith, peace,
            comfort, and happiness, had endeavoured to introduce another
            doctrine among them, subversive of all this.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Not to obey the truth</em>. By "the truth" is meant, either the
            whole Gospel, often so called, in opposition to the law, and the
            types and shadows of it; and because it is contained in the
            Scriptures of truth, and comes from the God of truth; the substance
            of it is Christ, who is the truth, and is what the Spirit of truth
            leads into; or else particularly the doctrine of justification by
            the righteousness of Christ, which is the truth the apostle is
            establishing, and these Galatians seemed to be going off from,
            through the artful insinuations of the false teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Formerly these people had not only heard this truth, but embraced
            it: they received the love of it, were strongly affected to it, and
            firmly believed but now they began to hesitate and doubt about it;
            they were not so fully persuaded of it as heretofore; they seemed
            ready to let it go, at least did not hold it fast, and the
            profession of it, without wavering as before; they were fallen from
            some degree of the steadfastness of their faith in, and of the
            obedience of it to this truth, which is what was the design of the
            false apostles, and is here charged upon the Galatians.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you</em
            >. Meaning in the ministry of the Gospel, in the clear preaching of
            it by the apostle; Jesus Christ was the sum and substance of his
            ministry, in which he was set forth and described, and, as it were,
            painted to the life by him; the glories and excellencies of his
            divine person, the nature of his office, as Mediator, the
            suitableness of him as a Saviour, the fulness of his grace, the
            efficacy of his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness, were so fully,
            and in such a lively manner expressed, that it was as if Christ was
            personally and visibly present with them; yea, he was so described
            in his sufferings and death, as hanging, bleeding, dying on the
            accursed tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>As crucified</em>. For this cannot be understood literally, for
            he was crucified without the gates of Jerusalem; nor does it respect
            the sin of the Galatians in departing from the Gospel, as if that
            was a crucifying of him again, and a putting him to open shame; nor
            their sufferings for the sake of Christ, as if he, in that sense,
            was crucified in them, and with them: but it intends the clear
            Gospel revelation of a crucified Christ, in the preaching of him by
            the apostle, which was such that no picture, no image, no crucifix
            would come up to, and which, where such preaching is, are altogether
            vain and needless; and the clear view these saints had, by faith, in
            the glass of the Gospel of Christ, and him crucified, which so
            realized the object, as if it was present and before the natural
            eye. Now this was an aggravation of their weakness and folly, that
            after such clear preaching, and clear sight, they had of the Gospel,
            and of Christ in it, that they should in the least degree depart
            from it.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 2.
            <em
              >I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by
              the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>I just want to learn this from you</em>. Though there were many
            things he could have put to them, yet he would only ask this one
            question, which, if rightly attended to, and honestly answered, must
            expose their folly, and put an end to the controversy upon this
            head: "Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by
            hearing of faith?"
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing
              of faith</em
            >? This question supposes they had received the Spirit; that is, the
            Spirit of God, as a spirit of wisdom and knowledge in the revelation
            of Christ; as a spirit of regeneration and sanctification; as a
            spirit of faith and adoption; and as the earnest, seal, and pledge
            of their future glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law</em>? Now the
            apostle asks, whether they received this Spirit "by the works of the
            law"; meaning, either whether they could imagine that they, by their
            obedience to the law, had merited and procured the Spirit of God; or
            whether they thought that the Spirit came to them, and into their
            hearts, through the doctrine or preaching of the law: the former
            could not be true, for if they could not obtain righteousness and
            life by the works of the law, then not the Spirit; besides, works
            done without the Spirit of God, are not properly good works: for
            though by the law is the knowledge of sin, yet this leaves nothing
            but a sense of wrath and damnation in the conscience; it is the
            killing letter, and a ministration of condemnation and death, and
            not of the Spirit, and of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Or by hearing of faith</em>? Spirit and life belong to the
            Gospel, "or the hearing of faith"; for by "faith" is meant the
            Gospel, and particularly the doctrine of justification by faith in
            Christ's righteousness; and by "the hearing" of it, the preaching of
            it, the report of it. Now in this way the Spirit of God is received;
            while the Gospel is preaching he falls on them that hear it, conveys
            himself into their hearts, and begets them again by the word of
            truth: and in this way the Galatians came by the Spirit, and which
            is another aggravation of their folly, that they should enjoy so
            great an advantage by the Gospel, and yet be so easily removed from
            it.
          </p>

            <em

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Are you so foolish</em>? Is it possible you should be so stupid?
            and do you, or can you continue to be so?
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Having begun in the Spirit</em>. That is, either in the Spirit
            of God, whom they had received through the preaching of the Gospel.
            They set out in a profession of religion in the light, under the
            influence, and by the assistance of the Spirit; they began to
            worship the Lord in spirit, and in truth, without any confidence in
            the flesh; they entered upon the service of God, and a newness of
            life, a different conversation than before, a spiritual way of
            living in a dependence on the grace and help of the divine Spirit:
            or in the Gospel, which is the Spirit that gives life, is the
            ministration of the Spirit of God, and contains spiritual doctrines,
            and gives an account of spiritual blessings, and is attended with
            the Holy Ghost, and with power. This was first preached unto them,
            and they embraced it; this they begun and set out with in their
            Christian profession, and yet it looked as if they sought to end
            with something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Are you now completed in the flesh</em>? Not in carnality, in
            the lusts of the flesh, as if they now walked and lived after the
            flesh, in a carnal, dissolute, wicked course of life; for the
            apostle is not charging them with immoralities, but complaining of
            their principles: wherefore, by "the flesh" is meant, either the
            strength of mere nature, in opposition to the Spirit of God, by
            which they endeavoured to perform obedience to the law; or else the
            law itself, in distinction from the Gospel; and particularly the
            ceremonial law, the law of a carnal commandment, and which consisted
            of carnal ordinances, and only sanctified to the purifying of the
            flesh; and also their obedience to it; yea, even all their own
            righteousness, the best of it, which is but flesh, merely external,
            weak, and insufficient to justify before God.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a third aggravation of their folly, that whereas they begun
            their Christian race depending upon the Spirit and grace of God, now
            they seemed to be taking a step as if they thought to finish it in
            the mere strength of nature; and whereas they set out with the clear
            Gospel of Christ, and sought for justification only by his
            righteousness, they were now verging to the law, and seeking to make
            their justifying righteousness perfect, by joining the works of the
            law unto it, which needed them not, but was perfect without them.
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Did you suffer so many things in vain</em>? These Galatians had
            suffered great reproach, many afflictions and persecutions for the
            sake of the Gospel, as all that embrace it must expect to do; and
            which to them that persevere in the faith of the Gospel will not be
            in vain, they will be followed with eternal life and glory; not that
            these things are meritorious of such happiness, or deserve such a
            reward; the reward of them is not of debt, but of grace. But, if
            such who have made a profession, and have suffered for it, should
            after all relinquish it, their sufferings for it are in vain; they
            will come short of that glory which is promised to them that suffer
            for righteousness sake: and this is another aggravation of the folly
            of these persons, that they should suffer so much persecution for
            the Gospel, which, if not true, they must have suffered in vain, and
            might as well have avoided it; and, if true, by relinquishing it not
            only sustain a great loss, but bring great hurt and damage to
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If it is indeed in vain</em>? By which words the apostle does,
            as it were, correct himself, and expresses his hope of them, that
            they would see their mistake, revoke their error, and abide by the
            truth of the Gospel.

            the extraordinary gifts of it unto men; but either God or Christ who
            had ministered, and still continued to minister the grace of the
            Spirit through the preaching of the Gospel; or rather the
            extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, which were manifested at the
            first preaching of the Gospel to them for the confirmation of it,
            and which they were still supplied with.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And does miracles among you</em>. So that this is a distinct
            argument from that in Galatians 3:2 and a further proof and
            aggravation of the folly and stupidity of the members of this
            church, who had not only received through the Gospel the Spirit, as
            a spirit of regeneration, at least many of them, but had seen the
            Gospel confirmed by the extraordinary gifts, signs, and wonders of
            the Holy Ghost, and which were still among them; and yet they were
            departing from this Gospel, through which all this was done.

            <em
              >Does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith</em

            Spirit, and these miracles done among them, did not attend the
            preaching of the law, or the doctrine of justification by works,
            taught by the false apostles, but the doctrine of faith, of
            justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ, delivered by
            him and others, for the truth of which he appeals to themselves; and
            therefore they must be guilty of the most egregious folly, once to
            think of, or take any one step towards a departure from that
            doctrine.

            <em>Even so, Abraham</em>. The apostle having observed, that the
            special grace and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit were received
            not through the preaching of the law, but through the doctrine of
            faith; by an easy transition, passes on to a further confirmation of
            the doctrine of justification by faith, by producing the instance of
            Abraham, what the Scripture says of him, and the promise made unto
            him; which is very appropriate to his purpose, since Abraham was
            certainly a righteous man, the first of the circumcision, and the
            head of the Jewish nation; and whom the false teachers much gloried
            in, and boasted of their being his seed, and of being circumcised as
            he was; and would fain have persuaded the Gentiles to the same
            practice, in imitation of him, and as necessary to their
            justification before God; whereas the apostle here shows, referring
            to Genesis 15:6 that Abraham was justified by faith, and not by any
            works whatever, much less by circumcision; for what he here refers
            to, was many years before his circumcision; and since therefore he
            was a justified person, declared to be so, before it and without it,
            it was not necessary to his justification, nor is it to any other
            person's.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Believed God</em>. The object of faith is God, Father, Son, and
            Spirit; here Jehovah the Son seems principally intended, who in
            Genesis 15:1 is called the "Word of the Lord"; the essential Word,
            who was with God from everlasting, and was God, and in the fulness
            of time was made flesh and dwelt among men; and "Abraham's shield",
            the same the apostle in Ephesians 6:16 calls "the shield of faith";
            meaning not the grace of faith, but Christ the object of faith;
            which faith lays hold on, and makes use of as a shield against the
            temptations of Satan: and also his "exceeding great reward"; his all
            in all, being made to him, as to all believers, wisdom,
            righteousness, sanctification, and redemption: him he believed, not
            only that he was God, but he believed his word of promise, and in
            his power and faithfulness to fulfil it; which regarded not only his
            natural offspring, and a numerous race, the enjoyment of the land of
            Canaan, and many temporal good things in it, but the Messiah, and
            spiritual blessings in him: he "believed in the Lord", Genesis 15:6
            in Jehovah the Word, in him as his shield, and exceeding great
            reward, in him as the Lord his righteousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And it was counted to him for righteousness</em>. That is, by
            God, whom he believed; for the sense is, not that Abraham ascribed
            righteousness to God, and celebrated his justice and faithfulness,
            as some; nor, as others, that Abraham was accounted a righteous man
            by the world; but that something was accounted by God to Abraham as
            his righteousness, which could not be the act of his faith; for
            faith is not a man's righteousness, neither in whole nor in part;
            faith and righteousness are two distinct things, and are often
            distinguished one from another in Scripture: besides, that which was
            accounted to Abraham for righteousness, is imputed to others also;
            see Romans 4:23 which can never be true of the act of his faith; but
            is of the object of it, the word of the Lord, his shield and
            exceeding great reward, the Lord his righteousness and strength, who
            is made or accounted, as to him, so to others, righteousness. The
            righteousness of Christ, whom he believed in, was accounted to him
            as his justifying righteousness now for faith to be accounted for
            righteousness, is all one as to be justified by faith; that is, by
            Christ, or by his righteousness imputed and received by faith; and
            if Abraham was justified this way, as he was, the apostle has his
            argument against the false teachers.

            object, Jehovah the Word, the Lord our righteousness, and wrought by
            the same Spirit; or who are of the faith of Christ, believers in him
            with all their hearts, and for themselves; who look to him for
            righteousness and life, who seek for justification by his
            righteousness, and trust in him alone for it, and not in the works
            of the law.

          <p>
            <em>Are children of Abraham</em>. His spiritual seed, though they

            believe, whether of the circumcision or the uncircumcision, and of
            none else in a spiritual sense: in this the apostle strikes at the
            false teachers, who boasted of their being the seed of Abraham, his
            natural descendants, which they might be, and yet not his spiritual
            children; for none are such, but they that are of faith, or seek for
            righteousness by faith; not they that are of the law, or seek for
            justification by the works of it, and so not heirs of the blessing;
            were they, faith would be made void, and the promise of none effect,
            Romans 5:14 and his view herein is to prove, that the Gentiles, who
            believe, are the true seed of Abraham, the children of the promise,
            those in many nations, he was promised to be the father of; and his
            further view is to observe, that as the father of the faithful was
            justified, so are all his children; and that as he was justified by
            faith, so are they.

          <p>
            <em>The Scripture, foreseeing</em>. What he had said in a general
            manner is now applied expressly to the Gentiles; for the calling of
            the Gentiles was a new and extraordinary occurrence. Doubts existed
            as to the manner in which they should be called. Some thought that
            they were required "to be circumcised and to keep the law," (Acts
            15:24,) and that otherwise they were shut out from having a share in
            the covenant. But Paul shows, on the other hand, that by faith they
            arrive at the blessing, and by faith they must be "in grafted"
            (Romans 11:17, 24,) into the family of Abraham. How does he prove
            this? Because it is said, In thee shall all nations be blessed.
            These words unquestionably recall that all must be blessed in the
            same manner as Abraham; for he is the model, nay, the rule, to be
            universally observed. Now, he obtained the blessing by faith, and in
            the same manner must it be obtained by all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That God would justify the Gentiles by faith</em>. That is, that
            whereas a righteousness would be wrought out, and brought in, for
            the justification of all God's elect, and the doctrine of it be
            preached among the Gentiles, to whom faith would be given to lay
            hold on, and receive this righteousness, God would hereby, and
            hereupon pronounce the sentence of justification in the court of
            conscience; from whence follow peace and joy in the Holy Ghost; the
            Scripture, the author, and substance of it, God the Word.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham</em>. For not to
            the Father or the Spirit, as to the Son, can preaching be so well
            ascribed: Christ was the first preacher of the Gospel that ever was;
            he first preached it to Adam and Eve in the garden, and afterwards
            to Abraham: it was Gospel, it was good news to him, that the Messiah
            should spring from him, and all nations be blessed in him; he
            rejoiced at it, and by faith saw Christ's day and was glad and
            particularly that part of the Gospel, and which is a principal part
            of it, justification by faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            As it concerned the Gentiles, was preached unto him; and before his
            circumcision, of which that was a sign and seal, namely, that the
            righteousness of faith should be upon the uncircumcised Gentiles;
            and before the law of works was given on Mount Sinai, and long
            before the doctrine of justification by faith was preached unto the
            Gentiles, and they enjoyed the comfort of it; which shows this to be
            the Gospel, and to be no new doctrine, nor different from what was
            so early taught; the sum and substance of which lies in these words,
            "in thee shall all nations be blessed"; the passage referred to, is
            in Genesis 12:3 and is repeated Genesis 18:18 and in Genesis 22:18.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”</em> With the
            words "Abraham believed" Paul describes a spiritual Abraham, renewed
            by faith and regenerated by the Holy Ghost, that he should be the
            spiritual father of many nations. In that way all the Gentiles could
            be given to him for an inheritance. The Scriptures ascribe no
            righteousness to Abraham except through faith. The Scriptures speak
            of Abraham as he stands before God, a man justified by faith.
            Because of his faith God extends to him the promise: "In thee shall
            all nations be blessed."

            <em>So then, those who are of faith</em>. This is the apostle's
            conclusion upon the whole, from the instance of Abraham, and, the
            promise made to him; and is an explanation of the preceding clause,
            and shows that it must be taken in a limited sense, and understood
            not of every individual; only of those who are of the same faith
            with Abraham, are believers in Christ, and seek for justification by
            faith in him, and not by the works of the law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Are blessed with the faithful Abraham</em>. They are blessed
            with a justifying righteousness in Christ as he was, and will be
            blessed with eternal life as he is; they shall sit with him, and
            with Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. The character of
            "faithful" given to him, respects not his uprightness and integrity
            among men, but his faith in God; and does not suppose that he was
            blessed for his faith, but that it was through faith that he
            received the blessing of justification, and not by the works of the
            law; and that in the same way, all that believe enjoy the same
            favour, for to them it is limited and restrained.

            would be no need for our present treatise... But the enemy of truth

            Jerome comments, "Christ is rightly said to be portrayed clearly
            before us because the whole chorus of the [Old Testament] prophets
            foretold his torture, suffering, and the blows and whippings he
            would receive. As a result, we know about the cross not only from
            the Gospel, which relates the story of his crucifixion, but also
            [from writings penned] long before he deigned to come down to earth
            and assume the form of a crucified man. It is much to the Galatians'
            credit that they believed in Christ crucified as he had previously
            been portrayed for them. They of course had been led in due course
            to this belief by continually reading the prophets and by knowing
            all of the ordinances of the old Law." (<a

            And David too, as he knows this, similarly prays that the same thing
            may be granted to him by God's mercy. 'Strengthen, O God, that which
            Thou hast wrought in us:' showing that it is not enough for the

            God, when a man is uplifted, not because of his own justice, but
            because he knows he is empty of true glory, and made just only
            through his faith in Christ. In this Paul gloried, that he thought
            nothing of his own justice; that he sought that justice alone which
            comes through Christ, which is from God, justice in faith (Phil.
            iii. 9); and that he might know Him, and the power of His
            resurrection, and the sharing of His sufferings, and be made like
            Him in His death, if by any means he might himself attain to the
            resurrection which is from the dead. It is here that the whole
            top-loftiness of arrogance falls down. Nothing is left to you to
            glory in, O man; whose true glorying and whose hope is in mortifying

            Archelaus writes, "And, indeed, I do not make this statement on the

            that Scripture which has been our instructor. For the apostle
            addresses the following words to us: 'That you may be lights in this
            world, holding the word of life for my glory against the day of
            Christ, seeing that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in
            vain' [Phil 2:15-16]. For the meaning of this saying is, that our
            Lord Jesus Christ, when He comes, will see that his doctrine has
            proved profitable in us, and that, finding that he, the apostle, has
            not run in vain, neither laboured in vain, He will bestow on him the
            crown of recompense. And again, in the same epistle, he also warns
            us not to mind earthly things, and tells us that we ought to have
            our conversation in heaven; from which also we look for the Saviour,

            am dead to the law, that I may live unto God,' that is, by the
            spiritual law he is dead to the carnal interpretation of the law.
            And we, by the law of our Lord Jesus Christ, are dead to this law,
            which sanctions such perfidious decrees. The law did not gather the
            Church together, but the faith of Christ. For the law is not by
            faith, but 'the just man lives by faith.' Therefore, faith, not the
            law, makes a man just, for justice is not through the law, but
            through the faith of Christ. But he who casts aside his faith and
            pleads for that, the claims of the law, bears witness that he is

            the Commandments be added, Faith no longer avails; for Faith then
            has efficacy when things from the Law are not added to it. 'Ye who

            Daniel Whedon comments, "But, as Prof. Lightfoot has fully shown,

            literature, both among the Greek-Jews of Alexandria, of whom the
            chief representative was Philo, and among the Rabbinical Jews of the
            Babylonian school, who retained much of ancient tradition. Thus, in
            the Apocrypha, ( 1Ma 2:52 ,) Mattathias, father of the Maccabees,
            enumerating a line of Hebrew worthies, begins with 'Was not Abraham
            found faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for
            righteousness?' And so in the Rabbinical school it was said, 'Great
            is faith, whereby Israel believed on Him that spake and the world
            was. For as a reward for Israel's having believed in the Lord, the
            Holy Spirit dwelt on them… In like manner thou findest that Abraham,
            our father, inherited this world and the world to come, solely by
            the merit of faith, whereby he believed in the Lord; for it is said,
            And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for
            righteousness.' A doctrine of faith essentially, yet not wholly,

            only, but in him who sent me'? In another place he replied to Jews
            who applauded themselves for the antiquity and nobility of their
            ethnicity, 'Do not say, We have Abraham as our father, for God is
            capable of raising up children for Abraham out of these stones.'

            prophesied respecting Him, I think that this position also has been
            made good, viz., that the Scriptures themselves, which contained
            these predictions, were divinely inspired, — those, namely, which
            had either foretold His advent, or the power of His doctrine, or the
            bringing over of all nations (to His obedience). To which this
            remark must be added, that the divinity and inspiration both of the
            predictions of the prophets and of the law of Moses have been
            clearly revealed and confirmed, especially since the advent of

            If any one, moreover, consider the words of the prophets with all
            the zeal and reverence which they deserve, it is certain that, in
            the perusal and careful examination thus given them, he will feel
            his mind and senses touched by a divine breath, and will acknowledge
            that the words which he reads were no human utterances, but the
            language of God; and from his own emotions he will feel that these
            books were the composition of no human skill, nor of any mortal
            eloquence, but, so to speak, of a style that is divine. The
            splendour of Christ's advent, therefore, illuminating the law of
            Moses by the light of truth, has taken away that veil which had been
            placed over the letter (of the law), and has unsealed, for every one

            thought of the lectures on the Books of Scripture. I, who had as yet

            seemed to me most useful in so far as the salvation of the soul was
            concerned, but that it appeared quite extraordinary to me that
            educated persons should not be able to understand the sacred books
            simply by studying them themselves, together with the glosses
            thereon, and without the aid of any teacher. Most of those who were
            present mocked at me, and asked whether I myself could do as I had
            said, or whether I would dare to undertake it. I answered that if
            they wished, I was ready to try it. Forthwith they cried out and
            jeered all the more. 'Well and good,' said they; 'we agree to the

            the Scriptures, so that we can put this boast of yours to the

            the Greek word for 'righteous' and means 'to declare righteous.'
            This verdict includes: pardon from the guilt and penalty of sin, as
            well as the imputation of Christ's righteousness to the believer's
            account, which provides for the positive righteousness man needs to
            be accepted by God. God declares a sinner righteous solely on the
            basis of the merits of Christ's righteousness. God imputes a
            believer's sin to Christ's account in His sacrificial death. The
            sinner receives this gift of God's grace by faith alone.
            Justification is a gracious gift God extends to the repentant,
            believing sinner—wholly apart from human merit or work." (Galatians:

            translated as &quot;before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly
            portrayed&quot;. &quot;οἷς κατ&#x27; ὀφθαλμοὺς&quot; (hois kat&#x27;
            ophthalmous) literally means &quot;before the eyes&quot;, and
            &quot;προεγράφη&quot; (proegraphē) is from &quot;προγράφω&quot;
            (prographō), meaning &quot;to write before&quot; or &quot;to portray
            publicly&quot;. It suggests that the message of Jesus Christ was
            very clearly presented to the Galatians.
          </p>
          <p>
            ἐν ὑμῖν ἐσταυρωμένος: Finally, this means &quot;among you,
            crucified&quot;. &quot;ἐσταυρωμένος&quot; (estaurōmenos) is a
            perfect passive participle form of &quot;σταυρόω&quot; (stauróō),
            meaning &quot;to crucify&quot;. This phrase emphasizes the central
            Christian belief of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion and its significance for
            the audience.
