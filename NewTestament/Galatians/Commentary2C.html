            John Calvin comments, "Fourteen years after. This cannot with
            certainty be affirmed to be the same journey mentioned by Luke.
            (Acts 15:2.) The connection of the history leads us rather to an
            opposite conclusion. We find that Paul performed four journeys to
            Jerusalem. Of the first we have already spoken. The second took
            place when, in company with Barnabas, he brought the charitable
            contributions of the Greek and Asiatic Churches. (Acts 15:25.) My
            belief that this second journey is referred to in the present
            passage rests on various grounds. On any other supposition, the
            statements of Paul and Luke cannot be reconciled. Besides, there is
            ground for conjecturing that the rebuke was administered to Peter at
            Antioch while Paul was residing there. Now, this happened before he
            was sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle the dispute which
            had arisen about ceremonial observances. (Acts 15:2.) It is not
            reasonable to suppose that Peter would have used such dissimulation,
            if that controversy had been settled and the decree of the Apostles
            published. But Paul writes that he came to Jerusalem, and afterwards
            adds that he had rebuked Peter for an act of dissimulation, an act
            which Peter certainly would not have committed except in matters
            that were doubtful." (<a

            James Coffman comments, "Some scholars dogmatically assert that
            Paul's account of the 'council' here cannot be harmonized with Acts
            15:1ff; but that is only because they fail to see that there were
            private discussions which took place before the public and more
            formal meeting later on." (<a

            Johann Lange comments, "Had the idea been merely, that the
            circumcision was not even demanded, so strong a word would not have
            been used. There is some force in the suggestion of Lightfoot, that
            the Apostles recommended Paul to yield as a charitable concession,
            but convinced at length that he was right, they gave him their
            support. Still we have not sufficient knowledge of the circumstances
            to decide whether Paul cites this as an evidence of the Apostles’
            agreement with him or of his firmness—in all probability it is both.
            Not even Titus, of whom as a Greek the false brethren made the
            demand, was required to submit—or whom as a Greek I would not allow
            to be circumcised, since this would have been a giving up of the
            whole matter. The preceding context suggests the former, the
            subsequent context the latter side of the occurrence. On the reasons
            for the non-circumcision of Titus, and the circumcision of Timothy
            (Acts 16:2)" (<a

            Augustine writes, "Let us treat scripture like scripture, like God
            speaking; don't let's look there for man going wrong. It is not for
            nothing, you see, that the canon has been established for the
            Church. This is the function of the Holy Spirit. So if anybody reads
            my book, let him pass judgment on me. If I have said something
            reasonable, let him follow, not me, but reason itself; if I've
            proved it by the clearest divine testimony, let him follow, not me,
            but the divine scripture." (The Works of Saint Augustine, Newly
            Discovered Sermons, part 3, vol 11, Edmund Hill, Sermon 162C.15,
            Hyde Park: New City Press, 1997, pg 176).

            Martin Luther comments, "Now the true Gospel has it that we are
            justified by faith alone, without the deeds of the Law. The false
            gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but not without the
            deeds of the Law. The false apostles preached a conditional gospel.
            So do the papists. They admit that faith is the foundation of
            salvation. But they add the conditional clause that faith can save
            only when it is furnished with good works. This is wrong. The true
            Gospel declares that good works are the embellishment of faith, but
            that faith itself is the gift and work of God in our hearts. Faith
            is able to justify, because it apprehends Christ, the Redeemer." (<a

            Martin Luther comments, "There must be people in high office, of
            course. But we are not to deify them. The governor, the mayor, the
            preacher, the teacher, the scholar, father, mother, are persons whom
            we are to love and revere, but not to the extent that we forget God.
            Least we attach too much importance to the person, God leaves with
            important persons offenses and sins, sometimes astounding
            shortcomings, to show us that there is a lot of difference between
            any person and God. David was a good king. But when the people began
            to think too well of him, down he fell into horrible sins, adultery
            and murder. Peter, excellent apostle that he was, denied Christ.
            Such examples of which the Scriptures are full, ought to warn us not
            to repose our trust in men. In the papacy appearance counts for
            everything. Indeed, the whole papacy amounts to nothing more than a
            mere kowtowing of persons and outward mummery. But God alone is to
            be feared and honored.
            <br />
            I would honor the Pope, I would love his person, if he would leave
            my conscience alone, and not compel me to sin against God. But the
            Pope wants to be adored himself, and that cannot be done without
            offending God. Since we must choose between one or the other, let us
            choose God. The truth is we are commissioned by God to resist the
            Pope, for it is written, "We ought to obey God rather than men"
            (Acts 5:29). We have seen how Paul refutes the argument of the false
            apostles concerning the authority of the apostles. In order that the
            truth of the Gospel may continue; in order that the Word of God and
            the righteousness of faith may be kept pure and undefiled, let the
            apostles, let an angel from heaven, let Peter, let Paul, let them
            all perish." (<a

            Joseph Benson comments, "The charge of preaching the Glad Tidings to
            the Judaites; was committed to Petrus — 'By saying that he was
            intrusted with the Glad Tidings of the uncircumcision, even as
            Petrus was with that of the circumcision, Paulus Apostolus put
            himself on a level with Petrus. In like manner, his withstanding
            Petrus publicly for withdrawing himself from the converted Gentiles,
            is a fact utterly inconsistent with the pretended superiority of
            Petrus above the other apostles, vainly imagined by the Roman
            pontiffs, for the purpose of aggrandizing themselves as his
            successors, above all other Christian bishops.' For he that wrought
            effectually in, or by, Petrus — To qualify him for the apostleship
            of the circumcision, to support him in the discharge of that office,
            and to render his exercise of it successful; the same was mighty in
            me — Wrought also effectually in and by me, for and in the discharge

            manifested by revelation, let Paul himself convict them, when he

            of the circumcision, and in himself for the Gentiles. [Galatians

            Scot McKnight comments, "In chapter 2, however, he argues that while
            his gospel was independent in source, it was also
            <em>endorsed</em> by the Jerusalem pillars. That endorsement, for
            Paul, was not necessary, but as long as it worked out that way, he
            decides to use that endorsement as part of his case against the
            Judaizers." (Galatians, NIV Application Commentary: Zondervan,

            Jerome comments, "For the man who is poor in grace or faith is
            unable to hear the warning about the punishment that is to come
            because he does not have spiritual riches or a knowledge of
            Scripture, which is compared to gold, silver, and a precious gem.
            Therefore, because it is the sick and not the healthy that need a
            doctor, the apostles agreed by the clasping of right hands not to
            look down on the poor or be contemptuous of sinners but always to
            remember them, just as Paul remembered the man whom in his first
            letter to the Corinthian church he had chastised momentarily in the
            hope that he would put his body through rigorous repentance and
            thereby save his spirit.2 He wrote to this man in his second letter
            [to the same church] to summon him back to the fold so that he would
            not be swallowed up by more sorrow, and he asked all the members of
            the congregation to forgive their brother and reaffirm their love
            for him, just as Paul himself forgave each of them before Christ,
            thus fulfilling the promise he had made at Jerusalem always to
            remember the poor." (<a
