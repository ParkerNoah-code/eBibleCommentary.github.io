          <h2>B. Calling: Proved by Independence (1:15-24)</h2>
          <h2>Ver 15. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ὅτε δὲ εὐδόκησεν ὁ θεὸς ὁ
              ἀφορίσας με ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου καὶ
              καλέσας διὰ τῆς χάριτος αὐτοῦ,</span></h2>
          <p>
            ἀφορίσας - seperated [selected]. Paul looks back on his parentage
            and early years as a providential preparation
            for his future ministry: this view is justified by his antecedents.
            By birth at once a Hebrew, a Greek and Roman
            citizen, educated in the Hebrew Scriptures and in Greek learning, he
            combined in his own person the most
            essential requisites for an Apostle to the Gentiles. He was further
            moulded by the spiritual discipline of an
            intense, though mistaken, zeal for the Law of his God, which issued
            in bitter remorse. By this career he was
            fitted to become a chosen vessel to bear the name of Christ before
            the Gentile world. He did not hesitate
            accordingly to regard himself, like Hebrew prophets of old (Isaiah
            49:1; Isaiah 49:5, Jeremiah 1:5), as
            dedicated from his birth to the service of God.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 16. <span style="font-weight:normal">ἀποκαλύψαι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ
              ἐν ἐμοὶ ἵνα εὐαγγελίζωμαι αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς
              ἔθνεσιν, εὐθέως οὐ προσανεθέμην σαρκὶ καὶ αἵματι·</span></h2>
          <p>
            ἀποκαλύψαι... ἐν τοῖς - reveal... in me. These words taken alone
            might denote either an inward revelation to
            Paul himself, or a revelation through him to the Gentiles. But the
            context is decisive in favour of the former:
            for this revelation is not only associated closely with his
            conversion and his personal history between that and
            the visit to Arabia, but it is expressly stated that it was granted
            with a view to future preaching (ἵνα,
            that...). The context distinguishes this revelation from the call;
            it cannot therefore be identified with the
            previous vision of Christ on the way, but (as the words ἐν ἐμοί
            import) was an inward and spiritual revelation
            which followed that appeal to eye and ear. The history corroborates
            this view: for it relates that Saul, after
            his vision, spent three days in solitary communion with himself and
            God before he was admitted to Christian
            baptism.
          </p>

          <p>
            προσανεθέμην - confer [consult]. This compound verb denotes (as in
            Galatians 2:6) additional communication.
            After direct revelation from God Saul had no occasion to seek
            further advice from man. There is an apparent
            reminiscence in thought and language of Christ's words, "flesh and
            blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My
            Father" (Matthew 16:17).
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 17. <span style="font-weight:normal">οὐδὲ ἀνῆλθον εἰς
              Ἱεροσόλυμα πρὸς τοὺς πρὸ ἐμοῦ ἀποστόλους, ἀλλὰ
              ἀπῆλθον εἰς Ἀραβίαν, καὶ πάλιν ὑπέστρεψα εἰς Δαμασκόν.</span></h2>
          <p>
            ἀνῆλθον - did I go up. The religious position of Jerusalem as seat
            of the Temple and mother-city of the Church,
            its political importance, and its geographical position on the
            central heights of Palestine, combined to suggest
            the application of the terms up and down to journeys to and from
            Jerusalem.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἀποστόλους - apostles. In the third Gospel and early chapters of the
            Acts this title is habitually applied to
            the Twelve. It was extended to Paul and Barnabas on the occasion of
            their mission. In 1 Corinthians 9:2 Paul and
            Barnabas are distinctly enumerated amidst the recognised Apostles.
            Romans 16:7 suggests a further extension of
            the title, probably to all founders of churches. But with the
            possible exception of James, no addition is
            recorded to the number of the Twelve at Jerusalem after Matthias.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ἀραβίαν - Arabia. No mention is made elsewhere of this journey; its
            object is clearly indicated by the context;
            for it is placed in strong contrast with human intercourse, and was,
            therefore, undertaken for the sake of
            solitary communion with God. The Arabian deserts were within easy
            reach of Damascus. Lightfoot suggests, indeed,
            that Paul perhaps repaired to Mount Sinai; but if the Apostle had
            been granted communion with God on Mount
            Sinai, the name would have constituted too effective an argument in
            favour of his Divine commission to be
            suppressed here. The Sinaitic peninsula was, in fact, remote from
            Damascus; the journey was at all times
            dangerous for travellers without escort, and in the year 37 (the
            most probable date of Saul's conversion) was
            hardly possible on account of war between King Aretas and the
            Romans.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 18. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἔπειτα μετὰ ἔτη τρία
              ἀνῆλθον εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα ἱστορῆσαι Κηφᾶν, καὶ
              ἐπέμεινα πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡμέρας δεκαπέντε.</span></h2>
          <p>
            Ἔπειτα - then. Ἔπειτα . The thrice-repeated Ἔπειτα in this verse, in
            Galatians 1:21 , and in Galatians 2:1 ,
            singles out three events in the Apostle's life bearing on his
            contact with the Church of Jerusalem: his first
            introduction to them, his departure to a distant sphere of labour,
            and his return to Jerusalem with Barnabas.
            The object of this sketch was not to write a history of those years,
            but to fix attention on certain salient
            incidents which threw light on the real nature of his intercourse
            with Jerusalem.
          </p>

          <p>
            μετὰ ἔτη τρία - after three years. A different preposition is here
            employed from that used in Galatians 2:1 ,
            which describes a mission within fourteen years. In this case no
            precise date is implied; for the object is not
            to date the visit, but to show that three full years at least had
            elapsed before Paul had any interaction with
            the Twelve.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἱστορῆσαι Κηφᾶν - to enquire of Cephas. That is, to obtain
            information from him. This is the usual meaning of
            the verb; in Herodotus, and elsewhere, it denotes visits paid to
            places of interest with a view to getting
            information about them on the spot. The circumstances in which Paul
            found himself at that time make this sense
            very appropriate. He had been suddenly driven from his ministry at
            Damascus, and was compelled to seek a new
            sphere. He could not turn to any adviser more valuable than Peter
            for determining his future course. For that
            Apostle was not only prominent in the general government of the
            Church, but had taken the lead in its expansion
            by his visits to Samaria, to the maritime plain, and to Cæsarea, and
            by his baptism of Gentiles. In spite,
            therefore, of the danger of revisiting Jerusalem, Paul repaired
            thither to consult Peter as to how he could best
            serve Christ.
          </p>

          <p>
            Κηφᾶν - Cephas. Several MSS. give the Greek form, Πέτρον, of this
            name; but the Hebrew form appears to be the
            original reading throughout the Epistle, except in Galatians 2:7-8.
            At Jerusalem he was probably known by the
            name Cephas, but in the Greek Church at large by the name Peter.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἐπέμεινα πρὸς αὐτὸν - I remained with him. Both in the Acts and in
            the Pauline Epistles this verb denotes the
            continuance or prolongation of a stay. This can hardly mean παρʼ
            αὐτῷ, I abode with him. The clause expresses
            rather the motive for Paul's lingering at Jerusalem, <em>I tarried
              to see him fifteen days</em>.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 19. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἕτερον δὲ τῶν ἀποστόλων
              οὐκ εἶδον, εἰ μὴ Ἰάκωβον τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ
              κυρίου.</span></h2>
          <p>
            εἰ μὴ Ἰάκωβον - but only [except] James. εἰ μή may either state an
            exception to the preceding negative clause
            (except, save James), or merely qualify it (but only James), as it
            does in Luke 4:26, "to none of them [the
            widows in Israel], but only to Sarepta in Sidon;" and in Galatians
            1:7, "no other Gospel, only ( εἰ μή ) there
            are some that pervert the Gospel." The latter appears to be its
            meaning here. If James had been entitled an
            Apostle, the author would probably have written that he saw no other
            Apostles but Peter and James. But here he
            states emphatically that he saw no second (ἕτερον) Apostle, only
            James. The Epistle, like the Acts (see Acts
            12:17, Acts 15:13, Acts 21:18), fully recognises the leading
            position of James in the local Church (cf.
            Galatians 2:9; Galatians 2:12); and the ecclesiastical tradition
            which entitles him Bishop of Jerusalem
            corresponds to this. All the evidence left of his life suggests that
            he clung throughout his Christian life to
            Jerusalem and did not undertake such missionary labours as would
            entitle him to the designation of Apostle.
          </p>

          <p>
            τὸν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ κυρίου - the brother of the Lord. James is here
            described as <em>the brother of the Lord</em> in
            order to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, who was
            living at the time of Paul's first visit.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 20. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἃ δὲ γράφω ὑμῖν, ἰδοὺ
              ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ ὅτι οὐ ψεύδομαι.</span></h2>
          <p>
            ἰδοὺ - behold. This imperative is always used interjectionally in
            Scriptures: the subsequent ὅτι depends on
            ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, which has the force of an attestation.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 21. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἔπειτα ἦλθον εἰς τὰ
              κλίματα τῆς Συρίας καὶ τῆς Κιλικίας.</span></h2>
          <p>
            κλίματα - regions. This word denotes the fringes of coastland
            sloping down from the mountains to the sea in
            north-western Syria and eastern, i.e. Roman, Cilicia. It is applied
            in 2 Corinthians 11:10 to the coastlands of
            Achaia. The name Syria is placed before Cilicia, though the ministry
            at Tarsus preceded that at Antioch: for the
            latter was by far the more important and prolonged ministry. A
            further reason for placing Syria first was the
            subordinate position of Cilicia: for Roman Cilicia was, like Judæa,
            only a district of the great province of
            Syria, separately administered by an imperial procurator at Tarsus.
            In Acts 15:41 Syria and Cilicia are coupled
            together as forming a single region (τὴν Συρίαν καὶ Κιλικίαν), no
            article being inserted before Κιλικίαν; not so
            here, for the first ministry at Tarsus was distinct from that at
            Antioch.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 22-23. <span style="font-weight:normal">Ἤμην δὲ ἀγνοούμενος τῷ
              προσώπῳ ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῆς Ἰουδαίας ταῖς
              ἐν χριστῷ· μόνον δὲ ἀκούοντες ἦσαν ὅτι Ὁ διώκων ἡμᾶς ποτέ, νῦν
              εὐαγγελίζεται τὴν πίστιν ἥν ποτε
              ἐπόρθει.</span></h2>
          <p>
            Ἤμην δὲ ἀγνοούμενος - I was then [becoming] unknown. The correct
            translation is not <em>I was unknown</em> (as
            our versions render it), but <em>I was becoming unknown</em>. At the
            beginning of this period he was a familiar
            figure in Jerusalem, but in the course of ten years’ absence he
            gradually became a stranger to the Christians of
            Judæa. ἐκκλησίαις . This passage speaks of the Churches of Judæa in
            the plural, as does also 1 Thessalonians
            2:14 . In the Acts the Church throughout Judæa, Galilee and Samaria
            is described as a single Church according to
            the text of the best MSS. (Acts 9:31): the funds contributed for the
            relief of the poor Christians in Judæa are
            handed over to the Elders at Jerusalem (Acts 11:29, Acts 12:25);
            brethren from Judæa are censured as members of
            their own body by the assembled Church at Jerusalem (Acts 15:1 ;
            Acts 15:24). It would seem from this that an
            effective unity of administration and control existed in Jerusalem
            side by side with local organisation of the
            several Churches of Judæa.
