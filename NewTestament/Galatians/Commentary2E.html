          <h2>
            Ver 15. <em>“We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            He is now proceeding to the second part of his speech, which
            commences with an anticipation. The Gentiles differed from them in
            this respect, that they were "unholy and profane," (1 Tim 1:9);
            while the Jews, being holy, so far as God had chosen them for his
            people, might contend for this superiority. Skillfully anticipating
            the objection, Paul turns it to the opposite conclusion. Since the
            Jews themselves, with all their advantages, were forced to betake
            themselves to the faith of Christ, how much more necessary was it
            that the Gentiles should look for salvation through faith? Paul's
            meaning therefore is: "We, who appear to excel others, -- we, who,
            by means of the covenant, have always enjoyed the privilege of being
            nigh to God, have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by
            believing in Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method
            to the Gentiles? For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for
            salvation to those who observed its enactments, it must have been
            most of all advantageous to us to whom it was given; but if we
            relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less ought
            compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles."
          </p>

          <p>
            The word <em>sinner</em>, signifies here, as in many other places, a
            "profane person" (Heb 12:16), or one who is lost and alienated from
            God. Such were the Gentiles, who had no intercourse with God; while
            the Jews were, by adoption, the children of God, and therefore set
            apart to holiness. By nature, does not mean that they were naturally
            free from the corruption of the human race; for David, who was a
            descendant of Abraham, acknowledges, "Behold, I was shapen in
            iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me" (Ps 51:5), but the
            corruption of nature, to which they were liable, had been met by the
            remedy of sanctifying grace. Now, as the promise made the blessing
            hereditary, so this benefit is called natural; just as, in the
            Epistle to the Romans, he says, that they were sprung from a "holy
            root" (Rom 11:16).
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 16.
            <em
              >yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law
              but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ
              Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by
              the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the
              works of the law.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            The first thing to be noticed is, that we must seek justification by
            the faith of Christ, because we cannot be justified by works. Now,
            the question is, what is meant by
            <em>the works of the law</em>? The Papists, misled by Origen and
            Jerome, are of opinion, and lay it down as certain, that the dispute
            relates to shadows; and accordingly assert, that by "the works of
            the law" are meant ceremonies. As if Paul were not reasoning about
            the free justification which is bestowed on us by Christ. For they
            see no absurdity in maintaining that "no man is justified by the
            works of the law," and yet that, by the merit of works, we are
            accounted righteous in the sight of God. In short, they hold that no
            mention is here made of the works of the moral law. But the context
            clearly proves that the moral law is also comprehended in these
            words; for almost everything which Paul afterwards advances belongs
            more properly to the moral than to the ceremonial law; and he is
            continually employed in contrasting the righteousness of the law
            with the free acceptance which God is pleased to bestow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The works of the law</em>. It is objected by our opponents, that
            the term "works" must have been employed without any addition, if
            Paul had not intended to limit it to a particular class. But I
            reply, there is the best of all reasons for this mode of expression;
            for, though a man were to excel all the angels in holiness, no
            reward is due to works, but on the footing of a Divine promise.
            Perfect obedience to the law is righteousness, and has a promise of
            eternal life annexed to it; but it derives this character from God,
            who declares that "they who have fulfilled them shall live." (Lev
            18:5). On this point we shall afterwards treat more fully in its own
            place. Besides, the controversy with the Jews was about the law.
            Paul, therefore, chose rather to bring the matter to an issue, by
            meeting them at once on their own ground, than to adopt a more
            circuitous route, which might wear the aspect of evading the
            subject, or distrusting his cause. Accordingly he resolves to have a
            close debate about the law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their second objection is, that the whole question raised was about
            ceremonies, which we readily allow. Why then, say they, would the
            apostle pass suddenly from a particular department to the whole
            subject? This was the sole cause of the mistake into which Origen
            and Jerome were betrayed; for they did not think it natural that,
            while the false apostles were contending about ceremonies alone,
            Paul should take in a larger field. But they did not consider that
            the very reason for disputing so keenly was, that the doctrine led
            to more serious consequences than at first view appeared. It would
            not have given so much uneasiness to Paul that ceremonies should be
            observed, as that the confident hope and the glory of salvation
            should be made to rest on works; just as, in the dispute about
            forbidding flesh on certain days, we do not look so much to the
            importance of the prohibition itself, as to the snare which is laid
            for the consciences of men. Paul, therefore, does not wander from
            the subject, when he enters into a controversy about the whole law,
            although the arguments of the false apostles were confined wholly to
            ceremonies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their object in pressing ceremonies was, that men might seek
            salvation by obedience to the law, which, they falsely maintained,
            was meritorious; and accordingly, Paul meets them, not with the
            moral law, but with the grace of Christ alone. And yet this extended
            discussion does not occupy the whole of the Epistle; he comes at
            length to the specific question of ceremonies: but as the most
            serious difficulty was, whether justification is to be obtained by
            works or by faith, it was proper that this should be first settled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But through faith in Jesus Christ</em>. He does not merely state
            that ceremonies, or works of any kind, are insufficient without the
            assistance of faith, but meets their denial by a statement admitting
            of no exception, as if he had said, "Not by works, but by the Gift
            of Christ alone." In any other point of view, the sentiment would
            have been trivial and foreign to the purpose; for the false apostles
            did not reject Christ nor faith, but demanded that ceremonies should
            be joined with them. If Paul had admitted this claim, they would
            have been perfectly at one, and he would have been under no
            necessity to agitate the church by this unpleasant debate. Let it
            therefore remain settled, that the proposition is so framed as to
            admit of no exception, "that we are justified in no other way than
            by faith," or, "that we are not justified but by faith," or, which
            amounts to the same thing, "that we are justified by faith alone."
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence it appears with what silly trifling the Papists of our day
            dispute with us about the word, as if it had been a word of our
            contrivance. But Paul was unacquainted with the theology of the
            Papists, who declare that a man is justified by faith, and yet make
            a part of justification to consist in works. Of such
            half-justification Paul knew nothing. For, when he instructs us that
            we are justified by faith, because we cannot be justified by works,
            he takes for granted what is true, that we cannot be justified
            through the righteousness of Christ, unless we are poor and
            destitute of a righteousness of our own. Consequently, either
            nothing or all must be ascribed to faith or to works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>No flesh will be justified by the works of the law</em>. He had
            already appealed to the consciences of Peter and others, and now
            confirms it more fully by affirming that such is the actual truth,
            that by the works of the law no mortal will obtain justification.
            This is the foundation of a freely bestowed righteousness, when we
            are stripped of a righteousness of our own. Besides, when he asserts
            that no mortal is justified by the righteousness of the law, the
            assertion amounts to this, that from such a mode of justification
            all mortals are excluded, and that none can possibly reach it.
          </p>

            Ver 17.
            <em
              >But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves
              also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly

          </h2>
          <p>
            "What are these false apostles doing?" Paul cries. "They are turning
            Law into grace, and grace into Law. They are changing Moses into
            Christ, and Christ into Moses. By teaching that besides Christ and
            His righteousness the performance of the Law is necessary unto
            salvation, they put the Law in the place of Christ, they attribute
            to the Law the power to save, a power that belongs to Christ only."
          </p>
          <p>
            The papists quote the words of Christ: "If thou wilt enter into
            life, keep the commandments" (Mat 19:17). With His own words they
            deny Christ and abolish faith in Him. Christ is made to lose His
            good name, His office, and His glory, and is demoted to the status
            of a law enforcer, reproving, terrifying, and chasing poor sinners
            around. The proper office of Christ is to raise the sinner, and
            extricate him from his sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Is Christ a servant of sin</em>? Either we are not justified by
            Christ, or we are not justified by the Law. The fact is, we are
            justified by Christ. Hence, we are not justified by the Law. If we
            observe the Law in order to be justified, or after having been
            justified by Christ, we think we must further be justified by the
            Law, we convert Christ into a legislator and a minister of sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the Law is to reveal sin. The Law requires perfect
            obedience. It condemns all who do not accomplish the will of God.
            But show me a person who is able to render perfect obedience. The
            Law cannot justify. It can only condemn according to the passage:
            "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are
            written in the book of the law to do them." If the Law is the
            minister of sin, it is at the same time the minister of wrath and
            death. As the Law reveals sin it fills a person with the fear of
            death and condemnation. Eventually the conscience wakes up to the
            fact that God is angry. If God is angry with you, He will destroy
            and condemn you forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            All who say that faith alone in Christ does not justify a person,
            convert Christ into a minister of sin, a teacher of the Law, and a
            cruel tyrant who requires the impossible. All merit-seekers take
            Christ for a new lawgiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Far from it</em>. He properly rejects that inference. Christ,
            who discovers the sin which lay concealed, is not therefore the
            minister of sin; as if, by depriving us of righteousness, he opened
            the gate to sin, or strengthened its dominion. The Jews were
            mistaken in claiming any holiness for themselves apart from Christ,
            while they had none. Hence arose the complaint: "Did Christ come to
            take from us the righteousness of the law, to change saints into
            polluted men, to subject us to sin and guilt?" Paul denies it, and
            repels the blasphemy with abhorrence. Christ did not bring sin, but
            unveiled it; he did not take away righteousness, but stripped the
            Jews of a false disguise.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>For if I build up again.</em> "By the ministry of the Gospel I
            have destroyed sin, heaviness of heart, wrath, and death. I have
            abolished the Law, so that it should not bother your conscience any
            more. Should I now once again establish the Law, and set up the rule
            of Moses? This is exactly what I should be doing, if I would urge
            circumcision and the performance of the Law as necessary unto
            salvation. Instead of righteousness and life, I would restore sin
            and death."
          </p>
          <p>
            By the grace of God we know that we are justified through faith in
            Christ alone. We do not mingle law and grace, faith and works. We
            keep them far apart. Let every true Christian mark the distinction
            between law and grace, and mark it well.
          </p>
          <p>
            We conclude with Paul, that we are justified by faith in Christ,
            without the Law. Once a person has been justified by Christ, he will
            not be unproductive of good, but as a good tree he will bring forth
            good fruit. A believer has the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit will
            not permit a person to remain idle, but will put him to work and
            stir him up to the love of God, to patient suffering in affliction,
            to prayer, thanksgiving, to the habit of charity towards all men.

            <em>For I through the law</em>. Now follows the direct reply, that
            we must not ascribe to Christ that work which properly belongs to
            the law. It was not necessary that Christ should destroy the
            righteousness of the law, for the law itself slays its disciples. As
            if he had said, "You deceive wretched men by the false notion, that
            they must live by the law; and, under that pretext, you keep them in
            the law. And yet you bring it as a charge against the Gospel, that
            it annihilates the righteousness which we have by the law. But it is
            the law which forces us to die to itself; for it threatens our
            destruction, leaves us nothing but despair, and thus drives us away
            from trusting to the law."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Died to the law</em>. To be dead to the Law means to be free of
            the Law. The law allures us all to destruction, and we find in it no
            life. It is not to Christ, he tells us, that it is owing that the
            law is more hurtful than beneficial; but the law carries within
            itself the curse which slays us. Hence it follows, that the death
            which is brought on by the law is truly deadly. With this is
            contrasted another kind of death, in the life-giving fellowship of
            the cross of Christ. He says, that he is crucified together with
            Christ, that he might live unto God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blessed is the person who knows how to use this truth in times of
            distress. He can talk. He can say: "Mr. Law, go ahead and accuse me
            as much as you like. I know I have committed many sins, and I
            continue to sin daily. But that does not bother me. You have got to
            shout louder, Mr. Law. I am deaf, you know. Talk as much as you
            like, I am dead to you. If you want to talk to me about my sins, go
            and talk to my flesh. Belabor that, but don't talk to my conscience.
            My conscience is a lady and a queen, and has nothing to do with the
            likes of you, because my conscience lives to Christ under another
            law, a new and better law, the law of grace."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That I might live to God</em>. He declares that we are dead to
            the law, not by any means that we may live to sin, but that we may
            live to God. To live to God, sometimes means to regulate our life
            according to his will, so as to study nothing else in our whole life
            but to gain his approbation; but here it means to live, if we may be
            allowed the expression, the life of God. In this way the various
            points of the contrast are preserved; for in whatever sense we are
            said to die to sin, in the same sense do we live to God. In short,
            Paul informs us that this death is not mortal, but is the cause of a
            better life; because God snatches us from the shipwreck of the law,
            and by his grace raises us up to another life.

            <em>I have been crucified with Christ</em>. Paul does not here speak
            of crucifying the flesh, but he speaks of that higher crucifying
            wherein sin, devil, and death are crucified in Christ and in me. By
            my faith in Christ I am crucified with Christ. Hence these evils are
            crucified and dead unto me. We are delivered from the yoke of the
            law, only by becoming one with Christ, as the twig draws its sap
            from the root, only by growing into one nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>It is no longer I who live</em>. True Christian righteousness is
            the righteousness of Christ who lives in us. We must look away from
            our own person, so that we can see nothing else but Christ crucified
            and raised from the dead to save us. If I keep on looking at myself,
            I am gone. Being crucified with Christ and dead unto the Law, I may
            now rise unto a new and better life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Christ lives in me</em>. This explains what he meant by "living
            to God." He does not live by his own life, but is animated by the
            power of Christ; so that Christ may be said to live in him; for, as
            the soul enlivens the body, so Christ imparts life to his members.
            It is a remarkable sentiment, that believers live out of themselves,
            that is, they live in Christ; which can only be accomplished by
            holding real and actual communication with him. Christ lives in us,
            making us partakers of his righteousness; so that, while we can do
            nothing of ourselves, we are accepted in the sight of God.
          </p>

            <em
              >That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the
              Son of God</em
            >. "I live by the faith of the Son of God," he says. "My speech is
            no longer directed by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. My sight is
            no longer governed by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. My hearing
            is no longer determined by the flesh, but by the Holy Ghost. I
            cannot teach, write, pray, or give thanks without the
            instrumentality of the flesh; yet these activities do not proceed
            from the flesh, but from God."
          </p>
          <p>
            A Christian uses earthly means like any unbeliever. Outwardly they
            look alike. Nevertheless there is a great difference between them. I
            may live in the flesh, but I do not live after the flesh. I do my
            living now "by faith in the Son of God." Paul had the same voice,
            the same tongue, before and after his conversion. Before his
            conversion his tongue uttered blasphemies. But after his conversion
            his tongue spoke a spiritual, heavenly language.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may now understand how spiritual life originates. It enters the
            heart by faith. Christ reigns in the heart with His Holy Spirit, who
            sees, hears, speaks, works, suffers, and does all things in and
            through us over the protest and the resistance of the flesh.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who loved me</em>. This is added to express the power of faith.
            But where does faith derive such power as to convey into our souls
            the life of Christ? He accordingly informs us, that the love of
            Christ, and his death, are the objects on which faith rests; for it
            is in this manner that the effect of faith must be judged. How comes
            it that we live by the faith of Christ? Because "he loved us, and
            gave himself for us." The love of Christ led him to unite himself to
            us, and he completed the union by his death. By giving himself for
            us, he suffered in our own person; as, on the other hand, faith
            makes us partakers of every thing which it finds in Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            "In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
            sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins" (1 Jn 4:1). For
            if any merit of ours had moved him to redeem us, this reason would
            have been stated; but now Paul ascribes the whole to love: it is
            therefore of free grace. Let us observe the order: "He loved us, and
            gave himself for us." As if he had said, "He had no other reason for
            dying, but because he loved us," and that "while we were enemies, we
            were reconciled to God through the death of his Son" (Rom 5:10).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And gave himself for me</em>. Let us count the price. When you
            hear that such an enormous price was paid for you, will you still
            come along with your cowl, your shaven pate, your chastity, your
            obedience, your poverty, your works, your merits? What do you want
            with all these trappings? What good are the works of all men, and
            all the pains of the martyrs, in comparison with the pains of the
            Son of God dying on the Cross, so that there was not a drop of His
            precious blood, but it was all shed for your sins. If you could
            properly evaluate this incomparable price, you would throw all your
            ceremonies, vows, works, and merits into the ash can. What awful
            presumption to imagine that there is any work good enough to pacify
            God, when to pacify God required the invaluable price of the death
            and blood of His own and only Son?

          <p>
            <em>I don't reject the grace of God</em>. Paul is now getting ready
            for the second argument of his Epistle, to the effect that to seek
            justification by works of the Law, is to reject the grace of God. I
            ask you, what sin can be more horrible than to reject the grace of
            God, and to refuse the righteousness of Christ? It is bad enough
            that we are wicked sinners and transgressors of all the commandments
            of God; on top of that to refuse the grace of God and the remission
            of sins offered unto us by Christ, is the worst sin of all, the sin
            of sins. That is the limit. There is no sin which Paul and the other
            apostles detested more than when a person despises the grace of God
            in Christ Jesus. Still there is no sin more common. That is why Paul
            can get so angry, because it snubs Christ, rebuffs the grace of God,
            and refuses the merit of Christ. What else would you call it but
            spitting in Christ's face, pushing Christ to the side, usurping
            Christ's throne. By this abominable doctrine many have spoiled,
            darkened, and buried the benefit of Christ, and in place of the
            grace of Christ and His Kingdom, have established a doctrine of
            works and a kingdom of ceremonies.

            <em
              >For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for
              nothing</em
            >! We will always affirm with Paul that either Christ died in vain,
            or else the Law cannot justify us. But Christ did not suffer and die
            in vain. Hence, the Law does not justify.
          </p>
          <p>
            If my salvation was so difficult to accomplish that it necessitated
            the death of Christ, then all my works, all the righteousness of the
            Law, are good for nothing. How can I buy for a penny what cost a
            million dollars? The Law is a penny's worth when you compare it with
            Christ. Should I be so stupid as to reject the righteousness of
            Christ which cost me nothing, and slave like a fool to achieve the
            righteousness of the Law which God disdains?
          </p>
          <p>
            If we could produce a righteousness of our own, then Christ has
            suffered in vain; for the intention of his sufferings was to procure
            it for us, and what need was there that a work which we could
            accomplish for ourselves should be obtained from another? If the
            death of Christ be our redemption, then we were captives; if it be
            satisfaction, we were debtors; if it be atonement, we were guilty;
            if it be cleansing, we were unclean. On the contrary, he who
            ascribes to works his sanctification, pardon, atonement,
            righteousness, or deliverance, makes void the death of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Man's own righteousness is in the last analysis a despising and
            rejecting of the grace of God. No combination of words can do
            justice to such an outrage. It is an insult to say that any man died
            in vain. But to say that Christ died in vain is a deadly insult. To
            say that Christ died in vain is to make His resurrection, His
            victory, His glory, His kingdom, heaven, earth, God Himself, of no
            purpose and benefit whatever.

            This passage will be better understood by comparing it with the
            Romans 7. There Paul describes beautifully, that no man lives to the
            law, but he to whom the law is dead, that is, has lost all power and
            efficacy; for, as soon as the law begins to live in us, it inflicts
            a fatal wound by which we die, and at the same time breathes life
            into the man who is already dead to sin. Those who live to the law,
            therefore, have never felt the power of the law, or properly
            understood what the law means; for the law, when truly perceived,
            makes us die to itself, and it is from this source, and not from
            Christ, that sin proceeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            This form of speech is frequently met with in the Scriptures,
            particularly in the writings of St. Paul, when the Law is set
            against the Law, and sin is made to oppose sin, and death is arrayed
            against death, and hell is turned loose against hell, as in the
            following quotations: "Thou hast led captivity captive," Psalm
            68:18. "O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy
            destruction," Hosea 13:14. "And for sin, condemned sin in the
            flesh," Romans 8:3. Here Paul plays the Law against the Law, as if
            to say: "The Law of Moses condemns me; but I have another law, the
            law of grace and liberty which condemns the accusing Law of Moses."
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul does not only refer to the Ceremonial Law, but to the whole
            Law. We are not to think that the Law is wiped out. It stays. It
            continues to operate in the wicked. But a Christian is dead to the
            Law. For example, Christ by His resurrection became free from the
            grave, and yet the grave remains. Peter was delivered from prison,
            yet the prison remains. The Law is abolished as far as I am
            concerned, when it has driven me into the arms of Christ. Yet the
            Law continues to exist and to function. But it no longer exists for
            me.

            Whenever remission of sins is freely proclaimed, people misinterpret
            it according to Romans 3:8, "Let us do evil, that good may come." As
            soon as people hear that we are not justified by the Law, they
            reason: "Why, then let us reject the Law. If grace abounds, where
            sin abounds, let us abound in sin, that grace may all the more
            abound." People who reason thus are reckless. They make sport of the
            Scriptures and slander the sayings of the Holy Ghost. These must be
            instructed as to why good works do not justify, and from what
            motives good works must be done. Good works are not the cause, but
            the fruit of righteousness. When we have become righteous, then
            first are we able and willing to do good. The tree makes the apple;
            the apple does not make the tree.

            faith, in which the devotion of a pure heart is demanded, not the
            circumcision of the flesh. By now withdrawing from the Gentiles we
            declare that whoever is uncircumcised is unclean. Therefore, is
            faith in Christ, by which we previously thought we were saved, the
            agent of sin rather than of righteousness, which abolishes [the need
            for] circumcision, the very thing without which one is deemed
            unclean? God forbid that I should uphold what I once attacked and
            knew would never again be beneficial to me. When I decisively
            departed from the Law, I died to it that I might live in Christ and
            be nailed to his cross and that I might be reborn as a new man and
            live by faith, not by the flesh, and leave the world in Christ. I
            remain steadfast in my original resolve. Christ did not die for me
            for nothing. If I was able to be saved by keeping the old Law
            instead of by having faith in him, then I have believed in Christ in
            vain." (<a

            Jerome comments, "Some say that if Paul is right to assert that no
            one is justified by the works of the Law but by faith in Jesus
            Christ, then the patriarchs, prophets, and saints who lived prior to
            Christ's advent were lacking in something. We must remind these
            objectors that Paul is talking here about those who have not pursued
            righteousness and who believe that they can be justified only by
            works. The saints who lived long ago, however, were justified by
            faith in Christ. Abraham foresaw the day of Christ and rejoiced.
            'Moses regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value
            than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his
            reward.' Isaiah beheld the glory of Christ, as John the Evangelist
            notes... Thus it is not so much the works of the Law that are
            condemned as those who are confident that they can be justified by
            them...
          </p>

          <p>
            The flesh about which it is said, 'All flesh is like grass, and all
            of its glory is like the flowers of the field,' is not justified by
            the works of the Law. But the flesh spoken of in the mystery of the
            resurrection, 'All flesh will see God's salvation,' is justified
            through faith in Jesus Christ. According to the more common
            understanding, it used to be that the only flesh redeemable by the
            Law were those who lived in Palestine. Now, however, all flesh is
            justified by faith in Jesus Christ, as his churches are being
            established all over the world." (<a

            Peter Lombard comments, "In short, there is no way that one can be
            justified except through the faith of Christ Jesus, referring to the
            faith by which one believes in Christ. It is for this reason,
            therefore, that we Jews, like the gentiles, believe in Christ Jesus,
            so that we might be justified by the faith of Christ. The Apostle
            does not say that by faith good works are thereby made meaningless,
            for God renders to each person according to that person's works.
            Rather, it is because works proceed from grace—not grace from
            works." (The Bible in Medieval Tradition: The Letter to the

            need to uphold the Law, and if those, having left the Law for
            Christ, are not justified in doing so, but rather are condemned,
            then Christ will be found to be the cause of our condemnation, since
            we left the law on his account in order to run towards the faith.

            William Nicoll comments, "Why did St. Paul love Christ with such an
            overwhelming passion? To answer it aright would be to retrace the
            whole history. But first we say that St. Paul's love was the love of
            gratitude. 'He loved me and gave Himself for me' that is the burning
            centre. Christ died for the ungodly. We are justified by faith in
            His blood. St. Paul knew the great desolation of the Victim of Love.
            Christ was made a curse for him on the tree of Calvary. Christ kept
            knocking by the voice of interior grace at the door of his heart
            till his heart opened. Then the soul that had been separated from
            the Author of Peace was restless and weary no longer. To him the
            meritorious death of Christ became the beautiful gate of the temple
            whereby he entered into the treasure-house of God. The full,
            finished, and perfect sacrifice and atonement for the sins of the
            whole world blotted out the transgressions that were past. More than
            that: if any man be in Christ there is a new creation. There is the
            stroke that ends him and the touch that begins him afresh. The faith
            of St. Paul apprehended the dying of the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit
            that raised up Christ from the dead quickened his mortal body.
            Mystically he died and rose again in Christ." (<a

            Charles Spurgeon comments, "They who say that the death of Christ
            goes only part of the way, but that man must do something in order
            to merit eternal life,— these, I say, make this death of Christ to
            be only partially effective, and, in yet clearer terms, ineffectual
            in and of itself. If it be even hinted that the blood of Jesus is
            not price enough till man adds his silver or his gold, then his
            blood is not our redemption at all, and Christ is no Redeemer! If it
            be taught that our Lord’s bearing of sin for us did not make a
            perfect atonement, and that it is ineffectual till we either do or
            suffer something to complete it, then in the supplemental work lies
            the real virtue, and Christ’s work is in itself insufficient. His
            death cry of 'It is finished,' must have been all a mistake, if
            still it is not finished; and if a believer in Christ is not
            completely saved by what Christ has done, but must do something
            himself to complete it, then salvation was not finished, and the
            Saviour’s work remains imperfect till we, poor sinners, lend a hand
            to make up for his deficiencies. What blasphemy lies in such a
