            Augustine writes, "Now it was quite competent for the apostle to
            say, and to say rightly: 'Be imitators of me, as I also am of
            Christ;' but he could never say: Be justified by me, as I also am by
            Christ;— since there may be, and indeed actually are and have been,
            many who were righteous and worthy of imitation; but no one is
            righteous and a justifier but Christ alone. Whence it is said: 'To
            the man that believes in him that justifies the ungodly, his faith
            is counted for righteousness' [ Romans 4:5 ]... But it has never
            been in the power of any of the saints of God to say this except the
            Saint of saints, who said:
            <em>You believe in God, believe also in me</em> [John 14:1]; so
            that, inasmuch as it is He that justifies the ungodly, to the man
            who believes in him that justifies the ungodly his faith is imputed
            for righteousness." (<a

            Tertullian writes, "One man perverts the Scriptures with his hand,
            another their meaning by his exposition. For although Valentinus
            seems to use the entire volume, he has none the less laid violent
            hands on the truth only with a more cunning mind and skill than
            Marcion. Marcion expressly and openly used the knife, not the pen,
            since he made such an excision of the Scriptures as suited his own
            subject-matter. Valentinus, however, abstained from such excision,
            because he did not invent Scriptures to square with his own
            subject-matter, but adapted his matter to the Scriptures; and yet he
            took away more, and added more, by removing the proper meaning of
            every particular word, and adding fantastic arrangements of things
            which have no real existence." (<a

            J. C. Ryle comments, "We all know the habit of mind that makes men
            great in this world,—that makes such men as Alexander the Great, or
            Julius Caesar, or Oliver Cromwell, or Peter the Great, or Charles
            XII., or Marlborough, or Napoleon, or Pitt. We know that, with all
            their faults, they were all men of one thing. They threw themselves
            into one grand pursuit. They cared for nothing else. They put every
            thing else aside. They counted everything else as second-rate, and
            of subordinate importance, compared to the one thing that they put
            before their eyes every day they lived. I say that the same habit of
            mind applied to the service of the Lord Jesus Christ becomes
            religious zeal." (<a
