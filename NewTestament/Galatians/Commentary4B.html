            Ambrose writes, "And Isaac 'smelled the fragrance of his garments'
            [Gen. 27:27]. And perhaps that means that we are not justified by
            works but by faith, because the weakness of the flesh is a hindrance
            to works but the brightness of faith puts the error that is in man’s
            deeds in the shadow and merits for him the forgiveness of his sins."

            Gregory the Great writes, "For contemplating the strictness of
            Divine Justice, we justly fear even for the very works themselves,
            which we flattered ourselves we had so done that they were strong...
            And hence, when Paul both perceived that he had the bones of the
            several virtues, and yet that these same bones trembled under the
            searching scrutiny, he saith,
            <em
              >But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
              you, or of man's judgment; yea, I judge not mine own self; for I
              know nothing against myself:</em
            >
            [1 Cor 4:3-4] Yet because, when the ‘veins’ of the divine
            ‘whispering’ were heard, these same bones quaked, he thereupon
            added,
            <em
              >For I am not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me is the
              Lord</em
            >. As though be were to say, ‘I remember that I have done light
            things, yet I presume not on my merits; for our life is brought to
            the scrutiny of Him, under Whom even the bones of our strength are
            dismayed." (<a

            Origen writes, "Before God, no living being will be justified. This
            shows that in comparision with God, and the righteousness that is in
            him, no one (not even the most perfect of saints) will be justified.
            We might take a different illustration and say that no candle can
            give light before the sun. We do not mean that the candle will not
            give out light, but that it will not be seen when the sun outshines
            it." (<a

            Bernard writes, " 'Our glory,' says the great Apostle, 'is this, the
            testimony of our conscience' (2 Cor. ii. I2). Not such testimony as
            the proud Pharisee obtained, for although his deceived and deceiving
            conscience gave testimony to him, we know that testimony was not
            true (Luke xviii, II, I2, John xix. 35); but the testimony which
            'the Spirit Himself giveth to our spirit' (Rom viii. I6)—it is in
            this testimony we place our glory. Now it seems to me that this
            divine testimony consists in three convictions. For we ought to
            believe, in the first place, that we cannot obtain the pardon of our
            sins otherwise than through the mercy of God; secondly, that we are
            powerless to do any good work whatever except by His grace; thirdly,
            that by no works of ours can we merit eternal life, unless it is His
            good pleasure to bestow upon us this also as a free gift." (<a

            Bernard writes, "Sorrow for sin is indeed necessary, but it should
            not be an endless preoccupation. You must dwell also on the glad
            remembrance of God's loving- kindness, otherwise sadness will harden
            the heart and lead it more deeply into despair. Let us mix honey
            with our absinthe, it is more easily drunk when sweetened, and what
            bitterness it may still retain will be wholesome. You must fix your
            attention on the ways of God, see how he mitigates the bitterness of
            the heart that is crushed, how he wins back the pusillanimous soul
            from the abyss of despair, how he consoles the grief-stricken and
            strengthens the wavering with the sweet caress of his faithful
            promise." (<a

            Athanasius writes, "One day when he had gone forth because all the
            monks had assembled to him and asked to hear words from him, he
            spoke to them in the Egyptian tongue as follows: ‘The Scriptures are
            enough for instruction, but it is a good thing to encourage one
            another in the faith, and to stir up with words... Wherefore as a
            servant would not dare to say, because I worked yesterday, I will
            not work today; and considering the past will do no work in the
            future; but, as it is written in the Gospel, daily shows the same
            readiness to please his master... Very often also without appearing
            they imitate the music of harp and voice, and recall the words of
            Scripture. Sometimes, too, while we are reading they immediately
            repeat many times, like an echo, what is read. They arouse us from
            our sleep to prayers; and this constantly, hardly allowing us to
            sleep at all. At another time they assume the appearance of monks
            and feign the speech of holy men, that by their similarity they may
            deceive and thus drag their victims where they will. But no heed
            must be paid them even if they arouse to prayer, even if they
            counsel us not to eat at all, even though they seem to accuse and
            cast shame upon us for those things which once they allowed. For
            they do this not for the sake of piety or truth, but that they may
            carry off the simple to despair; and that they may say the
            discipline is useless, and make men loathe the solitary life as a
            trouble and burden, and hinder those who in spite of them walk in
            it." (<a

            Duns Scotus writes, "About our theology I say that is not about all
            things, because, just as the theology of the blessed has a limit, so
            also does ours, from the will of God revealing. But the limit fixed
            by the divine will as to general revelation is the things that are
            in divine Scripture, because – as is contained in the last chapter
            of Revelation – 'he who adds to these things, to him will God add
            the plagues that are set down in this book.' Therefore, our
            knowledge is de facto only of the things contained in Scripture and
            of the things that can be elicited from them." (<a

            Thomas Watson comments, "It will be our comfort on our deathbed, to
            review a well-spent life. It was Augustine's wish that he might have
            a quiet, easy death. If anything makes our pillow easy at death, it
            will be this: that you have been unwearied in God's work. This will
            be a deathbed cordial. Did you ever know any to repent at death,
            that they had been too holy? Many have repented that they have
            followed the world too much—but not that they have prayed too
            much—not that they have repented too much. What has made death sweet
            but that they have finished their course and kept the faith." (<a

            Ambrose writes, "Perfect liberality is proved by its good faith, the
            case it helps, the time and place when and where it is shown. But
            first we must always see that we help those of the household of
            faith. [ Galatians 6:10 ] It is a serious fault if a believer is in
            want, and you know it, or if you know that he is without means, that
            he is hungry, that he suffer distress, especially if he is ashamed
            of his need. It is a great fault if he is overwhelmed by the
            imprisonment or false accusation of his family, and thou dost not
            come to his help. If he is in prison, and— upright though he is— has
            to suffer pain and punishment for some debt (for though we ought to
            show mercy to all, yet we ought to show it especially to an upright
            man); if in the time of his trouble he obtains nothing from you; if
            in the time of danger, when he is carried off to die, your money
            seems more to you than the life of a dying man; what a sin is that
            to you! Wherefore Job says beautifully: 'Let the blessing of him
            that was ready to perish come upon me.' [ Job 29:13 ]" (On the
            Duties of the Clergy, 1.148).
