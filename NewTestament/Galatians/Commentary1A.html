          <h2>
            Ver 1.
            <em
              >Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus
              Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. In the salutations with which he
            commenced his Epistles, Paul was accustomed to claim the title of
            "an Apostle." His object in doing so, as we have remarked on former
            occasions, was to employ the authority of his station, for the
            purpose of enforcing his doctrine. This authority depends not on the
            judgment or opinion of men, but exclusively on the calling of God;
            and therefore he demands a hearing on the ground of his being "an
            Apostle." Let us always bear this in mind, that in the church we
            ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he has
            appointed to be our teacher. Whoever assumes a right to instruct us,
            must speak in the name of God or of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as the calling of Paul was more vehemently disputed among the
            Galatians, he asserts it more strongly in his address to that
            church, than in his other Epistles; for he does not simply affirm
            that he was called by God, but states expressly that it was not
            either from men or by men. This statement, be it observed, applies
            not to the office which he held in common with other pastors, but to
            the apostleship. The authors of the calumnies which he has in his
            eye did not venture to deprive him altogether of the honor of the
            Christian ministry. They merely refused to allow him the name and
            rank of an apostle.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are now speaking of the apostleship in the strictest sense; for
            the word is employed in two different ways. Sometimes, it denotes
            preachers of the Gospel, to whatever class they might belong; but
            here it bears a distinct reference to the highest rank in the
            church; so that Paul is equal to Peter and to the other twelve.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Not from men, nor through man</em>. The first clause, that he
            was called not from men, he had in common with all the true
            ministers of Christ. As no man ought to "take this honor unto
            himself" (Heb 5:4), so it is not in the power of men to bestow it on
            whomsoever they choose. It belongs to God alone to govern his
            church; and therefore the calling cannot be lawful, unless it
            proceed from Him. So far as the church is concerned, a man who has
            been led to the ministry, not by a good conscience, but by ungodly
            motives, may happen to be regularly called. But Paul is here
            speaking of a call ascertained in so perfect, a manner, that nothing
            farther can be desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second clause, that he was called not by man, belonged in a
            peculiar manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary pastor, this
            would have implied nothing wrong. Paul himself, when travelling
            through various cities in company with Barnabas, "ordained elders in
            every church," by the votes of the people (Acts 14:23); and he
            enjoins Titus and Timothy to proceed in the same work (1 Tim 5:17
            Titus 1:5). Such is the ordinary method of electing pastors; for we
            are not entitled to wait until God shall reveal from heaven the
            names of the persons whom he has chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was called, not by a mere man, but by one that was more than a
            man; nor by a mortal man, but by Christ, as raised from the dead,
            immortal and glorious at God's right hand: or rather the sense is,
            he was not chosen into the office of apostleship by the suffrages of
            men, as Matthew was; or he was not ordained an apostle in the manner
            the ordinary ministers of the Gospel and pastors are, by the
            churches of Christ; so that as the former clause is opposed to an
            unlawful call of men, this is opposed to a lawful one; and shows him
            to be not an ordinary minister, but an extraordinary one, who was
            called to this office, not mediately by men.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if human agency was not improper, if it was even commendable,
            why does Paul disclaim it in reference to himself? I have already
            mentioned that something more was necessary to be proved than that
            Paul was a pastor, or that he belonged to the number of the
            ministers of the Gospel; for the point in dispute was the
            apostleship. It was necessary that the apostles should be elected,
            not in the same manner as other pastors, but by the direct agency of
            the Lord himself. Thus, Christ himself (Matthew 10:1) called the
            Twelve; and when a successor was to be appointed in the room of
            Judas, the church does not venture to choose one by votes, but has
            recourse to lot. (Acts 1:26). We are certain that the lot was not
            employed in electing pastors. Why was it resorted to in the election
            of Matthias? To mark the express agency of God for it was proper
            that the apostles should be distinguished from other ministers. And
            thus Paul, in order to show that he does not belong to the ordinary
            rank of ministers, contends that his calling proceeded immediately
            from God.
          </p>
          <p>
            But how does Paul affirm that he was not called by men, while Luke
            records that Paul and Barnabas were called by the church at Antioch?
            Some have replied, that he had previously discharged the duties of
            an apostle, and that, consequently, his apostleship was not founded
            on his appointment by that church. But here, again, it may be
            objected, that this was his first designation to be the apostle of
            the Gentiles, to which class the Galatians belonged. The more
            correct, and obvious reply is, that he did not intend here to set
            aside entirely the calling of that church, but merely to show that
            his apostleship rests on a higher title. This is true; for even
            those who laid their hands on Paul at Antioch did so, not of their
            own accord, but in obedience to express revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since, therefore, he was called by Divine revelation, and was also
            appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to be the apostle of the
            Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought forward by men,
            although the customary rite of ordination was afterwards added.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect contrast between Paul
            and the false apostles is here intended. I have no objection to that
            view; for they were in the habit of glorying in the name of men. His
            meaning will therefore stand thus: "Whoever may be the persons by
            whom others boast that they have been sent, I shall be superior to
            them; for I hold my commission from God and Christ."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By Jesus Christ and God the Father.</em> He asserts that God the
            Father and Christ had bestowed on him his apostleship. Christ is
            first named, because it is his prerogative to send, and because we
            are his ambassadors. But to make the statement more complete, the
            Father is also mentioned; as if he had said, "If there be any one
            whom the name of Christ is not sufficient to inspire with reverence,
            let him know that I have also received my office from God the
            Father."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who raised him from the dead</em>. The resurrection of Christ is
            the commencement of his reign, and is therefore closely connected
            with the present subject. It was a reproach brought by them against
            Paul that he had held no communication with Christ, while he was on
            the earth. He argues, on the other hand, that, as Christ was
            glorified by his resurrection, so he has actually exercised his
            authority in the government of his church. The calling of Paul is
            therefore more illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while
            still a mortal, had ordained him to the office. And this
            circumstance deserves attention; for Paul intimates that the attempt
            to set aside his authority, involved a malignant opposition to the
            astonishing power of God, which was displayed in the resurrection of
            Christ; because the same heavenly Father, who raised Christ from the
            dead, commanded Paul to make known that exertion of his power.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 2.
            <em
              >and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of
              Galatia:</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And all the brethren who are with me</em>. -- He appears to have
            usually written in the name of many persons, judging that, if those
            to whom he wrote should attach less weight to a solitary individual,
            they might listen to a greater number, and would not despise a whole
            congregation. His general practice is, to insert the salutations
            from brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the
            commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never
            mentions more than two names, and those very well known. But here he
            includes all the brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good
            reason, an opposite method. The concurrence of so many godly persons
            must have had some degree of influence in softening the minds of the
            Galatians, and preparing them to receive instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To the churches of Galatia</em>. It was an extensive country,
            and therefore contained many churches scattered through it. But is
            it not wonderful that the term "Church", which always implies unity
            of faith, should have been applied to the Galatians, who had almost
            entirely revolted from Christ? I reply, so long as they professed
            Christianity, worshipped one God, observed the sacraments, and
            enjoyed some kind of Gospel ministry, they retained the external
            marks of a church. We do not always find in churches such a measure
            of purity as might be desired. The purest have their blemishes; and
            some are marked, not by a few spots, but by general deformity.
            Though the doctrines and practices of any society may not, in all
            respects, meet our wishes, we must not instantly pronounce its
            defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from it the
            appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a gentleness of
            disposition utterly at variance with such a course. Yet our
            acknowledgment of societies to be churches of Christ must be
            accompanied by an explicit condemnation of everything in them that
            is improper or defective; for we must not imagine, that, wherever
            there is some kind of church, everything in it that ought to be
            desired in a church is perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            I make this observation, because the Papists, seizing on the single
            word Church, think that whatever they choose to force upon us is
            sanctioned; though the condition and aspect of the Church of Rome
            are widely different from what existed in Galatia. If Paul were
            alive at the present day, he would perceive the miserable and
            dreadfully shattered remains of a church; but he would perceive no
            building. In short, the word Church is often applied by a figure of
            speech in which a part is taken for the whole, to any portion of the
            church, even though it may not fully answer to the name.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 3.
            <em
              >Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
              Christ,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace be to you and peace</em>. The terms of grace and peace are
            common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood. But since
            we are explaining this epistle, you will not mind if we repeat what
            we have so often explained elsewhere. The article of justification
            must be sounded in our ears incessantly because the frailty of our
            flesh will not permit us to take hold of it perfectly and to believe
            it with all our heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace remits sin, and
            peace quiets the conscience. Sin and conscience torment us, but
            Christ has overcome these fiends now and forever. Only Christians
            possess this victorious knowledge given from above. These two terms,
            grace and peace, constitute Christianity. Grace involves the
            remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience. Sin is not
            canceled by lawful living, for no person is able to live up to the
            Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills the conscience with terror, and
            drives men to despair. Much less is sin taken away by man-invented
            endeavors. The fact is, the more a person seeks credit for himself
            by his own efforts, the deeper he goes into debt. Nothing can take
            away sin except the grace of God. In actual living, however, it is
            not so easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone, in opposition
            to every other means, we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and
            peace with God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world brands this a pernicious doctrine. The world advances free
            will, the rational and natural approach of good works, as the means
            of obtaining the forgiveness of sin. But it is impossible to gain
            peace of conscience by the methods and means of the world.
            Experience proves this. Various holy orders have been launched for
            the purpose of securing peace of conscience through religious
            exercises, but they proved failures because such devices only
            increase doubt and despair. We find no rest for our weary bones
            unless we cling to the word of grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace and peace from the
            emperor, or from kings, or from governors, but from God the Father.
            He wishes them heavenly peace, the kind of which Jesus spoke when He
            said, "Peace I leave unto you: my peace I give unto you." Worldly
            peace provides quiet enjoyment of life and possessions. But in
            affliction, particularly in the hour of death, the grace and peace
            of the world will not deliver us. However, the grace and peace of
            God will. They make a person strong and courageous to bear and to
            overcome all difficulties, even death itself, because we have the
            victory of Christ's death and the assurance of the forgiveness of
            our sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Paul confirms our creed, "that Christ is very
            God." We need such frequent confirmation of our faith, for Satan
            will not fail to attack it. He hates our faith. He knows that it is
            the victory which overcometh him and the world. That Christ is very
            God is apparent in that Paul ascribes to Him divine powers equally
            with the Father, as for instance, the power to dispense grace and
            peace. This Jesus could not do unless He were God.
          </p>
          <p>
            To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can
            create these blessings. The angels cannot. The apostles could only
            distribute these blessings by the preaching of the Gospel. In
            attributing to Christ the divine power of creating and giving grace,
            peace, everlasting life, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins, the
            conclusion is inevitable that Christ is truly God. Similarly, St.
            John concludes from the works attributed to the Father and the Son
            that they are divinely One. Hence, the gifts which we receive from
            the Father and from the Son are one and the same. Otherwise Paul
            should have written: "Grace from God the Father, and peace from our
            Lord Jesus Christ." In combining them he ascribes them equally to
            the Father and the Son. I stress this on account of the many errors
            emanating from the sects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Arians were sharp fellows. Admitting that Christ had two
            natures, and that He is called "very God of very God," they were yet
            able to deny His divinity. The Arians took Christ for a noble and
            perfect creature, superior even to the angels, because by Him God
            created heaven and earth. Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ. But
            all their praise is mere palaver to deceive men. Paul's language is
            different. To paraphrase him: "You are established in this belief
            that Christ is very God because He gives grace and peace, gifts
            which only God can create and bestow."

            <em>Who gave himself for our sins</em>. He begins with commending
            the grace of Christ, in order to recall and fix on Him the attention
            of the Galatians; for, if they had justly appreciated this benefit
            of redemption, they would never have fallen into opposite views of
            religion. He who knows Christ in a proper manner beholds him
            earnestly, embraces him with the warmest affection, is absorbed in
            the contemplation of him, and desires no other object. The best
            remedy for purifying our minds from any kind of errors or
            superstitions, is to keep in remembrance our relation to Christ, and
            the benefits which he has conferred upon us.
          </p>
          <p>
            These words,
            <em>who gave himself for our sins</em>, were intended to convey to
            the Galatians a doctrine of vast importance; that no other
            satisfactions can lawfully be brought into comparison with that
            sacrifice of himself which Christ offered to the Father; that in
            Christ, therefore, and in him alone, atonement for sin, and perfect
            righteousness, must be sought; and that the manner in which we are
            redeemed by him ought to excite our highest admiration. What Paul
            here ascribes to Christ is, with equal propriety, ascribed in other
            parts of Scripture to God the Father; for, on the one hand, the
            Father, by an eternal purpose, decreed this atonement, and gave this
            proof of his love to us, that he "spared not his only-begotten Son,
            (Romans 8:32), but delivered him up for us all;" and Christ, on the
            other hand, offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to
            God. Hence it follows, that his death is the satisfaction for sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That he might deliver us</em>. He likewise declares the design
            of our redemption to be, that Christ, by his death, might purchase
            us to be his own property. This takes place when we are separated
            from the world; for so long as we are of the world, we do not belong
            to Christ. The word <em>age</em> is here put for the corruption
            which is in the world; in the same manner as in the first Epistle of
            John, (1 John 5:19) where it is said that "the whole world lieth in
            the wicked one," and in his Gospel, (John 17:15), where the Savior
            says, "I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but
            that thou shouldst keep them from the evil;" for there it signifies
            the present life. What then is meant by the word "World" in this
            passage? Men separated from the kingdom of God and the grace of
            Christ. So long as a man lives to himself, he is altogether
            condemned. The World is, therefore, contrasted with regeneration, as
            nature with grace, or the flesh with the spirit. Those who are born
            of the world have nothing but sin and wickedness, not by creation,
            but by corruption. Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to
            redeem or separate us from the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From the present wicked age</em>. By adding the epithet
            "wicked", he intended to show that he is speaking of the corruption
            or depravity which proceeds from sin, and not of God's creatures, or
            of the bodily life. And yet by this single word, as by a
            thunderbolt, he lays low all human pride; for he declares, that,
            apart from that renewal of the nature which is bestowed by the grace
            of Christ, there is nothing in us but unmixed wickedness. We are of
            the world; and, till Christ take us out of it, the world reigns in
            us, and we live to the world. Whatever delight men may take in their
            fancied excellence, they are worthless and depraved; not indeed in
            their own opinion, but in the judgment of our Lord, which is here
            pronounced by the mouth of Paul, and which ought to satisfy our
            minds.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the will. He points out the original fountain of grace,
            namely, the purpose of God; "for God so loved the world, that he
            gave his only-begotten Son." (John 3:16). But it deserves notice,
            that Paul is accustomed to represent the decree of God as setting
            aside all compensation or merit on the part of men, and so Will
            denotes here what is commonly called "good pleasure." The meaning
            is, that Christ suffered for us, not because we were worthy, or
            because anything done by us moved him to the act, but because such
            was the purpose of God. Of God and our Father is of the same import
            as if he had said, "Of God who is our Father."

            <em>To whom be glory</em>. By this sudden exclamation of
            thanksgiving, he intends to awaken powerfully in his readers the
            contemplation of that invaluable gift which they had received from
            God, and in this manner to prepare their minds more fully for
            receiving instruction. It must at the same time be viewed as a
            general exhortation. Every instance in which the mercy of God occurs
            to our remembrance, ought to be embraced by us as an occasion of
            ascribing glory to God.

            <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. Elsewhere Paul draws a sharp distinction
            between an apostleship and lesser functions, as in I Corinthians
            12:28: "And God hath set some in the church; first, apostles;
            secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Apostle</em>. The term, in its native signification, signifies
            one who is sent; in its ecclesiastical use, it signifies one
            extraordinarily sent to preach the gospel; of these some were sent
            either more immediately by Christ, (as the twelve were sent, Matthew
            10:1; Mark 3:14; Luke 9:1), or more mediately, as Matthias, who was
            sent by the suffrage of the other apostles to supply the place of
            Judas (Acts 1:25, 1:26), and Barnabas, and Silas, and others were.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Not from men</em>. Paul saith he was sent not of men, neither by
            man, that is, not merely; for he was also sent by men to his
            particular province (Acts 13:3); but he was immediately sent by
            Jesus Christ, (as we read, Acts 9:1-43 and Acts 26:14-17, of which
            also he gives us an account in this chapter, Galatians 1:15-17), and
            by God the Father also.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through Jesus Christ</em>. How did Paul get his commission? He
            tells us in Acts 26. When he fell stricken on the Damascus road the
            risen Christ appeared to him, and said to him, “I am Jesus whom thou
            persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared
            unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
            both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in
            the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people,
            and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their
            eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of
            Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
            inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me”
            (vv. 15-18). Paul says that is where he got his commission.
            “Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
            vision” (v. 19), but in accord with his divinely-given instructions
            he went forth to teach at “Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
            throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that
            they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
            repentance” (v. 20).
          </p>
          <p>
            As it differed from the call of ordinary ministers, who are called
            by men (though their ministry be not merely of men); so it differed
            from the call of the rest of the apostles, being made by Christ not
            in his state of humiliation, (as the twelve were called, Matthew
            10:1-42), but in his state of exaltation, after he was raised from
            the dead, and sat down on the right hand of God.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace</em>. Some say when Christ was on earth and in the early
            part of the book of Acts, they preached the gospel of the kingdom
            but did not know the grace of God. I wonder whether they remember
            the words of John 3:16 and John 1:29, and recollect that it was the
            Lord who said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my
            word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and
            shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto
            life” (John 5:24). How short our memories are sometimes, if we say
            that Jesus was not preaching grace when here on earth when Scripture
            says, “The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
            Christ” (John 1:17). Can we say that Peter and his fellow apostles
            in the early part of Acts were not preaching grace when it was Peter
            who declared, “To him give all the prophets witness, that through
            his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins”
            (Acts 10:43).

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Who gave himself</em>. Which Christ, though he was put to death
            by Pilate and the Jews, yet he was not compelled to die; for he laid
            down his life, no man took it from him, John 10:17, 10:18. Sometimes
            it is said, he died for our sins, as Romans 5:8; sometimes, that he
            gave himself, meaning, to death, as in Ephesians 5:2, 5:25; 1
            Timothy 2:6; Titus 2:14; he was given by his Father, and he gave
            himself by his own free act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence we are not delivered by our own will, or shrewdness, or
            wisdom, but by the mercy and love of God, as it is written, "Herein
            is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
            Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4:10). Paul, like
            John, emphasizes the Father's will is Christ's habit of directing
            attention to the Father. For Christ came into the world to reconcile
            God with us and to draw us to the Father.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For our sins</em>. Of all men it is written, “None of them can
            by any means redeem his brother, nor give God a ransom for him. For
            the redemption of their life is costly, no payment is ever enough”
            (Psalms 49:7-8). But here is One who became Man to redeem our soul:
            “The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and
            to give his life a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That he might deliver us out of this present evil age</em>.
            Remission of sins is an effect of the death of Christ, but not the
            sole effect; we must not forget the propitiation (Romans 3:25); the
            redemption (Ephesians 1:7); the sacrifice (Hebrews 10:12); And
            though some other texts mention Christ’s dying for our sins, without
            mention of such expiation, propitiation, redemption, or
            satisfaction; yet they must be interpreted by the latitude of the
            end of Christ’s death (expressed in other scriptures) relating to
            sin. Which is not only expiation, and remission, but the delivery of
            us from the lusts and corruptions of this present evil age.

            raised by the power of the Father? Well then, He truly rose, and
            after He had risen was seen again of the disciples; and twelve
            disciples were witnesses of His Resurrection, who bare witness not

            ourselves of all those filthy wickednesses with which we were
            imbued... even so we, who through the name of Jesus have believed as
            one man in God the Maker of all, have been stripped, through the
            name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy garments, i.e., of our
            sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the word of His calling, we

            John Chrysostom comments, "Not only this exordium, but, so to speak,
            the whole Epistle, is full of a vehement and lofty spirit. For
            always to address one's disciples with mildness, even when they
            needed severity, would be to play the corrupter and enemy, not the

            F. F. Bruce comments, "The question of the North or South Galatian
            destination of our epistle is not one in which it is proper to take
            up partisan attitudes or indulge in dogmatic assertions; and it ill
            becomes champions of either view to disparage the rival view of
            those who maintain it. The fact that so many competent scholars can
            be cited in support of either position suggests that the evidence
            for neither is absolutely conclusive. But the weight of the
            evidence, it seems to me, favours the South Galatian view. If the
            Epistle to the Galatians was indeed addressed to the churches of
            Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Oerbe, then we have important
            historical, geographical, literary and epigraphic data which will
            provide material for its better understanding." (<a

            Martin Luther comments, "The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing.
            Grace remits sin, and peace quiets the conscience. Sin and
            conscience torment us, but Christ has overcome these fiends now and
            forever. Only Christians possess this victorious knowledge given
            from above. These two terms, grace and peace, constitute
            Christianity. Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and a
            happy conscience. Sin is not canceled by lawful living, for no
            person is able to live up to the Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills
            the conscience with terror, and drives men to despair. Much less is
            sin taken away by man-invented endeavors. The fact is, the more a
            person seeks credit for himself by his own efforts, the deeper he
            goes into debt. Nothing can take away sin except the grace of God.
            In actual living, however, it is not so easy to persuade oneself
            that by grace alone, in opposition to every other means, we obtain
            the forgiveness of our sins and peace with God." (<a

            upwards, discerns, as St. Stephen did, in the ineffable glory, the
            supreme God in whom he recognizes 'our Father,' and with him Jesus
            Christ, 'our Lord;' that is, our Master, Head, Mediator, 'through
            whom are all things, and we through him.' Grace and peace coming
            down from heaven, must come from God our Father and Jesus Christ our
            Lord. From the very nature of the case it is obvious that the
            blessings referred to come to us through Christ, though also 'from'
            him; as also that St. Paul's delegation as apostle, spoken of in the

            Matthew Henry comments, "From this we may note, 1. This present
            world is an evil world: it has become so by the sin of man, and it
            is so on account of the sin and sorrow with which it abounds and the
            many snares and temptations to which we are exposed as long as we
            continue in it. But, 2. Jesus Christ has died to deliver us from
            this present evil world, not presently to remove his people out of
            it, but to rescue them from the power of it, to keep them from the
            evil of it, and in due time to possess them of another and better
            world. This, the apostle informs us, he has done
            <em>according to the will of God and our Father</em>. In offering up
            himself a sacrifice for this end and purpose, he acted by the
            appointment of the Father, as well as with his own free consent; and
            therefore we have the greatest reason to depend upon the efficacy
            and acceptableness of what he has done and suffered for us" (<a

            of evil, sin, and death and find their true identity in the new age
            that has broken into history through Christ's epochal death and
            resurrection." (Galatians, BECNT: Baker, 2013).

            Irenaeus writes, "And He manifested the resurrection, Himself
            becoming <em>the first-begotten of the dead</em>, and in Himself
            raising up man that was fallen, lifting him up far above the heaven
            to the right hand of the glory of the Father: even as God promised
            by the prophet, saying:
            <em>And I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen</em>;
            that is, the flesh that was from David. And this our Lord Jesus
            Christ truly fulfilled, when He gloriously achieved our redemption,
            that He might truly raise us up, setting us free unto the Father.
            And if any man will not receive His birth from a virgin, how shall
            he receive His resurrection from the dead? For it is nothing
            wonderful and astonishing and extraordinary, if one who was not born
            rose from the dead: nay indeed we cannot speak of a resurrection of
            him who came unto being without birth. For one who is unborn and
            immortal, and has not undergone birth, will also not undergo death.

            end?" (<a

            gone forth into the whole world; for the whole earth is full of the
            mercy of the Lord, and His goodness is over all His works. Therefore
            he who has no perception of that fragrance, sweet, life giving, and
            everywhere diffused, and because of this does not run after Christ,
            is either dead, or he is corrupt... And the great fragrance of Thy

            describe a small group of brethren immediately surrounding the

            separate salutation from the Roman Church in general.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The pronoun ἡμῶν is placed after Κυρίου on good authority, though A
            and à, with some of the Latin fathers, insert it after πατρός, as in
            other salutations. Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:3; 2 Cor 1:2; Eph 1:2, etc. As
            διά in the first verse, so ἀπό in this verse governs both the
            genitives, as both are sources of divine blessing, according to the
            aspect in which each is viewed, primarily indeed from God and
            proximately from Jesus Christ. This contiguous use of two
            prepositions, each of them in application both to the Father and to
            Christ, shows that to the apostle God and Christ were so much one in
            will and operation (“God in Christ”), that no sharp dogmatic
            distinction of origin and medium needed to be drawn between them in
            such a prayer offered for the churches. See under Gal 1:1.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the meaning of the benediction, see under Eph 1:2, and also the
            note of Wieseler. As the West embodied its wishes in χάρις, and the
            East in ùÑÈìåÉí, H8934-εἰρήνη,-so the apostle, in catholic fulness,
            uses both terms in their profoundest Christian significance: no
            ordinary greeting, or “as the world giveth,” but a prayer for all
            combined and fitting spiritual blessings.
          </p>
          <p>
            In connection with Christ, and as an unusual addition to his
            salutations, he now describes His distinctive work in its blessed
            purpose and in its harmony with the divine plan; for the passing
            statement presents a truth in direct conflict with the errors
            prevailing in the Galatian churches. Thus the first and fourth
            verses contain in brief the two themes of the epistle,-a vindication
            of his apostleship and of the free and full salvation by faith
            without works of law, which he rejoiced to proclaim.

            περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν - for the sins. The sin offerings of the Law were
            designated περὶ ἁμαρτίας (cf. Hebrews 10:6; Hebrews 10:8), but περί
            and ὑπέρ were equally applicable with reference to Christ's offering
            of Himself for our sins; the former fixing attention on the effect
            of His sacrifice in doing away sin, the latter on the motive which
            prompted Him, viz., love for sinners. The two prepositions are
            combined in 1 Peter 3:18. It is often difficult to decide which is
            the genuine reading owing to the variation of MSS.: but here they
            are greatly in favour of περί, which is also more appropriate to the
            context: for in this clause a comparison is intended between the
            sin-offerings of Christ and the typical sin-offerings of the Law;
          </p>

          <p>
            αἰῶνος - age. In this place αἰῶνος denotes the world which Jesus
            found existing at the time of His coming, out of which He chose His
            disciples. World is the nearest English equivalent to αἰών in this
            sense, if only it be understood to mean a particular phase of human
            society, as in the phrases religious world, scientific world, etc.,
            and not the material universe.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἐνεστῶτος - existing. This participle is twice elsewhere applied to
            things existing by way of contrast to things future (μέλλοντα), in
            Romans 8:38 and 1 Corinthians 3:22. A similar contrast is here
            suggested between ὁ ἐνεστώς and ὁ μέλλων αἰών, i.e., between the
            world which Christ found existing on earth and the Messianic world
            whose coming Hebrew prophets had foretold.

          <p>
            πονηροῦ - evil. This sweeping condemnation of the existing world
            corresponds to the language of the Baptist and to Christ's own
            denunciations of the evil generation to which He came. In spite of
            all that revelation and conscience had done to leaven it, He found
            the faithful few in number, and evil predominant in the mass.

          <p>
            ἐξέληται - he might deliver. Here, as in Acts 26:17, this verb
            coupled with ἐκ can only denote choice out of the world, not
            deliverance from it, which would require the addition of ἐκ χειρός,
            as in Acts 12:11, or some equivalent. The clause describes the
            process of selection begun by Christ on earth, and still continued
            by the risen Christ as He calls fresh disciples into His Church
            continually.

          <p>
            ᾧ ἡ δόξα - to whom [be] the glory. Our versions supply ἔστω and turn
            the clause accordingly into an invocation of praise. But the
            insertion of the article points rather to an affirmation, whose is
            the glory. The verb is usually omitted in the doxology, but ἐστιν is
            added in 1 Peter 4:11. The glory consists in the manifestation of
            the Father's character throughout all the ages in the continual
            redemption of mankind according to His will. Hereby is revealed His
            union of perfect wisdom, holiness, and love.
          </p>

          <p>
            εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων. - to the ages of the ages. Denotes in
            Scripture a divinely appointed period (see ages, αἰῶνας, in
            Galatians 1:4). The larger of these divine dispensations comprehend
            within them other shorter periods, and are therefore designated
            αἰῶνες αἰώνων. The phrase in the text ascribes the glory to God for
            the whole term of these dispensations, i.e., for all the ages of
            human life, since these together make up the sum of man's existence.
            The full form is used by the Apostle in Php 4:20, 2 Timothy 4:18,
            but he uses elsewhere the shorter form εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ἀμήν. - amen. This Amen crowns the previous declaration of the glory
            of God by an invitation to the Churches to join in the ascription of
            praise.
