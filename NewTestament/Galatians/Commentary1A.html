          <h2>
            Ver 1.
            <em
              >Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus
              Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. In the salutations with which he
            commenced his Epistles, Paul was accustomed to claim the title of
            "an Apostle." His object in doing so, as we have remarked on former
            occasions, was to employ the authority of his station, for the
            purpose of enforcing his doctrine. This authority depends not on the
            judgment or opinion of men, but exclusively on the calling of God;
            and therefore he demands a hearing on the ground of his being "an
            Apostle." Let us always bear this in mind, that in the church we
            ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he has
            appointed to be our teacher. Whoever assumes a right to instruct us,
            must speak in the name of God or of Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as the calling of Paul was more vehemently disputed among the
            Galatians, he asserts it more strongly in his address to that
            church, than in his other Epistles; for he does not simply affirm
            that he was called by God, but states expressly that it was not
            either from men or by men. This statement, be it observed, applies
            not to the office which he held in common with other pastors, but to
            the apostleship. The authors of the calumnies which he has in his
            eye did not venture to deprive him altogether of the honor of the
            Christian ministry. They merely refused to allow him the name and
            rank of an apostle.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are now speaking of the apostleship in the strictest sense; for
            the word is employed in two different ways. Sometimes, it denotes
            preachers of the Gospel, to whatever class they might belong; but
            here it bears a distinct reference to the highest rank in the
            church; so that Paul is equal to Peter and to the other twelve.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Not from men, nor through man</em>. The first clause, that he
            was called not from men, he had in common with all the true
            ministers of Christ. As no man ought to "take this honor unto
            himself" (Heb 5:4), so it is not in the power of men to bestow it on
            whomsoever they choose. It belongs to God alone to govern his
            church; and therefore the calling cannot be lawful, unless it
            proceed from Him. So far as the church is concerned, a man who has
            been led to the ministry, not by a good conscience, but by ungodly
            motives, may happen to be regularly called. But Paul is here
            speaking of a call ascertained in so perfect, a manner, that nothing
            farther can be desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second clause, that he was called not by man, belonged in a
            peculiar manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary pastor, this
            would have implied nothing wrong. Paul himself, when travelling
            through various cities in company with Barnabas, "ordained elders in
            every church," by the votes of the people (Acts 14:23); and he
            enjoins Titus and Timothy to proceed in the same work (1 Tim 5:17
            Titus 1:5). Such is the ordinary method of electing pastors; for we
            are not entitled to wait until God shall reveal from heaven the
            names of the persons whom he has chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was called, not by a mere man, but by one that was more than a
            man; nor by a mortal man, but by Christ, as raised from the dead,
            immortal and glorious at God's right hand: or rather the sense is,
            he was not chosen into the office of apostleship by the suffrages of
            men, as Matthew was; or he was not ordained an apostle in the manner
            the ordinary ministers of the Gospel and pastors are, by the
            churches of Christ; so that as the former clause is opposed to an
            unlawful call of men, this is opposed to a lawful one; and shows him
            to be not an ordinary minister, but an extraordinary one, who was
            called to this office, not mediately by men.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if human agency was not improper, if it was even commendable,
            why does Paul disclaim it in reference to himself? I have already
            mentioned that something more was necessary to be proved than that
            Paul was a pastor, or that he belonged to the number of the
            ministers of the Gospel; for the point in dispute was the
            apostleship. It was necessary that the apostles should be elected,
            not in the same manner as other pastors, but by the direct agency of
            the Lord himself. Thus, Christ himself (Matthew 10:1) called the
            Twelve; and when a successor was to be appointed in the room of
            Judas, the church does not venture to choose one by votes, but has
            recourse to lot. (Acts 1:26). We are certain that the lot was not
            employed in electing pastors. Why was it resorted to in the election
            of Matthias? To mark the express agency of God for it was proper
            that the apostles should be distinguished from other ministers. And
            thus Paul, in order to show that he does not belong to the ordinary
            rank of ministers, contends that his calling proceeded immediately
            from God.
          </p>
          <p>
            But how does Paul affirm that he was not called by men, while Luke
            records that Paul and Barnabas were called by the church at Antioch?
            Some have replied, that he had previously discharged the duties of
            an apostle, and that, consequently, his apostleship was not founded
            on his appointment by that church. But here, again, it may be
            objected, that this was his first designation to be the apostle of
            the Gentiles, to which class the Galatians belonged. The more
            correct, and obvious reply is, that he did not intend here to set
            aside entirely the calling of that church, but merely to show that
            his apostleship rests on a higher title. This is true; for even
            those who laid their hands on Paul at Antioch did so, not of their
            own accord, but in obedience to express revelation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since, therefore, he was called by Divine revelation, and was also
            appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to be the apostle of the
            Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought forward by men,
            although the customary rite of ordination was afterwards added.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect contrast between Paul
            and the false apostles is here intended. I have no objection to that
            view; for they were in the habit of glorying in the name of men. His
            meaning will therefore stand thus: "Whoever may be the persons by
            whom others boast that they have been sent, I shall be superior to
            them; for I hold my commission from God and Christ."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>By Jesus Christ and God the Father.</em> He asserts that God the
            Father and Christ had bestowed on him his apostleship. Christ is
            first named, because it is his prerogative to send, and because we
            are his ambassadors. But to make the statement more complete, the
            Father is also mentioned; as if he had said, "If there be any one
            whom the name of Christ is not sufficient to inspire with reverence,
            let him know that I have also received my office from God the
            Father."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who raised him from the dead</em>. The resurrection of Christ is
            the commencement of his reign, and is therefore closely connected
            with the present subject. It was a reproach brought by them against
            Paul that he had held no communication with Christ, while he was on
            the earth. He argues, on the other hand, that, as Christ was
            glorified by his resurrection, so he has actually exercised his
            authority in the government of his church. The calling of Paul is
            therefore more illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while
            still a mortal, had ordained him to the office. And this
            circumstance deserves attention; for Paul intimates that the attempt
            to set aside his authority, involved a malignant opposition to the
            astonishing power of God, which was displayed in the resurrection of
            Christ; because the same heavenly Father, who raised Christ from the
            dead, commanded Paul to make known that exertion of his power.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Ver 2.
            <em
              >and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of
              Galatia:</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And all the brethren who are with me</em>. -- He appears to have
            usually written in the name of many persons, judging that, if those
            to whom he wrote should attach less weight to a solitary individual,
            they might listen to a greater number, and would not despise a whole
            congregation. His general practice is, to insert the salutations
            from brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the
            commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never
            mentions more than two names, and those very well known. But here he
            includes all the brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good
            reason, an opposite method. The concurrence of so many godly persons
            must have had some degree of influence in softening the minds of the
            Galatians, and preparing them to receive instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To the churches of Galatia</em>. It was an extensive country,
            and therefore contained many churches scattered through it. But is
            it not wonderful that the term "Church", which always implies unity
            of faith, should have been applied to the Galatians, who had almost
            entirely revolted from Christ? I reply, so long as they professed
            Christianity, worshipped one God, observed the sacraments, and
            enjoyed some kind of Gospel ministry, they retained the external
            marks of a church. We do not always find in churches such a measure
            of purity as might be desired. The purest have their blemishes; and
            some are marked, not by a few spots, but by general deformity.
            Though the doctrines and practices of any society may not, in all
            respects, meet our wishes, we must not instantly pronounce its
            defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from it the
            appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a gentleness of
            disposition utterly at variance with such a course. Yet our
            acknowledgment of societies to be churches of Christ must be
            accompanied by an explicit condemnation of everything in them that
            is improper or defective; for we must not imagine, that, wherever
            there is some kind of church, everything in it that ought to be
            desired in a church is perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            I make this observation, because the Papists, seizing on the single
            word Church, think that whatever they choose to force upon us is
            sanctioned; though the condition and aspect of the Church of Rome
            are widely different from what existed in Galatia. If Paul were
            alive at the present day, he would perceive the miserable and
            dreadfully shattered remains of a church; but he would perceive no
            building. In short, the word Church is often applied by a figure of
            speech in which a part is taken for the whole, to any portion of the
            church, even though it may not fully answer to the name.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 3.
            <em
              >Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
              Christ,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace be to you and peace</em>. The terms of grace and peace are
            common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood. But since
            we are explaining this epistle, you will not mind if we repeat what
            we have so often explained elsewhere. The article of justification
            must be sounded in our ears incessantly because the frailty of our
            flesh will not permit us to take hold of it perfectly and to believe
            it with all our heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace remits sin, and
            peace quiets the conscience. Sin and conscience torment us, but
            Christ has overcome these fiends now and forever. Only Christians
            possess this victorious knowledge given from above. These two terms,
            grace and peace, constitute Christianity. Grace involves the
            remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience. Sin is not
            canceled by lawful living, for no person is able to live up to the
            Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills the conscience with terror, and
            drives men to despair. Much less is sin taken away by man-invented
            endeavors. The fact is, the more a person seeks credit for himself
            by his own efforts, the deeper he goes into debt. Nothing can take
            away sin except the grace of God. In actual living, however, it is
            not so easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone, in opposition
            to every other means, we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and
            peace with God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world brands this a pernicious doctrine. The world advances free
            will, the rational and natural approach of good works, as the means
            of obtaining the forgiveness of sin. But it is impossible to gain
            peace of conscience by the methods and means of the world.
            Experience proves this. Various holy orders have been launched for
            the purpose of securing peace of conscience through religious
            exercises, but they proved failures because such devices only
            increase doubt and despair. We find no rest for our weary bones
            unless we cling to the word of grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace and peace from the
            emperor, or from kings, or from governors, but from God the Father.
            He wishes them heavenly peace, the kind of which Jesus spoke when He
            said, "Peace I leave unto you: my peace I give unto you." Worldly
            peace provides quiet enjoyment of life and possessions. But in
            affliction, particularly in the hour of death, the grace and peace
            of the world will not deliver us. However, the grace and peace of
            God will. They make a person strong and courageous to bear and to
            overcome all difficulties, even death itself, because we have the
            victory of Christ's death and the assurance of the forgiveness of
            our sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, Paul confirms our creed, "that Christ is very
            God." We need such frequent confirmation of our faith, for Satan
            will not fail to attack it. He hates our faith. He knows that it is
            the victory which overcometh him and the world. That Christ is very
            God is apparent in that Paul ascribes to Him divine powers equally
            with the Father, as for instance, the power to dispense grace and
            peace. This Jesus could not do unless He were God.
          </p>
          <p>
            To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can
            create these blessings. The angels cannot. The apostles could only
            distribute these blessings by the preaching of the Gospel. In
            attributing to Christ the divine power of creating and giving grace,
            peace, everlasting life, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins, the
            conclusion is inevitable that Christ is truly God. Similarly, St.
            John concludes from the works attributed to the Father and the Son
            that they are divinely One. Hence, the gifts which we receive from
            the Father and from the Son are one and the same. Otherwise Paul
            should have written: "Grace from God the Father, and peace from our
            Lord Jesus Christ." In combining them he ascribes them equally to
            the Father and the Son. I stress this on account of the many errors
            emanating from the sects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Arians were sharp fellows. Admitting that Christ had two
            natures, and that He is called "very God of very God," they were yet
            able to deny His divinity. The Arians took Christ for a noble and
            perfect creature, superior even to the angels, because by Him God
            created heaven and earth. Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ. But
            all their praise is mere palaver to deceive men. Paul's language is
            different. To paraphrase him: "You are established in this belief
            that Christ is very God because He gives grace and peace, gifts
            which only God can create and bestow."

            <em>Who gave himself for our sins</em>. He begins with commending
            the grace of Christ, in order to recall and fix on Him the attention
            of the Galatians; for, if they had justly appreciated this benefit
            of redemption, they would never have fallen into opposite views of
            religion. He who knows Christ in a proper manner beholds him
            earnestly, embraces him with the warmest affection, is absorbed in
            the contemplation of him, and desires no other object. The best
            remedy for purifying our minds from any kind of errors or
            superstitions, is to keep in remembrance our relation to Christ, and
            the benefits which he has conferred upon us.
          </p>
          <p>
            These words,
            <em>who gave himself for our sins</em>, were intended to convey to
            the Galatians a doctrine of vast importance; that no other
            satisfactions can lawfully be brought into comparison with that
            sacrifice of himself which Christ offered to the Father; that in
            Christ, therefore, and in him alone, atonement for sin, and perfect
            righteousness, must be sought; and that the manner in which we are
            redeemed by him ought to excite our highest admiration. What Paul
            here ascribes to Christ is, with equal propriety, ascribed in other
            parts of Scripture to God the Father; for, on the one hand, the
            Father, by an eternal purpose, decreed this atonement, and gave this
            proof of his love to us, that he "spared not his only-begotten Son,
            (Romans 8:32), but delivered him up for us all;" and Christ, on the
            other hand, offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to
            God. Hence it follows, that his death is the satisfaction for sins.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That he might deliver us</em>. He likewise declares the design
            of our redemption to be, that Christ, by his death, might purchase
            us to be his own property. This takes place when we are separated
            from the world; for so long as we are of the world, we do not belong
            to Christ. The word <em>age</em> is here put for the corruption
            which is in the world; in the same manner as in the first Epistle of
            John, (1 John 5:19) where it is said that "the whole world lieth in
            the wicked one," and in his Gospel, (John 17:15), where the Savior
            says, "I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but
            that thou shouldst keep them from the evil;" for there it signifies
            the present life. What then is meant by the word "World" in this
            passage? Men separated from the kingdom of God and the grace of
            Christ. So long as a man lives to himself, he is altogether
            condemned. The World is, therefore, contrasted with regeneration, as
            nature with grace, or the flesh with the spirit. Those who are born
            of the world have nothing but sin and wickedness, not by creation,
            but by corruption. Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to
            redeem or separate us from the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From the present wicked age</em>. By adding the epithet
            "wicked", he intended to show that he is speaking of the corruption
            or depravity which proceeds from sin, and not of God's creatures, or
            of the bodily life. And yet by this single word, as by a
            thunderbolt, he lays low all human pride; for he declares, that,
            apart from that renewal of the nature which is bestowed by the grace
            of Christ, there is nothing in us but unmixed wickedness. We are of
            the world; and, till Christ take us out of it, the world reigns in
            us, and we live to the world. Whatever delight men may take in their
            fancied excellence, they are worthless and depraved; not indeed in
            their own opinion, but in the judgment of our Lord, which is here
            pronounced by the mouth of Paul, and which ought to satisfy our
            minds.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the will. He points out the original fountain of grace,
            namely, the purpose of God; "for God so loved the world, that he
            gave his only-begotten Son." (John 3:16). But it deserves notice,
            that Paul is accustomed to represent the decree of God as setting
            aside all compensation or merit on the part of men, and so Will
            denotes here what is commonly called "good pleasure." The meaning
            is, that Christ suffered for us, not because we were worthy, or
            because anything done by us moved him to the act, but because such
            was the purpose of God. Of God and our Father is of the same import
            as if he had said, "Of God who is our Father."

            <em>To whom be glory</em>. By this sudden exclamation of
            thanksgiving, he intends to awaken powerfully in his readers the
            contemplation of that invaluable gift which they had received from
            God, and in this manner to prepare their minds more fully for
            receiving instruction. It must at the same time be viewed as a
            general exhortation. Every instance in which the mercy of God occurs
            to our remembrance, ought to be embraced by us as an occasion of
            ascribing glory to God.

            <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. Elsewhere Paul draws a sharp distinction
            between an apostleship and lesser functions, as in I Corinthians
            12:28: "And God hath set some in the church; first, apostles;
            secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Apostle</em>. The term, in its native signification, signifies
            one who is sent; in its ecclesiastical use, it signifies one
            extraordinarily sent to preach the gospel; of these some were sent
            either more immediately by Christ, (as the twelve were sent, Matthew
            10:1; Mark 3:14; Luke 9:1), or more mediately, as Matthias, who was
            sent by the suffrage of the other apostles to supply the place of
            Judas (Acts 1:25, 1:26), and Barnabas, and Silas, and others were.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Not from men</em>. Paul saith he was sent not of men, neither by
            man, that is, not merely; for he was also sent by men to his
            particular province (Acts 13:3); but he was immediately sent by
            Jesus Christ, (as we read, Acts 9:1-43 and Acts 26:14-17, of which
            also he gives us an account in this chapter, Galatians 1:15-17), and
            by God the Father also.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Through Jesus Christ</em>. How did Paul get his commission? He
            tells us in Acts 26. When he fell stricken on the Damascus road the
            risen Christ appeared to him, and said to him, “I am Jesus whom thou
            persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared
            unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness
            both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in
            the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people,
            and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their
            eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of
            Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
            inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me”
            (vv. 15-18). Paul says that is where he got his commission.
            “Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
            vision” (v. 19), but in accord with his divinely-given instructions
            he went forth to teach at “Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
            throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that
            they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for
            repentance” (v. 20).
          </p>
          <p>
            As it differed from the call of ordinary ministers, who are called
            by men (though their ministry be not merely of men); so it differed
            from the call of the rest of the apostles, being made by Christ not
            in his state of humiliation, (as the twelve were called, Matthew
            10:1-42), but in his state of exaltation, after he was raised from
            the dead, and sat down on the right hand of God.

          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Grace</em>. Some say when Christ was on earth and in the early
            part of the book of Acts, they preached the gospel of the kingdom
            but did not know the grace of God. I wonder whether they remember
            the words of John 3:16 and John 1:29, and recollect that it was the
            Lord who said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my
            word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and
            shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto
            life” (John 5:24). How short our memories are sometimes, if we say
            that Jesus was not preaching grace when here on earth when Scripture
            says, “The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
            Christ” (John 1:17). Can we say that Peter and his fellow apostles
            in the early part of Acts were not preaching grace when it was Peter
            who declared, “To him give all the prophets witness, that through
            his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins”
            (Acts 10:43).

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Who gave himself</em>. Which Christ, though he was put to death
            by Pilate and the Jews, yet he was not compelled to die; for he laid
            down his life, no man took it from him, John 10:17, 10:18. Sometimes
            it is said, he died for our sins, as Romans 5:8; sometimes, that he
            gave himself, meaning, to death, as in Ephesians 5:2, 5:25; 1
            Timothy 2:6; Titus 2:14; he was given by his Father, and he gave
            himself by his own free act.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence we are not delivered by our own will, or shrewdness, or
            wisdom, but by the mercy and love of God, as it is written, "Herein
            is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his
            Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4:10). Paul, like
            John, emphasizes the Father's will is Christ's habit of directing
            attention to the Father. For Christ came into the world to reconcile
            God with us and to draw us to the Father.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For our sins</em>. Of all men it is written, “None of them can
            by any means redeem his brother, nor give God a ransom for him. For
            the redemption of their life is costly, no payment is ever enough”
            (Psalms 49:7-8). But here is One who became Man to redeem our soul:
            “The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and
            to give his life a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>That he might deliver us out of this present evil age</em>.
            Remission of sins is an effect of the death of Christ, but not the
            sole effect; we must not forget the propitiation (Romans 3:25); the
            redemption (Ephesians 1:7); the sacrifice (Hebrews 10:12); And
            though some other texts mention Christ’s dying for our sins, without
            mention of such expiation, propitiation, redemption, or
            satisfaction; yet they must be interpreted by the latitude of the
            end of Christ’s death (expressed in other scriptures) relating to
            sin. Which is not only expiation, and remission, but the delivery of
            us from the lusts and corruptions of this present evil age.

            raised by the power of the Father? Well then, He truly rose, and
            after He had risen was seen again of the disciples; and twelve
            disciples were witnesses of His Resurrection, who bare witness not

            ourselves of all those filthy wickednesses with which we were
            imbued... even so we, who through the name of Jesus have believed as
            one man in God the Maker of all, have been stripped, through the
            name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy garments, i.e., of our
            sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the word of His calling, we

            John Chrysostom comments, "Not only this exordium, but, so to speak,
            the whole Epistle, is full of a vehement and lofty spirit. For
            always to address one's disciples with mildness, even when they
            needed severity, would be to play the corrupter and enemy, not the

            F. F. Bruce comments, "The question of the North or South Galatian
            destination of our epistle is not one in which it is proper to take
            up partisan attitudes or indulge in dogmatic assertions; and it ill
            becomes champions of either view to disparage the rival view of
            those who maintain it. The fact that so many competent scholars can
            be cited in support of either position suggests that the evidence
            for neither is absolutely conclusive. But the weight of the
            evidence, it seems to me, favours the South Galatian view. If the
            Epistle to the Galatians was indeed addressed to the churches of
            Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra and Oerbe, then we have important
            historical, geographical, literary and epigraphic data which will
            provide material for its better understanding." (<a

            Martin Luther comments, "The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing.
            Grace remits sin, and peace quiets the conscience. Sin and
            conscience torment us, but Christ has overcome these fiends now and
            forever. Only Christians possess this victorious knowledge given
            from above. These two terms, grace and peace, constitute
            Christianity. Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and a
            happy conscience. Sin is not canceled by lawful living, for no
            person is able to live up to the Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills
            the conscience with terror, and drives men to despair. Much less is
            sin taken away by man-invented endeavors. The fact is, the more a
            person seeks credit for himself by his own efforts, the deeper he
            goes into debt. Nothing can take away sin except the grace of God.
            In actual living, however, it is not so easy to persuade oneself
            that by grace alone, in opposition to every other means, we obtain
            the forgiveness of our sins and peace with God." (<a

            supreme God in whom he recognizes 'our Father,' and with him Jesus
            Christ, 'our Lord;' that is, our Master, Head, Mediator, 'through
            whom are all things, and we through him.' Grace and peace coming
            down from heaven, must come from God our Father and Jesus Christ our
            Lord. From the very nature of the case it is obvious that the
            blessings referred to come to us through Christ, though also 'from'
            him; as also that St. Paul's delegation as apostle, spoken of in the

            Matthew Henry comments, "From this we may note, 1. This present

            is so on account of the sin and sorrow with which it abounds and the
            many snares and temptations to which we are exposed as long as we
            continue in it. But, 2. Jesus Christ has died to deliver us from
            this present evil world, not presently to remove his people out of
            it, but to rescue them from the power of it, to keep them from the
            evil of it, and in due time to possess them of another and better
            world. This, the apostle informs us, he has done
            <em>according to the will of God and our Father</em>. In offering up
            himself a sacrifice for this end and purpose, he acted by the
            appointment of the Father, as well as with his own free consent; and
            therefore we have the greatest reason to depend upon the efficacy
            and acceptableness of what he has done and suffered for us" (<a

            of evil, sin, and death and find their true identity in the new age
            that has broken into history through Christ's epochal death and
            resurrection." (Galatians, BECNT: Baker, 2013).

            becoming <em>the first-begotten of the dead</em>, and in Himself
            raising up man that was fallen, lifting him up far above the heaven
            to the right hand of the glory of the Father: even as God promised
            by the prophet, saying:
            <em>And I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen</em>;
            that is, the flesh that was from David. And this our Lord Jesus
            Christ truly fulfilled, when He gloriously achieved our redemption,
            that He might truly raise us up, setting us free unto the Father.
            And if any man will not receive His birth from a virgin, how shall
            he receive His resurrection from the dead? For it is nothing
            wonderful and astonishing and extraordinary, if one who was not born
            rose from the dead: nay indeed we cannot speak of a resurrection of
            him who came unto being without birth. For one who is unborn and
            immortal, and has not undergone birth, will also not undergo death.

              Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em

          </h2>
          <p>
            The opening verse of Galatians, “Paul, an apostle—not from men nor
            through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised
            him from the dead,” establishes the foundation for the epistle’s
            overarching themes of authority, divine calling, and the purity of
            the gospel. Paul’s self-identification as an apostle, coupled with
            the emphatic negation of human mediation, reveals his intent to
            address the challenges posed by the Judaizers, who sought to
            discredit his ministry and distort the gospel of grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul employs a carefully structured statement to highlight the
            origin of his apostleship. The phrase “not from men nor through man”
            employs dual negations to underline the exclusion of human
            involvement in his calling. The subsequent affirmation, “but through
            Jesus Christ and God the Father,” shifts the focus to the divine
            source of his authority. This contrast sets the tone for the entire
            epistle, where Paul defends both his apostolic authority and the
            sufficiency of the gospel he preaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term “apostle” (ἀπόστολος) denotes one who is sent with a
            commission, implying both a sender and a purpose. Paul’s explicit
            denial of human involvement—“not from men nor through
            man”—distinguishes his apostleship from those of other teachers and
            leaders who may have been commissioned by human authorities or
            ecclesiastical institutions. Unlike pastors or elders, whose
            authority is often mediated through ordination or communal
            recognition, Paul asserts that his commission is direct and
            unmediated. The distinction between “from men” (denoting origin) and
            “through man” (denoting agency) reinforces the point: Paul’s
            apostleship originates directly with God and not through human
            intermediaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            This claim counters the accusations of the Judaizers, who questioned
            Paul’s legitimacy by insinuating that his gospel message was
            secondhand or incomplete compared to that of the Jerusalem apostles.
            By grounding his authority in divine revelation, Paul silences such
            critiques, presenting his message as carrying the full weight of
            divine authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s appeal to Jesus Christ and God the Father as the source of
            his apostleship underscores two key theological truths: the unity of
            the Father and the Son in the work of salvation, and the centrality
            of the resurrection in authenticating both Paul’s ministry and the
            gospel message.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s phrasing—“through Jesus Christ and God the Father”—places
            Jesus Christ and the Father on equal footing as the divine source of
            his authority. This conjunction implies a high Christology,
            affirming the deity of Christ. The lack of distinction in the
            preposition used for both—“through” (διὰ)—reinforces their shared
            role in Paul’s calling. As Chrysostom notes, Paul’s language “stops
            the mouths of heretics” by affirming the equality of the Father and
            the Son, countering any notion of subordination.
          </p>
          <p>
            This high Christology is a hallmark of Pauline theology, as
            evidenced by his frequent use of Old Testament passages referring to
            Yahweh and applying them to Christ (e.g., Romans 10:13, Philippians
            2:9-11). Furthermore, Paul’s unique use of the title “Lord” (κύριος)
            should be noted. While other New Testament authors use the term for
            both the Father and the Son, Paul predominantly uses it for Christ,
            reflecting his understanding of Jesus as the divine Lord of the Old
            Testament.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase “who raised him from the dead” ties Paul’s apostleship to
            the core event of Christian faith—the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
            This reference not only authenticates Paul’s gospel but also serves
            as a rebuttal to the Judaizers, whose message undermined the
            sufficiency of Christ’s work. The resurrection is the ultimate
            vindication of Christ’s deity and the efficacy of his atonement,
            making it the bedrock of Paul’s apostolic proclamation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s emphasis on divine calling aligns him with the prophetic
            tradition of the Old Testament. Like the prophets of Israel, Paul’s
            commission is characterized by a direct encounter with the divine.
            Several key parallels emerge between Paul’s Damascus Road experience
            (Acts 9, 22, 26) and the call narratives of prophets such as
            Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Isaiah.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ezekiel’s inaugural vision in Ezekiel 1 bears striking similarities
            to Paul’s encounter with the risen Christ. Both accounts feature a
            brilliant, overwhelming light and a direct divine commission. In
            Ezekiel’s case, the vision of the glory of the Lord includes the
            appearance of a human figure seated on a throne, described as “the
            likeness of the glory of the Lord.” This parallels Paul’s vision of
            the glorified Christ, whose radiance exceeds that of the sun (Acts
            26:13). Both figures are called to a mission of proclaiming God’s
            message to rebellious audiences—Ezekiel to Israel and Paul to the
            Gentiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Isaiah’s call in Isaiah 6 features similar elements of divine glory
            and a humbling encounter with the holy. Isaiah’s response, “Here I
            am! Send me,” echoes Paul’s willingness to be sent by Christ,
            despite the personal cost of suffering and persecution. The emphasis
            on divine initiative in both narratives reinforces the notion that
            true ministry originates with God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s language in Galatians 1:1 anticipates the strong condemnation
            he issues later in the chapter: “If anyone is preaching to you a
            gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed”
            (Galatians 1:9). His rejection of any gospel that adds human works
            or traditions to the finished work of Christ underscores the
            centrality of grace in salvation.
          </p>
          <p>Application points:</p>
          <p>
            Just as Paul’s apostleship was rooted in divine initiative, all
            Christian ministry should be grounded in God’s calling and empowered
            by his Spirit. Human recognition and credentials, while valuable,
            are secondary to the legitimacy conferred by God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s rejection of any human additions to the gospel serves as a
            caution against legalism and works-based righteousness. The message
            of salvation by grace through faith alone remains as vital today as
            it was in Paul’s time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s boldness in defending the gospel, even in the face of
            opposition, challenges believers to stand firm in their convictions.
            The gospel’s truth is worth defending, regardless of the personal
            cost.

            Ver 2.

              Galatia:</em

          </h2>
          <p>
            The mention of "all the brothers who are with me" underscores the
            collective nature of Paul’s apostolic authority. By including his
            fellow believers in the greeting, Paul signals that the message he
            delivers is not merely his personal conviction but one affirmed by
            the Christian community around him. This detail is particularly
            significant given the context of the letter. The Judaizers, who were
            leading the Galatians astray, likely claimed support from the
            Jerusalem apostles or other Christian authorities. Paul counters
            this by emphasizing that he is not alone in his stance; the gospel
            he preaches is supported by the broader body of believers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Greco-Roman world, public statements were often bolstered by
            witnesses to strengthen their credibility. By including "all the
            brothers," Paul not only reaffirms his apostolic authority but also
            invokes a communal witness to the truth of his message. This
            communal approach reinforces that Paul’s gospel aligns with the
            consensus of faithful Christian teaching, standing in contrast to
            the divisive and unorthodox teachings of the Judaizers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reference to the brothers also serves to counter the
            isolationism of false teachers. The Judaizers likely positioned
            themselves as the exclusive custodians of the "true" gospel. Paul’s
            inclusive greeting demonstrates that the true gospel unites rather
            than divides. His reference to "all the brothers" reminds the
            Galatians of the universal and communal nature of the Christian
            faith, which transcends regional or doctrinal factions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Galatia was a region in Asia Minor, encompassing cities like
            Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. Paul had visited these
            cities during his missionary journeys (Acts 13–14) and had
            established churches there. However, the plural "churches" in
            Galatians 1:2 indicates that Paul is addressing multiple
            congregations, each of which was facing similar doctrinal
            challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The regional nature of this address highlights the widespread
            influence of the Judaizers. Their teaching had permeated not just
            one congregation but an entire network of churches. This underscores
            the urgency of Paul’s letter, as the Galatian churches were
            collectively abandoning the gospel of grace for a works-based system
            of righteousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other letters, Paul does not address the Galatians with any
            honorific titles such as "saints" or "the church of God." For
            example, in his letters to the Corinthians, Paul refers to "the
            church of God that is in Corinth" (1 Corinthians 1:2), and to the
            Philippians as "saints in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 1:1). The
            omission of such titles in Galatians is deliberate and striking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galatians’ departure from the gospel mirrors Israel’s repeated
            pattern of apostasy in the Old Testament. Despite experiencing God’s
            redemptive acts, the Israelites frequently turned to idolatry and
            false worship. Similarly, the Galatians, who had received the gospel
            of grace, were now turning to a distorted gospel of works.
          </p>
          <p>
            This absence reflects Paul’s deep concern and disappointment with
            the Galatians. Early commentators like Chrysostom observed that
            Paul’s failure to use titles of affection or respect was a
            rhetorical device to express his dismay. The Galatian churches had
            deviated so far from the gospel that Paul refrains from affirming
            their identity as sanctified believers in Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plural "churches" is theologically significant. It indicates
            that Paul is not addressing the church as a singular, unified body
            but as fragmented assemblies that have collectively deviated from
            the gospel. This fragmentation mirrors the theological and practical
            disarray caused by the Judaizers. Paul’s choice of words subtly
            critiques the Galatians’ disunity, contrasting it with the unity
            that the gospel should produce.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s use of the plural "churches" evokes the image of the divided
            tribes of Israel, each plagued by its own forms of rebellion and
            unfaithfulness. Just as God preserved a remnant in Israel, Paul’s
            letter aims to call the Galatians back to the true gospel and
            preserve their witness.
          </p>
          <p>
            This verse helps us understand the distinction between the visible
            and invisible church—a concept later articulated by Reformation
            theologians. The visible church consists of those who outwardly
            profess faith in Christ, while the invisible church includes those
            who truly belong to Christ by faith. Paul’s omission of honorific
            titles for the Galatian churches suggests that their visible status
            as assemblies was not matched by their invisible status as true
            believers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This distinction serves as a sobering reminder that not all who
            outwardly identify with the church remain faithful to the gospel.
            While the Galatians had been founded on apostolic teaching, they
            were not immune to error. The Galatians’ departure from the doctrine
            of justification by faith alone reflects the vulnerability of the
            visible church to doctrinal error and apostasy. His greeting
            establishes the tone for the letter, which is characterized by sharp
            rebuke and an urgent call to repentance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This serves as a warning the modern church as well. Just as the
            Galatians were led astray by false teachers, modern churches are
            vulnerable to doctrinal distortions and theological drift. We see
            here the fall of apostolic churches. This directly challenges the
            assumption that historical or institutional connections to the
            apostles guarantee doctrinal fidelity. True apostolicity is defined
            by adherence to the gospel, not by external markers or traditions.
            Our faith needs to be grounded in the apostolic gospel rather than
            human traditions or leaders.
          </p>
          <p>Application points:</p>
          <p>
            Galatians 1:2 underscores the importance of guarding against false
            teaching. Believers must remain vigilant in upholding the truth of
            justification by faith alone, resisting the temptation to add human
            works or traditions to the gospel. Churches must be willing to
            confront error, even at the risk of discomfort or conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s inclusion of "all the brothers" highlights the role of
            community in preserving doctrinal purity. Churches should cultivate
            a culture of mutual accountability, where leaders and members alike
            are committed to upholding the truth of the gospel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galatians’ rapid departure from the gospel serves as a warning
            against complacency. Churches and individuals must remain rooted in
            Scripture and continually examine their beliefs and practices in
            light of the gospel. Faithfulness to Christ requires ongoing
            vigilance and humility.

          <p>
            Paul's greeting in Galatians 1:3—"Grace to you and peace from God
            our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"—serves as a compact
            theological declaration that encapsulates the essence of the gospel.
            It simultaneously addresses the Galatians' spiritual crisis and
            establishes the themes that dominate the epistle: grace, peace, and
            the divine initiative in salvation. This opening "prayer-wish," as
            identified by scholars, is not merely formulaic but functions as a
            liturgical invocation, reflecting Paul’s pastoral heart and
            theological focus. As noted in the transcript, Paul begins by
            invoking grace and peace, gifts that are foundational to Christian
            life, flowing from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Greek term <em>charis</em> (χάρις), rendered as "grace," is a
            central term in Paul’s theology, referring to God's unmerited favor.
            It conveys the idea of a benevolent gift given without regard to the
            recipient's worthiness. But that grace is even more than just
            undeserved favor—it is favor bestowed upon the ill-deserving. In its
            biblical usage, <em>charis</em> reflects the dynamic action of God
            extending His kindness toward sinners, a reality vividly described
            in Romans 4:4-5, where Paul contrasts wages earned through works
            with the free gift of grace received through faith. Grace,
            therefore, is entirely opposed to any concept of merit, a key
            distinction in Paul's defense of justification by faith alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul's invocation of grace finds its antecedent in the Aaronic
            benediction (Numbers 6:24-26), where the priestly blessing includes
            the petition, "The Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious
            to you." This connection indicates that Paul is drawing on the Old
            Testament to emphasize the continuity of God’s gracious dealings,
            now fulfilled in Christ. While the Aaronic blessing sought God's
            gracious presence for Israel, Paul applies this grace universally to
            the Galatian believers, a diverse body of Jewish and Gentile
            Christians.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galatian crisis revolved around the false teaching of the
            Judaizers who insisted on adherence to Mosaic law as a prerequisite
            for salvation. Paul's salutation of grace underscores the divine
            initiative in salvation, which stands in stark contrast to the
            works-based righteousness advocated by his opponents. This appeal to
            grace dismantles any attempt to mix human effort with divine gift.
            Grace is the cornerstone of the gospel, uniting all believers under
            the one true gospel of Christ and excluding boasting in human
            achievement (Ephesians 2:8-9).
          </p>
          <p>
            Peace (eirēnē), flowing from grace, signifies the restoration of a
            broken relationship between humanity and God. This is not merely a
            subjective feeling but an objective reality grounded in the atoning
            work of Christ. Peace is the natural outflow of justification.
            Romans 5:1 supports this, declaring that believers have peace with
            God as a result of being justified by faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Romans 5:1, Paul explicitly connects justification by faith with
            peace: "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
            with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." This peace is not merely a
            temporary absence of conflict but the assurance of reconciliation
            with God. Peace is a divine gift that follows the believer's
            justification and is sustained by grace. It is a present reality for
            believers that is grounded in Christ’s redemptive work.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Galatians, peace was threatened by the divisive influence of
            the Judaizers, who sought to impose the Mosaic law on Gentile
            believers. Paul’s invocation of peace is both a theological
            affirmation and a pastoral appeal. By emphasizing peace as a gift
            from God and Christ, Paul redirects the Galatians from the strife
            caused by false teaching to the unity and harmony that the gospel
            produces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practically speaking, Paul’s experience of tribulation (Romans
            5:3-5) demonstrates that peace with God equips believers to endure
            trials with hope and perseverance. This message is particularly
            relevant for the Galatians, who were caught in the tension between
            their newfound faith and the legalistic pressures of the Judaizers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s reference to Jesus as "the Lord" (κυρίου) not only affirms
            His sovereignty but also highlights His role as the mediator of
            grace and peace. This mediatorial role is further elaborated in
            verse 4, where Paul describes Christ as the one "who gave Himself
            for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age." Christ’s
            sacrificial death is the means by which grace and peace are secured,
            fulfilling the Old Testament promises and establishing a new
            covenant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s greeting is a "prayer-wish," a term used by scholars to
            describe his pastoral invocation of blessings upon his readers. This
            salutation is not a mere formality but a heartfelt appeal for God’s
            grace and peace to be manifest in the lives of the Galatians. By
            framing his letter in this way, Paul sets the tone for the
            theological and pastoral concerns he addresses throughout the
            epistle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s invocation of grace and peace serves as a unifying message
            for a community divided by ethnic and theological tensions. This
            greeting reflects the inclusivity of the gospel, which brings
            together Jews and Gentiles as one people under Christ. This unity is
            a central theme in Galatians, particularly in Paul’s declaration
            that "there is neither Jew nor Greek... for you are all one in
            Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28).
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s salutation contrasts sharply with the message of the
            Judaizers, who sought to undermine the gospel of grace by imposing
            legalistic requirements. By invoking grace and peace, Paul reaffirms
            the gospel's foundation in God’s unmerited favor and its
            transformative power to bring peace. This contrast is evident in the
            subsequent verses, where Paul pronounces anathemas on those who
            preach a different gospel (Galatians 1:6-9).
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s greeting reveals his deep pastoral concern for the Galatians.
            Despite their wavering, he addresses them with the hope that they
            might return to the true gospel. Paul’s invocation is a prayer for
            their restoration, demonstrating that even in the face of their
            error, he desires their salvation and spiritual well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            The salutation attributes grace and peace equally to “God our Father
            and the Lord Jesus Christ.” The use of the single preposition "from"
            (apo) governs both divine names, demonstrating the shared source of
            these blessings. This grammatical structure places Christ on par
            with the Father, highlighting their unity in essence and function.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a Jew steeped in the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4), identifying anyone
            other than Yahweh as the source of divine blessings would be
            blasphemous unless that individual shared in Yahweh's identity. By
            invoking Christ alongside the Father, Paul unequivocally asserts
            Christ’s deity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only a divine being can bestow the unmerited favor of grace and the
            reconciliatory peace described in Paul's epistles. Paul’s
            prayer-wish for these blessings to flow from Christ affirms His
            ability and authority to act as the source of divine gifts. This
            reinforces the doctrine of Christ’s sufficiency and His exclusive
            role in the economy of salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Victorinus elaborates that “if it is through Christ, nothing further
            ought to be sought.” This reflects the principle of
            <em>solus Christus</em>
            (Christ alone), central to Pauline theology. Paul’s appeal to
            Christ’s sufficiency underscores that salvation is a complete work
            of God, leaving no room for human additions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Paul’s invocation of Christ as an act of divine worship.
            In Jewish theology, invocation (calling upon the name of the Lord)
            is a prerogative reserved for Yahweh. For Paul to direct such
            language toward Christ indicates his belief in Christ’s divine
            status.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is consistent with New Testament practices. In Acts 7:59-60,
            Stephen prays directly to Jesus, and in 1 Corinthians 1:2, Paul
            describes Christians as those who “call upon the name of our Lord
            Jesus Christ.” Both examples reflect a continuity with the Old
            Testament motif of invoking Yahweh while identifying Jesus as the
            recipient of such prayers.

            This verse, though nestled within the epistolary introduction,
            encapsulates the essence of Paul’s gospel. It reveals the voluntary
            self-giving of Christ, His substitutionary atonement, the
            eschatological deliverance accomplished through His death, and the
            Trinitarian foundation of this redemptive act. The themes presented
            here resonate deeply with Paul’s larger arguments in Galatians and
            the broader New Testament, positioning Christ’s sacrificial death as
            the cornerstone of Christian soteriology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase "Who gave Himself" highlights the voluntary nature of
            Christ’s atoning death. The reflexive pronoun "Himself" (Greek:
            ἑαυτὸν) stresses that Christ's sacrifice was self-initiated and not
            coerced. This is echoed in Jesus' own words in John 10:18: "No one
            takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord." Here, the New
            Testament affirms Christ’s active role in His mission of redemption.
            This voluntary self-offering aligns with the Old Testament
            sacrificial system, where the unblemished lamb was willingly offered
            for atonement (Leviticus 1:3).
          </p>
          <p>
            The voluntariness of Christ’s act underscores His unity with the
            Father. While some critics of penal substitutionary atonement (PSA)
            mischaracterize it as pitting an angry Father against a loving Son,
            Galatians 1:4 dispels such notions. Christ’s self-giving reflects
            not only His love but also the Father’s. As John 3:16 declares, “For
            God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.” The
            unity of purpose within the Trinity in securing salvation is
            foundational: the Father sends, and the Son gives Himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The substitutionary nature of Christ’s sacrifice is explicit in the
            phrase "for our sins" (Greek: ὑπὲρ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν). The
            preposition ὑπὲρ (huper) denotes representation or substitution, a
            central concept in Paul’s theology. Christ bore the penalty due to
            sinners, satisfying the demands of divine justice. This truth is
            corroborated by 2 Corinthians 5:21, where Paul writes, “He made Him
            who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the
            righteousness of God in Him.” The legal exchange—Christ taking our
            sins and imputing His righteousness to us—is the foundation of
            justification.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Old Testament foreshadowed this substitutionary work through the
            sacrificial system. The Day of Atonement, for instance, involved the
            high priest laying hands on the scapegoat, symbolically transferring
            Israel’s sins onto it before it was sent into the wilderness
            (Leviticus 16:21-22). Similarly, Isaiah 53:5-6 vividly portrays the
            Messiah as the one who “was pierced for our transgressions” and upon
            whom “the Lord has laid the iniquity of us all.” Galatians 1:4
            affirms that Christ fulfills these typologies, offering Himself as
            the ultimate guilt offering to atone for humanity’s sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Roman Catholic theologians like Robert Sungenis and Tim Staples
            deny that Christ bore the legal penalty for sins. However, Paul
            consistently emphasizes that Christ’s death is a penal,
            substitutionary sacrifice. Deuteronomy 21:22-23 establishes that
            those hanged on a tree are under God’s curse—a reality Paul
            explicitly applies to Christ in Galatians 3:13: “Christ redeemed us
            from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us.” This
            underscores the legal framework of Christ’s atonement, where He
            endures the penalty due to lawbreakers, thereby freeing them from
            divine condemnation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose clause, "that He might deliver us from this present evil
            age," highlights the eschatological dimension of Christ’s atonement.
            The verb "deliver" (Greek: ἐξαιρέω) conveys the idea of rescue,
            often used in contexts of liberation from peril or bondage (cf. Acts
            7:34). Paul presents Christ’s death as an act of cosmic rescue,
            delivering believers from the dominion of sin and Satan, which
            characterizes "this present evil age."
          </p>
          <p>
            This age, in Paul’s worldview, is marked by corruption, idolatry,
            and hostility toward God. It is under the dominion of “the god of
            this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4) and stands in contrast to the age to
            come inaugurated by Christ. By His death and resurrection, Christ
            not only secures individual salvation but also initiates the
            overthrow of this present evil order. The cross thus becomes the
            decisive event through which believers are transferred from the
            domain of darkness into the kingdom of God’s Son (Colossians 1:13).
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s eschatological framework is further illuminated by the
            Christus Victor motif, which emphasizes Christ’s victory over Satan,
            sin, and death. This triumph is intrinsically linked to PSA. In
            Colossians 2:14-15, Paul states that Christ disarmed the powers and
            authorities by canceling the certificate of debt that stood against
            us. The nullification of sin’s legal demands is the basis for
            Christ’s victory over the spiritual forces that held humanity in
            bondage. These two truths go hand in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase "according to the will of our God and Father" anchors
            Christ’s atoning work in the divine will. The Father’s role in the
            atonement is often misunderstood or caricatured in critiques of PSA.
            However, Galatians 1:4 presents the atonement as the fulfillment of
            the Father’s gracious purpose. This echoes passages like Isaiah
            53:10, which declares, “Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush
            Him; He has put Him to grief.” The Father’s will is not one of
            vindictive wrath but of redemptive love, aimed at reconciling
            sinners to Himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Trinitarian harmony in salvation is evident throughout
            Scripture. The Father sends the Son (John 3:16), the Son willingly
            lays down His life (John 10:18), and the Spirit applies the benefits
            of Christ’s work to believers (Romans 8:11). Far from presenting a
            divided Godhead, the doctrine of the atonement showcases the unified
            action of Father, Son, and Spirit in the economy of salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This unity also dispels critiques of PSA that portray it as a
            "cosmic child abuse" model, where the Father imposes suffering on an
            unwilling Son. Instead, the Father’s sending, the Son’s self-giving,
            and the Spirit’s application of redemption demonstrate a
            collaborative divine act of love and justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mention of Pontius Pilate in the Apostles’ Creed—“suffered under
            Pontius Pilate”—is not incidental. It underscores that Christ’s
            death occurred within the context of Roman jurisprudence,
            highlighting His condemnation by an earthly judge. This judicial
            process reflects God’s ordained means of executing wrath through
            human agents, as seen in passages like Romans 13:4, which describes
            civil authorities as “God’s servant, an avenger who carries out
            God’s wrath on the wrongdoer.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Christ’s trial before Pilate fulfills this divine pattern, as Jesus,
            though innocent, is condemned as a criminal. This legal condemnation
            underscores the substitutionary nature of His death: the righteous
            one suffers the penalty deserved by the unrighteous. The Heidelberg
            Catechism captures this beautifully, stating that Christ “though
            innocent, was condemned by an earthly judge, and so freed us from
            the severe judgment of God.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The biblical evidence provided thus far addresses the claim that PSA
            is a Reformation innovation, but patristic evidence can be cited to
            the contrary as well. Early church fathers affirmed key elements of
            PSA, even if they did not use the exact terminology. Irenaeus speaks
            of Christ offering His life as a ransom, satisfying divine justice
            (Against Heresies, Book 5). Athanasius, in On the Incarnation,
            describes Christ bearing the penalty of death on behalf of humanity.
            Gregory of Nazianzus emphasizes that Christ’s sacrifice fulfilled
            the demands of divine justice (Oration 45). These writings
            demonstrate that the foundational principles of PSA—substitution,
            satisfaction of divine justice, and deliverance from sin’s
            penalty—were integral to early Christian theology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just to cite a few more to put the claim to rest completely, Clement
            of Rome speaks of Christ’s blood as precious and given "for our
            salvation." He ties sin to death and identifies Christ’s suffering
            as redemptive, demonstrating the penal substitutionary nature of the
            atonement. Justin Martyr connects the curse of the law (Deuteronomy
            21:23) to Christ’s death, emphasizing that He bore the curse due to
            sinners. Eusebius of Caesarea explicitly states that Christ
            "suffered a penalty He did not owe but which we owed," a direct
            affirmation of PSA.
          </p>
          <p>
            This doctrine of the "great exchange" was articulated in the Epistle
            to Diognetus. The concept that Christ bore the sins of humanity and
            imputed His righteousness to believers. This is the foundation of
            justification: because Christ legally bore the penalty for sin,
            believers are declared righteous before God. This exchange—Christ’s
            righteousness for our sin—is the essence of the gospel and reflects
            the substitutionary nature of the atonement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternative atonement theories, such as the moral influence theory,
            emphasize Christ’s death as an example of love but neglects its
            judicial implications. However, the uniqueness of the cross lies in
            its dual role as a demonstration of love and a satisfaction of
            justice. Without the penal element, the moral significance of
            Christ’s sacrifice is undermined because it fails to address the
            guilt and legal standing of sinners before a holy God as Romans 3:26
            indicates: "It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so
            that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in
            Jesus."
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, we can see the eschatological framework Paul is working in.
            Christ’s atoning work is not only a personal rescue from sin but
            also liberation from the dominion of this age. By His death and
            resurrection, He has inaugurated the age to come, bringing believers
            into its life and reality even while they remain physically present
            in this world. This is known as the tension between the "already"
            and "not yet" aspects of salvation. While believers remain in the
            physical world, they spiritually belong to the age to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Believers are already experiencing the age to come. Eternal life,
            often spoken of as a future reality (e.g., John 3:15-16), is also a
            present possession for believers (John 5:24). Believers are said to
            have "passed out of death into life." Adoption as children of God is
            both present and future. Romans 8:15-23 highlights that believers
            are already adopted, crying out "Abba, Father," yet they await the
            full manifestation of their adoption, which is the redemption of
            their bodies. Ephesians 2:6 emphasizes that believers have been
            "raised up with Him and seated with Him in the heavenly places in
            Christ Jesus." This spiritual union with Christ allows believers to
            partake in the realities of the age to come while still navigating
            the challenges of this present age.
          </p>
          <p>
            By His death, Christ has defeated the rulers and powers of this age
            (Colossians 2:15). This victory is linked to the broader theme of
            cosmic deliverance, demonstrating that Christ’s work is
            comprehensive, impacting both personal salvation and the broader
            spiritual realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gift of the Holy Spirit is described as the "firstfruits"
            (Romans 8:23) and the guarantee of the believer’s inheritance
            (Ephesians 1:13-14). This gift enables believers to live out the
            values of the age to come while awaiting its full consummation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Romans 12:2 exhorts believers not to be conformed to this age but to
            be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This underscores the
            importance of aligning one’s thinking with the values of the age to
            come, rather than succumbing to the corrupted patterns of this
            world. And, while this present age is marked by suffering and decay,
            believers look forward to the full realization of their salvation.
            This hope fuels perseverance and faithfulness, as described in
            Romans 8:18-25.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, Galatians 1:4 encapsulates the gospel’s power to deliver
            believers from sin and the dominion of this present evil age.
            Christ’s work includes but extends beyond individual salvation to
            cosmic renewal. Believers are called to live in the tension of the
            "already and not yet," embodying the realities of the age to come
            while awaiting its full consummation. This eschatological
            perspective transforms the believer’s worldview, empowering them to
            resist conformity to this age and live in hope of eternal glory.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 5. <em>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</em></h2>
          <p>
            Galatians 1:5 is the end Paul’s salutation (1:1–5), a section that
            deviates significantly from his usual epistolary structure. While
            Paul’s greetings often include a prayer for grace and peace, as seen
            in Romans 1:7 and 1 Corinthians 1:3, this salutation uniquely
            incorporates a theological proclamation of the gospel. Verse 4
            highlights the sacrificial work of Christ, who “gave himself for our
            sins to rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will
            of our God and Father.” Verse 5 then functions as a response to this
            proclamation, attributing all glory to God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inclusion of a doxology in the salutation is uncharacteristic
            for Paul and reflects the theological gravity of the situation in
            Galatia. The false teachings of the Judaizers, which sought to add
            works of the law to faith in Christ, required Paul to emphasize from
            the outset the sufficiency of Christ's work and the singular
            worthiness of God to receive glory. This doxology, therefore, not
            only expresses Paul’s worship but also anticipates his polemic
            against the Galatian heresy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s doxology resonates with Old Testament expressions of praise,
            such as Psalm 41:13: “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from
            everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.” These doxologies often
            conclude significant sections of Scripture, marking a response to
            God’s covenantal faithfulness. Paul’s doxology similarly marks his
            response to the redemptive work of Christ, which fulfills God’s
            covenantal promises.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase "to whom be the glory" ascribes all glory to God,
            emphasizing His supreme worthiness of praise. The Greek term for
            "glory" (δόξα, doxa) carries connotations of honor, splendor, and
            divine radiance. This usage echoes the Old Testament concept of
            God’s <em>kavod</em> (Hebrew for glory), often associated with His
            manifest presence and unmatched sovereignty (Exod. 33:18; Isa. 6:3).
            By attributing glory to God alone, Paul underscores the exclusivity
            of divine worship and denies any human contribution to salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doxology in Galatians 1:5 parallels similar expressions in
            Paul’s other writings, such as Romans 11:36: “For from Him and
            through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever.
            Amen.” These statements emphasize the centrality of God’s glory in
            Paul’s theology and reflect his consistent practice of concluding
            theological reflections with worship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul’s emphasis on God’s glory directly counters the theological
            claims of the Judaizers. By advocating for adherence to the Mosaic
            law as a means of justification, they effectively sought to share
            God’s glory by suggesting human effort played a role in salvation.
            Paul’s declaration rejects this notion, affirming that all glory
            belongs to God because salvation is entirely His work (Eph. 2:8–9).
          </p>
          <p>
            This aligns with the Reformation principle
            <em>Soli Deo Gloria</em> ("Glory to God Alone"). This doctrine
            asserts that God is the sole recipient of glory in all aspects of
            creation and redemption. Paul’s emphasis on God’s glory reflects his
            broader theological conviction that salvation is entirely the work
            of God, from its initiation in divine election to its accomplishment
            in Christ’s atonement and application through the Spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            By attributing all glory to God, Paul implicitly warns against
            theological systems that detract from God’s glory by emphasizing
            human effort. The Galatians are reminded that salvation is entirely
            of God, leaving no room for boasting (Eph. 2:8–9). This serves as a
            pastoral challenge to guard against legalism and uphold the
            sufficiency of Christ’s work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase for "forevermore" (Greek: aiōnas tōn aiōnōn) is an
            emphatic expression of eternity. This language reflects the eternal
            nature of God’s glory and the everlasting scope of His redemptive
            work. The doxology thus extends beyond the immediate context of
            Galatians, pointing to the eschatological fulfillment of God’s
            kingdom, where His glory will be universally acknowledged (Phil.
            2:10–11; Rev. 5:13).
          </p>
          <p>
            The eschatological dimension of "forevermore" also emphasizes that
            the gospel is not merely a temporal solution to human sin but part
            of God’s eternal purpose. This stands in contrast to the Judaizers’
            focus on temporal observances of the law. Paul’s use of
            “forevermore” reminds the Galatians that their salvation is secure
            in Christ, grounded in the eternal will and glory of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            The verse concludes with “Amen”, a term derived from Hebrew (אָמֵן,
            meaning “truly” or “so be it”). In Jewish and Christian liturgical
            traditions, Amen functions as an affirmation of faith and a seal of
            truth. By including this term, Paul not only expresses his personal
            conviction but also invites the Galatians to join in this
            affirmation of God’s glory. The use of Amen emphasizes that doxology
            is not merely a theological statement but an act of communal

            Paul’s doxology reminds believers that true worship arises from a
            proper understanding of God’s character and works. The gospel truths
            presented in verses 3–4—God’s grace, Christ’s sacrifice, and the
            rescue from sin—should inspire worship. This principle challenges
            modern tendencies to divorce theology from worship, emphasizing that
            robust theology enriches adoration.
