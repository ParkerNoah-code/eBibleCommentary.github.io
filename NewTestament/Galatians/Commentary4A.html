            Augustine writes, "Cling to the faithful who are good, for there are
            believers who are evil--a deplorable situation. There are those who,
            though called believers, are not so... Seek the good; cleave to the
            good; be good. Do not be surprised at the large number of bad
            Christians who fill the church... They can exist along with us in
            the Church of this time, but they will not be able to remain in that
            assembly of saints which will be after the resurrection." (Sermons,
            The Fathers of the Church: A New Translation, vol 38, Sermon 223: A
            Vigil of Easter).

            Irenaeus writes, "And that not by the much-speaking of the law, but
            by the brevity of faith and love, men were to be saved, Isaiah says
            thus:
            <em
              >A word brief and short in righteousness: for a short word will
              God make in the whole world</em
            >. And therefore the apostle Paul says:
            <em>Love is the fulfilling of the law:</em> for he who loves God has
            fulfilled the law. Moreover the Lord, when He was asked which is the
            first commandment, said:
            <em
              >Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all
              thy strength. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy
              neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments</em
            >, He says, <em>all the law hangeth and the prophets</em>. So then
            by our faith in Him He has made our love to God and our neighbour to
            grow, making us godly and righteous and good. And therefore a
            <em>short word</em> has God made on the earth
            <em>in the world</em>." (<a

            John Fox writes, "Thus far our history of persecution has been
            confined principally to the pagan world. We come now to a period
            when persecution, under the guise of Christianity, committed more
            enormities than ever disgraced the annals of paganism. Disregarding
            the maxims and the spirit of the Gospel, the papal Church, arming
            herself with the power of the sword, vexed the Church of God and
            wasted it for several centuries, a period most appropriately termed
            in history, the 'dark ages'...
          </p>
          <p>
            Popery having brought various innovations into the Church, and
            overspread the Christian world with darkness and superstition, some
            few, who plainly perceived the pernicious tendency of such errors,
            determined to show the light of the Gospel in its real purity, and
            to disperse those clouds which artful priests had raised about it,
            in order to blind the people, and obscure its real brightness...
          </p>
          <p>
            Many persons of the reformed persuasion were, about this time,
            beaten, racked, scourged, and burnt to death, in several parts of
            France, but more particularly at Paris, Malda, and Limosin..." (<a

            Augustine writes, "For the devil cannot conquer or subdue any but
            those who are in league with sin; and therefore he is conquered in
            the name of Him who assumed humanity, and that without sin, that
            Himself being both Priest and Sacrifice, He might bring about the
            remission of sins, that is to say, might bring it about through the
            Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, by whom we are
            reconciled to God, the cleansing from sin being accomplished. For
            men are separated from God only by sins, from which we are in this
            life cleansed not by our own virtue, but by the divine compassion;
            through His indulgence, not through our own power. For, whatever
            virtue we call our own is itself bestowed upon us by His goodness.
            And we might attribute too much to ourselves while in the flesh,
            unless we lived in the receipt of pardon until we laid it down. This
            is the reason why there has been vouchsafed to us, through the
            Mediator, this grace, that we who are polluted by sinful flesh
            should be cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh. By this grace of
            God, wherein He has shown His great compassion toward us, we are
            both governed by faith in this life, and, after this life, are led
            onwards to the fullest perfection by the vision of immutable truth."

            >' the very will by which we believe is reckoned as a gift of God,
            because it arises out of the free will which we received at our
            creation. Let the objector, however, attentively observe that this
            will is to be ascribed to the divine gift, not merely because it
            arises from our free will, which was created naturally with us; but
            also because God acts upon us by the incentives of our perceptions,
            to will and to believe, either externally by evangelical
            exhortations, where even the commands of the law also do something,
            if they so far admonish a man of his infirmity that he betakes
            himself to the grace that justifies by believing; or internally,
            where no man has in his own control what shall enter into his
            thoughts, although it appertains to his own will to consent or to
            dissent." (<a

            Fulgentius writes, "I thank God that by his operation, you are the
            kind of men who contend very courageously and fervently on behalf of
            that grace by which we are saved. I am, however, saddened because
            some of our brothers, calling themselves Christian, strive to deny
            the Catholic faith. That is, they attirubte the gifts of God's grace
            to the power or merit of the human will, as if our effor, without
            God's help, might avail for obeying the divine command, and as if
            the command were God's only in the sense that he commanded us to
            work, but did not himself accomplish in us what he commanded...
            Therefore, the voluntary death of the soul produced penal death for
            the body... This grace of God, by which we are saved, is not given
            to anyone by virtue of preceding good merit... Therefore, this was
            accomplished by the grace of divine goodness, grace that was never
            bestowed in such a way that it might reveal some good merits in man,
            but was bestowed so that grace itself might confer merits on those
            who did not have any... Let us affirm that grace is given to no man
            because of past or future merits, but that all men's good merits are
            both begun and perfected by the gift and help of grace itself." (The
            Truth About Predestination and Grace, TFOTC, vol 126, 1.1, 4, 7, 8,
            14).

            Anselm writes, "As all things were created through the supreme
            Being, so all live through it.
          </p>
          <p>
            IT is certain, then, that through the supreme Nature whatever is not
            identical with it has been created. But no rational mind can doubt
            that all creatures live and continue to exist, so long as they do
            exist, by the sustenance afforded by that very Being through whose
            creative act they are endowed with the existence that they have.
            For, by a like course of reasoning to that by which it has been
            gathered that all existing beings exist through some one being,
            hence that being alone exists through itself, and others through
            another than themselves -- by a like course of reasoning, I say, it
            can be proved that whatever things live, live through some one
            being; hence that being alone lives through itself, and others
            through another than themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, since it cannot but be that those things which have been
            created live through another, and that by which they have been
            created lives through itself, necessarily, just as nothing has been
            created except through the creative, present Being, so nothing lives
            except through its preserving presence." (<a
