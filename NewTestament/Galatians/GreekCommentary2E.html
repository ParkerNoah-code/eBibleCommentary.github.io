        <h2>E. Justification by Faith Alone (2:15-21)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 15.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Ἡμεῖς φύσει Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί,</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί - This clause expresses pointedly the insolent
          contempt of the Pharisaic party for Gentiles, who did not belong to
          the holy nation nor inherit the Law and the Covenants. Yet in spite of
          these arrogant pretensions to superior sanctity (it is added) they
          were driven by the verdict of their own conscience to embrace the
          faith of Christ because they knew that no flesh could possibly be so
          perfect in obedience to Law as to be thereby justified.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 16.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >εἰδότες ὅτι οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ἔργων νόμου, ἐὰν μὴ διὰ
            πίστεως Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ, καὶ ἡμεῖς εἰς χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐπιστεύσαμεν,
            ἵνα δικαιωθῶμεν ἐκ πίστεως χριστοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων νόμου· διότι οὐ
            δικαιωθήσεται ἐξ ἔργων νόμου πᾶσα σάρξ.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος - Two methods of seeking justification in the
          sight of God are here distinguished. The former took account of
          nothing but stedfast obedience to the law of God. Before his
          conversion Paul knew no other: he had been taught by his legal
          training to base his standard of right and wrong entirely on the
          revealed law, to find in it the sole guide of conscience, and to
          measure righteousness by conformity to its commandments alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But his view of God’s judgment had been profoundly modified by his
          conversion. He had learnt on the one hand from the teaching of Christ
          how impossible it was for man to attain to perfect righteousness,
          seeing that God claims not only obedience to the letter of the law,
          but an allegiance of the heart too thorough to be attainable by human
          infirmity. But on the other hand he knew now that God is a loving
          Father in Christ, ever seeking out His erring children that He may win
          them back, ever ready to temper strict justice with infinite mercy,
          and waiting only for the first response of imperfect faith and
          imperfect repentance, so they be at all sincere, to blot out a guilty
          past, and pronounce a favourable judgment on the sinner. He perceived
          that there is room in the judgment of God for another element beside
          strict justice, viz., the mercy of the judge, and that a prisoner,
          however clear may be his guilt on the evidence of his life, may
          nevertheless be assured of pardon and acceptance by throwing himself
          in humble trust on that mercy. In the Epistles of Paul accordingly
          justification acquired a new meaning, becoming equivalent to
          acceptance before God, and the term righteousness was applied to the
          merciful acquittal of the guilty but penitent offender.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἐξ ἔργων νόμου - The clause defines an acquittal on the merits of the
          case alone, based on a life of holy obedience, while διὰ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ
          χριστοῦ points to faith in Christ as the appointed channel of God’s
          mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἐπιστεύσαμεν - Here, as in Romans 13:11, this verb denotes the act of
          embracing the faith. Jewish Christians had by their conversion
          declared the hopelessness of their position under the Law without
          Christ. Faith in him was (they saw) the only means of obtaining
          justification.
        </p>
        <p>
          διότι - This clause corroborates the verdict of conscience and
          experience by the authority of Scripture, for it adopts the language
          of Psalms 142:2 LXX, οὐ δικαιωθήσεται ἐνώπιόν σου πᾶς ζῶν, with only
          some verbal alterations suggested by the context of the Epistle. As
          two kinds of justification have been mentioned, the clause ἐξ ἔργων
          νόμου is required here to make it clear that the justification to
          which the Psalm refers was legal, the words ἐνώπιόν σου are dropped as
          needless in this context, and πᾶσα σάρξ is substituted for πᾶς ζῶν in
          order to show that the Psalm referred to earthly life. The passage is
          quoted with corresponding verbal changes in Romans 3:20.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 17.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Εἰ δέ, ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν χριστῷ, εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ
            ἁμαρτωλοί, ἆρα χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος; Μὴ γένοιτο.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Εἰ δέ, ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν χριστῷ, εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἁμαρτωλοί
          - The last verse arrived at the conclusion that Jewish converts by
          their own act condemned themselves to be guilty of a broken law. The
          argument now proceeds on this assumption “ If it be true (as has been
          shown) that we by seeking to be justified in Christ were found to be
          ourselves also sinners as well as the Gentiles if our sin was then
          discovered, and it be admitted that confession of sin lies at the root
          of all Christian life, what then is the attitude of Christ toward
          sin?”
        </p>
        <p>
          ἆρα χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος - This clause is clearly interrogative,
          and the true reading is ἆρα, not ἄρα (inferential). For here, as
          always elsewhere in Pauline language, μὴ γένοιτο repudiates a
          monstrous suggestion, put forward in the form of a question, the mere
          statement of which is repugnant to the moral sense. It was objected to
          this doctrine of God’s free grace in Christ to guilty sinners that it
          held out a license to sin by doing away the wholesome restraints of
          the Law, and so encouraged men to continue in sin by its assurance of
          pardon. The fallacy is here dismissed with scorn on the strength of
          the very nature of Christ, but is more fully exposed in the sixth
          chapter to the Romans.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 18.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Εἰ γὰρ ἃ κατέλυσα, ταῦτα πάλιν οἰκοδομῶ, παραβάτην ἐμαυτὸν
            συνίστημι.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 19.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Ἐγὼ γὰρ διὰ νόμου νόμῳ ἀπέθανον, ἵνα θεῷ ζήσω.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Ἐγὼ - The stress laid on the personal pronoun shows that Paul is here
          referring to the facts of his personal history. He singles out his own
          conversion for the sake of the crucial example which it afforded of
          the difficulty of reconciling the commands of Christ with the
          traditional law of Israel, for he was actually bearing the commission
          of the high priest, and carrying out the orders of the Sanhedrim when
          Christ met him in the way and laid His commands upon him. He had to
          choose between the two: and at Christ’s word he flung up his office
          and renounced for ever the service of the Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          διὰ νόμου - through the law. The translation of these words in our
          versions through the law seems to me fatal to the sense: for the death
          to Law which is here recorded was not due to the instrumentality of
          Law, but was the immediate effect of the vision and words of Christ;
          and the express object of this reference to the conversion of Saul is
          to show how union with Christ annihilates the authority of an outward
          law. διὰ νόμου is really akin to διὰ γράμματος καὶ περιτομῆς in Romans
          2:27, and to διʼ ἀκροβυστίας in Romans 4:11. In all these cases διά
          denotes the environment, whether of the letter, of circumcision, of
          uncircumcision, or of law, which was subsisting at the time. Saul was
          on official duty, surrounded by the circumstances and machinery of Law
          when Christ stayed him, and he became at once dead to the claim of Law
          upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          νόμου νόμῳ ἀπέθανον - These words give a vivid description of the
          spiritual revulsion produced by his conversion in the heart of Saul.
          Whereas, hitherto, his whole mind had been set on fulfilling the whole
          Law, and he had counted its obligations all in all to him, he now
          entirely renounced the duty of obedience to its commands and
          repudiated its authority. And just as death works a final change, and
          leaves behind an indelible effect, so did his conversion affix a
          permanent stamp of lifelong change on all his after years: thenceforth
          he served another Master, owned absolute obedience to His will,
          listened for His inward voice or outward revelation, and drank of His
          Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          νόμῳ - The absence of the article before νόμῳ is noteworthy; whereas
          the Law of Moses, being the one revealed Law, is always designated the
          Law ( ὁ νόμος), νόμῳ denotes law in the abstract, so that this clause
          comprehends emancipation from all control of external law. The freedom
          was, of course, purely spiritual: Paul continued fully to acknowledge
          the duty of outward submission to all duly ordained authority, but
          maintained the absolute independence of his spirit and conscience from
          its dictates.
        </p>
        <p>
          ἵνα θεῷ ζήσω - This clause adds the motive for this death to Law. It
          was a veritable death unto life: Saul had striven in vain to obtain
          life before God by zealous fulfilment of every commandment; he now
          acknowledged his utter failure, surrendered all the pride and ambition
          of his life, and cast himself in humble trust at the feet of Jesus to
          receive from Him that precious life which he had sought in vain by his
          most zealous efforts under the Law.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 20.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Χριστῷ συνεσταύρωμαι· ζῶ δέ, οὐκέτι ἐγώ, ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμοὶ χριστός· ὃ
            δὲ νῦν ζῶ ἐν σαρκί, ἐν πίστει ζῶ τῇ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ, τοῦ
            ἀγαπήσαντός με καὶ παραδόντος ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Χριστῷ συνεσταύρωμαι - The Greek order throws special emphasis on
          Χριστῷ : union with Christ became from that time the central feature
          of his life; it entailed in the beginning a fellowship with his
          crucifixion, a real crucifixion of heart and will. By this figure he
          describes the intense agony of spiritual conflict, the crushing load
          of shame and bitter remorse which he underwent during the three days
          of darkness and silent despair that followed his vision of the Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          ζῶ δέ - and I live. I can perceive no ground for rendering δέ
          nevertheless (A.V.) or yet (R.V.). There is no contrast here between
          the life and the previous death: on the contrary, the life is
          presented as the direct outcome of the death. As the resurrection of
          Christ was the sequel of the crucifixion, so Paul was joined to Christ
          in death that he might be joined to Him in spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          οὐκέτι ἐγώ - The new life is no longer, like the former, dependent on
          the struggling efforts of a mere man to draw near to God in his own
          righteousness. Christ Himself is its source, as the vine is the source
          of life to the branches.
        </p>
        <p>
          ὃ δὲ νῦν ζῶ - but in that I live. Our versions make this = ἣν ζωὴν ζῶ;
          but it seems to me more accordant with the context and with Greek
          forms of expression to make ὅ = in that, as it is rendered by A.V. in
          Romans 6:10. Two instances of this adverbial use of ὅ for a connecting
          particle have been already noted in this Epistle (Galatians 1:7;
          2:10). Paul is here accounting for the fact that he now possesses
          spiritual life, though still in the flesh and subject to motions of
          sin in his members: it belongs to him in virtue of his faith in the
          Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          με καὶ παραδόντος ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ - The previous clauses have
          expressed the intimate personal union between the spirit of Paul and
          his Divine Master. In harmony with that view an exclusive personal
          aspect is presented of the love of Christ and of His sacrifice on the
          Cross, as though Paul himself had been their sole object.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 21.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Οὐκ ἀθετῶ τὴν χάριν τοῦ θεοῦ· εἰ γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη, ἄρα
            χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          διὰ νόμου - Law was never, like faith, instrumental to justification
          (cf. Galatians 2:16). Accordingly, Paul never speaks of justification
          through Law, but either ἐκ νόμου or ἐν νόμῳ. Here, as in Galatians
          2:19, διὰ νόμου really denotes a legal environment, and the verse
          argues that if righteousness was really within men’s reach under a
          legal dispensation, then there was no occasion for the death of Christ
          at all.
