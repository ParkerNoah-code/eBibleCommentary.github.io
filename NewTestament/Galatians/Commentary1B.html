            Ver 6.
            <em
              >I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in
              the grace of Christ to a different “good news”,</em

          <p>
            <em>I wonder</em>. He commences by administering a rebuke, though a
            somewhat milder one than they deserved; but his greatest severity of
            language is directed, as we shall see, against the false apostles.
            He charges them with turning aside, not only from his gospel, but
            from Christ; for it was impossible for them to retain their
            attachment to Christ, without acknowledging that he has graciously
            delivered us from the bondage of the law. But such a belief cannot
            be reconciled with those notions respecting the obligation of
            ceremonial observance which the false apostles inculcated. They were
            <em>removed from</em> Christ; not that they entirely rejected
            Christianity, but that the corruption of their doctrines was such as
            to leave them nothing more than an imaginary Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, in our own times, the Papists, choosing to have a divided and
            mangled Christ, have none, and are therefore "removed from Christ."
            They are full of superstitions, which are directly at variance with
            the nature of Christ. Let it be carefully observed, that we are
            <em>removed from</em> Christ, when we fall into those views which
            are inconsistent with his mediatorial office; for light can have no
            fellowship with darkness.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the same principle, he calls it
            <em>another gospel</em>, that is, a gospel different from the true
            one. And yet the false apostles professed that they preached the
            gospel of Christ; but, mingling with it their own inventions, by
            which its principal efficacy was destroyed, they held a false,
            corrupt, and spurious gospel. By using the present tense, ("ye are
            removed") he appears to say that they were only in the act of
            failing. As if he had said, "I do not yet say that ye have been
            removed; for then it would be more difficult to return to the right
            path. But now, at the critical moment, do not advance a single step,
            but instantly retreat."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>From Christ, who called you by grace</em>. Others read it, "from
            him who called you by the grace of Christ," understanding it to
            refer to the Father; but the reading which we have followed is more
            simple. When he says that they were called by Christ through grace,
            this tends to heighten the criminality of their ingratitude. To
            revolt from the Son of God under any circumstances, is unworthy and
            disgraceful; but to revolt from him, after being invited to partake
            salvation by grace, is more eminently base. His goodness to us
            renders our ingratitude to him more dreadfully heinous.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>So soon</em>. When it is considered how <em>soon</em> they had
            discovered a want of steadfastness, their guilt is still further
            heightened. A proper season, indeed, for departing from Christ
            cannot be imagined. But the fact, that no sooner had Paul left them
            than the Galatians were led away from the truth, inferred still
            deeper blame. As the consideration of the grace by which they had
            been called was adduced to aggravate their ingratitude, so the
            circumstance of the time when they were removed is now adduced to
            aggravate their levity.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 7.
            <em
              >but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who
              trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Which is not another thing</em>. Some explain it thus, "though
            there is not another gospel;" as if it were a sort of correction of
            the Apostle's language, to guard against the supposition that there
            were more gospels than one. So far as the explanation of the words
            is concerned, I take a more simple view of them; for he speaks
            contemptuously of the doctrine of the false apostles, as being
            nothing else than a mass of confusion and destruction. As if he had
            said, "What do those persons allege? On what grounds do they attack
            the doctrine which I have delivered? They merely trouble you, and
            subvert the gospel. They do nothing more." But it amounts to the
            same meaning; for this, too, I acknowledge, is a correction of the
            language he had used about <em>another gospel</em>. He declares that
            it is not a gospel, but a mere disturbance. All I intended to say
            was, that, in my opinion, the word <em>another</em> means another
            thing. It resembles strongly the expression in common use, "this
            amounts to nothing, but that you wish to deceive."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And wish to pervert</em>. He charges them with the additional
            crime of doing an injury to Christ, by endeavoring to subvert his
            gospel. Subversion is an enormous crime. It is worse than
            corruption. And with good reason does he fasten on them this charge.
            When the glow of justification is ascribed to another, and a snare
            is laid for the consciences of men, the Savior no longer occupies
            his place, and the doctrine of the gospel is utterly ruined.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>The gospel of Christ</em>. To know what are the leading points
            of the gospel, is a matter of unceasing importance. When these are
            attacked, the gospel is destroyed. When he adds the words, of
            Christ, this may be explained in two ways; either that it has come
            from Christ as its author, or that it purely exhibits Christ. The
            apostle's reason for employing that expression unquestionably was to
            describe the true and genuine gospel, which alone is worthy of the
            name.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 8.
            <em
              >But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
              any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him

            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>But though we</em>. As he proceeds in defending the authority of
            his doctrine, his confidence swells. First of all, he declares that
            the doctrine which he had preached is the only gospel, and that the
            attempt to set it aside is highly criminal. But then he was aware,
            the false apostles might object: "We will not yield to you in our
            desire to maintain the gospel, or in those feelings of respect for
            it which we are accustomed to cherish." Just as, at the present day,
            the Papists describe in the strongest terms the sacredness with
            which they regard the gospel, and kiss the very name with the
            deepest reverence, and yet, when brought to the trial, are found to
            persecute fiercely the pure and simple doctrine of the gospel.
            Accordingly, Paul does not rest satisfied with this general
            declaration, but proceeds to define what the gospel is, and what it
            contains, and declares boldly that his doctrine is the true gospel;
            so as to resist all further inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of what avail was it to profess respect for the gospel, and not to
            know what it meant? With Papists, who hold themselves bound to
            render implicit faith, that might be perfectly sufficient; but with
            Christians, where there is no knowledge, there is no faith. That the
            Galatians, who were otherwise disposed to obey the gospel, might not
            wander hither and thither, and "find no rest for the sole of their
            foot" (Genesis 8:9), Paul enjoins them to stand steadfastly by his
            doctrine. He demands such unhesitating belief of his preaching, that
            he pronounces a curse on all who dared to contradict it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here it is not a little remarkable, that he begins with himself;
            for thus he anticipates a slander with which his enemies would have
            loaded him. "You wish to have everything which comes from you
            received without hesitation, because it is your own." To show that
            there is no foundation for such a statement, he instantly surrenders
            the right of advancing anything against his own doctrine. He claims
            no superiority, in this respect, over other men, but justly demands
            from all, equally with himself, subjection to the word of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Or an angel from heaven</em>. In order to destroy more
            completely the pretensions of the false apostles, he rises so high
            as to speak of angels; and, on the supposition that they taught a
            different doctrine, he does not satisfy himself with saying that
            they were not entitled to be heard, but declares that they ought to
            be held accursed. Some may think, that it was absurd to engage in a
            controversy with angels about his doctrine; but a just view of the
            whole matter will enable any one to perceive, that this part of the
            apostle's proceedings was proper and necessary. It is impossible, no
            doubt, for angels from heaven to teach anything else than the
            certain truth of God. But when the credit due to doctrines which God
            had revealed concerning the salvation of men was the subject of
            controversy, he did not reckon it enough to disclaim the judgment of
            men, without declining, at the same time, the authority of angels.
          </p>
          <p>
            And thus, when he pronounces a curse on angels who should teach any
            other doctrine though his argument is derived from an impossibility,
            it is not superfluous. This exaggerated language must, have
            contributed greatly to strengthen the confidence in Paul's
            preaching. His opponents, by employing the lofty titles of men,
            attempted to press hard on him and on his doctrine. He meets them by
            the bold assertion, that even angels are unable to shake his
            authority. This is no disparagement to angels. To promote the glory
            of God by every possible means was the design of their creation. He
            who endeavors, in a pious manner, to accomplish this object, by an
            apparently desrespectful mention of their name, detracts nothing
            from their high rank. This language not only exhibits, in an
            impressive manner, the majesty of the word of God, but yields, also,
            a powerful confirmation to our faith while, in reliance on that
            word, we feel ourselves at liberty to treat even angels with
            defiance and scorn. When he says, "let him be accursed," the meaning
            must be, "let him be held by you as accursed." In expounding 1
            Corinthians 12:3, we had occasion to speak of the word accursed.
            Here it denotes cursing.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 9.
            <em
              >As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches
              to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him
              be cursed.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Let him be cursed.</em> Paul repeats the curse, directing it now
            upon other persons. Before, he cursed himself, his brethren, and an
            angel from heaven. "Now," he says, "if there are any others who
            preach a gospel different from that you have received from us, let
            them also be accursed." Paul herewith curses and excommunicates all
            false teachers including his opponents. He is so worked up that he
            dares to curse all who pervert his Gospel. Would to God that this
            terrible pronouncement of the Apostle might strike fear into the
            hearts of all who pervert the Gospel of Paul.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galatians might say: "Paul, we do not pervert the Gospel you
            have brought unto us. We did not quite understand it. That is all.
            Now these teachers who came after you have explained everything so
            beautifully." This explanation the Apostle refuses to accept. They
            must add nothing; they must correct nothing. "What you received from
            me is the genuine Gospel of God. Let it stand. If any man brings any
            other gospel than the one I brought you, or promises to deliver
            better things than you have received from me, let him be accursed."
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of this emphatic denunciation so many accept the pope as
            the supreme judge of the Scriptures. "The Church," they say, "chose
            only four gospels. The Church might have chosen more. Therefore the
            Church is above the Gospel." With equal force one might argue: "I
            approve the Scriptures. Therefore I am above the Scriptures. John
            the Baptist confessed Christ. Hence he is above Christ." Paul
            subordinates himself, all preachers, all the angels of heaven,
            everybody to the Sacred Scriptures. We are not the masters, judges,
            or arbiters, but witnesses, disciples, and confessors of the
            Scriptures, whether we be pope, Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Paul, or
            an angel from heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>As we said before</em>. Observe the expression -- ye have
            received; for he uniformly insists, that they must not regard the
            gospel as something unknown, existing in the air, or in their own
            imaginations. He exhorts them to entertain a firm and serious
            conviction, that the doctrine which they had received and embraced
            is the true gospel of Christ. Nothing can be more inconsistent with
            the nature of faith than a feeble, wavering assent. What, then, must
            be the consequence, if ignorance of the nature and character of the
            gospel shall lead to hesitation? Accordingly he enjoins them to
            regard as devils those who shall dare to bring forward a gospel
            different from his, -- meaning by <em>another gospel</em>, one to
            which the inventions of other men are added; for the doctrine of the
            false apostles was not entirely contrary, or even different, from
            that of Paul, but corrupted by false additions.
          </p>
          <p>
            To what poor subterfuges do the Papists resort, in order to escape
            from the Apostle's declaration! First, they tell us, that we have
            not in our possession the whole of Paul's preaching, and cannot know
            what it contained, unless the Galatians who heard it shall be raised
            from the dead, in order to appear as witnesses. Next, they assert,
            that it is not every kind of addition which is forbidden, but that
            other gospels only are condemned. What Paul's doctrine was, so far
            as it concerns us to know, may be learned with sufficient clearness
            from his writings. Of this gospel, it is plain, the whole of Popery
            is a dreadful perversion. And from the nature of the case, we remark
            in conclusion, it is manifest that any spurious doctrine whatever is
            at variance with Paul's preaching; so that these cavils will avail
            them nothing.

            <em>Him who called you</em>. That which inclines some to think that
            Paul meant himself, was his instrumentality in the conversion of
            these Galatians; and his complaints of them in this Epistle, for
            their deserting his doctrine, and alienation from him; but then the
            substantive to the participle must be understood, and the call must
            be understood of the external call only, by the ministry of the
            word.

            It therefore seems rather to be understood of God; the apostles
            generally ascribe calling to God, Galatians 5:8; 1 Thessalonians
            5:24; 2 Thessalonians 2:14; 1 Peter 1:2, 15; 2 Peter 1:3. Nor does
            it seem proper to refer the action to Christ, because the apostles
            ordinarily ascribe calling to the First Person in the Trinity,
            calling us by Christ, as Romans 8:30; 2 Thessalonians 2:13, 14, 16;
            2 Timothy 1:9; 1 Peter 5:10; besides, the grace of Christ is here
            made the term to which they are called.

            Though this would supply the participle with a substantive in the
            text, yet it seems both too remote, and also to alter the sense of
            the text; making it to run thus, from "Christ that called you unto
            grace," instead of "him that called you into the grace of Christ."
            By which grace the apostle doubtless means not the doctrine of the
            gospel only, though that be sometimes called grace, but all the
            benefits of the gospel, justification, reconciliation, adoption;
            which are all properly called the grace of Christ, as being the
            purchase of his blood.

            <em>To a different “good news.”</em> Their objection to Paul's
            Gospel is identical to that recorded in Acts 15 to the effect that
            it was not enough for the Galatians to believe in Christ, or to be
            baptized, but that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command
            them to keep the law of Moses, for "except ye be circumcised after
            the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved" (Acts 15:1). As though
            Christ were a workman who had begun a building and left it for Moses
            to finish.

            <em>There isn’t another good news</em>. From the Book from Genesis
            to Revelation there is only one gospel-that first preached in the
            Garden of Eden when the message went forth that the Seed of the
            woman should bruise Satan’s head (Genesis 3:15). That was the
            gospel, salvation through the coming Christ, the Son of God born of
            a woman.

            Abraham was given the same gospel. When God had given the word, “In
            thy seed [which is Christ] shall all the nations of the earth be
            blessed.” That was the gospel, that all nations were to be blessed
            through Christ, the Seed of Abraham. And “Abraham believed God, and
            it was counted unto him for righteousness” (Romans 4:3). He was
            justified by faith because he believed the gospel.

            David, stained with sin, the twin sins of adultery and murder,
            cries, “Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
            delightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken
            spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise”
            (Psalms 51:16-17). “Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash
            me, and I shall be whiter than snow” (Psalms 51:7). And there is
            only one way a poor sinner can be purged, and that is by the
            precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. David looked on in faith to
            the Christ, the Son of God, and his hope was in this one gospel.

            Marius Victorinus comments, "The gospel Paul announces is sure: that
            Christ is the Son of God, the power of God for salvation to all that
            believe, to the Greeks and to the Jews—and nothing besides! In fact,
            all hope for salvation and for the grace of God pertaining to us
            lies in faith pertaining to Christ, to the effect that we would
            believe he is the Son of God, that he suffered for our sake and rose
            again, from which we too might arise with the forgiveness of sins.
            This is the true gospel that Paul announces. Therefore, if anyone
            adds on something else—like Judaism, circumcision, sabbath
            observance, and other things of this sort—he is sinning and is a
            stranger to the truth." (<a

            The Glossa Ordinaria says, "The canonical books have been brought
            about through the dictation of the Holy Spirit. It is not known,
            however, at which time or by which authors the non-canonical or
            apocryphal books were produced. Since, nevertheless, they are very
            good and useful, and nothing is found in them which contradicts the
            canonical books, the church reads them and permits them to be read
            by the faithful for devotion and edification. Their authority,
            however, is not considered adequate for proving those things which
            come into doubt or contention, or for confirming the authority of
            ecclesiastical dogma, as blessed Jerome states in his prologue to
            Judith and to the books of Solomon. But the canonical books are of
            such authority that whatever is contained therein is held to be true
            firmly and indisputably, and likewise that which is clearly
            demonstrated from them. For just as in philosophy a truth is known
            through reduction to self-evident first principles, so too, in the
            writings handed down from holy teachers, the truth is known, as far
            as those things that must be held by faith, through reduction to the
            canonical scriptures that have been produced by divine revelation,
            which can contain nothing false. Hence, concerning them Augustine
            says to Jerome: To those writers alone who are called canonical I
            have learned to offer this reverence and honor: I hold most firmly
            that none of them has made an error in writing. Thus if I encounter
            something in them which seems contrary to the truth, I simply think
            that the manuscript is incorrect, or I wonder whether the translator
            has discovered what the word means, or whether I have understood it
            at all. But I read other writers in this way: however much they
            abound in sanctity or teaching, I do not consider what they say true
            because they have judged it so, but rather because they have been
            able to convince me from those canonical authors, or from probable
            arguments, that it agrees with the truth." (<a

            Thomas Aquinas comments, "Now, a teaching passed on by a man can be
            changed and revoked by another man who knows better, as one
            philosopher refutes the sayings of another... But a teaching that
            comes directly from God can be nullified neither by man nor angel.
            Hence if a man or an angel were to state anything contrary to what
            has been taught by God, such a statement would not contradict God’s
            teaching, so as to void or destroy it; rather, God’s teaching would
            be against him... Hence the Apostle says that the dignity of the
            Gospel teaching, which has come directly from God, is so great that
            if a man or even an angel preached another Gospel besides that which
            he has preached among them, he is anathema, i.e., must be rejected
            and expelled...nothing is to be taught except what is contained,
            either implicitly or explicitly, in the Gospels and epistles and
            Sacred Scripture. For Sacred Scripture and the Gospels announce that
            Christ must be believed explicitly. Hence whatever is contained
            therein implicitly and fosters its teaching and faith in Christ can
            be preached and taught. Therefore, when he says, besides that which
            you have received, he means by adding something completely alien:
            'If any, man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the
            plagues written in this book' (Rev 22:18). And 'Neither add
            anything,' i.e., contrary or alien, 'nor diminish' (Deut 12:32)."

            John Calvin comments, "Accordingly he enjoins them to regard as
            devils those who shall dare to bring forward a gospel different from
            his, — meaning by another gospel, one to which the inventions of
            other men are added; for the doctrine of the false apostles was not
            entirely contrary, or even different, from that of Paul, but
            corrupted by false additions." (<a

            μετατίθεσθε - you are removing [deserting]. The agitators had not
            yet achieved any decisive success, though the Galatians were
            disposed to lend too ready an ear to their suggestions. It was not
            so much their actual progress, as the evidence afforded of the
            instability of the Galatian faith, that excited misgivings in the
            mind of Paul (cf. Galatians 4:11; Galatians 4:20); he regarded the
            movement as merely a little leaven, and had not lost his confidence
            in the personal loyalty of his converts and the general soundness of
            their faith (Galatians 5:9-10, Galatians 6:17).
          </p>

          <p>
            τοῦ καλέσαντος - the one [him] who called. The Gospel call proceeded
            from God, like those to Abraham and the ancient servants and people
            of God; the Epistles of Paul invariably attribute it to Him (cf.
            Galatians 1:15), not to His human instruments.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἐν χάριτι - in [the] grace. This is evidently not εἰς τὴν χάριν
            (into the grace of Christ, A.V.), but records the spirit of Divine
            love which prompted the call. God, of His grace in Christ, sent
            forth the Gospel to the Galatians by the hands of Paul and Barnabas.
          </p>

          <p>
            ἕτερον - a different. This passage brings out forcibly the different
            meaning of ἕτερος and ἄλλος. ἕτερος is primarily the other of two,
            ἄλλος another of several. Hence ἕτερος fixes attention on two
            objects exclusively (cf. τὸν ἕτερον in Galatians 6:4); here it marks
            the essential difference between the true and the spurious Gospel,
            distinguishing the latter as quite a different Gospel.

            ὃ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλο - but [which] is not another [Good News]. The
            translation of this clause in A.V. and R.V. (which is not another)
            has caused great embarrassment by its apparent identification of the
            spurious Gospel with the true. Lightfoot pleads ingeniously that
            ἄλλο may mean another besides the true Gospel, and so interprets the
            clause to mean that it is no Gospel at all; but this will hardly be
            accepted by most other scholars. The American revisers suggest the
            rendering which is nothing else than. But these difficulties arise
            from making ὅ the subject of the sentence: surely it is in fact a
            connecting adverb (touching which, as to which, whereas), as it is
            again in Galatians 2:10, and probably in Galatians 2:20. If the
            clause be rendered, whereas there is no other Gospel (i.e., than the
            true), the sense becomes perfectly clear, and it forms an
            appropriate introduction to the succeeding anathemas by its emphatic
            testimony to the one true Gospel.
          </p>

          <p>
            εἰ μή τινές εἰσιν... - only [but] there are some... This clause
            qualifies the former “there is no other Gospel,” only a spurious
            semblance (see εἰ μή Galatians 1:19).
          </p>

          <p>
            τινές - some. There is a studied vagueness in this and other
            references to the agitators. They were evidently not Galatian
            Christians, but strangers from abroad, whom the Apostle treats with
            real or affected contempt.

            ἡμεῖς - we. Paul here associates with himself the colleagues
            Barnabas, Silas, Timothy, who had combined with him to preach the
            Gospel. He desires to impress on his disciples that the controversy
            is not between one teacher and another, but between truth and
            falsehood: no minister of Christ, not even an angel, can alter the
            truth in Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            ἀνάθεμα - accursed. The two derivatives, ἀνάθημα and ἀνάθεμα, are
            both employed in the LXX and N.T. in different senses. ἀνάθημα
            serves, as in other Greek authors, to denote a temple offering,
            statue, or ornament (cf. 2Ma 9:16, Luke 21:5), while ἀνάθεμα is
            restricted to the Hebrew conception of an offering devoted under a
            solemn vow to death or destruction (Leviticus 27:28, Joshua 7:1,
            Acts 23:14). The Epistles of Paul attach to the word the idea of
            spiritual death. The significant addition ἀπὸ τοῦ Χριστοῦ in Romans
            9:3 associates with it the further idea of separation from Christ,
            and consequent loss of all Christian blessings and means of grace.
            It does not, like excommunication, pronounce a judicial sentence on
            particular convicted offenders, but solemnly affirms general laws of
            the spiritual kingdom, e.g., in 1 Corinthians 16:22, any who love
            not the Lord, here any who tamper with the truth of the Gospel, are
            pronounced outcasts from the faith, and dead to the Spirit of
            Christ.

            προειρήκαμεν - we have forewarned you of late [said before]. The
            contrast between this plural and the singular λέγω proves that Paul
            is here referring, not to previous warnings of his own by letter,
            but to joint warnings given by his companions Silas and Timothy as
            well as himself during his visit to the Churches. He never speaks of
            himself in the plural number.
          </p>

          <p>
            ὡς προειρήκαμεν, καὶ ἄρτι - as we have forewarned you of late, I say
            again. Our versions interpret προειρήκαμεν we have said before and
            καὶ ἄρτι πάλιν λέγω so say I now again. But Greek usage forbids this
            antithesis between προ. and ἄρτι. Προλέγειν means to forewarn, not
            to say in time past (cf. 2 Corinthians 13:2, Galatians 5:21, 1
            Thessalonians 3:4); while ἄρτι is used indifferently of recent or of
            present time. In Matthew 9:18, 1 Thessalonians 3:6 it means of late,
            in Matthew 26:53, John 13:7; John 13:37; John 16:12; John 16:31, 1
            Corinthians 13:12; 1 Corinthians 16:7 it means now, by way of
            contrast with the future. Ἄρτι cannot therefore be used to contrast
            the present time with the immediate past. The words καὶ ἄρτι belong
            really to the preceding clause, and contain a reminder how recent
            had been the warnings which the Apostle is repeating. Since the
            rendering of John 9:25 Whereas I was blind, now I see appears to
            contradict this view of ἄρτι, it may be well to point out that ὤν
            does not mean whereas I was, but that the speaker's real meaning
            was, I being (sc., by nature) blind now see. The true rendering is
            of some historical importance, as evidence that warnings on the
            subject of circumcision had been given to the Galatians by Paul and
            his companions during a recent visit.
