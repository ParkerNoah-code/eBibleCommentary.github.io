            Lyrics:<br /><br />
            Before the throne of God above<br />
            I have a strong and perfect plea<br />
            A great High Priest whose name is love<br />
            Who ever lives and pleads for me<br />
            My name is graven on His hands<br />
            My name is written on His heart<br />
            I know that while in heav'n He stands<br />
            No tongue can bid me thence depart<br />
            No tongue can bid me thence depart<br /><br />
            When Satan tempts me to despair<br />
            And tells me of the guilt within<br />
            Upward I look and see Him there<br />
            Who made an end to all my sin<br />
            Because the sinless Savior died<br />
            My sinful soul is counted free<br />
            For God the Just is satisfied<br />
            To look on Him and pardon me<br />
            To look on Him and pardon me<br /><br />
            Behold Him there, the risen Lamb<br />
            My perfect, spotless Righteousness<br />
            The great unchangeable I Am<br />
            The King of glory and of grace<br />
            One with Himself, I cannot die<br />
            My soul is purchased by His blood<br />
            My life is hid with Christ on high<br />
            With Christ my Savior and my God<br /><br />
            One with Himself, I cannot die<br />
            My soul is purchased by His blood<br />
            My life is hid with Christ on high<br />
            With Christ my Savior and my God<br />
            With Christ my Savior and my God<br />

            John Chrsostom writes, "Everywhere he puts the Gentiles upon a
            thorough equality.'And put no difference between us and them, having
            purified their hearts by faith.' [ Acts 15:9 ] From faith alone, he
            says, they obtained the same gifts. This is also meant as a lesson
            to those (objectors); this is able to teach even them that faith
            only is needed, not works nor circumcision. For indeed they do not
            say all this only by way of apology for the Gentiles, but to teach
            (the Jewish believers) also to abandon the Law. However, at present
            this is not said.'Now therefore why do you tempt God, to put a yoke
            upon the neck of the disciples?' [ Acts 15:10 ] What means,'Tempt ye
            God?' As if He had not power to save by faith. Consequently, it
            proceeds from a want of faith, this bringing in the Law." (<a

            Bernard writes, "In commanding, then, things which are impossible
            [to the unaided strength of men], He has made men, not offenders,
            but humble: that
            <em
              >every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be made subject
              to God</em
            >. Because by the works of
            <em>the Law no flesh shall be justified before Him</em> (Rom iii.
            19, 20). We, then, receiving the commandment, and feeling ourselves
            to come short of it, shall raise our cry to Heaven, and our God
            shall have pity upon us, and we shall learn in that day that
            <em
              >not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
              to His mercy He saved us</em

            Thomas Schreiner comments, "Paul’s claim that the OT itself curses
            those who do not abide by the law in its entirety is an effective
            statement only if one cannot obey it perfectly. The idea that Paul
            assumed that no one could obey the law perfectly explains why he
            believed that only Christ could remove the curse from humanity (Gal
            3:13). Indeed, in Gal 2:21 Paul remarks that if justification were
            attainable by law-obedience, then Christ died for nothing." (<a

            John Chrysostom writes, "And if any were to cast in prison a person
            who owed ten mites, and not the man himself only, but wife and
            children and servants for his sake; and another were to come and not
            to pay down the ten mites only, but to give also ten thousand
            talents of gold, and to lead the prisoner into the kings courts, and
            to the throne of the highest power, and were to make him partaker of
            the highest honour and every kind of magnificence, the creditor
            would not be able to remember the ten mites; so hath our case been.
            For Christ hath paid down far more than we owe, yea as much more as

            is from faith makes one righteous in God's sight, so that one may be

            Ambrosiaster, commenting on Romans 3:25, writes, "They are justified
            freely, because they have not done anything nor given anything in
            return, but by faith alone they have been made holy by the gift of
            God. Paul testifies that the grace of God is in Christ, because we
            have been redeemed by Christ according to the will of God, so that
            once set free we may be justified, as he says to the Galatians:
            <em>Christ redeemed us by offering himself for us</em>."

            We are blessed first by the taking away of the curse. Then,
            justified by faith, we receive the grace of the Holy Spirit. So the
            cross has dissolved the curse, faith has brought righteouness, and

            (For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse, as it is

          <p>
            This is a key passage in Paul&#x27;s argument that salvation is by
            faith, not by works of the law. Paul is arguing that anyone who
            tries to be justified by works of the law is under a curse, because
            the law is impossible to keep perfectly. The passage quotes
            Deuteronomy 27:26, which says that anyone who does not obey all the
            commandments of the law is cursed. Paul is using this passage to
            show that no one can be justified by works of the law.

            Paul is arguing that the law cannot justify anyone, because no one
            can keep the law perfectly. Instead, salvation comes through faith
            in Jesus Christ. He quotes from Habakkuk 2:4 to support his
            argument. Habakkuk 2:4 says, &quot;The righteous will live by his
            faith.&quot; Paul is using this passage to show that salvation is
            not based on human works, but on God&#x27;s grace.

            The law requires people to obey its commandments perfectly in order

            cannot justify anyone.

            Paul quotes from Leviticus 18:5 to support his argument. Leviticus

            Paul begins this verse by stating that Christ redeemed us from the
            curse of the law. He then explains what this means by saying that
            Christ became a curse for us. This is a reference to Christ's death
            on the cross, which was a fulfillment of the curse that was placed
            on humanity by God as a result of sin. He supports his statement
            with a quotation from Deuteronomy 21:23, which says that "cursed is
            everyone who is hanged on a tree." This quotation shows that
            Christ's death on the cross was a substitutionary sacrifice. He took
            upon himself the curse that should have been ours.

          <p>
            Χριστός: &quot;Christ&quot; is the Greek word for
            &quot;Messiah&quot; or &quot;anointed one.&quot; It is a title for
            Jesus, who Christians believe is the fulfillment of the messianic
            prophecies of the Old Testament. ἡμᾶς: &quot;us&quot; is the
            accusative plural pronoun, referring to the Galatian Christians to
            whom Paul is writing. ἐξηγόρασεν: &quot;redeemed&quot; is the
            perfect tense of the verb &quot;to redeem,&quot; which means to buy
            back or to release from bondage. In this context, it refers to the
            act of Christ&#x27;s death on the cross, which rescued humanity from
            the curse of the law.

            γενόμενος: &quot;becoming&quot; is the present participle of the

            Christ&#x27;s death on the cross. ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν: &quot;for us&quot; is
            the dative case of the pronoun &quot;us,&quot; indicating the
            purpose of Christ&#x27;s death. κατάρα: &quot;curse&quot; is the
            nominative singular of the noun &quot;curse.&quot; In this context,
