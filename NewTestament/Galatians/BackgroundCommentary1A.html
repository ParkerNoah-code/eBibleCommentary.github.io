        <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <em
            >Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus
            Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Paul, an apostle</em>. Elsewhere Paul draws a sharp distinction
          between an apostleship and lesser functions, as in I Corinthians
          12:28: "And God hath set some in the church; first, apostles;
          secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers."
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Apostle</em>. The term, in its native signification, signifies one
          who is sent; in its ecclesiastical use, it signifies one
          extraordinarily sent to preach the gospel; of these some were sent
          either more immediately by Christ, (as the twelve were sent, Matthew
          10:1; Mark 3:14; Luke 9:1), or more mediately, as Matthias, who was
          sent by the suffrage of the other apostles to supply the place of
          Judas (Acts 1:25, 1:26), and Barnabas, and Silas, and others were.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Not from men</em>. Paul saith he was sent not of men, neither by
          man, that is, not merely; for he was also sent by men to his
          particular province (Acts 13:3); but he was immediately sent by Jesus
          Christ, (as we read, Acts 9:1-43 and Acts 26:14-17, of which also he
          gives us an account in this chapter, Galatians 1:15-17), and by God
          the Father also.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Through Jesus Christ</em>. How did Paul get his commission? He
          tells us in Acts 26. When he fell stricken on the Damascus road the
          risen Christ appeared to him, and said to him, “I am Jesus whom thou
          persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared
          unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both
          of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which
          I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the
          Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn
          them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,
          that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them
          which are sanctified by faith that is in me” (vv. 15-18). Paul says
          that is where he got his commission. “Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was
          not disobedient unto the heavenly vision” (v. 19), but in accord with
          his divinely-given instructions he went forth to teach at “Damascus,
          and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to
          the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works
          meet for repentance” (v. 20).
        </p>
        <p>
          As it differed from the call of ordinary ministers, who are called by
          men (though their ministry be not merely of men); so it differed from
          the call of the rest of the apostles, being made by Christ not in his
          state of humiliation, (as the twelve were called, Matthew 10:1-42),
          but in his state of exaltation, after he was raised from the dead, and
          sat down on the right hand of God.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <em
            >and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of
            Galatia:</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <em
            >Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
            Christ,</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Grace</em>. Some say when Christ was on earth and in the early
          part of the book of Acts, they preached the gospel of the kingdom but
          did not know the grace of God. I wonder whether they remember the
          words of John 3:16 and John 1:29, and recollect that it was the Lord
          who said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word,
          and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
          not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life” (John
          5:24). How short our memories are sometimes, if we say that Jesus was
          not preaching grace when here on earth when Scripture says, “The law
          was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ” (John
          1:17). Can we say that Peter and his fellow apostles in the early part
          of Acts were not preaching grace when it was Peter who declared, “To
          him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever
          believeth in him shall receive remission of sins” (Acts 10:43).
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 4.
          <em
            >who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this
            present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</em
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Who gave himself</em>. Which Christ, though he was put to death by
          Pilate and the Jews, yet he was not compelled to die; for he laid down
          his life, no man took it from him, John 10:17, 10:18. Sometimes it is
          said, he died for our sins, as Romans 5:8; sometimes, that he gave
          himself, meaning, to death, as in Ephesians 5:2, 5:25; 1 Timothy 2:6;
          Titus 2:14; he was given by his Father, and he gave himself by his own
          free act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence we are not delivered by our own will, or shrewdness, or wisdom,
          but by the mercy and love of God, as it is written, "Herein is love,
          not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be
          the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4:10). Paul, like John,
          emphasizes the Father's will is Christ's habit of directing attention
          to the Father. For Christ came into the world to reconcile God with us
          and to draw us to the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>For our sins</em>. Of all men it is written, “None of them can by
          any means redeem his brother, nor give God a ransom for him. For the
          redemption of their life is costly, no payment is ever enough” (Psalms
          49:7-8). But here is One who became Man to redeem our soul: “The Son
          of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give
          his life a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>That he might deliver us out of this present evil age</em>.
          Remission of sins is an effect of the death of Christ, but not the
          sole effect; we must not forget the propitiation (Romans 3:25); the
          redemption (Ephesians 1:7); the sacrifice (Hebrews 10:12); And though
          some other texts mention Christ’s dying for our sins, without mention
          of such expiation, propitiation, redemption, or satisfaction; yet they
          must be interpreted by the latitude of the end of Christ’s death
          (expressed in other scriptures) relating to sin. Which is not only
          expiation, and remission, but the delivery of us from the lusts and
          corruptions of this present evil age.
