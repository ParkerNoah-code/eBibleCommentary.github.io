        <h2>A. Salutation (1:1-5)</h2>
        <h2>
          Ver 1.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >Παῦλος ἀπόστολος οὐκ ἀπ' ἀνθρώπων, οὐδὲ δι' ἀνθρώπου, ἀλλὰ διὰ
            Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ, καὶ θεοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν,</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>
          Ver 2.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >καὶ οἱ σὺν ἐμοὶ πάντες ἀδελφοί, ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις τῆς Γαλατίας·</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          οἱ σὺν ἐμοὶ - those with me. It seems, from its use in Php 4:21, to
          describe a small group of brethren immediately surrounding the
          Apostle; for the salutation from them is there followed by a separate
          salutation from the Roman Church in general.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 3.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ θεοῦ πατρός, καὶ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ
            χριστοῦ,</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          The pronoun ἡμῶν is placed after Κυρίου on good authority, though A
          and à, with some of the Latin fathers, insert it after πατρός, as in
          other salutations. Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:3; 2 Cor 1:2; Eph 1:2, etc. As διά
          in the first verse, so ἀπό in this verse governs both the genitives,
          as both are sources of divine blessing, according to the aspect in
          which each is viewed, primarily indeed from God and proximately from
          Jesus Christ. This contiguous use of two prepositions, each of them in
          application both to the Father and to Christ, shows that to the
          apostle God and Christ were so much one in will and operation (“God in
          Christ”), that no sharp dogmatic distinction of origin and medium
          needed to be drawn between them in such a prayer offered for the
          churches. See under Gal 1:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the meaning of the benediction, see under Eph 1:2, and also the
          note of Wieseler. As the West embodied its wishes in χάρις, and the
          East in ùÑÈìåÉí, H8934-εἰρήνη,-so the apostle, in catholic fulness,
          uses both terms in their profoundest Christian significance: no
          ordinary greeting, or “as the world giveth,” but a prayer for all
          combined and fitting spiritual blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In connection with Christ, and as an unusual addition to his
          salutations, he now describes His distinctive work in its blessed
          purpose and in its harmony with the divine plan; for the passing
          statement presents a truth in direct conflict with the errors
          prevailing in the Galatian churches. Thus the first and fourth verses
          contain in brief the two themes of the epistle,-a vindication of his
          apostleship and of the free and full salvation by faith without works
          of law, which he rejoiced to proclaim.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 4.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >τοῦ δόντος ἑαυτὸν περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν, ὅπως ἐξέληται ἡμᾶς ἐκ τοῦ
            ἐνεστῶτος αἰῶνος πονηροῦ, κατὰ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ πατρὸς
            ἡμῶν·</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν - for the sins. The sin offerings of the Law were
          designated περὶ ἁμαρτίας (cf. Hebrews 10:6; Hebrews 10:8), but περί
          and ὑπέρ were equally applicable with reference to Christ's offering
          of Himself for our sins; the former fixing attention on the effect of
          His sacrifice in doing away sin, the latter on the motive which
          prompted Him, viz., love for sinners. The two prepositions are
          combined in 1 Peter 3:18. It is often difficult to decide which is the
          genuine reading owing to the variation of MSS.: but here they are
          greatly in favour of περί, which is also more appropriate to the
          context: for in this clause a comparison is intended between the
          sin-offerings of Christ and the typical sin-offerings of the Law;
        </p>

        <p>
          αἰῶνος - age. In this place αἰῶνος denotes the world which Jesus found
          existing at the time of His coming, out of which He chose His
          disciples. World is the nearest English equivalent to αἰών in this
          sense, if only it be understood to mean a particular phase of human
          society, as in the phrases religious world, scientific world, etc.,
          and not the material universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          ἐνεστῶτος - existing. This participle is twice elsewhere applied to
          things existing by way of contrast to things future (μέλλοντα), in
          Romans 8:38 and 1 Corinthians 3:22. A similar contrast is here
          suggested between ὁ ἐνεστώς and ὁ μέλλων αἰών, i.e., between the world
          which Christ found existing on earth and the Messianic world whose
          coming Hebrew prophets had foretold.
        </p>

        <p>
          πονηροῦ - evil. This sweeping condemnation of the existing world
          corresponds to the language of the Baptist and to Christ's own
          denunciations of the evil generation to which He came. In spite of all
          that revelation and conscience had done to leaven it, He found the
          faithful few in number, and evil predominant in the mass.
        </p>

        <p>
          ἐξέληται - he might deliver. Here, as in Acts 26:17, this verb coupled
          with ἐκ can only denote choice out of the world, not deliverance from
          it, which would require the addition of ἐκ χειρός, as in Acts 12:11,
          or some equivalent. The clause describes the process of selection
          begun by Christ on earth, and still continued by the risen Christ as
          He calls fresh disciples into His Church continually.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Ver 5.
          <span style="font-weight: normal"
            >ᾧ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων. Ἀμήν.</span
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          ᾧ ἡ δόξα - to whom [be] the glory. Our versions supply ἔστω and turn
          the clause accordingly into an invocation of praise. But the insertion
          of the article points rather to an affirmation, whose is the glory.
          The verb is usually omitted in the doxology, but ἐστιν is added in 1
          Peter 4:11. The glory consists in the manifestation of the Father's
          character throughout all the ages in the continual redemption of
          mankind according to His will. Hereby is revealed His union of perfect
          wisdom, holiness, and love.
        </p>

        <p>
          εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων. - to the ages of the ages. Denotes in
          Scripture a divinely appointed period (see ages, αἰῶνας, in Galatians
          1:4). The larger of these divine dispensations comprehend within them
          other shorter periods, and are therefore designated αἰῶνες αἰώνων. The
          phrase in the text ascribes the glory to God for the whole term of
          these dispensations, i.e., for all the ages of human life, since these
          together make up the sum of man's existence. The full form is used by
          the Apostle in Php 4:20, 2 Timothy 4:18, but he uses elsewhere the
          shorter form εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ἀμήν. - amen. This Amen crowns the previous declaration of the glory
          of God by an invitation to the Churches to join in the ascription of
          praise.
