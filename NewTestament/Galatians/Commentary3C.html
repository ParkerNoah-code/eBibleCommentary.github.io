            Johannes Brenz comments, "Paul calls the promise of God a covenant.
            This word shows that not only is the mercy of the one who promises
            it free but also that the promise itself is certain... If God had
            based it on our merits, then we would never be sure of our
            salvation. Of necessity we would remain in doubt forever. But now,
            in order for us to be certain, he has grounded it on the basis of
            his promise so that we might stand in judgment of God." (Explanation
            of Galatians, Reformation Commentary on Scripture: IVP, NT vol 10,
            2011).

            C. John Collins comments, "If Paul really was alluding to Genesis
            22:18, then his point was that the 'offspring' there was a single
            individual, not a group of descendants. He further tells us that
            this single offspring was Christ (that is, Messiah)... This would
            mean that Paul, in alluding to this text, was drawing out the
            meaning that was already there in the Hebrew of Genesis." (<a

            Cyril of Jerusalem writes, "For the God of the two Testaments is
            One, Who in the Old Testament foretold the Christ Who appeared in
            the New; Who by the Law and the Prophets led us to Christ's school.
            For before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, and, the
            law has been our tutor to bring us unto Christ. And if ever thou
            hear any of the heretics speaking evil of the Law or the Prophets,
            answer in the sound of the Saviour's voice, saying, Jesus came not
            to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it. Learn also diligently, and
            from the Church, what are the books of the Old Testament, and what
            those of the New. And, pray, read none of the apocryphal writings:
            for why do you, who know not those which are acknowledged among all,
            trouble yourself in vain about those which are disputed?" (<a

            John Chrysostom writes, "But he calls it their 'own righteousness,'
            either because the Law was no longer of force, or because it was one
            of trouble and toil. But this he calls God's righteousness, that
            from faith, because it comes entirely from the grace from above, and
            because men are justified in this case, not by labors, but by the
            gift of God. But they that evermore resisted the Holy Ghost, and
            vexatiously tried to be justified by the Law, came not over to the
            faith. But as they did not come over to the faith, nor receive the
            righteousness thereupon ensuing, and were not able to be justified
            by the Law either, they were thrown out of all resources." (<a

            Hilary of Poitiers writes, "Now, by the Law, sprinkling was a
            cleansing from sins; it purified the people through faith by the
            sprinkling of blood, of which this same blessed David thus speaks:
            <em>Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed</em>;
            the Law, through faith, providing as a temporary substitute, in the
            blood of whole burnt-offerings, a type of the sprinkling with the
            blood of the Lord, which was to be. But this people, like the people
            of the Ziphims, being sprinkled on their face and not in their
            faith, and receiving the cleansing drops on their lips and not in
            their hearts, turned faithless and traitors towards their David, as
            God had foretold by the Prophet:
            <em

            Theodore of Mopsuestia comments, "If power were inherent in Torah
            such that those who were governed by it could be justified and
            attain eternal life as well, the Torah would undermine the Promise
            by providing justification all by itself, instead of the Promise
            providing justification. But the reality is just the opposite: Torah
            prohibits sin, but is powerless to rescue those who fall into it
            through the weakness of human nature. Torah therefore effectively
            exposes our feebleness, or rather our complete impotence, with
            regard to justification, and necessarily demonstrates our need for
            the Messiah's grace." (Commentary on Galatians,

            B. B. Warfield writes, " 'None is God,' says he, 'but one' (1 Cor
            8:4); and he says it, as we have seen, in immediate connection with
            his recognition of 'one God, the Father' and 'one Lord, Jesus
            Christ' (cf. Rom 3:30, 16:27, Gal 3:20, Eph 4:6, 1 Tim 2:5). How,
            then, could he mean to set by the side of this 'one God the Father'
            the 'one Lord Jesus Christ' as a second, although somewhat inferior,
            God? And nothing could exceed the clearness and emphasis with which
            Paul represents Jesus' divine majesty not as an attainment but as an
            aboriginal possession." (<a

            Augustine comments, "Is the law then against the promises of God? No
            way! If we had been given a law capable of vivifying, justice would
            actually come from the law. But the Scripture contained everything
            under sin, so that the promise would be granted to believers through
            faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, the law was not given to eliminate
            sin, but to enclose everything under sin. For the law showed that
            sin existed, a sin that they, blinded by custom, could judge as
            justice: so that, humiliated in this way, they would know that their
            salvation was not in their power, but in that of the Mediator. It is
            humility above all that revokes us from the place where pride has
            thrown us. And the same humility is accommodated to the reception of
            the grace of Christ, who constitutes a unique example of humility."

            John of Damascus writes, "So let us knock at the very beautiful
            paradise of the Scriptures... Let us not knock casually, but with
            eagerness and persistence, and let us not lose heart while knocking,
            for so it will be opened to us. Should we read once and then a
            second time and still not understand what we are reading, let us not
            be discouraged. Rather, let us persist, let us meditate and
            inquire... let us draw everflowing and most pure waters springing up
            into life everlasting... for they contain the grace which cannot be
            exhausted." (Orthodox Faith: Book 4, The Fathers of the Church: A
            New Translation, vol 37, ch 17, pg 374).

            Hugh of Saint Victor writes, "All of Sacred Scripture is contained
            in two testaments, namely the Old and the New Testament…(the)
            writings of the Fathers are not included in the text of the Sacred
            Scriptures, just as in the Old Testament there are some books that
            not included in the canon but are still read.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence the holy Fathers, taught by the Holy Spirit, accepted only
            four authoritative Gospels…Paul wrote fourteen letters... there are
            seven canonical letters…Luke…wrote his Gospel to Theophilus, to whom
            he also dedicated his Acts of the Apostles…John the Apostle wrote
            the Apocalypse…These are the writers of the sacred books, who
            speaking by the Holy Spirit, wrote down for our instruction the
            precepts and rule of living. Besides these there are other volumes
            that are called apocryphal…Their origin is obscure and the holy
            fathers do not tell us by whom they were written. There is some
            truth in them, but because of their many errors they nevertheless
            have no canonical authority." (On the Sacred Scripture and Its
            Authors, Victorine Texts in Translation: Interpretation of
            Scripture, 2013, pgs 219 and 222).
