        <h2>B. Calling: Proved by Independence (1:15-24)</h2>
        <div id="Expository" class="commentary">
          <h2>
            Ver 15-16a.
            <em
              >But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from
              my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, to reveal his
              Son in me,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>But after that it pleased God.</em> This is the second part of
            the narrative, and relates to his miraculous conversion. He tells
            us, first, that he had been called by the grace of God to preach
            Christ among the Gentiles; and, next, that as soon as he had been
            called, without consulting the apostles, he unhesitatingly proceeded
            to the performance of the work, which, he felt assured, had been
            enjoined upon him by the appointment of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul's reasoning does not, at first sight, appear so strong; for
            although, when he had been converted to Christianity, he instantly,
            and without consulting the apostles, entered into the office of
            preaching the gospel, it does not thence follow that he had been
            appointed to that office by the revelation of Christ. But the
            arguments which he employs are various, and, when they are all
            collected, will be found sufficiently strong to establish his
            conclusion. He argues, first, that he had been called by the grace
            of God; next, that his apostleship had been acknowledged by the
            other apostles; and the other arguments follow. Let the reader,
            therefore, remember to read the whole narrative together, and to
            draw the inference, not from single parts, but from the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Who separated me.</em> This separation was the purpose of God,
            by which Paul was appointed to the apostolic office, before he was
            even born. The calling followed afterwards at the proper time, when
            the Lord made known his will concerning him, and commanded him to
            proceed to the work. God had, no doubt, decreed, before the
            foundation of the world, what he would do with regard to every one
            of us, and had assigned to every one, by his secret counsel, his
            respective place. But the sacred writers frequently introduce those
            three steps: the eternal predestination of God, the destination from
            the womb, and the calling, which is the effect and accomplishment of
            both.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah, though expressed a
            little differently from this passage, has entirely the same meaning.
            "Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou
            camest forth from the womb I sanctified thee; a prophet to the
            nations have I made thee." (Jeremiah 1:5). Before they even existed,
            Jeremiah had been set apart to the office of a prophet, and Paul to
            that of an apostle; but he is said to separate us from the womb,
            because the design of our being sent into the world is, that he may
            accomplish, in us, what he has decreed. The calling is delayed till
            its proper time, when God has prepared us for the office which he
            commands us to undertake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, in his usual manner, he traces his calling to the good
            pleasure of God. This deserves our careful attention; for it shows
            us that we owe it to the goodness of God, not only that we have been
            elected and adopted to everlasting life, but that he deigns to make
            use of our services, who would otherwise have been altogether
            useless, and that he assigns to us a lawful calling, in which we may
            be employed. What had Paul, before he was born, to entitle him to so
            high an honor? In like manner we ought to believe, that it is
            entirely the gift of God, and not obtained by our own industry, that
            we have been called to govern the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>And called me by his grace</em>. God is said to separate us, not
            because he bestows any peculiar disposition of mind which
            distinguishes us from others, but because he appoints us by his own
            purpose. Although the apostle had most explicitly attributed his
            calling to the free grace of God, when he pronounced that voluntary
            separation from the womb to be the origin of it, yet he repeats the
            direct statement, both that, by his commendation of Divine grace, he
            may take away all grounds of boasting, and that he may testify his
            own gratitude to God. On this subject he is wont freely to
            expatiate, even when he has no controversy with the false apostles.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Did God call me on account of my holy life? Or on account of my
            pharisaical religion? Or on account of my prayers, fastings, and
            works? Never. Well, then, it is certain God did not call me on
            account of my blasphemies, persecutions, oppressions. What prompted
            Him to call me? His grace alone."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>To reveal his Son in me.</em> We now hear what kind of doctrine
            was committed to Paul: The doctrine of the Gospel, the doctrine of
            the revelation of the Son of God. This doctrine differs greatly from
            the Law. The Law terrorizes the conscience. The Law reveals the
            wrath and judgment of God. The Gospel does not threaten. The Gospel
            announces that Christ is come to forgive the sins of the world. The
            Gospel conveys to us the inestimable treasures of God.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 16b.
            <em
              >that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately
              confer with flesh and blood,</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>That I might preach him among the Gentiles</em>. "It pleased
            God," says the Apostle, "to reveal himself in me. Why? For a twofold
            purpose. That I personally should believe in the Son of God, and
            that I should reveal Him to the Gentiles." Paul does not mention the
            Jews, for the simple reason that he was the called and acknowledged
            apostle of the Gentiles, although he preached Christ also to the
            Jews.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>I didn’t immediately confer</em>. So far as the meaning of these
            words is concerned, his intention was absolutely to have nothing to
            do with any human counsels. The general expression, as will
            presently appear from the context, includes all men, and all the
            prudence or wisdom which they may possess. He even makes a direct
            reference to the apostles, for the express purpose of exhibiting, in
            a stronger light, the immediate calling of God. Relying on the
            authority of God alone, and asking nothing more, he proceeded to
            discharge the duty of preaching the gospel.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 17.
            <em
              >nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before
              me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Neither did I return to Jerusalem.</em>
            What he had just written is now explained, and more fully stated. As
            if he had said, "I did not ask the authority of any man," not even
            of the apostles themselves. It is a mistake to suppose, that,
            because the apostles are now separately mentioned, they are not
            included in the words,
            <em>flesh and blood</em>. Nothing new or different is here added,
            but merely a clearer explanation of what had been already said. And
            no disrespect to the apostles is implied in that expression. For the
            purpose of showing that he did not owe his commission to man, the
            false boasting of unprincipled men laid him under the necessity of
            contrasting. the authority of the apostles themselves with the
            authority of God. When a creature is brought into comparison with
            God, however contemptuous or humiliating may be the language
            employed, he has no reason to complain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>But I went into Arabia.</em> In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke
            has omitted these three years. In like manner, there are other
            passages of the history which he does not touch; and hence the
            slander of those who seek to build on this a charge of inconsistency
            in the narratives is ridiculous. Let godly readers consider the
            severe temptation with which Paul was called to struggle at the very
            commencement of his course. He who but yesterday, for the sake of
            doing him honor, had been sent to Damascus with a magnificent
            retinue, is now compelled to wander as an exile in a foreign land:
            but he does not lose his courage.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 18.
            <em
              >Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and
              stayed with him fifteen days.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Then after three years.</em> It was not till three years after
            he had begun to discharge the apostolic office, that he
            <em>went up to Jerusalem</em>. Thus, he did not, at the outset,
            receive the calling of men. But lest it should be supposed that he
            had separate interests from theirs, and was desirous to avoid their
            society, he tells us that he went up for the express purpose to
            <em>see Peter</em>. Although he had not waited for their sanction
            before undertaking the office, yet it was not against their will,
            but with their full consent and approbation, that he held the rank
            of an apostle. He is desirous to show that at no period was he at
            variance with the apostles, and that even now he is in full harmony
            with all their views. By mentioning the short time that he remained
            there, he shows that he had come, not with a view to learn, but to
            visit with Peter.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 19.
            <em
              >But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s
              brother.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            Why does Paul harp on this seemingly unimportant fact? To convince
            the churches of Galatia that his Gospel was the true Word of Christ
            which he learned from Christ Himself and from no man. Paul was
            forced to affirm and re-affirm this fact. His usefulness to all the
            churches that had used him as their pastor and teacher was at stake.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 20.
            <em
              >Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God,
              I’m not lying.</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            This affirmation extends to the whole narrative. The vast
            earnestness of Paul on this subject is evinced by his resorting to
            an oath, which cannot lawfully be employed but on great and weighty
            occasions. Nor is it wonderful that he insists with so much
            earnestness on this point; for we have already seen to what
            expedients the impostors had recourse in order to take from him the
            name and credit of an apostle. Now the modes of swearing used by
            good men deserve our attention; for we learn from them that an oath
            must be viewed simply as an appeal to the judgment-seat of God for
            the integrity and truth of our words and actions; and such a
            transaction ought to be guided by religion and the fear of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            Was it necessary for Paul to go under oath? Yes. Paul is reporting
            personal history. How else would the churches believe him? The false
            apostles might say, "Who knows whether Paul is telling the truth?"
            Paul, the elect vessel of God, was held in so little esteem by his
            own Galatians to whom he had preached Christ that it was necessary
            for him to swear an oath that he spoke the truth. If this happened
            to Paul, what business have we to complain when people doubt our
            words, or hold us in little regard, we who cannot begin to compare
            ourselves with the Apostle?
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 21. <em>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Syria and Cilicia are adjacent countries. Paul traces his movements
            carefully in order to convince the Galatians that he had never been
            the disciple of any apostle.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Ver 22-23.
            <em
              >I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were
              in Christ, but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now
              preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”</em
            >
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>And was unknown by face.</em> This appears to be added for the
            sake of showing more strongly the wickedness and malignity of his
            slanderers. If the churches of Judea who had only heard respecting
            him, were led to give glory to God for the astonishing change which
            he had wrought in Paul, how disgraceful was it that those who had
            beheld the fruits of his amazing labors should not have acted a
            similar part! If the mere report was enough for the former, why did
            not the facts before their eyes satisfy the latter?
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Which once he destroyed.</em> This does not mean that
            <em>faith</em> may actually be destroyed, but that he lessened its
            influence on the minds of weak men. Besides, it is the will, rather
            than the deed, that is here expressed.
          </p>

          <h2>Ver 24. <em>So they glorified God in me.</em></h2>
          <p>
            <em>And they glorified God in me.</em> This was an evident proof
            that his ministry was approved by all the churches of Judea, and
            approved in such a manner, that they broke out into admiration and
            praise of the wonderful power of God. Thus he indirectly reproves
            their malice, by showing that their venom and slanders could have no
            other effect than to hide the glory of God, which, as the apostles
            admitted and openly acknowledged, shone brightly in the apostleship
            of Paul.
          </p>
          <p>
            This reminds us of the light in which the saints of the Lord ought
            to be regarded by us. When we behold men adorned with the gifts of
            God, such is our depravity, or ingratitude, or proneness to
            superstition, that we worship them as gods, unmindful of Him by whom
            those gifts were bestowed. These words remind us, on the contrary,
            to lift up our eyes to the Great Author, and to ascribe to Him what
            is his own, while they at the same time inform us that an occasion
            of offering praise to God was furnished by the change produced on
            Paul, from being an enemy to becoming a minister of Christ.

            John Calvin comments, "Immediately I conferred not. To confer with

            meaning of these words is concerned, his intention was absolutely to
            have nothing to do with any human counsels. The general expression,
            as will presently appear from the context, includes all men, and all
            the prudence or wisdom which they may possess. He even makes a
            direct reference to the apostles, for the express purpose of
            exhibiting, in a stronger light, the immediate calling of God.
            Relying on the authority of God alone, and asking nothing more, he
            proceeded to discharge the duty of preaching the gospel." (<a

            might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the family and descent
            of Christ... And therefore, when to the previous question, 'Who is
            my mother, and who are my brethren?' He added the answer 'None but
            they who hear my words and do them,' He transferred the names of
            blood-relationship to others, whom He judged to be more closely
            related to Him by reason of their faith... That He adopted others
            only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused
            because of their offence, and for whom He substituted the others,
            not as being truer relatives, but worthier ones. Finally, it was no

            <em>And he took his wife, and knew her again no more</em>? Could not
            Matthew find words to express his meaning? <em>He knew her not</em>,

            Jerome comments, "This may be simply taken as follows: What I write
            to you is true and I affirm, with God as my witness, that it has not
            been embellished with any lie or verbal artifice. Or perhaps it
            could be taken in a deeper sense: What I write to you is before God,
            that is, it is worthy of being seen by God. But why worthy of God's
            countenance? Because I do not lie. And just as the Lord fixes his
            eyes on the righteous but turns his face away from the unholy, so
            also now what I write is before the Lord. I who write do not lie; if

            confess; the saving indulgence from God's pity is granted to you
            when you believe; nay in the very hour of death a transit is secured
            to immortality. This grace Christ grants, this work of His mercy He
            puts in our possession, by subduing death in the trophy of the
            Cross, by redeeming the believer with the price of His blood, by
            reconciling man to God the Father, and giving life to one who is
            mortal by heavenly regeneration... We Christians will be partakers
            in glory with Christ, in the blessedness of God the Father,
            rejoicing with perpetual gladness, in the presence of God for ever,
