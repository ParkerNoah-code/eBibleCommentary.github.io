            Ignatius writes, "When I heard some saying, If I do not find it in
            the ancient Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel; on my saying
            to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be proved.
            But to me Jesus Christ is in the place of all that is ancient: His
            cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which is by Him,
            are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through
            your prayers, to be justified." (<a

            Justin Martyr writes, "When Abraham himself was still uncircumcised,
            he was justified and blessed by God because of his faith in him, as
            the Scriptures tell us. Furthermore, the Scriptures and the facts of
            the case force us to admit that Abraham received circumcision for a
            sign, not for justification itself... and along with Abraham we
            shall inherit the holy land, when we shall receive the inheritance
            for an endless eternity, being children of Abraham through the like
            faith. For as he believed the voice of God, and it was imputed to
            him for righteousness, in like manner we having believed God's voice
            spoken by the apostles of Christ, and promulgated to us by the
            prophets, have renounced even to death all the things of the world.
            Accordingly, He promises to him a nation of similar faith,
            God-fearing, righteous, and delighting the Father; but it is not
            you, 'in whom is no faith.' " (<a

            "But the strangest thing of all is that when the Saviour and Lord of
            all, the Creator and Ruler of this lower universe, the Son and Word
            of the Great Father, Mediator, High-priest, and Partner of His
            throne; He, who for the sake of us that had dishonoured His image,
            and had cast it down to the ground, and who knew not the great
            mystery of the Union, had not merely "come down into the form of a
            servant," but had gone up unto the Cross, carrying with Him my sin,
            to die there----that He being called a Samaritan, and what is much
            worse, accused of being possessed by a devil, was neither ashamed,
            nor reproached those who insulted Him----He to whom it was an easy
            thing to avenge himself upon the wicked by means of the angelic
            host, and by a single word----but that He answered those that
            insulted Him, altogether patiently and with mildness, and shed tears
            for those who crucified Him----a very strange thing it was for him
            to think that we would be vexed or ashamed at being so called, or be
            slackened in our zeal for the good cause, or would make more account
            of his insults than of our own lives and bodies, which we know how
            to despise for the Truth's sake!" (Gregory Nazianzen,

            Ambrose writes, " If Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto
            him for righteousness, and that which is accounted for righteousness
            passes from unbelief to faith, then are we justified by faith, not
            by the works of the Law. Now Abraham himself had two sons, Ishmael
            and Isaac, one of the bondwoman, the other of the freewoman; and it
            was told him that he should cast out the bondwoman and the son of
            the bondwoman, for that the son of the bondwoman should not be his
            heir. We therefore are children not of the bondwoman but of the free
            woman, in that liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. Hence it
            follows that they are specially Abraham's sons, who are so by faith,
            for the heirs of faith excel heirs by natural birth. The Law is our
            schoolmaster, faith is free; let us therefore cast away the works of
            bondage, let us preserve the grace of liberty, let us leave the
            shade, and follow the Sun, let us desert Jewish rites." (<a
