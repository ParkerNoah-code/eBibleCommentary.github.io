  <h1>The Prince</h1>
  <p>
    Excerpts from

      >The Prince</a
    >, (Penguin Classics: Britain, 2014), translated by Tim Parks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The central theme of the book: the acquisition and maintenance of political
    power. Written for Lorenzo de’ Medici to study and "achieve the greatness
    that your status and qualities promise" (62).
  </p>
  <p>
    1. "All states and governments that ever ruled over men have been either
    republics or monarchies" (63). This chapter sets the stage by categorizing
    the types of principalities and how they are acquired. Machiavelli
    distinguishes between hereditary principalities and new principalities,
    outlining the challenges and advantages associated with each.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. "A ruler who inherits power has less reason or need to upset his subjects
    than a new one and as a result is better loved. If he doesn’t go out of his
    way to get himself hated, it’s reasonable to suppose his people will wish
    him well" (64). Machiavelli explains that hereditary principalities are
    easier to maintain than new ones because the ruling family has a
    long-standing authority and the populace is accustomed to their rule. The
    main challenge is avoiding the pitfalls of complacency and ensuring
    continuity through capable governance.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. A "ruler is bound to upset the people in his new territories, first with
    his occupying army and then with all the endless injustices consequent on
    any invasion. So not only do you make enemies of those whose interests you
    damaged when you occupied the territory, but you can’t even keep the
    friendship of the people who helped you to take power, this for the simple
    reason that you can’t give them as much as they expected" (65).
  </p>
  <p>
    It is easier to hold on to a territory if it has the same language and if it
    is in a similar geographical location. If the people are not used to
    self-rule, the old ruling family is killed so that they are dependent on
    you. Soon enough the occupied territory will become one with the other lands
    of the king.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, if they have different customs, languages and institutions,
    "perhaps the most effective solution is for the new ruler to go and live
    there himself" (67). Another solution is creating colonies. The principle
    is: "you must either pamper people or destroy them; harm them just a little
    and they’ll hit back; harm them seriously and they won’t be able to" (68).
    Establish friendship with a weaker neighbor and you will have an ally.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Louis made five mistakes: he eliminated the weaker states; he enhanced the
    power of one of Italy’s stronger states; he brought in an extremely powerful
    foreign king; he didn’t go to live in the territory he’d acquired and he
    didn’t establish colonies there" (72).
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Machiavelli examines the structure of the Persian Empire under Darius,
    highlighting the centralized nature of its government. He contrasts this
    with decentralized states like France, arguing that centralized states are
    harder to conquer but easier to maintain, as they depend on the singular
    authority of the prince.
  </p>
  <p>
    "The reason why it’s hard to conquer a country like Turkey is that there are
    no barons to invite you in and you can’t expect anyone to make your invasion
    easier by rebelling against the king" (75). It's hard to start a rebellion
    because everyone is indebted to the king.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Machiavelli outlines three strategies for maintaining control over cities
    that previously enjoyed self-rule: destroy them, reside in them, or allow
    them to maintain their laws while imposing a loyal government. The most
    effective method is complete destruction to prevent rebellion. In a
    republic, the "memory of old freedoms lingers on and won’t let them rest. In
    these cases, your only options are to reduce the place to rubble or go and
    live there yourself" (78).
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Machiavelli examines leaders who rise to power through their own merit
    and military prowess. He uses examples such as Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, and
    Theseus to illustrate how capable leaders establish new states.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. This chapter explores how leaders gain power through the help of others,
    such as through alliances or the favor of influential individuals. Cesare
    Borgia is cited as a key example.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. Machiavelli analyzes leaders who attain power through immoral or
    unscrupulous means. He uses examples like Agathocles of Syracuse to show how
    cruelty can be a tool for maintaining control.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. The chapter discusses how leaders can rise to power with the support of
    the populace or the nobility, and the implications of each path for
    maintaining power.
  </p>
  <p>
    10. This chapter discusses the importance of a principality's ability to
    defend itself without external assistance. Machiavelli advises that a prince
    should focus on building fortifications and cultivating military strength to
    withstand sieges.
  </p>
  <p>
    11. Machiavelli considers ecclesiastical principalities unique because they
    are sustained by religious institutions and are less reliant on conventional
    political strategies. He points out that the Church's spiritual power and
    influence make these states stable and hard to challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    12. Machiavelli warns against the use of mercenary forces, which are
    unreliable and motivated by profit rather than loyalty. He argues that
    mercenaries pose a significant risk to rulers who rely on them, as their
    interests can easily shift.
  </p>
  <p>
    13. Continuing his discussion on military forces, Machiavelli differentiates
    between auxiliary troops, which are borrowed from allies, and native armies.
    He stresses that a prince should build and rely on his own military forces
    to ensure loyalty and effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    14. Machiavelli emphasizes that a prince must prioritize military
    preparedness and study the art of war. He advises rulers to constantly train
    and equip their forces, as military strength is the foundation of political
    power.
  </p>
  <p>
    15. Machiavelli discusses the virtues and vices attributed to rulers,
    arguing that a successful prince must be willing to act immorally when
    necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    16. Machiavelli discusses the balance between generosity and frugality. He
    suggests that while being liberal can win favor, it often leads to resource
    depletion and higher taxes. Therefore, it is better for a prince to be
    considered miserly, which ensures financial stability and the ability to
    respond to emergencies.
  </p>
  <p>
    17. Machiavelli explores the balance between fear and love in governance,
    concluding that while both are important, it is safer for a ruler to be
    feared than loved if they cannot be both.
  </p>
  <p>
    18. Machiavelli argues that a prince should not be bound by his word if it
    is detrimental to his interests, highlighting examples of successful leaders
    who employed deception.
  </p>
  <p>
    19. This chapter advises princes on how to avoid being despised or hated by
    their subjects, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a strong,
    respected image.
  </p>
  <p>
    20. Machiavelli examines the strategic use of fortresses and other defensive
    measures. He concludes that while fortresses can be useful, a ruler's best
    defense lies in gaining the trust and loyalty of his subjects, which makes
    physical fortifications less necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    21. Machiavelli outlines strategies for a prince to gain a positive
    reputation, such as taking bold actions, aligning with popular causes, and
    displaying visible successes. He advises rulers to balance diplomacy with
    decisive actions that capture the admiration of the populace.
  </p>
  <p>
    22. This chapter stresses the importance of choosing competent advisors.
    Machiavelli argues that the quality of a prince's counselors reflects on the
    ruler himself and that wise advisors can significantly enhance a prince's
    governance.
  </p>
  <p>
    23. Machiavelli warns against the dangers of flattery, which can lead to
    poor decision-making. He advises rulers to seek honest feedback and maintain
    a circle of trusted advisors who are not afraid to speak the truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    24. Reflecting on recent history, Machiavelli analyzes why Italian rulers
    lost their territories, attributing their failures to a lack of military
    preparedness, dependence on mercenaries, and failure to adapt to changing
    circumstances.
  </p>
  <p>
    25. Machiavelli discusses the role of fortune in human affairs and argues
    that while fortune controls half of our actions, the other half is shaped by
    our actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    26. The concluding chapter is a passionate call to action for Italian
    leaders to unify and free Italy from foreign domination.
