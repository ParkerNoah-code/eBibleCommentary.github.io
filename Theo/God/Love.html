    >, Chapter 12. Of the Love of God:
  </p>
  <p>
    Next to the attributes which belong to God, as an intelligent Spirit, to his
    understanding and will, may be considered, those which may be called
    &quot;Affections&quot;; for though, properly speaking, there are none in
    God, he being a most pure and simple act, free from all confusion and
    disorder; yet there being some things said and done by him, which are
    similar to affections in intelligent beings, they are ascribed to him; as
    love, pity, hatred, anger, etc. from which must be removed everything that
    is carnal, sensual, or has any degree of imperfection in it; and among
    these, Love stands in the first place; and this enters so much into the
    nature of God, that it is said, &quot;God is love&quot; (1 John 4:8, 16).
  </p>
  <p>
    So the Shekinah, or the divine majesty and glory, is, by the Jews, called
    &quot;Love&quot;; and the heathens give the same name to God; Plato
    expressly calls him &quot;Love&quot;: and Hesiod speaks of love as the
    fairest and most beautiful among the immortal gods. In treating of this
    divine attribute, I shall,
  </p>
  <p>1. Consider the objects of it. And,</p>
  <p>
    1a. The principal object of the love of God is himself. Self-love is in all
    intelligent beings; nor is it discommendable, when it Is not carried to a
    criminal excess, and to the neglect of others; none are obliged to love
    others more than themselves, but as themselves (Matthew 22:39). God first
    and chiefly loves himself; and hence he has made himself, that is, his
    glory, the ultimate end of all he does in nature, providence, and grace,
    (Proverbs 16:4; Romans 11:36; Revelation 4:11; Ephesians 1:6) and his
    happiness lies in contemplating himself, his nature and perfections; in that
    love, complacency and delight he has in himself; nor needs he, nor can he
    have anything out of himself that can add to his essential happiness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The three divine Persons in the Godhead mutually love each other; the Father
    loves the Son and the Spirit, the Son loves the Father and the Spirit, and
    the Spirit loves the Father and the Son. That the Father loves the Son, is
    more than once said, (John 3:35, 5:20) and the Son is sometimes called the
    well beloved and dear Son of God, (Matthew 3:17, 17:5; Colossians 1:13) he
    was from all eternity as &quot;one brought up with him&quot;; and was loved
    by him before the foundation of the world; and that with a love of
    complacency and delight; as he must, since &quot;he is the brightness of his
    glory, the express image of his person&quot;, and is of the same nature, and
    possessed of all the same perfections with him, (Proverbs 8:30, 31; John
    17:24; Hebrews 1:3; Colossians 2:9) yes, he loved him as his Servant, as the
    Mediator, in his state of humiliation, and obedience, and under all his
    sufferings, and on account of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even while he bore his wrath as the sinner&#x27;s surety, he was the object
    of his love, as his Son, (Isaiah 42:1; Matthew 3:17; John 10:17) and now he
    is at his right hand, in human nature, he looks upon him with delight, and
    is well pleased with his sacrifice, satisfaction, and righteousness. The
    Father loves the Spirit; being the very breath of him, from whence he has
    his name, and proceeding from him, and possessing the same nature and
    essence with him (Job 33:4; Psalm 33:6; John 15:26; 1 John 5:7).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Son loves the Father, of whom he is begotten, with whom he was brought
    up, in whose bosom he lay from all eternity, as his own and only begotten
    Son; and as man, the law of God was in his heart; the sum of which is to
    love the Lord God with all the heart and soul; and as Mediator he showed his
    love to him by an obedience to his commandment, even though that was to
    suffer death for his people (Psalm 40:8; John 14:31, 10:18; Philippians
    2:8).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Son also loves the Spirit, since he proceeds from him, as from the
    Father, and is called the Spirit of the Son, (Galatians 4:6) and Christ
    often speaks of him with pleasure and delight, (Isaiah 48:16, 61:1; John
    14:16, 17, 26, 15:26, 16:7, 13). And the Spirit loves the Father and the
    Son, and sheds abroad the love of them both in the hearts of his people; he
    searches into the deep things of God, and reveals them to them; and takes of
    the things of Christ, and shows them unto them; and so is both the Comforter
    of them, and the Glorifier of him (1 Corinthians 2:10-12; John 16:14).
  </p>
  <p>
    1b. All that God has made is the object of his love; all the works of
    creation, when he had made them, he looked over them, and saw that they were
    good, &quot;very good&quot;, (Genesis 1:31) he was well pleased, and
    delighted with them; yes, he is said to &quot;rejoice in his works&quot;,
    (Psalm 104:31) he upholds all creatures in their beings, and is the
    Preserver of all, both men and beasts; and is good to all, and his tender
    mercies are over all his works, (Psalm 36:6, 145:9) and particularly,
    rational creatures are the objects of his care, love, and delight: he loves
    the holy angels, and has shown his love to them in choosing them to
    happiness; hence they are called &quot;elect angels&quot;, (1 Timothy 5:21)
    by making Christ the head of them, by whom they are confirmed in the estate
    in which they were created, (Colossians 2:10) and by admitting them into his
    presence, allowing them to stand before him, and behold his face, (Matthew
    18:10)
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, even the devils, as they are the creatures of God, are not hated by
    him, but as they are apostate spirits from him: and so he bears a general
    love to all men, as they are his creatures, his offspring, and the work of
    his hands; he supports them, preserves them, and bestows the bounties of his
    providence in common upon them, (Acts 17:28, 14:17; Matthew 5:45) but he
    bears a special love to elect men in Christ; which is called his &quot;great
    love&quot;, (Ephesians 2:4) whom he has chosen and blessed with all
    spiritual blessings in him, (Ephesians 1:3, 4) and which love is
    distinguishing and discriminating (Mal 1:1, 2; Romans 9:11, 12). I go on to,
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Give some instances of the love of God, particularly to chosen men in
    Christ, and who share in the love of Father, Son, and Spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The love of the Father has appeared in thinking of them, thoughts of peace;
    in contriving and forming the scheme of their peace and reconciliation in
    Christ, from eternity, (2 Corinthians 5:18, 19) in choosing them in him from
    the beginning, even from everlasting, to salvation, by him, (2 Thessalonians
    2:13) in putting their persons into the hands of Christ, and securing and
    preserving them in him, (Deuteronomy 33:3; Jude 1:1) in laying up all
    blessings in him for them, and blessing them with them so early, (Ephesians
    1:3, 4) in appointing Christ to be the Savior of them; in providing,
    promising, and sending him into the world, to work out their salvation,
    (John 3:16; 1 John 4:9, 10; Titus 3:4, 5) in the pardon of their sins
    through the blood of Christ, (Isaiah 38:17; Ephesians 1:7) in their
    adoption, (1 John 3:1) in their regeneration and conversion, (Jeremiah 31:3;
    Ephesians 2:4, 5) and in the gift of eternal life unto them (Romans 6:23).
  </p>
  <p>
    The love of the Son of God appears in espousing the persons of the elect,
    those sons of men, in whom his delights were before the world was, (Proverbs
    8:31; Hosea 2:19) in becoming their Surety for good, undertaking their
    cause, engaging to do the will of God with that cheerfulness he did; which
    was to work out their salvation, (Psalm 40:68; Hebrews 7:22) in assuming
    their nature, in the fullness of time, to redeem them, work out a
    righteousness, and make reconciliation for them, (Galatians 4:4, 5; Romans
    8:3, 4; Hebrews 2:14, 17) by giving himself a Sacrifice for them; laying
    down his life on their account; and shedding his blood for the cleansing of
    their souls, and the remission of their sins (Ephesians 5:2, 25; Titus 2:14;
    1 John 3:16; Revelation 1:5).
  </p>
  <p>
    The love of the Spirit, of which mention is made in (Romans 15:30) appears
    in his coming into the hearts of God&#x27;s elect, to convince them of sin
    and righteousness, and to comfort them; by showing the grace of the
    covenant, and the blessings of it to them; by opening and applying the
    promises of it; and by shedding abroad the love of God and Christ in their
    hearts; by implanting every grace in them, and drawing them forth into
    exercise; by witnessing to their spirits their adoption; by assisting them
    in every duty, particularly in prayer, making intercession for them,
    according to the will of God; and in being the earnest, pledge, and seal of
    them to the day of redemption (John 16:7, 8; Romans 8:15, 16, 26, 27;
    Ephesians 1:13, 14).
  </p>
  <p>
    3. It may be proper next to consider the properties of the love of God
    towards chosen men, which will lead more into the nature of it. And,
  </p>
  <p>
    3a. There is no cause of it out of God; there is no motive or inducement to
    it in them, no loveliness in them to excite it; all men by nature are
    corrupt and abominable; rather to be loathed than loved; and those that are
    loved, are no better than others, all being under sin; and are, &quot;by
    nature, children of wrath, as others&quot;; as deserving of that as those
    that are not loved, (Romans 3:9; Ephesians 2:3) what loveliness or beauty is
    in saints, is owing to the righteousness of Christ, imputed to them; which
    is that loveliness that is put upon them, whereby they are made perfectly
    lovely; and to the sanctifying grace of the Spirit, whereby they are all
    glorious within, and appear in the beauties of holiness: so that all this is
    the fruit of the love of God, and not the cause of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor can it be any love in them to God, that is the cause of his to them; for
    they had no love in them when Christ died for them; nor until regenerated by
    the Spirit of God; and when they love him, it is because he first loved
    them, (1 John 4:10, 19) and though Christ is said to love them that love
    him, and the Father is said to love them too; yet this must not be
    understood of the first love of God and Christ, unto them, nor of the first
    display of it; but of further and larger manifestations of it to them; and
    is descriptive of the persons who are most certainly and evidently the
    objects of their love; but not as being the cause of it, (Proverbs 8:17;
    John 14:21, 23, 16:27).
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor are good works the cause of this love; for this, at least, in one
    instance of it, was before either good or evil were done, (Romans 9:11, 12)
    and in other instances it broke forth towards them, and broke in upon them
    while they were yet in their sins, and before they were capable of
    performing good works, (Romans 5:8; Titus 3:3, 4; Ephesians 2:2-4) and how
    can it be thought, that since the best works of men are so impure and
    imperfect as to be reckoned as filthy rags, that these should be the cause
    of God&#x27;s love to men? no, even faith itself is not; that &quot;is the
    gift of God&quot;, and flows from electing love, and is a fruit and evidence
    of it (Ephesians 2:8; Acts 13:48; Titus 1:1).
  </p>
  <p>
    God loves men, not because they have faith; but they have faith given them,
    because God loves them; it is true indeed, that &quot;without faith it is
    impossible to please God&quot;; that is, to do those things which are
    pleasing in his sight; but then the persons of God&#x27;s elect, may be, and
    are, well pleasing to God, in Christ, before faith, and without it. In
    short, the love of God purely flows from his good will and pleasure; who
    &quot;is gracious to whom he will be gracious&quot;, (Exodus 33:19) it is
    that pure river that proceeds out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb, as
    an emblem of sovereignty, (Revelation 22:1) as God loved the people of
    Israel because he loved them, or would love them; and for no other reason,
    (Deuteronomy 7:7, 8) in like manner he loves his spiritual and mystical
    Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
    3b. The love of God is eternal, it does not commence in time, it is without
    beginning, it is from eternity: this is evident from the love of God to
    Christ, which was before the foundation of the world; and with the same love
    he loved him, he loved his people also, and as early, (John 17:23, 24) and
    from various acts of love to them in eternity; as the election of them in
    Christ, which supposes the love of them, (Ephesians 1:4) the covenant of
    grace made with them, in which, grants of grace, and promises of glory, were
    made before the world began; and Christ was set up as the Mediator of it
    from everlasting: all which are strong proofs of love to them (2 Timothy
    1:9; Titus 1:2; Proverbs 8:22, 23).
  </p>
  <p>
    3c. The love of God is immutable, unalterable, and invariable; it is like
    himself, &quot;the same today, yesterday, and for ever&quot;: and, indeed,
    God is love; it is his nature; it is himself; and therefore must be without
    any variableness, or shadow of turning. It admits of no distinctions, by
    which it appears to alter and vary. Some talk of a love of benevolence, by
    which God wishes or wills good to men; and then comes on a love of
    beneficence, and he does good to them, and works good in them: and then a
    love of complacency and delight takes place, and not until then.
  </p>
  <p>
    But this is to make God changeable, as we are: the love of God admits of no
    degrees, it neither increases nor decreases; it is the same from the instant
    in eternity it was, without any change: it is needless to ask whether it is
    the same before as after conversion, since there were as great, if not
    greater gifts of love, bestowed on the object loved, before conversion, as
    after; such as the gift of God himself, in the everlasting covenant; the
    gift of his Son to die for them when in their sins; and the gift of the
    Spirit to them, in order to regenerate, quicken, and convert them; Heaven
    itself, eternal life, is not a greater gift than these; and yet they were
    all before conversion.
  </p>
  <p>
    There never were any stops, lets, or impediments to this love; not the fall
    of Adam, nor the sad effects of it; nor the actual sins and transgressions
    of God&#x27;s people, in a state of nature; nor all their backslidings,
    after called by grace; for still he loves them freely, (Hosea 14:4) for God
    foreknew that they would fall in Adam, with others, that they would be
    transgressors from the womb, and do as evil as they could; yet this hindered
    not his taking up thoughts of love towards them, his choice of them, and
    covenant with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversion makes a change in them; brings them from the power of Satan to
    God, from darkness to light, from bondage to liberty; from fellowship with
    evil men to communion with God: but it makes no change in the love of God;
    God changes his dispensations and dealings with them, but never changes his
    love; he sometimes rebukes and chastises them, but still he loves them; he
    sometimes hides his face from them, but his love continues the same, (Psalm
    89:29-33; Isaiah 54:7-10) the manifestations of his love are various; to
    some they are greater, to others less; and so to the same persons, at
    different times; but love in his own heart is invariable and unchangeable.
  </p>
  <p>
    3d. The love of God endures forever; it is an everlasting love, in that
    sense, (Jeremiah 31:3) it is the bond of union between God and Christ, and
    the elect; and it can never be dissolved; nothing can separate it, nor
    separate from it (Romans 8:35, 38, 39). The union it is the bond of, is next
    to that, and like it, which is between the three divine persons (John 17:21,
    23). The union between soul and body, may be, and is dissolved, at death;
    but neither death nor life can separate from this; this loving-kindness of
    God never departs; though health, and wealth, and friends, and life itself
    may depart, this never will, (Isaiah 54:10) whatever God takes away, as all
    the said things may be taken away by him, he will never take away this,
    (Psalm 89:33) having loved his own which were in the world, he loves them to
    the end, to the end of their lives, to the end of time, and to all eternity
    (John 13:1).
