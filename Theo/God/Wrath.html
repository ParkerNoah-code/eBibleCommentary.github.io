    >, Chapter 17. Of the Anger and Wrath of God:
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides the love and kindness of God, his grace, favor, and good will, his
    mercy, pity, and compassion; and his longsuffering and forbearance; which
    flow from the goodness of his nature; there are other things to be
    considered, which may come under the notion of affections; as anger, wrath,
    hatred, etc. The anger and wrath of God are often used promiscuously in
    Scripture, to signify the same thing, and yet they sometimes seem to be
    distinct; and according to our notion of them, as in men, they may be
    distinguished: anger is a lower and lesser degree of wrath, and wrath is the
    height of anger; and accordingly I shall distinctly consider them, as in
    God.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. The Anger of God. And shall, first, show that it belongs to God; and in
    what sense, and on what account. And, secondly, with whom he is angry; or on
    whom his anger is exercised.
  </p>
  <p>
    1a. First, That Anger belongs to God, or may be predicated of him. This is
    denied by some philosophers of the Cynic and Stoic sects, because it is a
    passion; they allow grace, good will, and beneficence in God to men, but not
    anger; this they suppose to be a weakness, and even a sort of madness, and
    what is unfitting a wise and good man, and much more unfitting Deity. The
    Epicureans deny that either is in God; neither favor and good will, nor
    anger and wrath; for they imagine he has no concern in the affairs of men,
    and neither regards their good actions, nor their bad ones; and so is
    neither pleased nor displeased with them; and is neither kind and favorable
    to them; nor is angry with them, nor resents what is done by them. But the
    scriptures everywhere ascribe anger to God; and often speak of it, as being
    kindled against particular persons, and against whole bodies of men; and
    give many particular instances of it: to produce the whole proof of this,
    would be to transcribe a great part of the Bible.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then anger is to be considered not as a passion, or affection in God, as
    it is in men; and especially as it may be defined from the etymology of the
    Latin word for it &quot;ira&quot;, as given by a learned grammarian,
    deriving it from &quot;ire&quot;, &quot;to go&quot;; as if a man, when in
    anger, goes out of himself; and when he lays it down, returns to himself
    again; this cannot, in any sense, be ascribed to God: rather it may be, as
    if it was &quot;ura&quot;, and so is &quot;as urendo&quot;, from burning; or
    rather from the Hebrew word which signifies to burn; and the anger of God is
    compared to fire in Scripture, and is often said to be kindled.
  </p>
  <p>
    But then we are not to imagine, when God is said to be angry, that there is
    any commotion or perturbation in God&#x27;s mind; that he is ruffled and
    discomposed, or that there is any pain or uneasiness in him, as in human
    minds; so it may be in finite created spirits, but not in an infinite and
    uncreated one, as God is: and much less is this to be considered as a
    criminal passion in him, as it too often is in men; for God is a pure and
    holy being; without iniquity: besides, there may be anger in men without
    sin; we are exhorted to be angry and sin not, (Ephesians 4:26) and it is
    certain there was anger in the human nature of Christ, in whom there was no
    sin, nor was he conscious of any, (Mark 3:5) and so there may be in the
    divine mind, without an imputation of weakness or sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anger in God is no other than a disgust with sin, and with sinners, on
    account of it; it is often said in Scripture, that such and such a thing
    displeased him, or was evil, and not right in his sight (Numbers 11:1; 2
    Samuel 11:27; Psalm 60:1; Isaiah 59:15).
  </p>
  <p>
    All sin is displeasing to God; he cannot take any pleasure in it, nor look
    upon it with delight; it is so contrary to his nature, and repugnant to his
    will, he cannot but have an aversion to it, and an abhorrence of it; and
    there are some sins more especially which provoke him to anger; as the sins
    against the first table of the law, particularly idolatry; which, of all
    sins, is the most provoking to him: since it strikes at his very being, and
    robs him of his glory; see (Deuteronomy 32:16, 21; Judg. 2:12, 13; 1 King
    16:33).
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise distrust of the power and providence of God, murmuring at it, and
    complaining of it; which was often the case of the Israelites; and by which
    they provoked the Lord to anger; so perjury, false swearing, the taking of
    the name of God in vain, and blasphemy of it; profanation of the Lord&#x27;s
    day, and neglect of his word, worship, and ordinances: and not these only,
    but sins against the second table of the law, are highly displeasing to God,
    and resented by him; as disobedience to parents, murder, adultery, theft,
    false witness, covetousness, and every evil thing (see Isaiah 5:24, 25).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now &quot;who knows the power of God&#x27;s anger?&quot; (Psalm 90:11)
    nothing can resist it, nor stand before it; not rocks and mountains, which
    are overturned and cast down by it; nor the mightiest monarchs, nor the
    proudest mortals, nor the stoutest and adamantine hearts; none can stand
    before God when once he is angry, (Job 9:5, 13; Psalm 76:7; Nah. 1:6).
  </p>
  <p>
    1b. Secondly, The objects of the anger of God, or on whom it is exercised.
    &quot;God is angry with the wicked every day&quot;, (Psalm 7:11) because
    they are daily sinning against him; their whole lives are one continued
    series and course of wickedness; all they do is sin; their very actions in
    civil life, the ploughing of the wicked, is sin; and all their religious
    services are but &quot;splendida peccata&quot;, &quot;shining sins&quot;,
    and so are displeasing to God, and resented by him; their sacrifices,
    brought with a wicked mind, without a right principle, and a right end, are
    an abomination to him, (Proverbs 21:4, 27) being in the flesh, in an
    unregenerate state, they cannot please God, nor do the things which are
    pleasing in his sight; being destitute of the grace of God, and particularly
    of faith; &quot;without which it is impossible to please him.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    These, though God is angry with them continually, yet they do not always
    appear under the visible and public tokens of his resentment; the &quot;rod
    of God&quot; is not on them; nor are they in trouble, as other men, and have
    more than heart can wish; oftentimes their families, flocks, and herds,
    increase; and they spend their days in health, wealth, and pleasure, (Job
    21:7-13; Psalm 73:3-12) and seem as if they were the favorites of Heaven,
    and think themselves to be such. But though God is slow to anger, as he is
    often described, moves slowly to express his anger; yet he will most
    certainly do it in the issue of things; and though men may promise
    themselves impunity in sin, and fancy they shall have peace when they walk
    after the imagination of their evil hearts, and add sin to sin; yet at
    length God will not spare them; but his anger and jealousy shall smoke
    against them, and all the curses written in the law shall come upon them,
    (Deuteronomy 29:19, 20).
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, God is angry with his own special people, holy and good men; we
    read of his anger being kindled against Aaron and Miriam, for speaking
    against Moses; and against Moses and Aaron, for not sanctifying him before
    the children of Israel; insomuch that neither of them were admitted to enter
    the land of Canaan; and against David, Solomon, and others, for sins
    committed by them.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this is not at all inconsistent with the love of God unto them: anger is
    not opposite to love; there may be anger in the nearest and dearest
    relatives; and where there is the most affectionate regard to each other:
    the anger of Jacob was kindled against his beloved Rachel; a father may be
    angry with his son, and chastise him for a fault, and yet dearly love him;
    and a son may be angry with a father, as Jonathan was with Saul, yet bear a
    true filial affection for him. God loves his people with an everlasting and
    unchangeable love, and never alters and varies in it; and yet may be angry,
    that is, displeased with them, and show his resentment at sin committed by
    them, by his chastisement of them, and still continue his love to them; for
    even that is done in love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides, the anger of God towards them, is often only in their sense and
    apprehension of it; when God goes forth towards them, in some dispensations
    of his, which are not agreeable to them, they conclude he is angry with
    them; and when these dispensations are varied, then they suppose his anger
    is turned away from them, (Isaiah 12:1) so when he hides his face from them,
    and unbelief prevails, they interpret it, putting them away in anger, and
    shutting up his tender mercies in anger, (Psalm 27:9, 77:9) when he seems to
    turn a deaf ear to their prayers, and does not give an immediate answer to
    them; this they call being angry against the prayer of his people, (Psalm
    80:4) and when he afflicts them, in one way or another, then they apprehend
    he comes forth in anger against them; and &quot;they have no soundness in
    their flesh, because of his anger; nor rest in their bones, because of their
    sins&quot;, (Psalm 38:3) but when he takes off his afflicting hand, grants
    his gracious presence, and manifests his pardoning love and grace, then they
    conclude he has turned himself from the fierceness of his anger (Psalm 85:2,
    3).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now this apparent anger, or appearance of anger, &quot;endures but for a
    moment&quot;, (Psalm 30:5) a very short space of time indeed; though God
    hides his face from his people, and chides them for their sins: yet he does
    not keep anger for ever: this is the criterion by which he is distinguished
    from other gods, in that he retains not his anger forever, because he
    delights in mercy, (Psalm 103:9; Micah 7:18) and in this the anger of God
    towards his people, differs from his anger to wicked men, since the one is
    but for a moment, and the other is continual.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The Wrath of God is the heat of his great anger, (Deuteronomy 29:24) it
    is his anger not only kindled and incensed, but blown up into a flame; it is
    the &quot;indignation&quot; of his anger, the &quot;fury&quot; and
    &quot;fierceness&quot; of it, (Isaiah 30:30, 42:25; Hosea 11:9) and it seems
    to be no other than his punitive justice, and includes his will to punish
    sinners according to the demerit of their sins in strict justice; his
    threatenings to do it, and the actual execution of it; which is the
    vengeance that belongs to him, and he will recompense; even his vindictive
    wrath, or vengeful judgment; &quot;What if God willing to show his
    wrath&quot;, etc.? (Romans 9:22). Now the wrath of God may be considered,
  </p>
  <p>
    2a. As temporary, or what is executed in the present life; of which there
    have been many instances and examples, and there will be more; and a brief
    review of them will give a more enlarged idea of the wrath of God. Not to
    take notice of the apostate angels, whom God has cast down to Hell; where,
    though they may not be in full torment, yet are dreadful instances of the
    wrath of God against sin; since not one of them have been spared, or have
    shared in pardoning grace and mercy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I shall only observe what examples of it have been, or will be, among men.
    The first instance of it is in the condemnation of Adam, and all his
    posterity, for the first sin, and for only one single sin of his. How great
    must that sin be! what sinfulness must there be in it! how greatly must the
    divine Being be incensed by it! in that, for it, he has caused death, that
    is, his wrath to pass in judgment on him, and all his offspring; so that, in
    consequence of it, all the children of Adam are the children of God&#x27;s
    wrath. The next is the drowning of the old world, when full of violence and
    corruption; so that God repented he had made man in it, and it grieved him
    to the heart; and in his wrath he determined to destroy man and beast in it;
    and which he did, by bringing a flood on the world of the ungodly. Then
    follows another, though not so general; but limited and restrained to a part
    of the world; the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and others of the plain;
    whose inhabitants being notorious sinners, provoked the eyes of God&#x27;s
    glory to such a degree, that he rained fire and brimstone from Heaven upon
    them; and set them as an example and emblem of men&#x27;s suffering the
    vengeance of eternal fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, for not letting Israel go, when
    demanded of them, is another instance of the wrath of God; for by inflicting
    these on them, he not only made a way to his anger, to show it forth, as the
    Psalmist says; but, as he also observes, &quot;he cast upon them the
    fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble&quot;, (Psalm
    78:49, 50).
  </p>
  <p>
    The children of Israel themselves often provoked the Lord to wrath; and
    brought it down upon them, for their sins; as at Horeb, when they made the
    calf; at Taberah, Massah, and Kibrothhattaavah, where they murmured against
    the Lord, (Deuteronomy 9:8, 19, 22) as they did likewise at the report of
    the spies, concerning the land of Canaan; when &quot;God swore in his wrath,
    they should not enter into his rest.&quot; And again, upon the affair of
    Korah, and his accomplices, when wrath went forth from the Lord, and the
    plague began, (Numbers 14:23, 16:46).
  </p>
  <p>
    Witness, also, each of their captivities; particularly their captivity in
    Babylon, through their mocking at, and misuse of the prophets of the Lord;
    so that wrath arose against them; and there was no remedy; and their last
    captivity, and destruction, by the Romans; when wrath came upon them to the
    uttermost; and under which wrath, and in which captivity they are to this
    day. Whenever the four sore judgments of God, the sword, famine, pestilence,
    and wild beasts, have been exercised in the world, as they often have been;
    they are always in wrath; and these with earthquakes, and such like uncommon
    events, are presignifications, and foretokens of greater wrath yet to come;
    and in a little while, the seven vials full of the wrath of God, will be
    poured forth on antichrist, and on the anti-christian states; and the
    judgment of God will come on Babylon in one day.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when the end of all things is come, the earth, and all in it will be
    burnt with fire, and the heavens melt away with fervent heat; the day of the
    Lord will burn like an oven, and the wicked, like stubble, will be burnt up
    by it, and will have neither root nor branch left: all which will be
    expressive of the great wrath of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    But there is no greater instance of it, or what more fully demonstrates it,
    than what our Lord Jesus Christ suffered and endured as the Surety of his
    people, in their room and stead; when, their sins being imputed to him, were
    found on him, and he was stricken for them; the sword of justice was
    sheathed in him; the vindictive wrath of God was poured forth upon him, to
    the uttermost of the demerit of sin; God spared him not: how inconceivably
    great must his wrath be against sin, when God spared not in the least his
    own dearly beloved Son, but suffered him to be put to the most exquisite
    pain, both in body and soul, for the sins of his people! 2b. There is the
    wrath of God that is yet to come: the Scriptures speak of future wrath;
    wrath that will take place in the life which is to come; which in part,
    commences at the death of wicked men; and will be complete at their
    resurrection from the dead (Matthew 3:7; 1 Thessalonians 1:10).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is expressed by fire, than which nothing is more intolerable; even
    devouring fire and everlasting burnings, not to be endured; this is no other
    than the curse of the law that is broken; which not only reaches to this
    life, but to that which is to come; it is the same with the second death;
    which lies in a separation from God, and, in a sense of his hot displeasure;
    it is called Hell and Hell fire; the word for which, in the New Testament,
    is taken from Gehinnom, or the valley of Hinnom; where the Jews burnt their
    children in sacrifice to Molech; and which place, from the beating of drums
    in it, that the shrieks of the children might not be heard by their parents,
    was called Tophet; of which the prophet says, as an emblem of Hell fire, or
    the fire of divine wrath; &quot;Tophet is ordained of old — the pile thereof
    is fire, and much wood: the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone,
    does kindle it&quot;, (Isaiah 30:33) which is an awful representation of the
    wrath of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    And by whatever term this state of wrath is expressed, it is always spoken
    of as what will continue forever: it is called everlasting fire, everlasting
    punishment, everlasting destruction, &quot;the smoke of torment, that
    ascends forever and ever&quot;; and for the commencement of which, in its
    full extent, there is a day fixed, called, &quot;the day of wrath, and
    righteous judgment of God&quot;; until which time God reserves wrath for his
    adversaries; it is laid up in store with him, among his treasures, and will
    be ever laying out, and pouring forth.
  </p>
  <p>
    As to the objects of this wrath, seeing it is revealed against all
    unrighteousness and ungodliness of men; it lies against all that are
    unrighteous and ungodly; and as all have sinned, and are under sin, all are
    &quot;children of wrath&quot;, (Ephesians 2:3; Romans 1:18, 3:9, 23) but
    there are some particularly described, on whom this wrath comes, and they
    are called &quot;children of disobedience&quot;, (Ephesians 5:5, 6;
    Colossians 3:5, 6) such who are disobedient to the light of nature, rebel
    against it, and hold truth in unrighteousness, which that discovers; and so
    as they sin without law, they perish without law, (Romans 1:18, 19, 21, 28,
    2:12) and who also are disobedient to the law of God, break it, and are
    convicted by it, as transgressors, whom it pronounces guilty, and is the
    ministration of condemnation and death unto them.
  </p>
  <p>
    And who are disobedient to the gospel of Christ, obey not the truth, but
    obey unrighteousness, and are slaves to their sinful lusts and pleasures; on
    these come indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish; even on every
    soul of man that does evil, (2 Thessalonians 1:8; Romans 2:8, 9) they are
    also represented as unbelievers: &quot;He who believes not the Son, shall
    not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him&quot;: he who does not
    believe that Christ is the Son of God, that he is the Messiah and Savior of
    men, the sentence of wrath, which the law has passed on him, as a
    transgressor of that, remains; and since he denies divine revelation,
    rejects the gospel scheme, and disbelieves Christ as a Savior, and salvation
    by him, there is no help for him; wrath is on him, and that without remedy,
    it must abide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is not any sort of unbelief for which this wrath is, and abides; not
    for that which is through the want of the means of faith, such as in
    heathens; for &quot;how shall they believe on him of whom they have not
    heard?&quot; (Romans 10:14, 17) nor which is through the want of the special
    grace of faith, which is the gift of God, and peculiar to his elect, and
    which he only can give, and yet denies it; and which, without his grace
    given, they can never have: but it is the disbelief of the report of the
    gospel, by such who have the opportunity of reading and hearing it, and yet
    either attend not to the evidence of it; or, notwithstanding that, reject
    it; they receive not the record God has given of his Son, and so make him a
    liar, than which nothing is more provoking to wrath (1 John 5:10). This was
    the case of the Jews of old, (John 3:19) and is of the deists of the present
    age. In short, the wrath of God comes upon men either for their sins against
    the light of nature, or against the law of God, or against the gospel of
    Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some on whom no wrath comes here, nor hereafter; who are the
    vessels of mercy, afore prepared for glory: concerning whom Jehovah says,
    &quot;fury is not in me&quot;; and to whom he is all love, &quot;love&quot;
    itself, (Isaiah 27:4; 1 John 4:16) being sinners indeed, and transgressors
    of the law of God, they are children of wrath as others, (Ephesians 2:3)
    which phrase not only means that they are serving of wrath, but that, as
    they are sinners, they are found guilty of it; and not only found guilty,
    but are condemned unto it; they are really under the sentence of wrath,
    condemnation, and death; they are obnoxious to the curse of the law, which
    is no other than the wrath of God; they are liable to it, and in danger of
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    And being so near it, how is it that they escape it, and are secured from
    it? They are secured from it by the decree of God, who has appointed them
    not to wrath, but to obtain salvation, (1 Thessalonians 5:9) which decree is
    unfrustrable by the oath of God, who has swore that he will not be wrath
    with them, (Isaiah 54:9) which is immutable: by the suretyship engagements
    of Christ for them, to bear it in their room; and until that was done, God
    forbore to execute the sentence; called the forbearance of God, (Romans
    3:25) by Christ&#x27;s actually bearing the chastisement of their peace; by
    being made a curse for them, and enduring the wrath of God in their room;
    whereby he delivered them from wrath to come, (Psalm 89:38; 1 Thessalonians
    5:10) and by his righteousness imputed to them, through which, being
    justified, they are saved from wrath, (Romans 5:9).
  </p>
  <p>
    Though even these persons may have, at times, some apprehensions of the
    wrath of God; as, particularly, under first awakenings, and convictions of
    sin; when the law works a sense of wrath in them, and leaves in them a
    fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation; when they flee to
    Christ, from wrath to come, and say, &quot;Lord, save us, or we
    perish&quot;; and afterwards, when under the hiding of God&#x27;s face, or
    his afflicting hand is upon them, they imagine that the wrath of God lies
    hard upon them, and his fierce wrath goes over them, (Psalm 88:7, 16;
    Lamentations 3:1) but in reality, there is no wrath comes upon them now;
    their afflictions and chastisements are all in love; and there will be no
    curse hereafter; but they shall always see the face of God, and be &quot;in
    his presence, where are fullness of joy, and pleasures for evermore&quot;
    (Revelation 3:19, 22:3, 4).
