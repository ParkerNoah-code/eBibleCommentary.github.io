  <h2>I. Sources of Theology.</h2>
  <p>
    God himself, in the last analysis, must be the only source of knowledge with
    regard to his own being and relations. Theology is therefore a summary and
    explanation of the content of God&#x27;s self-revelations. These are, first,
    the revelation of God in nature; secondly and supremely, the revelation of
    God in the Scriptures.

        Ambrose: “To whom shall I give greater credit concerning God than to God
        himself?”Von Baader: “To know God without God is impossible; there is no
        knowledge without him who is the prime source of knowledge.” C. A.
        Briggs, Whither, 8—“God reveals truth in several spheres: in universal
        nature, in the constitution of mankind, in the history of our race, in
        the Sacred Scriptures, but above all in the person of Jesus Christ our
        Lord.” F. H. Johnson, What is Reality? 399—“The teacher intervenes when
        needed. Revelation helps reason and conscience, but is not a substitute
        for them. But Catholicism affirms this substitution for the church, and
        Protestantism for the Bible. The Bible, like nature, gives many free
        gifts, but more in the germ. Growing ethical ideals must interpret the
        Bible.” A. J. F. Behrends: “The Bible is only a telescope, not the eye
        which sees, nor the stars which the telescope brings to view. It is your
        business and mine to see the stars with our own eyes.” Schurman,
        Agnosticism, 178—“The Bible is a glass through which to see the living
        God. But it is useless when you put your eyes out.”

        We can know God only so far as he has revealed himself. The immanent God
        is known, but the transcendent God we do not know any more than we know
        the side of the moon that is turned away from us. A. H. Strong, Christ
        in Creation, 118—“The word ‘authority’ is derived from auctor, augeo,
        ‘to add.’ Authority adds something to the truth communicated. The thing
        added is the personal element of witness. This is needed wherever there
        is ignorance which cannot be removed by our own effort, or unwillingness
        which results from our own sin. In religion I need to add to my own
        knowledge that which God imparts. Reason, conscience, church, Scripture,
        are all delegated and subordinate authorities; the only original and
        supreme authority is God himself, or Christ, who is only God revealed
        and made comprehensible by us.” Gore, Incarnation, 181—“All legitimate
        authority represents the reason of God, educating the reason of man and
        communicating itself to it.... Man is made in God&#x27;s image: he is,
        in his fundamental capacity, a son of God, and he becomes so in fact,
        and fully, through union with Christ. Therefore in the truth of God, as
        Christ presents it to him, he can recognize his own better reason,—to
        use Plato&#x27;s beautiful expression, he can salute it by force of
        instinct as something akin to himself, before he can give intellectual
        account of it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 332-337, holds that there is no such
        thing as unassisted reason, and that, even if there were, natural
        religion is not one of its products. Behind all evolution of our own
        reason, he says, stands the Supreme Reason. “Conscience, ethical ideals,
        capacity for admiration, sympathy, repentance, righteous indignation, as
        well as our delight in beauty and truth, are all derived from God.”
        Kaftan, in Am. Jour. Theology, 1900; 718, 719, maintains that there is
        no other principle for dogmatics than Holy Scripture. Yet he holds that
        knowledge never comes directly from Scripture, but from faith. The order
        is not: Scripture, doctrine, faith; but rather, Scripture, faith,
        doctrine. Scripture is no more a direct authority than is the church.
        Revelation is addressed to the whole man, that is, to the will of the
        man, and it claims obedience from him. Since all Christian knowledge is
        mediated through faith, it rests on obedience to the authority of
        revelation, and revelation is self-manifestation on the part of God.
        Kaftan should have recognized more fully that not simply Scripture, but
        all knowable truth, is a revelation from God, and that Christ is “the
        light which lighteth every man” (John 1:9). Revelation is an organic
        whole, which begins in nature, but finds its climax and key in the
        historical Christ whom Scripture presents to us. See H. C. Minton&#x27;s
        review of Martineau&#x27;s Seat of Authority, in Presb. and Ref. Rev.,
        Apr. 1900:203 sq.

    <h2>1. Scripture and Nature.</h2>
    <p>
      By nature we here mean not only physical facts, or facts with regard to
      the substances, properties, forces, and laws of the material world, but
      also spiritual facts, or facts with regard to the intellectual and moral
      constitution of man, and the orderly arrangement of human society and
      history.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        We here use the word “nature” in the ordinary sense, as including man.
        There is another and more proper use of the word “nature,” which makes
        it simply a complex of forces and beings under the law of cause and
        effect. To nature in this sense man belongs only as respects his body,
        while as immaterial and personal he is a supernatural being. Free will
        is not under the law of physical and mechanical causation. As Bushnell
        has said: “Nature and the supernatural together constitute the one
        system of God.” Drummond, Natural Law in the Spiritual World,
        232—“Things are natural or supernatural according to where we stand. Man
        is supernatural to the mineral; God is supernatural to the man.” We
        shall in subsequent chapters use the term “nature” in the narrow sense.
        The universal use of the phrase “Natural Theology,”however, compels us
        in this chapter to employ the word “nature” in its broader sense as
        including man, although we do this under protest, and with this
        explanation of the more proper meaning of the term. See Hopkins, in
        Princeton Review, Sept. 1882:183 sq.
      </p>
      <p>
        E. G. Robinson: “Bushnell separates nature from the supernatural. Nature
        is a blind train of causes. God has nothing to do with it, except as he
        steps into it from without. Man is supernatural, because he is outside
        of nature, having the power of originating an independent train of
        causes.” If this were the proper conception of nature, then we might be
        compelled to conclude with P. T. Forsyth, in Faith and Criticism,
        100—“There is no revelation in nature. There can be none, because there
        is no forgiveness. We cannot be sure about her. She is only aesthetic.
        Her ideal is harmony, not reconciliation.... For the conscience,
        stricken or strong, she has no word.... Nature does not contain her own
        teleology, and for the moral soul that refuses to be fancy-fed, Christ
        is the one luminous smile on the dark face of the world.”But this is
        virtually to confine Christ&#x27;s revelation to Scripture or to the
        incarnation. As there was an astronomy without the telescope, so there
        was a theology before the Bible. George Harris, Moral Evolution,
        411—“Nature is both evolution and revelation. As soon as the question
        How is answered, the questions Whence and Why arise. Nature is to God
        what speech is to thought.” The title of Henry Drummond&#x27;s book
        should have been: “Spiritual Law in the Natural World,” for nature is
        but the free though regular activity of God; what we call the
        supernatural is simply his extraordinary working.
      </p>

    <p>
      (a) Natural theology.—The universe is a source of theology. The Scriptures
      assert that God has revealed himself in nature. There is not only an
      outward witness to his existence and character in the constitution and
      government of the universe (Ps. 19; Acts 14:17; Rom. 1:20), but an inward
      witness to his existence and character in the heart of every man (Rom.
      1:17, 18, 19, 20, 32; 2:15). The systematic exhibition of these facts,
      whether derived from observation, history or science, constitutes natural
      theology.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        Outward witness: Ps.19:1-6—“The heavens declare the glory of God”; Acts
        14:17—“he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and
        gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons”; Rom. 1:20—“for the
        invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly
        seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his
        everlasting power and divinity.” Inward witness: Rom. 1:19—τὸ γνωστὸν
        τοῦ Θεοῦ = “that which is known of God is manifest in them.” Compare the
        ἀποκαλύπτεται of the gospel in verse 17, with the ἀποκαλύπτεται of wrath
        in verse 18—two revelations, one of ὀργή, the other of χάρις; see Shedd,
        Homiletics, 11. Rom. 1:32—“knowing the ordinance of God”; 2:15—“they
        show the work of the law written in their hearts.” Therefore even the
        heathen are “without excuse” (Rom. 1:20). There are two books: Nature
        and Scripture—one written, the other unwritten: and there is need of
        studying both. On the passages in Romans, see the Commentary of Hodge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spurgeon told of a godly person who, when sailing down the Rhine, closed
        his eyes, lest the beauty of the scene should divert his mind from
        spiritual themes. The Puritan turned away from the moss-rose, saying
        that he would count nothing on earth lovely. But this is to despise
        God&#x27;s works. J. H. Barrows: “The Himalayas are the raised letters
        upon which we blind children put our fingers to spell out the name of
        God.”To despise the works of God is to despise God himself. God is
        present in nature, and is now speaking. Ps. 19:1—“The heavens declare
        the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork”—present
        tenses. Nature is not so much a book, as a voice. Hutton, Essays,
        2:236—“The direct knowledge of spiritual communion must be supplemented
        by knowledge of God&#x27;s ways gained from the study of nature. To
        neglect the study of the natural mysteries of the universe leads to an
        arrogant and illicit intrusion of moral and spiritual assumptions into a
        different world. This is the lesson of the book of Job.” Hatch, Hibbert
        Lectures, 85—“Man, the servant and interpreter of nature, is also, and
        is thereby, the servant and interpreter of the living God.” Books of
        science are the record of man&#x27;s past interpretations of God&#x27;s
        works.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      (b) Natural theology supplemented.—The Christian revelation is the chief
      source of theology. The Scriptures plainly declare that the revelation of
      God in nature does not supply all the knowledge which a sinner needs (Acts
      17:23; Eph. 3:9). This revelation is therefore supplemented by another, in
      which divine attributes and merciful provisions only dimly shadowed forth
      in nature are made known to men. This latter revelation consists of a
      series of supernatural events and communications, the record of which is
      presented in the Scriptures.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        Acts 17:23—Paul shows that, though the Athenians, in the erection of an
        altar to an unknown God, “acknowledged a divine existence beyond any
        which the ordinary rites of their worship recognized, that Being was
        still unknown to them; they had no just conception of his nature and
        perfections” (Hackett, in loco). Eph. 3:9—“the mystery which hath been
        hid in God”—this mystery is in the gospel made known for man&#x27;s
        salvation. Hegel, in his Philosophy of Religion, says that Christianity
        is the only revealed religion, because the Christian God is the only one
        from whom a revelation can come. We may add that as science is the
        record of man&#x27;s progressive interpretation of God&#x27;s revelation
        in the realm of nature, so Scripture is the record of man&#x27;s
        progressive interpretation of God&#x27;s revelation in the realm of
        spirit. The phrase “word of God” does not primarily denote a record,—it
        is the spoken word, the doctrine, the vitalizing truth, disclosed by
        Christ; see Mat. 13:19—“heareth the word of the kingdom”; Luke
        5:1—“heard the word of God”; Acts 8:25—“spoken the word of the Lord”;
        13:48, 49—“glorified the word of God: ... the word of the Lord was
        spread abroad”; 19:10, 20—“heard the word of the Lord, ... mightily grew
        the word of the Lord”; 1 Cor. 1:18—“the word of the cross”—all
        designating not a document, but an unwritten word; cf.Jer. 1:4—“the word
        of Jehovah came unto me”; Ez. 1:3—“the word of Jehovah came expressly
        unto Ezekiel, the priest.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      (c) The Scriptures the final standard of appeal.—Science and Scripture
      throw light upon each other. The same divine Spirit who gave both
      revelations is still present, enabling the believer to interpret the one
      by the other and thus progressively to come to the knowledge of the truth.
      Because of our finiteness and sin, the total record in Scripture of
      God&#x27;s past communications is a more trustworthy source of theology
      than are our conclusions from nature or our private impressions of the
      teaching of the Spirit. Theology therefore looks to the Scripture itself
      as its chief source of material and its final standard of appeal.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        There is an internal work of the divine Spirit by which the outer word
        is made an inner word, and its truth and power are manifested to the
        heart. Scripture represents this work of the Spirit, not as a giving of
        new truth, but as an illumination of the mind to perceive the fulness of
        meaning which lay wrapped up in the truth already revealed. Christ is
        “the truth” (John 14:6); “in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and
        knowledge hidden” (Col. 2:3); the Holy Spirit, Jesus says, “shall take
        of mine, and shall declare it unto you” (John 16:14). The incarnation
        and the Cross express the heart of God and the secret of the universe;
        all discoveries in theology are but the unfolding of truth involved in
        these facts. The Spirit of Christ enables us to compare nature with
        Scripture, and Scripture with nature, and to correct mistakes in
        interpreting the one by light gained from the other. Because the church
        as a whole, by which we mean the company of true believers in all lands
        and ages, has the promise that it shall be guided “into all the truth”
        (John 16:13), we may confidently expect the progress of Christian
        doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christian experience is sometimes regarded as an original source of
        religious truth. Experience, however, is but a testing and proving of
        the truth objectively contained in God&#x27;s revelation. The word
        “experience” is derived from experior, to test, to try. Christian
        consciousness is not “norma normans,” but “norma normata.” Light, like
        life, comes to us through the mediation of others. Yet the first comes
        from God as really as the last, of which without hesitation we say: “God
        made me,” though we have human parents. As I get through the
        service-pipe in my house the same water which is stored in the reservoir
        upon the hillside, so in the Scriptures I get the same truth which the
        Holy Spirit originally communicated to prophets and apostles. Calvin,
        Institutes, book I, chap. 7—“As nature has an immediate manifestation of
        God in conscience, a mediate in his works, so revelation has an
        immediate manifestation of God in the Spirit, a mediate in the
        Scriptures.” “Man&#x27;s nature,” said Spurgeon, “is not an organized
        lie, yet his inner consciousness has been warped by sin, and though once
        it was an infallible guide to truth and duty, sin has made it very
        deceptive. The standard of infallibility is not in man&#x27;s
        consciousness, but in the Scriptures. When consciousness in any matter
        is contrary to the word of God, we must know that it is not God&#x27;s
        voice within us, but the devil&#x27;s.” Dr. George A. Gordon says that
        “Christian history is a revelation of Christ additional to that
        contained in the New Testament.”Should we not say “illustrative,”
        instead of “additional”? On the relation between Christian experience
        and Scripture, see Stearns, Evidence of Christian Experience, 286-309:
        Twesten, Dogmatik, 1:344-348; Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:15.
      </p>
      <p>
        H. H. Bawden: “God is the ultimate authority, but there are delegated
        authorities, such as family, state, church; instincts, feelings,
        conscience; the general experience of the race, traditions, utilities;
        revelation in nature and in Scripture. But the highest authority
        available for men in morals and religion is the truth concerning Christ
        contained in the Christian Scriptures. What the truth concerning Christ
        is, is determined by: (1) the human reason, conditioned by a right
        attitude of the feelings and the will; (2) in the light of all the truth
        derived from nature, including man; (3) in the light of the history of
        Christianity; (4) in the light of the origin and development of the
        Scriptures themselves. The authority of the generic reason and the
        authority of the Bible are co-relative, since they both have been
        developed in the providence of God, and since the latter is in large
        measure but the reflection of the former. This view enables us to hold a
        rational conception of the function of the Scripture in religion. This
        view, further, enables us to rationalize what is called the inspiration
        of the Bible, the nature and extent of inspiration, the Bible as
        history—a record of the historic unfolding of revelation; the Bible as
        literature—a compend of life-principles, rather than a book of rules;
        the Bible Christocentric—an incarnation of the divine thought and will
        in human thought and language.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      (d) The theology of Scripture not unnatural.—Though we speak of the
      systematized truths of nature as constituting natural theology, we are not
      to infer that Scriptural theology is unnatural. Since the Scriptures have
      the same author as nature, the same principles are illustrated in the one
      as in the other. All the doctrines of the Bible have their reason in that
      same nature of God which constitutes the basis of all material things.
      Christianity is a supplementary dispensation, not as contradicting, or
      correcting errors in, natural theology, but as more perfectly revealing
      the truth. Christianity is indeed the ground-plan upon which the whole
      creation is built—the original and eternal truth of which natural theology
      is but a partial expression. Hence the theology of nature and the theology
      of Scripture are mutually dependent. Natural theology not only prepares
      the way for, but it receives stimulus and aid from, Scriptural theology.
      Natural theology may now be a source of truth, which, before the
      Scriptures came, it could not furnish.
    </p>

        John Caird, Fund. Ideas of Christianity. 23—“There is no such thing as a
        natural religion or religion of reason distinct from revealed religion.
        Christianity is more profoundly, more comprehensively, rational, more
        accordant with the deepest principles of human nature and human thought
        than is natural religion; or, as we may put it, Christianity is natural
        religion elevated and transmuted into revealed.” Peabody, Christianity
        the Religion of Nature, lecture 2—“Revelation is the unveiling,
        uncovering of what previously existed, and it excludes the idea of
        newness, invention, creation.... The revealed religion of earth is the
        natural religion of heaven.” Compare Rev. 13:8—“the Lamb that hath been
        slain from the foundation of the world” = the coming of Christ was no
        make-shift; in a true sense the Cross existed in eternity; the atonement
        is a revelation of an eternal fact in the being of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note Plato&#x27;s illustration of the cave which can be easily threaded
        by one who has previously entered it with a torch. Nature is the dim
        light from the cave&#x27;s mouth; the torch is Scripture. Kant to
        Jacobi, in Jacobi&#x27;s Werke, 3:523—“If the gospel had not previously
        taught the universal moral laws, reason would not yet have obtained so
        perfect an insight into them.” Alexander McLaren: “Non-Christian
        thinkers now talk eloquently about God&#x27;s love, and even reject the
        gospel in the name of that love, thus kicking down the ladder by which
        they have climbed. But it was the Cross that taught the world the love
        of God, and apart from the death of Christ men may hope that there is a
        heart at the centre of the universe, but they can never be sure of
        it.”The parrot fancies that he taught men to talk. So Mr. Spencer
        fancies that he invented ethics. He is only using the twilight, after
        his sun has gone down. Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theol., 252, 253—“Faith, at
        the Reformation, first gave scientific certainty; it had God sure: hence
        it proceeded to banish scepticism in philosophy and science.”See also

    <h2>2. Scripture and Rationalism.</h2>
    <p>
      Although the Scriptures make known much that is beyond the power of
      man&#x27;s unaided reason to discover or fully to comprehend, their
      teachings, when taken together, in no way contradict a reason conditioned
      in its activity by a holy affection and enlightened by the Spirit of God.
      To reason in the large sense, as including the mind&#x27;s power of
      cognizing God and moral relations—not in the narrow sense of mere
      reasoning, or the exercise of the purely logical faculty—the Scriptures
      continually appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. The proper office of reason, in this large sense, is: (a) To furnish us
      with those primary ideas of space, time, cause, substance, design, right,
      and God, which are the conditions of all subsequent knowledge. (b) To
      judge with regard to man&#x27;s need of a special and supernatural
      revelation. (c) To examine the credentials of communications professing to
      be, or of documents professing to record, such a revelation. (d) To
      estimate and reduce to system the facts of revelation, when these have
      been found properly attested. (e) To deduce from these facts their natural
      and logical conclusions. Thus reason itself prepares the way for a
      revelation above reason, and warrants an implicit trust in such revelation
      when once given.

        Dove, Logic of the Christian Faith, 318—“Reason terminates in the
        proposition: Look for revelation.” Leibnitz: “Revelation is the viceroy
        who first presents his credentials to the provincial assembly (reason),
        and then himself presides.” Reason can recognize truth after it is made
        known, as for example in the demonstrations of geometry, although it
        could never discover that truth for itself. See Calderwood&#x27;s
        illustration of the party lost in the woods, who wisely take the course
        indicated by one at the tree-top with a larger view than their own
        (Philosophy of the Infinite, 126). The novice does well to trust his
        guide in the forest, at least till he learns to recognise for himself
        the marks blazed upon the trees. Luthardt, Fund. Truths, lect.
        viii—“Reason could never have invented a self-humiliating God, cradled
        in a manger and dying on a cross.” Lessing, Zur Geschichte und
        Litteratur, 6:134—“What is the meaning of a revelation that reveals
        nothing?”

        Ritschl denies the presuppositions of any theology based on the Bible as
        the infallible word of God on the one hand, and on the validity of the
        knowledge of God as obtained by scientific and philosophic processes on
        the other. Because philosophers, scientists, and even exegetes, are not
        agreed among themselves, he concludes that no trustworthy results are
        attainable by human reason. We grant that reason without love will fall
        into many errors with regard to God, and that faith is therefore the
        organ by which religious truth is to be apprehended. But we claim that
        this faith includes reason, and is itself reason in its highest form.
        Faith criticizes and judges the processes of natural science as well as
        the contents of Scripture. But it also recognizes in science and
        Scripture prior workings of that same Spirit of Christ which is the
        source and authority of the Christian life. Ritschl ignores
        Christ&#x27;s world-relations and therefore secularizes and disparages
        science and philosophy. The faith to which he trusts as the source of
        theology is unwarrantably sundered from reason. It becomes a subjective
        and arbitrary standard, to which even the teaching of Scripture must
        yield precedence. We hold on the contrary, that there are ascertained
        results in science and in philosophy, as well as in the interpretation
        of Scripture as a whole, and that these results constitute an
        authoritative revelation. See Orr, The Theology of Ritschl; Dorner,
        Hist. Prot. Theol., 1:233—“The unreasonable in the empirical reason is
        taken captive by faith, which is the nascent true reason that despairs
        of itself and trustfully lays hold of objective Christianity.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      B. Rationalism, on the other hand, holds reason to be the ultimate source
      of all religious truth, while Scripture is authoritative only so far as
      its revelations agree with previous conclusions of reason, or can be
      rationally demonstrated. Every form of rationalism, therefore, commits at
      least one of the following errors: (a) That of confounding reason with
      mere reasoning, or the exercise of the logical intelligence. (b) That of
      ignoring the necessity of a holy affection as the condition of all right
      reason in religious things. (c) That of denying our dependence in our
      present state of sin upon God&#x27;s past revelations of himself. (d) That
      of regarding the unaided reason, even its normal and unbiased state, as
      capable of discovering, comprehending, and demonstrating all religious
      truth.
    </p>
    <section>

        Reason must not be confounded with ratiocination, or mere reasoning.
        Shall we follow reason? Yes, but not individual reasoning, against the
        testimony of those who are better informed than we; nor by insisting on
        demonstration, where probable evidence alone is possible; nor by
        trusting solely to the evidence of the senses, when spiritual things are
        in question. Coleridge, in replying to those who argued that all
        knowledge comes to us from the senses, says: “At any rate we must bring
        to all facts the light in which we see them.” This the Christian does.
        The light of love reveals much that would otherwise be invisible.
        Wordsworth, Excursion, book 5 (598)—“The mind&#x27;s repose On evidence
        is not to be ensured By act of naked reason. Moral truth Is no mechanic
        structure, built by rule.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Rationalism is the mathematical theory of knowledge. Spinoza&#x27;s
        Ethics is an illustration of it. It would deduce the universe from an
        axiom. Dr. Hodge very wrongly described rationalism as “an overuse of
        reason.” It is rather the use of an abnormal, perverted, improperly
        conditioned reason; see Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:34, 39, 55, and criticism
        by Miller, in his Fetich in Theology. The phrase “sanctified intellect”
        means simply intellect accompanied by right affections toward God, and
        trained to work under their influence. Bishop Butler: “Let reason be
        kept to, but let not such poor creatures as we are go on objecting to an
        infinite scheme that we do not see the necessity or usefulness of all
        its parts, and call that reasoning.” Newman Smyth, Death&#x27;s Place in
        Evolution, 86—“Unbelief is a shaft sunk down into the darkness of the
        earth. Drive the shaft deep enough, and it would come out into the
        sunlight on the earth&#x27;s other side.” The most unreasonable people
        in the world are those who depend solely upon reason, in the narrow
        sense. “The better to exalt reason, they make the world irrational.”
        “The hen that has hatched ducklings walks with them to the water&#x27;s
        edge, but there she stops, and she is amazed when they go on. So reason
        stops and faith goes on, finding its proper element in the invisible.
        Reason is the feet that stand on solid earth; faith is the wings that
        enable us to fly; and normal man is a creature with wings.” Compare
        γνῶσις (1 Tim. 6:20—“the knowledge which is falsely so called”) with
        ἐπίγνωσις (2 Pet. 1:2—“the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord” =
        full knowledge, or true knowledge). See Twesten, Dogmatik, 1:467-500;
        Julius Müller, Proof-texts, 4, 5; Mansel, Limits of Religious Thought,
        96; Dawson, Modern Ideas of Evolution.

    <h2>3. Scripture and Mysticism.</h2>
    <p>
      As rationalism recognizes too little as coming from God, so mysticism
      recognizes too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      A. True mysticism.—We have seen that there is an illumination of the minds
      of all believers by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit, however, makes no new
      revelation of truth, but uses for his instrument the truth already
      revealed by Christ in nature and in the Scriptures. The illuminating work
      of the Spirit is therefore an opening of men&#x27;s minds to understand
      Christ&#x27;s previous revelations. As one initiated into the mysteries of
      Christianity, every true believer may be called a mystic. True mysticism
      is that higher knowledge and fellowship which the Holy Spirit gives
      through the use of nature and Scripture as subordinate and principal
      means.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “Mystic” = one initiated, from μύω, “to close the eyes”—probably in
        order that the soul may have inward vision of truth. But divine truth is
        a “mystery,” not only as something into which one must be initiated, but
        as ὑπερβάλλουσα τῆς γνώσεως (Eph. 3:19)—surpassing full knowledge, even
        to the believer; see Meyer on Rom. 11:25—“I would not, brethren, have
        you ignorant of this mystery.” The Germans have Mystik with a favorable
        sense, Mysticismus with an unfavorable sense,—corresponding respectively
        to our true and false mysticism. True mysticism is intimated in John
        16:13—“the spirit of truth ... shall guide you into all the truth”; Eph.
        3:9—“dispensation of the mystery”; 1 Cor. 2:10—“unto us God revealed
        them through the Spirit.” Nitzsch, Syst. of Christ. Doct., 35—“Whenever
        true religion revives, there is an outcry against mysticism, i. e.,
        higher knowledge, fellowship, activity through the Spirit of God in the
        heart.” Compare the charge against Paul that he was mad, in Acts 26:24,
        25, with his self-vindication in 2 Cor. 5:13—“whether we are beside
        ourselves, it is unto God.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Inge, Christian Mysticism, 21—“Harnack speaks of mysticism as
        rationalism applied to a sphere above reason. He should have said reason
        applied to a sphere above rationalism. Its fundamental doctrine is the
        unity of all existence. Man can realize his individuality only by
        transcending it and finding himself in the larger unity of God&#x27;s
        being. Man is a microcosm. He recapitulates the race, the universe,
        Christ himself.” Ibid., 5—Mysticism is “the attempt to realize in
        thought and feeling the immanence of the temporal in the eternal, and of
        the eternal in the temporal. It implies (1) that the soul can see and
        perceive spiritual truth; (2) that man, in order to know God, must be a
        partaker of the divine nature; (3) that without holiness no man can see
        the Lord; (4) that the true hierophant of the mysteries of God is love.
        The ‘scala perfectionis’is (a) the purgative life; (b) the illuminative
        life; (c) the unitive life.” Stevens, Johannine Theology, 239, 240—“The
        mysticism of John ... is not a subjective mysticism which absorbs the
        soul in self-contemplation and revery, but an objective and rational
        mysticism, which lives in a world of realities, apprehends divinely
        revealed truth, and bases its experience upon it. It is a mysticism
        which feeds, not upon its own feelings and fancies, but upon Christ. It
        involves an acceptance of him, and a life of obedience to him. Its motto
        is: Abiding in Christ.” As the power press cannot dispense with the
        type, so the Spirit of God does not dispense with Christ&#x27;s external
        revelations in nature and in Scripture. E. G. Robinson, Christian
        Theology, 364—“The word of God is a form or mould, into which the Holy
        Spirit delivers us when he creates us anew”; cf. Rom. 6:17—“ye became
        obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were
        delivered.”
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      B. False mysticism.—Mysticism, however, as the term is commonly used, errs
      in holding to the attainment of religious knowledge by direct
      communication from God, and by passive absorption of the human activities
      into the divine. It either partially or wholly loses sight of (a) the
      outward organs of revelation, nature and the Scriptures; (b) the activity
      of the human powers in the reception of all religious knowledge; (c) the
      personality of man, and, by consequence, the personality of God.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        In opposition to false mysticism, we are to remember that the Holy
        Spirit works through the truth externally revealed in nature and in
        Scripture (Acts 14:17—“he left not himself without witness”; Rom.
        1:20—“the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are
        clearly seen”; Acts 7:51—“ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your
        fathers did, so do ye”; Eph. 6:17—“the sword of the Spirit, which is the
        word of God”). By this truth already given we are to test all new
        communications which would contradict or supersede it (1 John
        4:1—“believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are
        of God”; Eph. 5:10—“proving what is well pleasing unto the Lord”). By
        these tests we may try Spiritualism, Mormonism, Swedenborgianism. Note
        the mystical tendency in Francis de Sales, Thomas à Kempis, Madame
        Guyon, Thomas C. Upham. These writers seem at times to advocate an
        unwarrantable abnegation of our reason and will, and a “swallowing up of
        man in God.” But Christ does not deprive us of reason and will; he only
        takes from us the perverseness of our reason and the selfishness of our
        will; so reason and will are restored to their normal clearness and
        strength. Compare Ps. 16:7—“Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; yea, my
        heart instructeth me in the night seasons”—God teaches his people
        through the exercise of their own faculties.
      </p>
      <p>
        False mysticism is sometimes present though unrecognized. All
        expectation of results without the use of means partakes of it.
        Martineau, Seat of Authority, 288—“The lazy will would like to have the
        vision while the eye that apprehends it sleeps.”Preaching without
        preparation is like throwing ourselves down from a pinnacle of the
        temple and depending on God to send an angel to hold us up. Christian
        Science would trust to supernatural agencies, while casting aside the
        natural agencies God has already provided; as if a drowning man should
        trust to prayer while refusing to seize the rope. Using Scripture “ad
        aperturam libri” is like guiding one&#x27;s actions by a throw of the
        dice. Allen, Jonathan Edwards, 171, note—“Both Charles and John Wesley
        were agreed in accepting the Moravian method of solving doubts as to
        some course of action by opening the Bible at hazard and regarding the
        passage on which the eye first alighted as a revelation of God&#x27;s
        will in the matter”; cf. Wedgwood, Life of Wesley, 193; Southey, Life of
        Wesley, 1:216. J. G. Paton, Life, 2:74—“After many prayers and
        wrestlings and tears, I went alone before the Lord, and on my knees cast
        lots, with a solemn appeal to God, and the answer came: ‘Go home!’ ” He
        did this only once in his life, in overwhelming perplexity, and finding
        no light from human counsel. “To whomsoever this faith is given,” he
        says, “let him obey it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        F. B. Meyer, Christian Living, 18—“It is a mistake to seek a sign from
        heaven; to run from counsellor to counsellor; to cast a lot; or to trust
        in some chance coincidence. Not that God may not reveal his will thus;
        but because it is hardly the behavior of a child with its Father. There
        is a more excellent way,”—namely, appropriate Christ who is wisdom, and
        then go forward, sure that we shall be guided, as each new step must be
        taken, or word spoken, or decision made. Our service is to be “rational
        service”(Rom. 12:1); blind and arbitrary action is inconsistent with the
        spirit of Christianity. Such action makes us victims of temporary
        feeling and a prey to Satanic deception. In cases of perplexity, waiting
        for light and waiting upon God will commonly enable us to make an
        intelligent decision, while “whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (Rom.
        14:23).
      </p>
      <p>
        “False mysticism reached its logical result in the Buddhistic theosophy.
        In that system man becomes most divine in the extinction of his own
        personality. Nirvana is reached by the eightfold path of right view,
        aspiration, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, rapture;
        and Nirvana is the loss of ability to say: ‘This is I,’ and ‘This is
        mine.’ Such was Hypatia&#x27;s attempt, by subjection of self, to be
        wafted away into the arms of Jove. George Eliot was wrong when she said:
        ‘The happiest woman has no history.’ Self-denial is not self-effacement.
        The cracked bell has no individuality. In Christ we become our complete
        selves.” Col 2:9, 10—“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
        bodily, and in him ye are made full.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Royce, World and Individual, 2:248, 249—“Assert the spiritual man;
        abnegate the natural man. The fleshly self is the root of all evil; the
        spiritual self belongs to a higher realm. But this spiritual self lies
        at first outside the soul; it becomes ours only by grace. Plato rightly
        made the eternal Ideas the source of all human truth and goodness.
        Wisdom comes into a man, like Aristotle&#x27;s νοῦς.” A. H. Bradford,
        The Inner Light, in making the direct teaching of the Holy Spirit the
        sufficient if not the sole source of religious knowledge, seems to us to
        ignore the principle of evolution in religion. God builds upon the past.
        His revelation to prophets and apostles constitutes the norm and
        corrective of our individual experience, even while our experience
        throws new light upon that revelation. On Mysticism, true and false, see

    <h2>4. Scripture and Romanism.</h2>
    <p>
      While the history of doctrine, as showing the progressive apprehension and
      unfolding by the church of the truth contained in nature and Scripture, is
      a subordinate source of theology, Protestantism recognizes the Bible as
      under Christ the primary and final authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romanism, on the other hand, commits the two-fold error (a) Of making the
      church, and not the Scriptures, the immediate and sufficient source of
      religious knowledge; and (b) Of making the relation of the individual to
      Christ depend upon his relation to the church, instead of making his
      relation to the church depend upon, follow, and express his relation to
      Christ.
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        In Roman Catholicism there is a mystical element. The Scriptures are not
        the complete or final standard of belief and practice. God gives to the
        world from time to time, through popes and councils, new communications
        of truth. Cyprian: “He who has not the church for his mother, has not
        God for his Father.” Augustine: “I would not believe the Scripture,
        unless the authority of the church also influenced me.”Francis of Assisi
        and Ignatius Loyola both represented the truly obedient person as one
        dead, moving only as moved by his superior; the true Christian has no
        life of his own, but is the blind instrument of the church. John Henry
        Newman, Tracts, Theol. and Eccl., 287—“The Christian dogmas were in the
        church from the time of the apostles,—they were ever in their substance
        what they are now.” But this is demonstrably untrue of the immaculate
        conception of the Virgin Mary; of the treasury of merits to be
        distributed in indulgences; of the infallibility of the pope (see Gore,
        Incarnation, 186). In place of the true doctrine, “Ubi Spiritus, ibi
        ecclesia,” Romanism substitutes her maxim, “Ubi ecclesia, ibi Spiritus.”
        Luther saw in this the principle of mysticism, when he said: “Papatus
        est merus enthusiasmus.” See Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:61-69.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reply to the Romanist argument that the church was before the Bible,
        and that the same body that gave the truth at the first can make
        additions to that truth, we say that the unwritten word was before the
        church and made the church possible. The word of God existed before it
        was written down, and by that word the first disciples as well as the
        latest were begotten (1 Pet. 1:23—“begotten again ... through the word
        of God”). The grain of truth in Roman Catholic doctrine is expressed in
        1 Tim. 3:15—“the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the
        truth” = the church is God&#x27;s appointed proclaimer of truth; cf.
        Phil. 2:16—“holding forth the word of life.” But the church can proclaim
        the truth, only as it is built upon the truth. So we may say that the
        American Republic is the pillar and ground of liberty in the world; but
        this is true only so far as the Republic is built upon the principle of
        liberty as its foundation. When the Romanist asks: “Where was your
        church before Luther?” the Protestant may reply: “Where yours is not
        now—in the word of God. Where was your face before it was washed? Where
        was the fine flour before the wheat went to the mill?” Lady Jane Grey,
        three days before her execution, February 12, 1554, said: “I ground my
        faith on God&#x27;s word, and not upon the church; for, if the church be
        a good church, the faith of the church must be tried by God&#x27;s word,
        and not God&#x27;s word by the church, nor yet my faith.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Roman church would keep men in perpetual childhood—coming to her for
        truth instead of going directly to the Bible; “like the foolish mother
        who keeps her boy pining in the house lest he stub his toe, and would
        love best to have him remain a babe forever, that she might mother him
        still.” Martensen, Christian Dogmatics, 30—“Romanism is so busy in
        building up a system of guarantees, that she forgets the truth of Christ
        which she would guarantee.” George Herbert: “What wretchedness can give
        him any room, Whose house is foul while he adores his broom!” It is a
        semi-parasitic doctrine of safety without intelligence or spirituality.
        Romanism says: “Man for the machine!”Protestantism: “The machine for
        man!” Catholicism strangles, Protestantism restores, individuality. Yet
        the Romanist principle sometimes appears in so-called Protestant
        churches. The Catechism published by the League of the Holy Cross, in
        the Anglican Church, contains the following: “It is to the priest only
        that the child must acknowledge his sins, if he desires that God should
        forgive him. Do you know why? It is because God, when on earth, gave to
        his priests and to them alone the power of forgiving sins. Go to the
        priest, who is the doctor of your soul, and who cures you in the name of
        God.” But this contradicts John 10:7—where Christ says “I am the door”;
        and 1 Cor. 3:11—“other foundation can no man lay than that which is
        laid, which is Jesus Christ” = Salvation is attained by immediate access
        to Christ, and there is no door between the soul and him. See Dorner,
        Gesch. prot. Theol., 227; Schleiermacher, Glaubenslehre, 1:24; Robinson,
        in Mad. Av. Lectures, 387; Fisher, Nat. and Method of Revelation, 10;
