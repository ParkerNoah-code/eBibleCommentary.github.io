    (a) A perfect system of theology is impossible. We do not expect to
    construct such a system. All science but reflects the present attainment of
    the human mind. No science is complete or finished. However it may be with
    the sciences of nature and of man, the science of God will never amount to
    an exhaustive knowledge. We must not expect to demonstrate all Scripture
    doctrines upon rational grounds, or even in every case to see the principle
    of connection between them. Where we cannot do this, we must, as in every
    other science, set the revealed facts in their places and wait for further
    light, instead of ignoring or rejecting any of them because we cannot
    understand them or their relation to other parts of our system.

      Three problems left unsolved by the Egyptians have been handed down to our
      generation: (1) the duplication of the cube; (2) the trisection of the
      angle; (3) the quadrature of the circle. Dr. Johnson: “Dictionaries are
      like watches; the worst is better than none; and the best cannot be
      expected to go quite true.” Hood spoke of Dr. Johnson&#x27;s
      “Contradictionary,” which had both “interiour” and “exterior.” Sir William
      Thompson (Lord Kelvin) at the fiftieth anniversary of his professorship
      said: “One word characterizes the most strenuous of the efforts for the
      advancement of science which I have made perseveringly through fifty-five
      years: that word is failure; I know no more of electric and magnetic
      force, or of the relations between ether, electricity and ponderable
      matter, or of chemical affinity, than I knew and tried to teach my
      students of natural philosophy fifty years ago in my first session as
      professor.” Allen, Religious Progress, mentions three tendencies. “The
      first says: Destroy the new! The second says: Destroy the old! The third
      says: Destroy nothing! Let the old gradually and quietly grow into the
      new, as Erasmus wished. We should accept contradictions, whether they can
      be intellectually reconciled or not. The truth has never prospered by
      enforcing some &#x27;via media.&#x27; Truth lies rather in the union of
      opposite propositions, as in Christ&#x27;s divinity and humanity, and in
      grace and freedom. Blanco White went from Rome to infidelity; Orestes
      Brownson from infidelity to Rome; so the brothers John Henry Newman and
      Francis W. Newman, and the brothers George Herbert of Bemerton and Lord
      Herbert of Cherbury. One would secularize the divine, the other would
      divinize the secular. But if one is true, so is the other. Let us adopt
      both. All progress is a deeper penetration into the meaning of old truth,
      and a larger appropriation of it.”

    (b) Theology is nevertheless progressive. It is progressive in the sense
    that our subjective understanding of the facts with regard to God, and our
    consequent expositions of these facts, may and do become more perfect. But
    theology is not progressive in the sense that its objective facts change,
    either in their number or their nature. With Martineau we may say: “Religion
    has been reproached with not being progressive; it makes amends by being
    imperishable.” Though our knowledge may be imperfect, it will have great
    value still. Our success in constructing a theology will depend upon the
    proportion which clearly expressed facts of Scripture bear to mere
    inferences, and upon the degree in which they all cohere about Christ, the
    central person and theme.

      The progress of theology is progress in apprehension by man, not progress
      in communication by God. Originality in astronomy is not man&#x27;s
      creation of new planets, but man&#x27;s discovery of planets that were
      never seen before, or the bringing to light of relations between them that
      were never before suspected. Robert Kerr Eccles: “Originality is a habit
      of recurring to origins—the habit of securing personal experience by
      personal application to original facts. It is not an eduction of novelties
      either from nature, Scripture, or inner consciousness; it is rather the
      habit of resorting to primitive facts, and of securing the personal
      experiences which arise from contact with these facts.” Fisher, Nat. and
      Meth. of Revelation, 48—“The starry heavens are now what they were of old;
      there is no enlargement of the stellar universe, except that which comes
      through the increased power and use of the telescope.” We must not imitate
      the green sailor who, when set to steer, said he had “sailed by that
      star.”

      Martineau, Types, 1:492, 493—“Metaphysics, so far as they are true to
      their work, are stationary, precisely because they have in charge, not
      what begins and ceases to be, but what always is.... It is absurd to
      praise motion for always making way, while disparaging space for still
      being what it ever was: as if the motion you prefer could be, without the
      space which you reproach.” Newman Smyth, Christian Ethics, 45, 67-70,
      79—“True conservatism is progress which takes direction from the past and
      fulfils its good; false conservatism is a narrowing and hopeless reversion
      to the past, which is a betrayal of the promise of the future. So Jesus
      came not ‘to destroy the law or the prophets’; he ‘came not to destroy,
      but to fulfil’ (Mat. 5:17).... The last book on Christian Ethics will not
      be written before the Judgment Day.” John Milton, Areopagitica: “Truth is
      compared in the Scripture to a streaming fountain; if her waters flow not
      in a perpetual progression, they sicken into a muddy pool of conformity
      and tradition. A man may be a heretic in the truth.” Paul in Rom. 2:16,
      and in 2 Tim. 2:8—speaks of “my gospel.” It is the duty of every Christian
      to have his own conception of the truth, while he respects the conceptions
      of others. Tennyson, Locksley Hall: “I that rather held it better men
      should perish one by one, Than that earth should stand at gaze like
      Joshua&#x27;s moon at Ajalon.” We do not expect any new worlds, and we
      need not expect any new Scriptures; but we may expect progress in the
      interpretation of both. Facts are final, but interpretation is not.
