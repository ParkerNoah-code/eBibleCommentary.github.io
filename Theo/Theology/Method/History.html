  <h2>III. History of Systematic Theology.</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    1. In the Eastern Church, Systematic Theology may be said to have had its
    beginning and end in John of Damascus (700-760).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Ignatius († 115—Ad Trall., c. 9) gives us “the first distinct statement of
      the faith drawn up in a series of propositions. This systematizing formed
      the basis of all later efforts” (Prof. A. H. Newman). Origen of Alexandria
      (186-254) wrote his Περὶ Ἀρχῶν; Athanasius of Alexandria (300-373) his
      Treatises on the Trinity and the Deity of Christ; and Gregory of Nyssa in
      Cappadocia (332-398) his Λόγος κατηχητικὸς ὁ μέγας. Hatch, Hibbert
      Lectures, 323, regards the “De Principiis” of Origen as the “first
      complete system of dogma,” and speaks of Origen as “the disciple of
      Clement of Alexandria, the first great teacher of philosophical
      Christianity.” But while the Fathers just mentioned seem to have conceived
      the plan of expounding the doctrines in order and of showing their
      relation to one another, it was John of Damascus (700-760) who first
      actually carried out such a plan. His Ἔκδοσις ἀκριβὴς τῆς ὀρθοδόξου
      Πίστεως, or Summary of the Orthodox Faith, may be considered the earliest
      work of Systematic Theology. Neander calls it “the most important
      doctrinal text-book of the Greek Church.” John, like the Greek Church in
      general, was speculative, theological, semi-pelagian, sacramentarian. The
      Apostles&#x27; Creed, so called, is, in its present form, not earlier than
      the fifth century; see Schaff, Creeds of Christendom, 1:19. Mr. Gladstone
      suggested that the Apostles&#x27; Creed was a development of the baptismal
      formula. McGiffert, Apostles&#x27; Creed, assigns to the meagre original
      form a date of the third quarter of the second century, and regards the
      Roman origin of the symbol as proved. It was framed as a baptismal
      formula, but specifically in opposition to the teachings of Marcion, which
      were at that time causing much trouble at Rome. Harnack however dates the
      original Apostles&#x27; Creed at 150, and Zahn places it at 120. See also
      J. C. Long, in Bap. Quar. Rev., Jan. 1892: 89-101.

  <p>
    2. In the Western Church, we may (with Hagenbach) distinguish three periods:
  </p>
  <p>
    (a) The period of Scholasticism,—introduced by Peter Lombard (1100-1160),
    and reaching its culmination in Thomas Aquinas (1221-1274) and Duns Scotus
    (1265-1308).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Though Systematic Theology had its beginning in the Eastern Church, its
      development has been confined almost wholly to the Western. Augustine
      (353-430) wrote his “Encheiridion ad Laurentium” and his “De Civitate
      Dei,” and John Scotus Erigena († 850), Roscelin (1092-1122), and Abelard
      (1079-1142), in their attempts at the rational explanation of the
      Christian doctrine foreshadowed the works of the great scholastic
      teachers. Anselm of Canterbury (1034-1109), with his “Proslogion de Dei
      Existentia” and his “Cur Deus Homo,” has sometimes, but wrongly, been
      called the founder of Scholasticism. Allen, in his Continuity of Christian
      Thought, represents the transcendence of God as the controlling principle
      of the Augustinian and of the Western theology. The Eastern Church, he
      maintains, had founded its theology on God&#x27;s immanence. Paine, in his
      Evolution of Trinitarianism, shows that this is erroneous. Augustine was a
      theistic monist. He declares that “Dei voluntas rerum natura est,” and
      regards God&#x27;s upholding as a continuous creation. Western theology
      recognized the immanence of God as well as his transcendence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Lombard, however, (1100-1160), the “magister sententiarum,” was the
      first great systematizer of the Western Church, and his “Libri
      Sententiarum Quatuor” was the theological text-book of the Middle Ages.
      Teachers lectured on the “Sentences”(Sententia = sentence, Satz, locus,
      point, article of faith), as they did on the books of Aristotle, who
      furnished to Scholasticism its impulse and guide. Every doctrine was
      treated in the order of Aristotle&#x27;s four causes: the material, the
      formal, the efficient, the final. (“Cause” here = requisite: (1) matter of
      which a thing consists, e. g., bricks and mortar; (2) form it assumes, e.
      g., plan or design; (3) producing agent, e. g., builder; (4) end for which
      made, e. g., house.) The organization of physical as well as of
      theological science was due to Aristotle. Dante called him “the master of
      those who know.” James Ten Broeke, Bap. Quar. Rev., Jan. 1892:1-26—“The
      Revival of Learning showed the world that the real Aristotle was much
      broader than the Scholastic Aristotle—information very unwelcome to the
      Roman Church.” For the influence of Scholasticism, compare the literary
      methods of Augustine and of Calvin,—the former giving us his materials in
      disorder, like soldiers bivouacked for the night; the latter arranging
      them like those same soldiers drawn up in battle array; see A. H. Strong,
      Philosophy and Religion, 4, and Christ in Creation, 188, 189.
    </p>
    <p>
      Candlish, art.: Dogmatic, in Encycl. Brit., 7:340—“By and by a mighty
      intellectual force took hold of the whole collected dogmatic material, and
      reared out of it the great scholastic systems, which have been compared to
      the grand Gothic cathedrals that were the work of the same ages.” Thomas
      Aquinas (1221-1274), the Dominican, “doctor angelicus,” Augustinian and
      Realist,—and Duns Scotus (1265-1308), the Franciscan, “doctor
      subtilis,”—wrought out the scholastic theology more fully, and left behind
      them, in their Summæ, gigantic monuments of intellectual industry and
      acumen. Scholasticism aimed at the proof and systematizing of the
      doctrines of the Church by means of Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy. It became
      at last an illimitable morass of useless subtilities and abstractions, and
      it finally ended in the nominalistic scepticism of William of Occam
      (1270-1347). See Townsend, The Great Schoolmen of the Middle Ages.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (b) The period of Symbolism,—represented by the Lutheran theology of Philip
    Melanchthon (1497-1560), and the Reformed theology of John Calvin
    (1509-1564); the former connecting itself with the Analytic theology of
    Calixtus (1585-1656), and the latter with the Federal theology of Cocceius
    (1603-1669).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      The Lutheran Theology.—Preachers precede theologians, and Luther
      (1485-1546) was preacher rather than theologian. But Melanchthon
      (1497-1560), “the preceptor of Germany,” as he was called, embodied the
      theology of the Lutheran church in his “Loci Communes” = points of
      doctrine common to believers (first edition Augustinian, afterwards
      substantially Arminian; grew out of lectures on the Epistle to the
      Romans). He was followed by Chemnitz (1522-1586), “clear and accurate,”
      the most learned of the disciples of Melanchthon. Leonhard Hutter
      (1563-1616), called “Lutherus redivivus,”and John Gerhard (1582-1637)
      followed Luther rather than Melanchthon. “Fifty years after the death of
      Melanchthon, Leonhard Hutter, his successor in the chair of theology at
      Wittenberg, on an occasion when the authority of Melanchthon was appealed
      to, tore down from the wall the portrait of the great Reformer, and
      trampled it under foot in the presence of the assemblage” (E. D. Morris,
      paper at the 60th Anniversary of Lane Seminary). George Calixtus
      (1586-1656) followed Melanchthon rather than Luther. He taught a theology
      which recognized the good element in both the Reformed and the Romanist
      doctrine and which was called “Syncretism.” He separated Ethics from
      Systematic Theology, and applied the analytical method of investigation to
      the latter, beginning with the end, or final cause, of all things, viz.:
      blessedness. He was followed in his analytic method by Dannhauer
      (1603-1666), who treated theology allegorically, Calovius (1612-1686),
      “the most uncompromising defender of Lutheran orthodoxy and the most
      drastic polemicist against Calixtus,” Quenstedt (1617-1688), whom Hovey
      calls “learned, comprehensive and logical,” and Hollaz († 1730). The
      Lutheran theology aimed to purify the existing church, maintaining that
      what is not against the gospel is for it. It emphasized the material
      principle of the Reformation, justification by faith; but it retained many
      Romanist customs not expressly forbidden in Scripture. Kaftan, Am. Jour.
      Theol., 1900:716—“Because the mediæval school-philosophy mainly held sway,
      the Protestant theology representing the new faith was meanwhile
      necessarily accommodated to forms of knowledge thereby conditioned, that
      is, to forms essentially Catholic.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reformed Theology.—The word “Reformed” is here used in its technical
      sense, as designating that phase of the new theology which originated in
      Switzerland. Zwingle, the Swiss reformer (1484-1531), differing from
      Luther as to the Lord&#x27;s Supper and as to Scripture, was more than
      Luther entitled to the name of systematic theologian. Certain writings of
      his may be considered the beginning of Reformed theology. But it was left
      to John Calvin (1509-1564), after the death of Zwingle, to arrange the
      principles of that theology in systematic form. Calvin dug channels for
      Zwingle&#x27;s flood to flow in, as Melanchthon did for Luther&#x27;s. His
      Institutes (“Institutio Religionis Christianæ”), is one of the great works
      in theology (superior as a systematic work to Melanchthon&#x27;s “Loci”).
      Calvin was followed by Peter Martyr (1500-1562), Chamier (1565-1621), and
      Theodore Beza (1519-1605). Beza carried Calvin&#x27;s doctrine of
      predestination to an extreme supralapsarianism, which is hyper-Calvinistic
      rather than Calvinistic. Cocceius (1603-1669), and after him Witsius
      (1626-1708), made theology centre about the idea of the covenants, and
      founded the Federal theology. Leydecker (1642-1721) treated theology in
      the order of the persons of the Trinity. Amyraldus (1596-1664) and Placeus
      of Saumur (1596-1632) modified the Calvinistic doctrine, the latter by his
      theory of mediate imputation, and the former by advocating the hypothetic
      universalism of divine grace. Turretin (1671-1737), a clear and strong
      theologian whose work is still a text-book at Princeton, and Pictet
      (1655-1725), both of them Federalists, showed the influence of the
      Cartesian philosophy. The Reformed theology aimed to build a new church,
      affirming that what is not derived from the Bible is against it. It
      emphasized the formal principle of the Reformation, the sole authority of
      Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, while the line between Catholic and Protestant in Europe runs
      from west to east, the line between Lutheran and Reformed runs from south
      to north, the Reformed theology flowing with the current of the Rhine
      northward from Switzerland to Holland and to England, in which latter
      country the Thirty-nine Articles represent the Reformed faith, while the
      Prayer-book of the English Church is substantially Arminian; see Dorner,
      Gesch. prot. Theologie, Einleit., 9. On the difference between Lutheran
      and Reformed doctrine, see Schaff, Germany, its Universities, Theology and
      Religion, 167-177. On the Reformed Churches of Europe and America, see H.
      B. Smith, Faith and Philosophy, 87-124.

  </section>
  <p>
    (c) The period of Criticism and Speculation,—in its three divisions: the
    Rationalistic, represented by Semler (1725-1791); the Transitional, by
    Schleiermacher (1768-1834); the Evangelical, by Nitzsch, Müller, Tholuck and
    Dorner.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      First Division. Rationalistic theologies: Though the Reformation had freed
      theology in great part from the bonds of scholasticism, other philosophies
      after a time took its place. The Leibnitz- (1646-1754) Wolffian
      (1679-1754) exaggeration of the powers of natural religion prepared the
      way for rationalistic systems of theology. Buddeus (1667-1729) combated
      the new principles, but Semler&#x27;s (1725-1791) theology was built upon
      them, and represented the Scriptures as having a merely local and
      temporary character. Michaelis (1716-1784) and Doederlein (1714-1789)
      followed Semler, and the tendency toward rationalism was greatly assisted
      by the critical philosophy of Kant (1724-1804), to whom “revelation was
      problematical, and positive religion merely the medium through which the
      practical truths of reason are communicated” (Hagenbach, Hist. Doct.,
      2:397). Ammon (1766-1850) and Wegscheider (1771-1848) were representatives
      of this philosophy. Daub, Marheinecke and Strauss (1808-1874) were the
      Hegelian dogmatists. The system of Strauss resembled “Christian theology
      as a cemetery resembles a town.” Storr (1746-1805), Reinhard (1753-1812),
      and Knapp (1753-1825), in the main evangelical, endeavored to reconcile
      revelation with reason, but were more or less influenced by this
      rationalizing spirit. Bretschneider (1776-1828) and De Wette (1780-1849)
      may be said to have held middle ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Division. Transition to a more Scriptural theology. Herder
      (1744-1803) and Jacobi (1743-1819), by their more spiritual philosophy,
      prepared the way for Schleiermacher&#x27;s (1768-1834) grounding of
      doctrine in the facts of Christian experience. The writings of
      Schleiermacher constituted an epoch, and had great influence in delivering
      Germany from the rationalistic toils into which it had fallen. We may now
      speak of a
    </p>
    <p>
      Third Division—and in this division we may put the names of Neander and
      Tholuck, Twesten and Nitzsch, Müller and Luthardt, Dorner and Philippi,
      Ebrard and Thomasius, Lange and Kahnis, all of them exponents of a far
      more pure and evangelical theology than was common in Germany a century
      ago. Two new forms of rationalism, however, have appeared in Germany, the
      one based upon the philosophy of Hegel, and numbering among its adherents
      Strauss and Baur, Biedermann, Lipsius and Pfleiderer; the other based upon
      the philosophy of Kant, and advocated by Ritschl and his followers,
      Harnack, Hermann and Kaftan; the former emphasizing the ideal Christ, the
      latter emphasizing the historical Christ; but neither of the two fully
      recognizing the living Christ present in every believer (see
      Johnson&#x27;s Cyclopædia, art.: Theology, by A. H. Strong).
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    3. Among theologians of views diverse from the prevailing Protestant faith,
    may be mentioned:
  </p>
  <p>(a) Bellarmine (1542-1621), the Roman Catholic.</p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Besides Bellarmine, “the best controversial writer of his age” (Bayle),
      the Roman Catholic Church numbers among its noted modern
      theologians:—Petavius (1583-1652), whose dogmatic theology Gibbon calls “a
      work of incredible labor and compass”; Melchior Canus (1523-1560), an
      opponent of the Jesuits and their scholastic method; Bossuet (1627-1704),
      who idealized Catholicism in his Exposition of Doctrine, and attacked
      Protestantism in his History of Variations of Protestant Churches; Jansen
      (1585-1638), who attempted, in opposition to the Jesuits, to reproduce the
      theology of Augustine, and who had in this the powerful assistance of
      Pascal (1623-1662). Jansenism, so far as the doctrines of grace are
      concerned, but not as respects the sacraments, is virtual Protestantism
      within the Roman Catholic Church. Moehler&#x27;s Symbolism, Perrone&#x27;s
      “Prelectiones Theologicæ,” and Hurter&#x27;s “Compendium Theologiæ
      Dogmaticæ”are the latest and most approved expositions of Roman Catholic
      doctrine.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>(b) Arminius (1560-1609), the opponent of predestination.</p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Among the followers of Arminius (1560-1609) must be reckoned Episcopius
      (1583-1643), who carried Arminianism to almost Pelagian extremes; Hugo
      Grotius (1553-1645), the jurist and statesman, author of the governmental
      theory of the atonement; and Limborch (1633-1712), the most thorough
      expositor of the Arminian doctrine.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (c) Laelius Socinus (1525-1562), and Faustus Socinus (1539-1604), the
    leaders of the modern Unitarian movement.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      The works of Laelius Socinus (1525-1562) and his nephew, Faustus Socinus
      (1539-1604) constituted the beginnings of modern Unitarianism. Laelius
      Socinus was the preacher and reformer, as Faustus Socinus was the
      theologian; or, as Baumgarten Crusius expresses it: “the former was the
      spiritual founder of Socinianism, and the latter the founder of the sect.”
      Their writings are collected in the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum. The
      Racovian Catechism, taking its name from the Polish town Racow, contains
      the most succinct exposition of their views. In 1660, the Unitarian church
      of the Socini in Poland was destroyed by persecution, but its Hungarian
      offshoot has still more than a hundred congregations.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>4. British Theology, represented by:</p>
  <p>
    (a) The Baptists, John Bunyan (1628-1688), John Gill (1697-1771), and Andrew
    Fuller (1754-1815).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Some of the best British theology is Baptist. Among John Bunyan&#x27;s
      works we may mention his “Gospel Truths Opened,” though his
      “Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress” and “Holy War” are theological treatises in
      allegorical form. Macaulay calls Milton and Bunyan the two great creative
      minds of England during the latter part of the 17th century. John
      Gill&#x27;s “Body of Practical Divinity” shows much ability, although the
      Rabbinical learning of the author occasionally displays itself in a
      curious exegesis, as when on the word “Abba” he remarks: “You see that
      this word which means &#x27;Father&#x27; reads the same whether we read
      forward or backward; which suggests that God is the same whichever way we
      look at him.” Andrew Fuller&#x27;s “Letters on Systematic Divinity” is a
      brief compend of theology. His treatises upon special doctrines are marked
      by sound judgment and clear insight. They were the most influential factor
      in rescuing the evangelical churches of England from antinomianism. They
      justify the epithets which Robert Hall, one of the greatest of Baptist
      preachers, gives him: “sagacious,” “luminous,” “powerful.”
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (b) The Puritans, John Owen (1616-1683), Richard Baxter (1615-1691), John
    Howe (1630-1705), and Thomas Ridgeley (1666-1734).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Owen was the most rigid, as Baxter was the most liberal, of the Puritans.
      The Encyclopædia Britannica remarks: “As a theological thinker and writer,
      John Owen holds his own distinctly defined place among those titanic
      intellects with which the age abounded. Surpassed by Baxter in point and
      pathos, by Howe in imagination and the higher philosophy, he is unrivaled
      in his power of unfolding the rich meanings of Scripture. In his writings
      he was preëminently the great theologian.” Baxter wrote a “Methodus
      Theologiæ,” and a “Catholic Theology”; John Howe is chiefly known by his
      “Living Temple”; Thomas Ridgeley by his “Body of Divinity.”Charles H.
      Spurgeon never ceased to urge his students to become familiar with the
      Puritan Adams, Ambrose, Bowden, Manton and Sibbes.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (c) The Scotch Presbyterians, Thomas Boston (1676-1732), John Dick
    (1764-1833), and Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Of the Scotch Presbyterians, Boston is the most voluminous, Dick the most
      calm and fair, Chalmers the most fervid and popular.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (d) The Methodists, John Wesley (1703-1791), and Richard Watson (1781-1833).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Of the Methodists, John Wesley&#x27;s doctrine is presented in “Christian
      Theology,”collected from his writings by the Rev. Thornley Smith. The
      great Methodist text-book, however, is the “Institutes” of Watson, who
      systematized and expounded the Wesleyan theology. Pope, a recent English
      theologian, follows Watson&#x27;s modified and improved Arminianism, while
      Whedon and Raymond, recent American writers, hold rather to a radical and
      extreme Arminianism.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (e) The Quakers, George Fox (1624-1691), and Robert Barclay (1648-1690).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      As Jesus, the preacher and reformer, preceded Paul the theologian; as
      Luther preceded Melanchthon; as Zwingle preceded Calvin; as Laelius
      Socinus preceded Faustus Socinus; as Wesley preceded Watson; so Fox
      preceded Barclay. Barclay wrote an “Apology for the true Christian
      Divinity,” which Dr. E. G. Robinson described as “not a formal treatise of
      Systematic Theology, but the ablest exposition of the views of the
      Quakers.” George Fox was the reformer, William Penn the social founder,
      Robert Barclay the theologian, of Quakerism.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    (f) The English Churchmen, Richard Hooker (1553-1600), Gilbert Burnet
    (1643-1715), and John Pearson (1613-1686).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      The English church has produced no great systematic theologian (see
      reasons assigned in Dorner, Gesch. prot. Theologie, 470). The “judicious”
      Hooker is still its greatest theological writer, although his work is only
      on “Ecclesiastical Polity.”Bishop Burnet is the author of the “Exposition
      of the XXXIX Articles,” and Bishop Pearson of the “Exposition of the
      Creed.” Both these are common English text-books. A recent “Compendium of
      Dogmatic Theology,” by Litton, shows a tendency to return from the usual
      Arminianism of the Anglican church to the old Augustinianism; so also
      Bishop Moule&#x27;s “Outlines of Christian Doctrine,” and Mason&#x27;s
      “Faith of the Gospel.”
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>5. American theology, running in two lines:</p>
  <p>
    (a) The Reformed system of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), modified
    successively by Joseph Bellamy (1719-1790), Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803),
    Timothy Dwight (1752-1817), Nathanael Emmons (1745-1840), Leonard Woods
    (1774-1854), Charles G. Finney (1792-1875), Nathaniel W. Taylor (1786-1858),
    and Horace Bushnell (1802-1876). Calvinism, as thus modified, is often
    called the New England, or New School, theology.

      Jonathan Edwards, one of the greatest of metaphysicians and theologians,
      was an idealist who held that God is the only real cause, either in the
      realm of matter or in the realm of mind. He regarded the chief good as
      happiness—a form of sensibility. Virtue was voluntary choice of this good.
      Hence union with Adam in acts and exercises was sufficient. Thus
      God&#x27;s will made identity of being with Adam. This led to the
      exercise-system of Hopkins and Emmons, on the one hand, and to
      Bellamy&#x27;s and Dwight&#x27;s denial of any imputation of Adam&#x27;s
      sin or of inborn depravity, on the other—in which last denial agree many
      other New England theologians who reject the exercise-scheme, as for
      example, Strong, Tyler, Smalley, Burton, Woods, and Park. Dr. N. W. Taylor
      added a more distinctly Arminian element, the power of contrary choice—and
      with this tenet of the New Haven theology, Charles G. Finney, of Oberlin,
      substantially agreed. Horace Bushnell held to a practically Sabellian view
      of the Trinity, and to a moral-influence theory of the atonement. Thus
      from certain principles admitted by Edwards, who held in the main to an
      Old School theology, the New School theology has been gradually developed.

      Robert Hall called Edwards “the greatest of the sons of men.” Dr. Chalmers
      regarded him as the “greatest of theologians.” Dr. Fairbairn says: “He is
      not only the greatest of all the thinkers that America has produced, but
      also the highest speculative genius of the eighteenth century. In a far
      higher degree than Spinoza, he was a &#x27;God-intoxicated man.&#x27;” His
      fundamental notion that there is no causality except the divine was made
      the basis of a theory of necessity which played into the hands of the
      deists whom he opposed and was alien not only to Christianity but even to
      theism. Edwards could not have gotten his idealism from Berkeley; it may
      have been suggested to him by the writings of Locke or Newton, Cudworth or
      Descartes, John Norris or Arthur Collier. See Prof. H. N. Gardiner, in
      Philos. Rev., Nov. 1900:573-596; Prof. E. C. Smyth, in Am. Jour. Theol.,
      Oct. 1897:956; Allen, Jonathan Edwards, 16, 308-310, and in Atlantic
      Monthly, Dec. 1891:767; Sanborn, in Jour. Spec. Philos., Oct.
      1883:401-420; G. P. Fisher, Edwards on the Trinity, 18, 19.

    (b) The older Calvinism, represented by Charles Hodge the father (1797-1878)
    and A. A. Hodge the son (1823-1886), together with Henry B. Smith
    (1815-1877), Robert J. Breckinridge (1800-1871), Samuel J. Baird, and
    William G. T. Shedd (1820-1894). All these, although with minor differences,
    hold to views of human depravity and divine grace more nearly conformed to
    the doctrine of Augustine and Calvin, and are for this reason distinguished
    from the New England theologians and their followers by the popular title of
    Old School.

      Old School theology, in its view of predestination, exalts God; New School
      theology, by emphasizing the freedom of the will, exalts man. It is yet
      more important to notice that Old School theology has for its
      characteristic tenet the guilt of inborn depravity. But among those who
      hold this view, some are federalists and creationists, and justify
      God&#x27;s condemnation of all men upon the ground that Adam represented
      his posterity. Such are the Princeton theologians generally, including
      Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, and the brothers Alexander. Among those who
      hold to the Old School doctrine of the guilt of inborn depravity, however,
      there are others who are traducians, and who explain the imputation of
      Adam&#x27;s sin to his posterity upon the ground of the natural union
      between him and them. Baird&#x27;s “Elohim Revealed” and Shedd&#x27;s
      essay on “Original Sin” (Sin a Nature and that Nature Guilt) represent
      this realistic conception of the relation of the race to its first father.
      R. J. Breckinridge, R. L. Dabney, and J. H. Thornwell assert the fact of
      inherent corruption and guilt, but refuse to assign any rationale for it,
      though they tend to realism. H. B. Smith holds guardedly to the theory of
      mediate imputation.

      Dogmatik, 1:15-128; Hase, Hutterus Redivivus, 24-52. Gretillat, Théologie
      Systématique, 3:24-120, has given an excellent history of theology,
      brought down to the present time. On the history of New England theology,
