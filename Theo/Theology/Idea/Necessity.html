  <h1>Chapter I. Idea Of Theology.</h1>
  <h2>IV. Necessity of Theology.</h2>
</section>

<div>
  <section>
    <p>The necessity of theology has its grounds:</p>
    <p>
      (a) In the organizing instinct of the human mind. This organizing
      principle is a part of our constitution. The mind cannot endure confusion
      or apparent contradiction in known facts. The tendency to harmonize and
      unify its knowledge appears as soon as the mind becomes reflective; just
      in proportion to its endowments and culture does the impulse to
      systematize and formulate increase. This is true of all departments of
      human inquiry, but it is peculiarly true of our knowledge of God. Since
      the truth with regard to God is the most important of all, theology meets
      the deepest want of man&#x27;s rational nature. Theology is a rational
      necessity. If all existing theological systems were destroyed to-day, new
      systems would rise to-morrow. So inevitable is the operation of this law,
      that those who most decry theology show nevertheless that they have made a
      theology for themselves, and often one sufficiently meagre and blundering.
      Hostility to theology, where it does not originate in mistaken fears for
      the corruption of God&#x27;s truth or in a naturally illogical structure
      of mind, often proceeds from a license of speculation which cannot brook
      the restraints of a complete Scriptural system.

        President E. G. Robinson: “Every man has as much theology as he can
        hold.” Consciously or unconsciously, we philosophize, as naturally as we
        speak prose. “Se moquer de la philosophie c&#x27;est vraiment
        philosopher.” Gore, Incarnation, 21—“Christianity became metaphysical,
        only because man is rational. This rationality means that he must
        attempt ‘to give account of things,’ as Plato said, ‘because he was a
        man, not merely because he was a Greek.’ ” Men often denounce systematic
        theology, while they extol the sciences of matter. Has God then left
        only the facts with regard to himself in so unrelated a state that man
        cannot put them together? All other sciences are valuable only as they
        contain or promote the knowledge of God. If it is praiseworthy to
        classify beetles, one science may be allowed to reason concerning God
        and the soul. In speaking of Schelling, Royce, Spirit of Modern
        Philosophy, 173, satirically exhorts us: “Trust your genius; follow your
        noble heart; change your doctrine whenever your heart changes, and
        change your heart often,—such is the practical creed of the
        romanticists.” Ritchie, Darwin and Hegel, 3—“Just those persons who
        disclaim metaphysics are sometimes most apt to be infected with the
        disease they profess to abhor—and not to know when they have it.” See
        Shedd, Discourses and Essays, 27-52; Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith,
        195-199.

      (b) In the relation of systematic truth to the development of character.
      Truth thoroughly digested is essential to the growth of Christian
      character in the individual and in the church. All knowledge of God has
      its influence upon character, but most of all the knowledge of spiritual
      facts in their relations. Theology cannot, as has sometimes been objected,
      deaden the religious affections, since it only draws out from their
      sources and puts into rational connection with each other the truths which
      are best adapted to nourish the religions affections. On the other hand,
      the strongest Christians are those who have the firmest grasp upon the
      great doctrines of Christianity; the heroic ages of the church are those
      which have witnessed most consistently to them; the piety that can be
      injured by the systematic exhibition of them must be weak, or mystical, or
      mistaken.

        Some knowledge is necessary to conversion—at least, knowledge of sin and
        knowledge of a Savior; and the putting together of these two great
        truths is a beginning of theology. All subsequent growth of character is
        conditioned upon the increase of this knowledge. Col. 1:10—αὐξανόμενοι
        τῇ ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ Θεοῦ [omit ἐν] = “increasing by the knowledge of
        God”—the instrumental dative represents the knowledge of God as the dew
        or rain which nurtures the growth of the plant; cf. 3 Pet. 3:18—“grow in
        the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.” For texts
        which represent truth as nourishment, see Jer. 3:15—“feed you with
        knowledge and understanding”; Mat. 4:4—“Man shall not live by bread
        alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God”; 1
        Cor. 3:1, 2—“babes in Christ ... I fed you with milk, not with meat”;
        Heb. 5:14—“but solid food is for full-grown men.” Christian character
        rests upon Christian truth as its foundation; see 1 Cor. 3:10-15—“I laid
        a foundation, and another buildeth thereon.”See Dorus Clarke, Saying the
        Catechism; Simon, on Christ Doct. and Life, in Bib. Sac., July,
        1884:433-439.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignorance is the mother of superstition, not of devotion. Talbot W.
        Chambers:—“Doctrine without duty is a tree without fruits; duty without
        doctrine is a tree without roots.” Christian morality is a fruit which
        grows only from the tree of Christian doctrine. We cannot long keep the
        fruits of faith after we have cut down the tree upon which they have
        grown. Balfour, Foundations of Belief, 82—“Naturalistic virtue is
        parasitic, and when the host perishes, the parasite perishes also.
        Virtue without religion will die.” Kidd, Social Evolution, 214—“Because
        the fruit survives for a time when removed from the tree, and even
        mellows and ripens, shall we say that it is independent of the tree?”
        The twelve manner of fruits on the Christmas-tree are only tacked
        on,—they never grew there, and they can never reproduce their kind. The
        withered apple swells out under the exhausted receiver, but it will go
        back again to its former shrunken form; so the self-righteousness of
        those who get out of the atmosphere of Christ and have no divine ideal
        with which to compare themselves. W. M. Lisle: “It is the mistake and
        disaster of the Christian world that effects are sought instead of
        causes.” George A. Gordon, Christ of To-day, 28—“Without the historical
        Christ and personal love for that Christ, the broad theology of our day
        will reduce itself to a dream, powerless to rouse a sleeping church.”

      (c) In the importance to the preacher of definite and just views of
      Christian doctrine. His chief intellectual qualification must be the power
      clearly and comprehensively to conceive, and accurately and powerfully to
      express, the truth. He can be the agent of the Holy Spirit in converting
      and sanctifying men, only as he can wield “the sword of the Spirit, which
      is the word of God” (Eph. 6:17), or, in other language, only as he can
      impress truth upon the minds and consciences of his hearers. Nothing more
      certainly nullifies his efforts than confusion and inconsistency in his
      statements of doctrine. His object is to replace obscure and erroneous
      conceptions among his hearers by those which are correct and vivid. He
      cannot do this without knowing the facts with regard to God in their
      relations—knowing them, in short, as parts of a system. With this truth he
      is put in trust. To mutilate it or misrepresent it, is not only sin
      against the Revealer of it,—it may prove the ruin of men&#x27;s souls. The
      best safeguard against such mutilation or misrepresentation, is the
      diligent study of the several doctrines of the faith in their relations to
      one another, and especially to the central theme of theology, the person
      and work of Jesus Christ.

        The more refined and reflective the age, the more it requires reasons
        for feeling. Imagination, as exercised in poetry and eloquence and as
        exhibited in politics or war, is not less strong than of old,—it is only
        more rational. Notice the progress from “Buncombe”, in legislative and
        forensic oratory, to sensible and logical address. Bassanio in
        Shakespeare&#x27;s Merchant of Venice, 1:1:113—“Gratiano speaks an
        infinite deal of nothing.... His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid
        in two bushels of chaff.”So in pulpit oratory, mere Scripture quotation
        and fervid appeal are no longer sufficient. As well be a howling
        dervish, as to indulge in windy declamation. Thought is the staple of
        preaching. Feeling must be roused, but only by bringing men to “the
        knowledge of the truth” (2 Tim. 2:25). The preacher must furnish the
        basis for feeling by producing intelligent conviction. He must instruct
        before he can move. If the object of the preacher is first to know God,
        and secondly to make God known, then the study of theology is absolutely
        necessary to his success.

        Shall the physician practice medicine without study of physiology, or
        the lawyer practice law without study of jurisprudence? Professor
        Blackie: “One may as well expect to make a great patriot out of a
        fencing-master, as to make a great orator out of a mere rhetorician.”
        The preacher needs doctrine, to prevent his being a mere barrel-organ,
        playing over and over the same tunes. John Henry Newman: “The false
        preacher is one who has to say something; the true preacher is one who
        has something to say.” Spurgeon, Autobiography, 1:167—“Constant change
        of creed is sure loss. If a tree has to be taken up two or three times a
        year, you will not need to build a very large loft in which to store the
        apples. When people are shifting their doctrinal principles, they do not
        bring forth much fruit.... We shall never have great preachers till we
        have great divines. You cannot build a man of war out of a currant-bush,
        nor can great soul-moving preachers be formed out of superficial
        students.” Illustrate the harmfulness of ignorant and erroneous
        preaching, by the mistake in a physician&#x27;s prescription; by the
        wrong trail at Lake Placid which led astray those ascending Whiteface;
        by the sowing of acorns whose crop was gathered only after a hundred
        years. Slight divergences from correct doctrine on our part may be
        ruinously exaggerated in those who come after us. Though the moth-miller
        has no teeth, its offspring has. 2 Tim. 2:2—“And the things which thou
        hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to
        faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.”
      </p>

    <p>
      (d) In the intimate connection between correct doctrine and the safety and
      aggressive power of the church. The safety and progress of the church is
      dependent upon her “holding the pattern of sound words” (2 Tim. 1:13), and
      serving as “pillar and ground of the truth” (1 Tim. 3:15). Defective
      understanding of the truth results sooner or later in defects of
      organization, of operation, and of life. Thorough comprehension of
      Christian truth as an organized system furnishes, on the other hand, not
      only an invaluable defense against heresy and immorality, but also an
      indispensable stimulus and instrument in aggressive labor for the
      world&#x27;s conversion.

        The creeds of Christendom have not originated in mere speculative
        curiosity and logical hair-splitting. They are statements of doctrine in
        which the attacked and imperiled church has sought to express the truth
        which constitutes her very life. Those who deride the early creeds have
        small conception of the intellectual acumen and the moral earnestness
        which went to the making of them. The creeds of the third and fourth
        centuries embody the results of controversies which exhausted the
        possibilities of heresy with regard to the Trinity and the person of
        Christ, and which set up bars against false doctrine to the end of time.
        Mahaffy: “What converted the world was not the example of Christ&#x27;s
        life,—it was the dogma of his death.” Coleridge: “He who does not
        withstand, has no standing ground of his own.” Mrs. Browning: “Entire
        intellectual toleration is the mark of those who believe nothing.” E. G.
        Robinson, Christian Theology, 360-362—“A doctrine is but a precept in
        the style of a proposition; and a precept is but a doctrine in the form
        of a command.... Theology is God&#x27;s garden; its trees are trees of
        his planting; and ‘all the trees of the Lord are full of sap’ (Ps.
        104:16).”
      </p>
      <p>
        Bose, Ecumenical Councils: “A creed is not catholic because a council of
        many or of few bishops decreed it, but because it expresses the common
        conviction of entire generations of men and women who turned their
        understanding of the New Testament into those forms of words.” Dorner:
        “The creeds are the precipitate of the religious consciousness of mighty
        men and times.” Foster, Christ. Life and Theol., 162—“It ordinarily
        requires the shock of some great event to startle men into clear
        apprehension and crystallization of their substantial belief. Such a
        shock was given by the rough and coarse doctrine of Arius, upon which
        the conclusion arrived at in the Council of Nice followed as rapidly as
        in chilled water the crystals of ice will sometimes form when the
        containing vessel receives a blow.” Balfour, Foundations of Belief,
        287—“The creeds were not explanations, but rather denials that the Arian
        and Gnostic explanations were sufficient, and declarations that they
        irremediably impoverished the idea of the Godhead. They insisted on
        preserving that idea in all its inexplicable fulness.”Denny, Studies in
        Theology, 192—“Pagan philosophies tried to capture the church for their
        own ends, and to turn it into a school. In self-defense the church was
        compelled to become somewhat of a school on its own account. It had to
        assert its facts; it had to define its ideas; it had to interpret in its
        own way those facts which men were misinterpreting.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Professor Howard Osgood: “A creed is like a backbone. A man does not
        need to wear his backbone in front of him; but he must have a backbone,
        and a straight one, or he will be a flexible if not a humpbacked
        Christian.” Yet we must remember that creeds are credita, and not
        credenda; historical statements of what the church hasbelieved, not
        infallible prescriptions of what the church must believe. George Dana
        Boardman, The Church, 98—“Creeds are apt to become cages.” Schurman,
        Agnosticism, 151—“The creeds were meant to be defensive fortifications
        of religion; alas, that they should have sometimes turned their
        artillery against the citadel itself.”T. H. Green: “We are told that we
        must be loyal to the beliefs of the Fathers. Yes, but who knows what the
        Fathers believe now?” George A. Gordon, Christ of To-day, 60—“The
        assumption that the Holy Spirit is not concerned in the development of
        theological thought, nor manifest in the intellectual evolution of
        mankind, is the superlative heresy of our generation.... The metaphysics
        of Jesus are absolutely essential to his ethics.... If his thought is a
        dream, his endeavor for man is a delusion.”See Schaff, Creeds of
        Christendom, 1:8, 15, 16; Storrs, Div. Origin of Christianity, 121; Ian
        Maclaren (John Watson), Cure of Souls, 152; Frederick Harrison, in
        Fortnightly Rev., Jan. 1889.

      (e) In the direct and indirect injunctions of Scripture. The Scripture
      urges upon us the thorough and comprehensive study of the truth (John
      5:39, marg.,—“Search the Scriptures”), the comparing and harmonizing of
      its different parts (1 Cor. 2:13—“comparing spiritual things with
      spiritual”), the gathering of all about the great central fact of
      revelation (Col. 1:27—“which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”), the
      preaching of it in its wholeness as well as in its due proportions (2 Tim.
      4:2—“Preach the word”). The minister of the Gospel is called “a scribe who
      hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven” (Mat. 13:52); the
      “pastors” of the churches are at the same time to be “teachers” (Eph.
      4:11); the bishop must be “apt to teach” (1 Tim. 3:2), “handling aright
      the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15), “holding to the faithful word which is
      according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound
      doctrine and to convict the gainsayers” (Tit. 1:9).
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        As a means of instructing the church and of securing progress in his own
        understanding of Christian truth, it is well for the pastor to preach
        regularly each month a doctrinal sermon, and to expound in course the
        principal articles of the faith. The treatment of doctrine in these
        sermons should be simple enough to be comprehensible by intelligent
        youth; it should be made vivid and interesting by the help of brief
        illustrations; and at least one-third of each sermon should be devoted
        to the practical applications of the doctrine propounded. See Jonathan
        Edwards&#x27;s sermon on the Importance of the Knowledge of Divine
        Truth, in Works, 4:1-15. The actual sermons of Edwards, however, are not
        models of doctrinal preaching for our generation. They are too
        scholastic in form, too metaphysical for substance; there is too little
        of Scripture and too little of illustration. The doctrinal preaching of
        the English Puritans in a similar manner addressed itself almost wholly
        to adults. The preaching of our Lord on the other hand was adapted also
        to children. No pastor should count himself faithful, who permits his
        young people to grow up without regular instruction from the pulpit in
        the whole circle of Christian doctrine. Shakespeare, K. Henry VI, 2nd
        part, 4:7—“Ignorance is the curse of God; knowledge the wing wherewith
        we fly to heaven.”
