  <h1>Chapter I. Idea Of Theology.</h1>
  <h2>III. Possibility of Theology.</h2>
  <p>
    <em
      >The possibility of theology has a threefold ground: 1. In the existence
      of a God who has relations to the universe; 2. In the capacity of the
      human mind for knowing God and certain of these relations; and 3. In the
      provision of means by which God is brought into actual contact with the
      mind, or in other words, in the provision of a revelation.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Any particular science is possible only when three conditions combine,
    namely, the actual existence of the object with which the science deals, the
    subjective capacity of the human mind to know that object, and the provision
    of definite means by which the object is brought into contact with the mind.
    We may illustrate the conditions of theology from selenology—the science,
    not of “lunar politics,” which John Stuart Mill thought so vain a pursuit,
    but of lunar physics. Selenology has three conditions: 1. the objective
    existence of the moon; 2. the subjective capacity of the human mind to know
    the moon; and 3. the provision of some means (e. g., the eye and the
    telescope) by which the gulf between man and the moon is bridged over, and
    by which the mind can come into actual cognizance of the facts with regard
    to the moon.

    <h2>1. The existence of a God.</h2>
    <p>
      In the existence of a God who has relations to the universe.—It has been
      objected, indeed, that since God and these relations are objects
      apprehended only by faith, they are not proper objects of knowledge or
      subjects for science. We reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Faith is knowledge, and a higher sort of knowledge.—Physical science
      also rests upon faith—faith in our own existence, in the existence of a
      world objective and external to us, and in the existence of other persons
      than ourselves; faith in our primitive convictions, such as space, time,
      cause, substance, design, right; faith in the trustworthiness of our
      faculties and in the testimony of our fellow men. But physical science is
      not thereby invalidated, because this faith, though unlike
      sense-perception or logical demonstration, is yet a cognitive act of the
      reason, and may be defined as certitude with respect to matters in which
      verification is unattainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objection to theology thus mentioned and answered is expressed in the
      words of Sir William Hamilton, Metaphysics, 44, 531—“Faith—belief—is the
      organ by which we apprehend what is beyond our knowledge.” But science is
      knowledge, and what is beyond our knowledge cannot be matter for science.
      Pres. E. G. Robinson says well, that knowledge and faith cannot be severed
      from one another, like bulkheads in a ship, the first of which may be
      crushed in, while the second still keeps the vessel afloat. The mind is
      one,—“it cannot be cut in two with a hatchet.” Faith is not antithetical
      to knowledge,—it is rather a larger and more fundamental sort of
      knowledge. It is never opposed to reason, but only to sight. Tennyson was
      wrong when he wrote: “We have but faith: we cannot know; For knowledge is
      of things we see” (In Memoriam, Introduction). This would make sensuous
      phenomena the only objects of knowledge. Faith in supersensible realities,
      on the contrary, is the highest exercise of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William Hamilton consistently declares that the highest achievement of
      science is the erection of an altar “To the Unknown God.” This, however,
      is not the representation of Scripture. Cf. John 17:3—“this is life
      eternal, that they should know thee, the only true God”; and Jer.
      9:24—“let him that glorieth glory in that he hath understanding and
      knoweth me.” For criticism of Hamilton, see H. B. Smith, Faith and
      Philosophy, 297-336. Fichte: “We are born in faith.” Even Goethe called
      himself a believer in the five senses. Balfour, Defence of Philosophic
      Doubt, 277-295, shows that intuitive beliefs in space, time, cause,
      substance, right, are presupposed in the acquisition of all other
      knowledge. Dove, Logic of the Christian Faith, 14—“If theology is to be
      overthrown because it starts from some primary terms and propositions,
      then all other sciences are overthrown with it.” Mozley, Miracles, defines
      faith as “unverified reason.” See A. H. Strong, Philosophy and Religion,
      19-30.
    </p>
    <p>
      B. Faith is a knowledge conditioned by holy affection.—The faith which
      apprehends God&#x27;s being and working is not opinion or imagination. It
      is certitude with regard to spiritual realities, upon the testimony of our
      rational nature and upon the testimony of God. Its only peculiarity as a
      cognitive act of the reason is that it is conditioned by holy affection.
      As the science of æsthetics is a product of reason as including a power of
      recognizing beauty practically inseparable from a love for beauty, and as
      the science of ethics is a product of reason as including a power of
      recognizing the morally right practically inseparable from a love for the
      morally right, so the science of theology is a product of reason, but of
      reason as including a power of recognizing God which is practically
      inseparable from a love for God.
    </p>
    <p>
      We here use the term “reason” to signify the mind&#x27;s whole power of
      knowing. Reason in this sense includes states of the sensibility, so far
      as they are indispensable to knowledge. We cannot know an orange by the
      eye alone; to the understanding of it, taste is as necessary as sight. The
      mathematics of sound cannot give us an understanding of music; we need
      also a musical ear. Logic alone cannot demonstrate the beauty of a sunset,
      or of a noble character; love for the beautiful and the right precedes
      knowledge of the beautiful and the right. Ullman draws attention to the
      derivation of sapientia, wisdom, from sapĕre, to taste. So we cannot know
      God by intellect alone; the heart must go with the intellect to make
      knowledge of divine things possible. “Human things,” said Pascal, “need
      only to be known, in order to be loved; but divine things must first be
      loved, in order to be known.” “This [religious] faith of the intellect,”
      said Kant, “is founded on the assumption of moral tempers.” If one were
      utterly indifferent to moral laws, the philosopher continues, even then
      religious truths “would be supported by strong arguments from analogy, but
      not by such as an obstinate, sceptical heart might not overcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith, then, is the highest knowledge, because it is the act of the
      integral soul, the insight, not of one eye alone, but of the two eyes of
      the mind, intellect and love to God. With one eye we can see an object as
      flat, but, if we wish to see around it and get the stereoptic effect, we
      must use both eyes. It is not the theologian, but the undevout astronomer,
      whose science is one-eyed and therefore incomplete. The errors of the
      rationalist are errors of defective vision. Intellect has been divorced
      from heart, that is, from a right disposition, right affections, right
      purpose in life. Intellect says: “I cannot know God”; and intellect is
      right. What intellect says, the Scripture also says: 1 Cor. 2:14—“the
      natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
      foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are
      spiritually judged”; 1:21—“in the wisdom of God the world through its
      wisdom knew not God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scripture on the other hand declares that “by faith we know” (Heb.
      11:3). By “heart”the Scripture means simply the governing disposition, or
      the sensibility + the will; and it intimates that the heart is an organ of
      knowledge: Ex. 35:25—“the women that were wise-hearted”; Ps. 34:8—“O taste
      and see that Jehovah is good” = a right taste precedes correct sight; Jer.
      24:7—“I will give them a heart to know me”; Mat. 5:8—“Blessed are the pure
      in heart; for they shall see God”; Luke 24:25—“slow of heart to believe”;
      John 7:17—“If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the
      teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself”; Eph.
      1:18—“having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know”; 1 John
      4:7, 8—“Every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God. He that
      loveth not knoweth not God.” See Frank, Christian Certainty, 303-324;
      Clarke, Christ. Theol., 362; Illingworth, Div. and Hum. Personality,
      114-137; R. T. Smith, Man&#x27;s Knowledge of Man and of God, 6; Fisher,
      Nat. and Method of Rev., 6; William James, The Will to Believe, 1-31; Geo.
      T. Ladd, on Lotze&#x27;s view that love is essential to the knowledge of
      God, in New World, Sept. 1895:401-406; Gunsaulus, Transfig. of Christ, 14,
      15.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Faith, therefore, can furnish, and only faith can furnish, fit and
      sufficient material for a scientific theology.—As an operation of
      man&#x27;s higher rational nature, though distinct from ocular vision or
      from reasoning, faith is not only a kind, but the highest kind, of
      knowing. It gives us understanding of realities which to sense alone are
      inaccessible, namely, God&#x27;s existence, and some at least of the
      relations between God and his creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippi, Glaubenslehre, 1:50, follows Gerhard in making faith the joint
      act of intellect and will. Hopkins, Outline Study of Man, 77, 78, speaks
      not only of “the æsthetic reason” but of “the moral reason.” Murphy,
      Scientific Bases of Faith, 91, 109, 145, 191—“Faith is the certitude
      concerning matter in which verification is unattainable.” Emerson, Essays,
      2:96—“Belief consists in accepting the affirmations of the soul—unbelief
      in rejecting them.” Morell, Philos. of Religion, 38, 52, 53, quotes
      Coleridge: “Faith consists in the synthesis of the reason and of the
      individual will, ... and by virtue of the former (that is, reason), faith
      must be a light, a form of knowing, a beholding of truth.” Faith, then, is
      not to be pictured as a blind girl clinging to a cross—faith is not
      blind—“Else the cross may just as well be a crucifix or an image of
      Gaudama.” “Blind unbelief,” not blind faith, “is sure to err, And scan his
      works in vain.” As in conscience we recognize an invisible authority, and
      know the truth just in proportion to our willingness to “do the truth,” so
      in religion only holiness can understand holiness, and only love can
      understand love (cf. John 3:21—“he that doeth the truth cometh to the
      light”).
    </p>
    <p>
      If a right state of heart be indispensable to faith and so to the
      knowledge of God, can there be any “theologia irregenitorum,” or theology
      of the unregenerate? Yes, we answer; just as the blind man can have a
      science of optics. The testimony of others gives it claims upon him; the
      dim light penetrating the obscuring membrane corroborates this testimony.
      The unregenerate man can know God as power and justice, and can fear him.
      But this is not a knowledge of God&#x27;s inmost character; it furnishes
      some material for a defective and ill-proportioned theology; but it does
      not furnish fit or sufficient material for a correct theology. As, in
      order to make his science of optics satisfactory and complete, the blind
      man must have the cataract removed from his eyes by some competent
      oculist, so, in order to any complete or satisfactory theology, the veil
      must be taken away from the heart by God himself (cf. 2 Cor. 3:15, 16—“a
      veil lieth upon their heart. But whensoever it [marg. ‘a man’] shall turn
      to the Lord, the veil is taken away”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our doctrine that faith is knowledge and the highest knowledge is to be
      distinguished from that of Ritschl, whose theology is an appeal to the
      heart to the exclusion of the head—to fiducia without notitia. But fiducia
      includes notitia, else it is blind, irrational, and unscientific. Robert
      Browning, in like manner, fell into a deep speculative error, when, in
      order to substantiate his optimistic faith, he stigmatized human knowledge
      as merely apparent. The appeal of both Ritschl and Browning from the head
      to the heart should rather be an appeal from the narrower knowledge of the
      mere intellect to the larger knowledge conditioned upon right affection.
      See A. H. Strong, The Great Poets and their Theology, 441. On
      Ritschl&#x27;s postulates, see Stearns, Evidence of Christian Experience,
      274-280, and Pfleiderer, Die Ritschl&#x27;sche Theologie. On the relation
      of love and will to knowledge, see Kaftan, in Am. Jour. Theology,

    <h2>2. Man's capacity for the knowledge of God</h2>
    <p>
      In the capacity of the human mind for knowing God and certain of these
      relations.—But it has urged that such knowledge is impossible for the
      following reasons:
    </p>
    <p>
      A. Because we can know only phenomena. We reply: (a) We know mental as
      well as physical phenomena. (b) In knowing phenomena, whether mental or
      physical, we know substance as underlying the phenomena, as manifested
      through them, and as constituting their ground of unity. (c) Our minds
      bring to the observation of phenomena not only this knowledge of
      substance, but also knowledge of time, space, cause, and right, realities
      which are in no sense phenomenal. Since these objects of knowledge are not
      phenomenal, the fact that God is not phenomenal cannot prevent us from
      knowing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What substance is, we need not here determine. Whether we are realists or
      idealists, we are compelled to grant that there cannot be phenomena
      without noumena, cannot be appearances without something that appears,
      cannot be qualities without something that is qualified. This something
      which underlies or stands under appearance or quality we call substance.
      We are Lotzeans rather than Kantians, in our philosophy. To say that we
      know, not the self, but only its manifestations in thought, is to confound
      self with its thinking and to teach psychology without a soul. To say that
      we know no external world, but only its manifestations in sensations, is
      to ignore the principle that binds these sensations together; for without
      a somewhat in which qualities inhere they can have no ground of unity. In
      like manner, to say that we know nothing of God but his manifestations, is
      to confound God with the world and practically to deny that there is a
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stählin, in his work on Kant, Lotze and Ritschl, 186-191, 218, 219, says
      well that “limitation of knowledge to phenomena involves the elimination
      from theology of all claim to know the objects of the Christian faith as
      they are in themselves.” This criticism justly classes Ritschl with Kant,
      rather than with Lotze who maintains that knowing phenomena we know also
      the noumena manifested in them. While Ritschl professes to follow Lotze,
      the whole drift of his theology is in the direction of the Kantian
      identification of the world with our sensations, mind with our thoughts,
      and God with such activities of his as we can perceive. A divine nature
      apart from its activities, a preexistent Christ, an immanent Trinity, are
      practically denied. Assertions that God is self-conscious love and
      fatherhood become judgments of merely subjective value. On Ritschl, see
      the works of Orr, of Garvie, and of Swing; also Minton, in Pres. and Ref.
      Rev., Jan. 1902:162-169, and C. W. Hodge, ibid., Apl. 1902:321-326; Flint,
      Agnosticism, 590-597; Everett, Essays Theol. and Lit., 92-99.
    </p>
    <p>
      We grant that we can know God only so far as his activities reveal him,
      and so far as our minds and hearts are receptive of his revelation. The
      appropriate faculties must be exercised—not the mathematical, the logical,
      or the prudential, but the ethical and the religious. It is the merit of
      Ritschl that he recognizes the practical in distinction from the
      speculative reason; his error is in not recognizing that, when we do thus
      use the proper powers of knowing, we gain not merely subjective but also
      objective truth, and come in contact not simply with God&#x27;s activities
      but also with God himself. Normal religious judgments, though dependent
      upon subjective conditions, are not simply “judgments of worth” or
      “value-judgments,”—they give us the knowledge of “things in themselves.”
      Edward Caird says of his brother John Caird (Fund. Ideas of Christianity,
      Introd. cxxi)—“The conviction that God can be known and is known, and
      that, in the deepest sense, all our knowledge is knowledge of him, was the
      corner-stone of his theology.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ritschl&#x27;s phenomenalism is allied to the positivism of Comte, who
      regarded all so-called knowledge of other than phenomenal objects as
      purely negative. The phrase “Positive Philosophy” implies indeed that all
      knowledge of mind is negative; see Comte, Pos. Philosophy,
      Martineau&#x27;s translation, 26, 28, 33—“In order to observe, your
      intellect must pause from activity—yet it is this very activity you want
      to observe. If you cannot effect the pause, you cannot observe; if you do
      effect it, there is nothing to observe.” This view is refuted by the two
      facts; (1) consciousness, and (2) memory; for consciousness is the knowing
      of the self side by side with the knowing of its thoughts, and memory is
      the knowing of the self side by side with the knowing of its past; see
      Martineau, Essays Philos. and Theol., 1:24-40, 207-212. By phenomena we
      mean “facts, in distinction from their ground, principle, or law”;
      “neither phenomena nor qualities, as such, are perceived, but objects,
      percepts, or beings; and it is by an after-thought or reflex process that
      these are connected as qualities and are referred to as substances”; see
      Porter, Human Intellect, 51, 238, 520, 619-637, 640-645.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phenomena may be internal, e. g., thoughts; in this case the noumenon is
      the mind, of which these thoughts are the manifestations. Or, phenomena
      may be external, e. g., color, hardness, shape, size; in this case the
      noumenon is matter, of which these qualities are the manifestations. But
      qualities, whether mental or material, imply the existence of a substance
      to which they belong: they can no more be conceived of as existing apart
      from substance, than the upper side of a plank can be conceived of as
      existing without an under side; see Bowne, Review of Herbert Spencer, 47,
      207-217; Martineau, Types of Ethical Theory, 1; 455, 456—“Comte&#x27;s
      assumption that mind cannot know itself or its states is exactly balanced
      by Kant&#x27;s assumption that mind cannot know anything outside of
      itself.... It is precisely because all knowledge is of relations that it
      is not and cannot be of phenomena alone. The absolute cannot per se be
      known, because in being known it would ipso facto enter into relations and
      be absolute no more. But neither can the phenomenal per se be known, i.
      e., be known as phenomenal, without simultaneous cognition of what is
      non-phenomenal.” McCosh, Intuitions, 138-154, states the characteristics
      of substance as (1) being, (2) power, (3) permanence. Diman, Theistic
      Argument, 337, 363—“The theory that disproves God, disproves an external
      world and the existence of the soul.” We know something beyond phenomena,
      viz.: law, cause, force,—or we can have no science; see Tulloch, on Comte,
      in Modern Theories, 53-73; see also Bib. Sac., 1874:211; Alden,
      Philosophy, 44; Hopkins, Outline Study of Man, 87; Fleming, Vocab. of
      Philosophy, art.: Phenomena; New Englander, July, 1875:537-539.
    </p>
    <p>
      B. Because we can know only that which bears analogy to our own nature or
      experience. We reply: (a) It is not essential to knowledge that there be
      similarity of nature between the knower and the known. We know by
      difference as well as by likeness. (b) Our past experience, though greatly
      facilitating new acquisitions, is not the measure of our possible
      knowledge. Else the first act of knowledge would be inexplicable, and all
      revelation of higher characters to lower would be precluded, as well as
      all progress to knowledge which surpasses our present attainments. (c)
      Even if knowledge depended upon similarity of nature and experience, we
      might still know God, since we are made in God&#x27;s image, and there are
      important analogies between the divine nature and our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The dictum of Empedocles, “Similia similibus percipiuntur,” must be
      supplemented by a second dictum, “Similia dissimilibus percipiuntur.” All
      things are alike, in being objects. But knowing is distinguishing, and
      there must be contrast between objects to awaken our attention. God knows
      sin, though it is the antithesis to his holy being. The ego knows the
      non-ego. We cannot know even self, without objectifying it, distinguishing
      it from its thoughts, and regarding it as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Versus Herbert Spencer, First Principles, 79-82—“Knowledge is
      recognition and classification.” But we reply that a thing must first be
      perceived in order to be recognized or compared with something else; and
      this is as true of the first sensation as of the later and more definite
      forms of knowledge,—indeed there is no sensation which does not involve,
      as its complement, an at least incipient perception; see Sir William
      Hamilton, Metaphysics, 351, 352; Porter, Human Intellect, 206.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Porter, Human Intellect, 486—“Induction is possible only upon the
      assumption that the intellect of man is a reflex of the divine intellect,
      or that man is made in the image of God.” Note, however, that man is made
      in God&#x27;s image, not God in man&#x27;s. The painting is the image of
      the landscape, not, vice versa, the landscape the image of the painting;
      for there is much in the landscape that has nothing corresponding to it in
      the painting. Idolatry perversely makes God in the image of man, and so
      deifies man&#x27;s weakness and impurity. Trinity in God may have no exact
      counterpart in man&#x27;s present constitution, though it may disclose to
      us the goal of man&#x27;s future development and the meaning of the
      increasing differentiation of man&#x27;s powers. Gore, Incarnation,
      116—“If anthropomorphism as applied to God is false, yet theomorphism as
      applied to man is true; man is made in God&#x27;s image, and his qualities
      are, not the measure of the divine, but their counterpart and real
      expression.” See Murphy, Scientific Bases, 122; McCosh, in Internat. Rev.,
      1875:105; Bib. Sac., 1867:624; Martineau, Types of Ethical Theory, 2:4-8,
      and Study of Religion, 1:94.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. Because we know only that of which we can conceive, in the sense of
      forming an adequate mental image. We reply: (a) It is true that we know
      only that of which we can conceive, if by the term “conceive” we mean our
      distinguishing in thought the object known from all other objects. But,
      (b) The objection confounds conception with that which is merely its
      occasional accompaniment and help, namely, the picturing of the object by
      the imagination. In this sense, conceivability is not a final test of
      truth. (c) That the formation of a mental image is not essential to
      conception or knowledge, is plain when we remember that, as a matter of
      fact, we both conceive and know many things of which we cannot form a
      mental image of any sort that in the least corresponds to the reality; for
      example, force, cause, law, space, our own minds. So we may know God,
      though we cannot form an adequate mental image of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objection here refuted is expressed most clearly in the words of
      Herbert Spencer, First Principles, 25-36, 98—“The reality underlying
      appearances is totally and forever inconceivable by us.” Mansel,
      Prolegomena Logica, 77, 78 (cf. 26) suggests the source of this error in a
      wrong view of the nature of the concept: “The first distinguishing feature
      of a concept, viz.: that it cannot in itself be depicted to sense or
      imagination.” Porter, Human Intellect, 392 (see also 429, 656)—“The
      concept is not a mental image”—only the percept is. Lotze: “Color in
      general is not representable by any image; it looks neither green nor red,
      but has no look whatever.” The generic horse has no particular color,
      though the individual horse may be black, white, or bay. So Sir William
      Hamilton speaks of “the unpicturable notions of the intelligence.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Martineau, Religion and Materialism, 39, 40—“This doctrine of Nescience
      stands in exactly the same relation to causal power, whether you construe
      it as Material Force or as Divine Agency. Neither can be observed; one or
      the other must be assumed. If you admit to the category of knowledge only
      what we learn from observation, particular or generalized, then is Force
      unknown; if you extend the word to what is imported by the intellect
      itself into our cognitive acts, to make them such, then is God known.”
      Matter, ether, energy, protoplasm, organism, life,—no one of these can be
      portrayed to the imagination; yet Mr. Spencer deals with them as objects
      of Science. If these are not inscrutable, why should he regard the Power
      that gives unity to all things as inscrutable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Spencer is not in fact consistent with himself, for in divers
      parts of his writings he calls the inscrutable Reality back of phenomena
      the one, eternal, ubiquitous, infinite, ultimate, absolute Existence,
      Power and Cause. “It seems,” says Father Dalgairns, “that a great deal is
      known about the Unknowable.” Chadwick, Unitarianism, 75—“The beggar phrase
      ‘Unknowable’ becomes, after Spencer&#x27;s repeated designations of it, as
      rich as Croesus with all saving knowledge.” Matheson: “To know that we
      know nothing is already to have reached a fact of knowledge.” If Mr.
      Spencer intended to exclude God from the realm of Knowledge, he should
      first have excluded him from the realm of Existence; for to grant that he
      is, is already to grant that we not only may know him, but that we
      actually to some extent do know him; see D. J. Hill, Genetic Philosophy,
      22; McCosh, Intuitions, 186-189 (Eng. ed., 214); Murphy, Scientific Bases,
      133; Bowne, Review of Spencer, 30-34; New Englander, July, 1875:543, 544;
      Oscar Craig, in Presb. Rev., July, 1883:594-602.
    </p>
    <p>
      D. Because we can know truly only that which we know in whole and not in
      part. We reply: (a) The objection confounds partial knowledge with the
      knowledge of a part. We know the mind in part, but we do not know a part
      of the mind. (b) If the objection were valid, no real knowledge of
      anything would be possible, since we know no single thing in all its
      relations. We conclude that, although God is a being not composed of
      parts, we may yet have a partial knowledge of him, and this knowledge,
      though not exhaustive, may yet be real, and adequate to the purposes of
      science.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The objection mentioned in the text is urged by Mansel, Limits of
      Religious Thought, 97, 98, and is answered by Martineau, Essays, 1:291.
      The mind does not exist in space, and it has no parts: we cannot speak of
      its south-west corner, nor can we divide it into halves. Yet we find the
      material for mental science in partial knowledge of the mind. So, while we
      are not “geographers of the divine nature” (Bowne, Review of Spencer, 72),
      we may say with Paul, not “now know we a part of God,” but “now I know
      [God], in part” (1 Cor. 13:12). We may know truly what we do not know
      exhaustively; see Eph. 3:19—“to know the love of Christ which passeth
      knowledge.” I do not perfectly understand myself, yet I know myself in
      part; so I may know God, though I do not perfectly understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) The same argument that proves God unknowable proves the universe
      unknowable also. Since every particle of matter in the universe attracts
      every other, no one particle can be exhaustively explained without taking
      account of all the rest. Thomas Carlyle: “It is a mathematical fact that
      the casting of this pebble from my hand alters the centre of gravity of
      the universe.” Tennyson, Higher Pantheism: “Flower in the crannied wall, I
      pluck you out of the crannies; Hold you here, root and all, in my hand,
      Little flower; but if I could understand What you are, root and all, and
      all in all, I should know what God and man is.” Schurman, Agnosticism,
      119—“Partial as it is, this vision of the divine transfigures the life of
      man on earth.” Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:167—“A faint-hearted
      agnosticism is worse than the arrogant and titanic gnosticism against
      which it protests.”
    </p>
    <p>
      E. Because all predicates of God are negative, and therefore furnish no
      real knowledge. We answer: (a) Predicates derived from our consciousness,
      such as spirit, love, and holiness, are positive. (b) The terms “infinite”
      and “absolute,” moreover, express not merely a negative but a positive
      idea—the idea, in the former case, of the absence of all limit, the idea
      that the object thus described goes on and on forever; the idea, in the
      latter case, of entire self-sufficiency. Since predicates of God,
      therefore, are not merely negative, the argument mentioned above furnishes
      no valid reason why we may not know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Versus Sir William Hamilton, Metaphysics, 530—“The absolute and the
      infinite can each only be conceived as a negation of the thinkable; in
      other words, of the absolute and infinite we have no conception at all.”
      Hamilton here confounds the infinite, or the absence of all limits, with
      the indefinite, or the absence of all known limits. Per contra, see
      Calderwood, Moral Philosophy, 248, and Philosophy of the Infinite,
      272—“Negation of one thing is possible only by affirmation of another.”
      Porter, Human Intellect, 652—“If the Sandwich Islanders, for lack of name,
      had called the ox a not-hog, the use of a negative appellation would not
      necessarily authorize the inference of a want of definite conceptions or
      positive knowledge.” So with the infinite or not-finite, the unconditioned
      or not-conditioned, the independent or not-dependent,—these names do not
      imply that we cannot conceive and know it as something positive. Spencer,
      First Principles, 92—“Our consciousness of the Absolute, indefinite though
      it is, is positive, and not negative.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Schurman, Agnosticism, 100, speaks of “the farce of nescience playing at
      omniscience in setting the bounds of science.” “The agnostic,” he says,
      “sets up the invisible picture of a Grand Être, formless and colorless in
      itself, absolutely separated from man and from the world—blank within and
      void without—its very existence indistinguishable from its non-existence,
      and, bowing down before this idolatrous creation, he pours out his soul in
      lamentations over the incognizableness of such a mysterious and awful
      non-entity.... The truth is that the agnostic&#x27;s abstraction of a
      Deity is unknown, only because it is unreal.” See McCosh, Intuitions, 194,
      note; Mivart, Lessons from Nature, 363. God is not necessarily infinite in
      every respect. He is infinite only in every excellence. A plane which is
      unlimited in the one respect of length may be limited in another respect,
      such as breadth. Our doctrine here is not therefore inconsistent with what
      immediately follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      F. Because to know is to limit or define. Hence the Absolute as unlimited,
      and the Infinite as undefined, cannot be known. We answer: (a) God is
      absolute, not as existing in no relation, but as existing in no necessary
      relation; and (b) God is infinite, not as excluding all coexistence of the
      finite with himself, but as being the ground of the finite, and so
      unfettered by it. (c) God is actually limited by the unchangeableness of
      his own attributes and personal distinctions, as well as by his
      self-chosen relations to the universe he has created and to humanity in
      the person of Christ. God is therefore limited and defined in such a sense
      as to render knowledge of him possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Versus Mansel, Limitations of Religious Thought, 75-84, 93-95; cf.
      Spinoza: “Omnis determinatio est negatio;” hence to define God is to deny
      him. But we reply that perfection is inseparable from limitation. Man can
      be other than he is: not so God, at least internally. But this limitation,
      inherent in his unchangeable attributes and personal distinctions, is
      God&#x27;s perfection. Externally, all limitations upon God are
      self-limitations, and so are consistent with his perfection. That God
      should not be able thus to limit himself in creation and redemption would
      render all self-sacrifice in him impossible, and so would subject him to
      the greatest of limitations. We may say therefore that God&#x27;s 1.
      Perfection involves his limitation to (a) personality, (b) trinity, (c)
      righteousness; 2. Revelation involves his self-limitation in (a) decree,
      (b) creation, (c) preservation, (d) government, (e) education of the
      world; 3. Redemption involves his infinite self-limitation in the (a)
      person and (b) work of Jesus Christ; see A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation,
      87-101, and in Bap. Quar. Rev., Jan. 1891:521-532.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 135—“The infinite is not the quantitative all;
      the absolute is not the unrelated.... Both absolute and infinite mean only
      the independent ground of things.” Julius Müller, Doct. Sin, Introduc.,
      10—“Religion has to do, not with anObject that must let itself be known
      because its very existence is contingent upon its being known, but with
      the Object in relation to whom we are truly subject, dependent upon him,
      and waiting until he manifest himself.” James Martineau, Study of
      Religion, 1:346—“We must not confound the infinite with the total.... The
      self-abnegation of infinity is but a form of self-assertion, and the only
      form in which it can reveal itself.... However instantaneous the
      omniscient thought, however sure the almighty power, the execution has to
      be distributed in time, and must have an order of successive steps; on no
      other terms can the eternal become temporal, and the infinite articulately
      speak in the finite.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect personality excludes, not self-determination, but determination
      from without, determination by another. God&#x27;s self-limitations are
      the self-limitations of love, and therefore the evidences of his
      perfection. They are signs, not of weakness but of power. God has limited
      himself to the method of evolution, gradually unfolding himself in nature
      and in history. The government of sinners by a holy God involves constant
      self-repression. The education of the race is a long process of divine
      forbearance; Herder: “The limitations of the pupil are limitations of the
      teacher also.” In inspiration, God limits himself by the human element
      through which he works. Above all, in the person and work of Christ, we
      have infinite self-limitation: Infinity narrows itself down to a point in
      the incarnation, and holiness endures the agonies of the Cross. God&#x27;s
      promises are also self-limitations. Thus both nature and grace are
      self-imposed restrictions upon God, and these self-limitations are the
      means by which he reveals himself. See Pfleiderer, Die Religion, 1:189,
      195; Porter, Human Intellect, 653; Murphy, Scientific Bases, 130;
      Calderwood, Philos. Infinite, 168; McCosh, Intuitions, 186; Hickok,
      Rational Cosmology, 85; Martineau, Study of Religion, 2:85, 86, 362;
      Shedd, Dogmatic Theology, 1:189-191.

    <p>
      G. Because all knowledge is relative to the knowing agent; that is, what
      we know, we know, not as it is objectively, but only as it is related to
      our own senses and faculties. In reply: (a) We grant that we can know only
      that which has relation to our faculties. But this is simply to say that
      we know only that which we come into mental contact with, that is, we know
      only what we know. But, (b) We deny that what we come into mental contact
      with is known by us as other than it is. So far as it is known at all, it
      is known as it is. In other words, the laws of our knowing are not merely
      arbitrary and regulative, but correspond to the nature of things. We
      conclude that, in theology, we are equally warranted in assuming that the
      laws of our thought are laws of God&#x27;s thought, and that the results
      of normally conducted thinking with regard to God correspond to the
      objective reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Versus Sir Wm. Hamilton, Metaph., 96-116, and Herbert Spencer, First
      Principles, 68-97. This doctrine of relativity is derived from Kant,
      Critique of Pure Reason, who holds that a priori judgments are simply
      “regulative.” But we reply that when our primitive beliefs are found to be
      simply regulative, they will cease to regulate. The forms of thought are
      also facts of nature. The mind does not, like the glass of a kaleidoscope,
      itself furnish the forms; it recognizes these as having an existence
      external to itself. The mind reads its ideas, not into nature, but in
      nature. Our intuitions are not green goggles, which make all the world
      seem green: they are the lenses of a microscope, which enable us to see
      what is objectively real (Royce, Spirit of Mod. Philos., 125). Kant called
      our understanding “the legislator of nature.” But it is so, only as
      discoverer of nature&#x27;s laws, not as creator of them. Human reason
      does impose its laws and forms upon the universe; but, in doing this, it
      interprets the real meaning of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladd, Philos. of Knowledge: “All judgment implies an objective truth
      according to which we judge, which constitutes the standard, and with
      which we have something in common, i. e., our minds are part of an
      infinite and eternal Mind.” French aphorism: “When you are right, you are
      more right than you think you are.” God will not put us to permanent
      intellectual confusion. Kant vainly wrote “No thoroughfare” over the
      reason in its highest exercise. Martineau, Study of Religion, 1:135,
      136—“Over against Kant&#x27;s assumption that the mind cannot know
      anything outside of itself, we may set Comte&#x27;s equally unwarrantable
      assumption that the mind cannot know itself or its states. We cannot have
      philosophy without assumptions. You dogmatize if you say that the forms
      correspond with reality; but you equally dogmatize if you say that they do
      not.... 79—That our cognitive faculties correspond to things as they are,
      is much less surprising than that they should correspond to things as they
      are not.” W. T. Harris, in Journ. Spec. Philos., 1:22, exposes Herbert
      Spencer&#x27;s self-contradiction: “All knowledge is, not absolute, but
      relative; our knowledge of this fact however is, not relative, but
      absolute.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ritschl, Justification and Reconciliation, 3:16-21, sets out with a
      correct statement of the nature of knowledge, and gives in his adhesion to
      the doctrine of Lotze, as distinguished from that of Kant. Ritschl&#x27;s
      statement may be summarized as follows: “We deal, not with the abstract
      God of metaphysics, but with the God self-limited, who is revealed in
      Christ. We do not know either things or God apart from their phenomena or
      manifestations, as Plato imagined; we do not know phenomena or
      manifestations alone, without knowing either things or God, as Kant
      supposed; but we do know both things and God in their phenomena or
      manifestations, as Lotze taught. We hold to no mystical union with God,
      back of all experience in religion, as Pietism does; soul is always and
      only active, and religion is the activity of the human spirit, in which
      feeling, knowing and willing combine in an intelligible order.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. C. M. Mead, Ritschl&#x27;s Place in the History of Doctrine, has
      well shown that Ritschl has not followed Lotze. His “value-judgments” are
      simply an application to theology of the “regulative” principle of Kant.
      He holds that we can know things not as they are in themselves, but only
      as they are for us. We reply that what things are worth for us depends on
      what they are in themselves. Ritschl regards the doctrines of
      Christ&#x27;s preexistence, divinity and atonement as intrusions of
      metaphysics into theology, matters about which we cannot know, and with
      which we have nothing to do. There is no propitiation or mystical union
      with Christ; and Christ is our Example, but not our atoning Savior.
      Ritschl does well in recognizing that love in us gives eyes to the mind,
      and enables us to see the beauty of Christ and his truth. But our judgment
      is not, as he holds, a merely subjective value-judgment,—it is a coming in
      contact with objective fact. On the theory of knowledge held by Kant,
      Hamilton and Spencer, see Bishop Temple, Bampton Lectures for 1884:13; H.

    <h2>3. God's revelation of himself to man.</h2>
    <p>
      In God&#x27;s actual revelation of himself and certain of these
      relations.—As we do not in this place attempt a positive proof of
      God&#x27;s existence or of man&#x27;s capacity for the knowledge of God,
      so we do not now attempt to prove that God has brought himself into
      contact with man&#x27;s mind by revelation. We shall consider the grounds
      of this belief hereafter. Our aim at present is simply to show that,
      granting the fact of revelation, a scientific theology is possible. This
      has been denied upon the following grounds:
    </p>
    <p>
      A. That revelation, as a making known, is necessarily internal and
      subjective—either a mode of intelligence, or a quickening of man&#x27;s
      cognitive powers—and hence can furnish no objective facts such as
      constitute the proper material for science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morell, Philos. Religion, 128-131, 143—“The Bible cannot in strict
      accuracy of language be called a revelation, since a revelation always
      implies an actual process of intelligence in a living mind.” F. W. Newman,
      Phases of Faith, 152—“Of our moral and spiritual God we know nothing
      without—everything within.” Theodore Parker: “Verbal revelation can never
      communicate a simple idea like that of God, Justice, Love, Religion”; see
      review of Parker in Bib. Sac., 18:24-27. James Martineau, Seat of
      Authority in Religion: “As many minds as there are that know God at first
      hand, so many revealing acts there have been, and as many as know him at
      second hand are strangers to revelation”; so, assuming external revelation
      to be impossible, Martineau subjects all the proofs of such revelation to
      unfair destructive criticism. Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion, 1:185—“As all
      revelation is originally an inner living experience, the springing up of
      religious truth in the heart, no external event can belong in itself to
      revelation, no matter whether it be naturally or supernaturally brought
      about.”Professor George M. Forbes: “Nothing can be revealed to us which we
      do not grasp with our reason. It follows that, so far as reason acts
      normally, it is a part of revelation.”Ritchie, Darwin and Hegel, 30—“The
      revelation of God is the growth of the idea of God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this objection, urged mainly by idealists in philosophy, (a)
      We grant that revelation, to be effective, must be the means of inducing a
      new mode of intelligence, or in other words, must be understood. We grant
      that this understanding of divine things is impossible without a
      quickening of man&#x27;s cognitive powers. We grant, moreover, that
      revelation, when originally imparted, was often internal and subjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matheson, Moments on the Mount, 51-53, on Gal. 1:16—“to reveal his Son in
      me”: “The revelation on the way to Damascus would not have enlightened
      Paul, had it been merely a vision to his eye. Nothing can be revealed to
      us which has not been revealed in us. The eye does not see the beauty of
      the landscape, nor the ear hear the beauty of music. So flesh and blood do
      not reveal Christ to us. Without the teaching of the Spirit, the external
      facts will be only like the letters of a book to a child that cannot
      read.” We may say with Channing: “I am more sure that my rational nature
      is from God, than that any book is the expression of his will.”
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) But we deny that external revelation is therefore useless or
      impossible. Even if religious ideas sprang wholly from within, an external
      revelation might stir up the dormant powers of the mind. Religious ideas,
      however, do not spring wholly from within. External revelation can impart
      them. Man can reveal himself to man by external communications, and, if
      God has equal power with man, God can reveal himself to man in like
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogers, in his Eclipse of Faith, asks pointedly: “If Messrs. Morell and
      Newman can teach by a book, cannot God do the same?” Lotze, Microcosmos,
      2:660 (book 9, chap. 4), speaks of revelation as “either contained in some
      divine act of historic occurrence, or continually repeated in men&#x27;s
      hearts.” But in fact there is no alternative here; the strength of the
      Christian creed is that God&#x27;s revelation is both external and
      internal; see Gore, in Lux Mundi, 338. Rainy, in Critical Review, 1:1-21,
      well says that Martineau unwarrantably isolates the witness of God to the
      individual soul. The inward needs to be combined with the outward, in
      order to make sure that it is not a vagary of the imagination. We need to
      distinguish God&#x27;s revelations from our own fancies. Hence, before
      giving the internal, God commonly gives us the external, as a standard by
      which to try our impressions. We are finite and sinful, and we need
      authority. The external revelation commends itself as authoritative to the
      heart which recognizes its own spiritual needs. External authority evokes
      the inward witness and gives added clearness to it, but only historical
      revelation furnishes indubitable proof that God is love, and gives us
      assurance that our longings after God are not in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Hence God&#x27;s revelation may be, and, as we shall hereafter see, it
      is, in great part, an external revelation in works and words. The universe
      is a revelation of God; God&#x27;s works in nature precede God&#x27;s
      words in history. We claim, moreover, that, in many cases where truth was
      originally communicated internally, the same Spirit who communicated it
      has brought about an external record of it, so that the internal
      revelation might be handed down to others than those who first received
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not limit revelation to the Scriptures. The eternal Word antedated
      the written word, and through the eternal Word God is made known in nature
      and in history. Internal revelation is preceded by, and conditioned upon,
      external revelation. In point of time earth comes before man, and
      sensation before perception. Action best expresses character, and historic
      revelation is more by deeds than by words. Dorner, Hist. Prot. Theol.,
      1:231-264—“The Word is not in the Scriptures alone. The whole creation
      reveals the Word. In nature God shows his power; in incarnation his grace
      and truth. Scripture testifies of these, but Scripture is not the
      essential Word. The Scripture is truly apprehended and appropriated when
      in it and through it we see the living and present Christ. It does not
      bind men to itself alone, but it points them to the Christ of whom it
      testifies. Christ is the authority. In the Scriptures he points us to
      himself and demands our faith in him. This faith, once begotten, leads us
      to new appropriation of Scripture, but also to new criticism of Scripture.
      We find Christ more and more in Scripture, and yet we judge Scripture more
      and more by the standard which we find in Christ.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Newman Smyth, Christian Ethics, 71-82: “There is but one authority—Christ.
      His Spirit works in many ways, but chiefly in two: first, the inspiration
      of the Scriptures, and, secondly, the leading of the church into the
      truth. The latter is not to be isolated or separated from the former.
      Scripture is law to the Christian consciousness, and Christian
      consciousness in time becomes law to the Scripture—interpreting,
      criticizing, verifying it. The word and the spirit answer to each other.
      Scripture and faith are coördinate. Protestantism has exaggerated the
      first; Romanism the second. Martineau fails to grasp the coördination of
      Scripture and faith.”
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) With this external record we shall also see that there is given under
      proper conditions a special influence of God&#x27;s Spirit, so to quicken
      our cognitive powers that the external record reproduces in our minds the
      ideas with which the minds of the writers were at first divinely filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may illustrate the need of internal revelation from Egyptology, which
      is impossible so long as the external revelation in the hieroglyphics is
      uninterpreted; from the ticking of the clock in a dark room, where only
      the lit candle enables us to tell the time; from the landscape spread out
      around the Rigi in Switzerland, invisible until the first rays of the sun
      touch the snowy mountain peaks. External revelation (φανέρωσις, Rom. 1:19,
      20) must be supplemented by internal revelation (ἀποκάλυψις, 1 Cor. 2:10,
      12). Christ is the organ of external, the Holy Spirit the organ of
      internal, revelation. In Christ (2 Cor. 1:20) are “the yea” and “the
      Amen”—the objective certainty and the subjective certitude, the reality
      and the realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objective certainty must become subjective certitude in order to be a
      scientific theology. Before conversion we have the first, the external
      truth of Christ; only at conversion and after conversion do we have the
      second, “Christ formed in us” (Gal. 4:19). We have objective revelation at
      Sinai (Ex. 20:22); subjective revelation in Elisha&#x27;s knowledge of
      Gehazi (2 K. 5:26). James Russell Lowell, Winter Evening Hymn to my Fire:
      “Therefore with thee I love to read Our brave old poets: at thy touch how
      stirs Life in the withered words! how swift recede Time&#x27;s shadows!
      and how glows again Through its dead mass the incandescent verse, As when
      upon the anvil of the brain It glittering lay, cyclopically wrought By the
      fast throbbing hammers of the poet&#x27;s thought!”
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Internal revelations thus recorded, and external revelations thus
      interpreted, both furnish objective facts which may serve as proper
      material for science. Although revelation in its widest sense may include,
      and as constituting the ground of the possibility of theology does
      include, both insight and illumination, it may also be used to denote
      simply a provision of the external means of knowledge, and theology has to
      do with inward revelations only as they are expressed in, or as they agree
      with, this objective standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have here suggested the vast scope and yet the insuperable limitations
      of theology. So far as God is revealed, whether in nature, history,
      conscience, or Scripture, theology may find material for its structure.
      Since Christ is not simply the incarnate Son of God but also the eternal
      Word, the only Revealer of God, there is no theology apart from Christ,
      and all theology is Christian theology. Nature and history are but the
      dimmer and more general disclosures of the divine Being, of which the
      Cross is the culmination and the key. God does not intentionally conceal
      himself. He wishes to be known. He reveals himself at all times just as
      fully as the capacity of his creatures will permit. The infantile
      intellect cannot understand God&#x27;s boundlessness, nor can the perverse
      disposition understand God&#x27;s disinterested affection. Yet all truth
      is in Christ and is open to discovery by the prepared mind and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Infinite One, so far as he is unrevealed, is certainly unknowable to
      the finite. But the Infinite One, so far as he manifests himself, is
      knowable. This suggests the meaning of the declarations: John 1:18—“No man
      hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of
      the Father, he hath declared him”; 14:9—“he that hath seen me hath seen
      the Father”; 1 Tim. 6:16—“whom no man hath seen, nor can see.” We
      therefore approve of the definition of Kaftan, Dogmatik, 1—“Dogmatics is
      the science of the Christian truth which is believed and acknowledged in
      the church upon the ground of the divine revelation”—in so far as it
      limits the scope of theology to truth revealed by God and apprehended by
      faith. But theology presupposes both God&#x27;s external and God&#x27;s
      internal revelations, and these, as we shall see, include nature, history,
      conscience and Scripture. On the whole subject, see Kahnis, Dogmatik,
      3:37-43; Nitzsch, System Christ. Doct., 72; Luthardt, Fund. Truths, 193;
      Auberlen, Div. Rev., Introd., 29; Martineau, Essays, 1:171, 280; Bib.
      Sac., 1867:593, and 1872:428; Porter, Human Intellect, 373-375; C. M.
      Mead, in Boston Lectures, 1871:58.
    </p>
    <p>
      B. That many of the truths thus revealed are too indefinite to constitute
      the material for science, because they belong to the region of the
      feelings, because they are beyond our full understanding, or because they
      are destitute of orderly arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>We reply:</p>
    <p>
      (a) Theology has to do with subjective feelings only as they can be
      defined, and shown to be effects of objective truth upon the mind. They
      are not more obscure than are the facts of morals or of psychology, and
      the same objection which would exclude such feelings from theology would
      make these latter sciences impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      See Jacobi and Schleiermacher, who regard theology as a mere account of
      devout Christian feelings, the grounding of which in objective historical
      facts is a matter of comparative indifference (Hagenbach, Hist. Doctrine,
      2:401-403). Schleiermacher therefore called his system of theology “Der
      Christliche Glaube,” and many since his time have called their systems by
      the name of “Glaubenslehre.” Ritschl&#x27;s “value-judgments,”in like
      manner, render theology a merely subjective science, if any subjective
      science is possible. Kaftan improves upon Ritschl, by granting that we
      know, not only Christian feelings, but also Christian facts. Theology is
      the science of God, and not simply the science of faith. Allied to the
      view already mentioned is that of Feuerbach, to whom religion is a matter
      of subjective fancy; and that of Tyndall, who would remit theology to the
      region of vague feeling and aspiration, but would exclude it from the
      realm of science; see Feuerbach, Essence of Christianity, translated by
      Marian Evans (George Eliot); also Tyndall, Belfast Address.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Those facts of revelation which are beyond our full understanding may,
      like the nebular hypothesis in astronomy, the atomic theory in chemistry,
      or the doctrine of evolution in biology, furnish a principle of union
      between great classes of other facts otherwise irreconcilable. We may
      define our concepts of God, and even of the Trinity, at least sufficiently
      to distinguish them from all other concepts; and whatever difficulty may
      encumber the putting of them into language only shows the importance of
      attempting it and the value of even an approximate success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Bushnell: “Theology can never be a science, on account of the
      infirmities of language.” But this principle would render void both
      ethical and political science. Fisher, Nat. and Meth. of Revelation,
      145—“Hume and Gibbon refer to faith as something too sacred to rest on
      proof. Thus religious beliefs are made to hang in mid-air, without any
      support. But the foundation of these beliefs is no less solid for the
      reason that empirical tests are not applicable to them. The data on which
      they rest are real, and the inferences from the data are fairly drawn.”
      Hodgson indeed pours contempt on the whole intuitional method by saying:
      “Whatever you are totally ignorant of, assert to be the explanation of
      everything else!” Yet he would probably grant that he begins his
      investigations by assuming his own existence. The doctrine of the Trinity
      is not wholly comprehensible by us, and we accept it at the first upon the
      testimony of Scripture; the full proof of it is found in the fact that
      each successive doctrine of theology is bound up with it, and with it
      stands or falls. The Trinity is rational because it explains Christian
      experience as well as Christian doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) Even though there were no orderly arrangement of these facts, either
      in nature or in Scripture, an accurate systematizing of them by the human
      mind would not therefore be proved impossible, unless a principle were
      assumed which would show all physical science to be equally impossible.
      Astronomy and geology are constructed by putting together multitudinous
      facts which at first sight seem to have no order. So with theology. And
      yet, although revelation does not present to us a dogmatic system
      ready-made, a dogmatic system is not only implicitly contained therein,
      but parts of the system are wrought out in the epistles of the New
      Testament, as for example in Rom. 5:12-19; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; 8:6; 1 Tim.
      3:16; Heb. 6:1, 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may illustrate the construction of theology from the dissected map, two
      pieces of which a father puts together, leaving his child to put together
      the rest. Or we may illustrate from the physical universe, which to the
      unthinking reveals little of its order. “Nature makes no fences.” One
      thing seems to glide into another. It is man&#x27;s business to
      distinguish and classify and combine. Origen: “God gives us truth in
      single threads, which we must weave into a finished texture.” Andrew
      Fuller said of the doctrines of theology that “they are united together
      like chain-shot, so that, whichever one enters the heart, the others must
      certainly follow.” George Herbert: “Oh that I knew how all thy lights
      combine, And the configuration of their glory; Seeing not only how each
      verse doth shine, But all the constellations of the story!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripture hints at the possibilities of combination, in Rom. 5:12-19, with
      its grouping of the facts of sin and salvation about the two persons, Adam
      and Christ; in Rom. 4:24, 25, with its linking of the resurrection of
      Christ and our justification; in 1 Cor. 3:6, with its indication of the
      relations between the Father and Christ; in 1 Tim. 3:16, with its poetical
      summary of the facts of redemption (see Commentaries of DeWette, Meyer,
      Fairbairn); in Heb. 6:1, 2, with its statement of the first principles of
      the Christian faith. God&#x27;s furnishing of concrete facts in theology,
      which we ourselves are left to systematize, is in complete accordance with
      his method of procedure with regard to the development of other sciences.
      See Martineau, Essays, 1:29, 40; Am. Theol. Rev., 1859:101-126—art. on the
      Idea, Sources and Uses of Christian Theology.
