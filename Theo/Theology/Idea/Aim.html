      The aim of theology is the ascertainment of the facts respecting God and
      the relations between God and the universe, and the exhibition of these
      facts in their rational unity, as connected parts of a formulated and
      organic system of truth.

        In defining theology as a science, we indicate its aim. Science does not
        create; it discovers. Theology answers to this description of a science.
        It discovers facts and relations, but it does not create them. Fisher,
        Nature and Method of Revelation, 141—“Schiller, referring to the ardor
        of Columbus&#x27;s faith, says that if the great discoverer had not
        found a continent, he would have created one. But faith is not creative.
        Had Columbus not found the land—had there been no real object answering
        to his belief—his faith would have been a mere fancy.” Because theology
        deals with objective facts, we refuse to define it as “the science of
        religion”; versus Am. Theol. Rev., 1850:101-126, and Thornwell,
        Theology, 1:139. Both the facts and the relations with which theology
        has to deal have an existence independent of the subjective mental
        processes of the theologian.

        Science is not only the observing, recording, verifying, and formulating
        of objective facts; it is also the recognition and explication of the
        relations between these facts, and the synthesis of both the facts and
        the rational principles which unite them in a comprehensive, rightly
        proportioned, and organic system. Scattered bricks and timbers are not a
        house; severed arms, legs, heads and trunks from a dissecting room are
        not living men; and facts alone do not constitute science. Science =
        facts + relations; Whewell, Hist. Inductive Sciences, I, Introd.,
        43—“There may be facts without science, as in the knowledge of the
        common quarryman; there may be thought without science, as in the early
        Greek philosophy.” A. MacDonald: “The a priori method is related to the
        a posteriori as the sails to the ballast of the boat: the more
        philosophy the better, provided there are a sufficient number of facts;
        otherwise, there is danger of upsetting the craft.”
      </p>
      <p>
        President Woodrow Wilson: “ ‘Give us the facts’ is the sharp injunction
        of our age to its historians ... But facts of themselves do not
        constitute the truth. The truth is abstract, not concrete. It is the
        just idea, the right revelation, of what things mean. It is evoked only
        by such arrangements and orderings of facts as suggest meanings.”Dove,
        Logic of the Christian Faith, 14—“The pursuit of science is the pursuit
        of relations.”Everett, Science of Thought, 3—“Logy” (e. g., in
        “theology”), from λόγος, = word + reason, expression + thought, fact +
        idea; cf. John 1:1—“In the beginning was the Word.”
      </p>
      <p>
        As theology deals with objective facts and their relations, so its
        arrangement of these facts is not optional, but is determined by the
        nature of the material with which it deals. A true theology thinks over
        again God&#x27;s thoughts and brings them into God&#x27;s order, as the
        builders of Solomon&#x27;s temple took the stones already hewn, and put
        them into the places for which the architect had designed them; Reginald
        Heber: “No hammer fell, no ponderous axes rung; Like some tall palm, the
        mystic fabric sprung.” Scientific men have no fear that the data of
        physics will narrow or cramp their intellects; no more should they fear
        the objective facts which are the data of theology. We cannot make
        theology, any more than we can make a law of physical nature. As the
        natural philosopher is “Naturæ minister et interpres,” so the theologian
        is the servant and interpreter of the objective truth of God. On the
        Idea of Theology as a System, see H. B. Smith, Faith and Philosophy,
        126-166.
