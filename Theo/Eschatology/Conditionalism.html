    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Conditionalism, also known as Annihilationism, proposes that after the
      resurrection and judgment of all people, the unsaved will face a second,
      irreversible death, ceasing conscious existence forever. Only those who
      are saved through faith in Christ will receive the gift of immortality and
      eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional belief in the eternal conscious torment of the unsaved,
      whether right or wrong, acts as a doctrinal grid that affects our
      interpretation of biblical texts. This grid forces texts about "death,"
      "destruction," and "perishing" to be interpreted metaphorically to refer
      to separation from God, pain, or torment even though annihilation,
      extinction, or cessation of consciousness would appear be the obvious
      interpretation of these passages otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are sufficient translational, exegetical, theological, and practical
      considerations to inspire humility and genuine reflection as one studies
      this weighty and important doctrine. Therefore, both sides must be careful
      to avoid reading presuppositions into the Bible or flippantly dismissing
      those who disagree. Proof-texting without regard for context or
      carefulness is irresponsible and unhelpful. A thorough examination of
      passages about the ultimate end of unbelievers is the only way we can
      reach clarity and certainty on the matter.

      disqualifying conditions)." "Our own view is that all people will be

      'died to sin' and been 'crucified with him,' in order that 'we will also
      live' and 'never die again,' for 'death has no dominion' over him, nor
      over those who are 'alive to God in Christ Jesus' (Rom 6:2-11)."

        >Statement on Evangelical Conditionalism</a
      >: "Conditionalism is the view that life is the Creator’s provisional gift
      to all, which will ultimately be granted forever to the saved and revoked
      forever from the unsaved. Evangelical conditionalists believe that the
      saved in Christ will receive glory, honor and immortality, being raised
      with an incorruptible body to inherit eternal life (Romans 2:7). The
      unsaved will be raised in shame and dishonor, to face God and receive the
      just condemnation for their sins. When the penalty is carried out, they
      will be permanently excluded from eternal life by means of a final death,
      implicating the whole person in a destruction of human life and being
      (Matthew 10:28)."
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      I believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. Scripture, being the very word of
      God, is both authoritative and accurate in all that it teaches. It is the
      standard of truth over and against all human traditions, philosophies,
      creeds, councils, and authorities. I don't have a set position for or
      against Annihilationism, I'm still studying the issue, but I do see it as
      a plausible view worth considering seriously after reexamining some of the
      biblical texts which appeared to me to teach the traditional view until I
      examined them critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will present positive arguments for Annihilationism first and then
      challenge or defend them as I study and revise the article. I cite
      resources at the bottom of each section when relevant for further study
      and support. Not all the authors cited are Conditionalists, though the
      majority are.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      What would cause someone to question a belief that seems so certain? One
      only needs to consider the time before the Reformation when the majority
      of the visible church was certain that justification was by faith and
      works. It was going back to the Word of God with an open mind to be
      conformed to its message that revealed that doctrinal error. So, it is
      certainly possible for many to be mistaken about what the Bible teaches,
      but what in Scripture would cause someone to question eternal torment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well to start with, the very meaning of the gospel suggests that death,
      not eternal torment, is the price for sin. Everyone is under "the law of
      sin and death" (Rom 8:2), for "the wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23). "But
      God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners,
      Christ died for us" (Rom 5:8), so that we have "an atoning sacrifice
      through faith in his blood" (Rom 3:25). He, "who was delivered up for our
      trespasses and raised for our justification" (Rom 4:25), took the penalty
      for our sins, that is death, on the cross for our justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those whose sins are not covered by the cross will be held accountable on
      judgment day. They will have to suffer the consequences of sin with the
      most serious punishment, capital punishment. They will be cast into the
      lake of fire where they will undergo the second death (Rev 20:14). This
      permanent, final punishment, the second death, represents the ultimate
      consequence of sin. It entails eternal and complete destruction from God
      who will annihilate both soul and body in Gehenna (Mat 10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      This punishment is put in stark contrast to eternal life, which is
      consistently presented in the New Testament as the desirable alternative
      to death, destruction, and perishing. The Bible clearly states that the
      righteous will be resurrected and given immortality, but there is no
      suggestion in the Scriptures that the wicked will be granted immortality.
      They will not receive eternal life but perish (John 3:16). In contrast to
      this, the historic doctrine of eternal torment holds that unbelievers will
      also be granted eternal, embodied life just like believers, and the price
      for their sins is not death but torture.

      reason—not because it fitted into their comfort zone, though it did, but
      because they thought they found it in the Bible.'"

      firm commitment to the truthfulness and perennial relevance of the Bible,
      and not from a desire to have its message be more palatable to our own
      culture. We are not seeking to construct a more tolerable version of hell,
      as though primarily motivated by an emotional aversion to the idea of
      eternal torment. Neither do we assume, however, that the correct view of
      Hell must be whichever is perceived to be the harshest and most
      intolerable."

      to work with about the nature of hell, while "conditionalism’s
      <em>sedes doctrinae</em>—its seat of doctrine—can be likened to a stool
      with three legs, each representing a body of biblical texts collectively
      conveying one of these themes: life from death as the <em>telos</em> of
      the gospel; immortality as a gift granted only to the saved; and death and

      three arguments: (1) that the OT is, generally speaking, silent on the
      subject; (2) that the doctrine of conscious unending torment developed
      during the intertestamental years and came, by Jesus' time, to be "the
      commonly-accepted Jewish view" (it is said therefore that we ought to read
      Jesus and the NT writers with a presumption that they and their original
      hearers all held to the doctrine of unending conscious torment); (3) that
      the NT language on the subject requires us to conclude that God will make
      the wicked immortal for the purpose of torturing them alive forever
      without end."

      >, 2016: "The doctrine of conditional immortality is an example of
      Biblical consistency. On the one hand, from Genesis to Revelation the
      Bible never says that all people are immortal. It never says that the
      unrighteous will live forever. On the other hand, the Bible consistently
      offers eternal life to those who put their faith in Christ."

    <h2>Translation of Hell</h2>
    <p>
      The King James Version translated the words Sheol, Hades, Gehenna, and
      Tartarus as hell. This is inaccurate and confusing in modern English. The
      word hell has developed to refer to a place of eternal torment; however,
      it originally only meant a covered or hidden place (think of the word
      "helmet," a covering for your head). There are still many modern
      translations which translate these words inconsistently, but Gehenna is
      the only one that refers to the final fate of the wicked.

      the Bible says people go to 'hell,' we agree. We just think it is, as
      Jesus put it in Matthew 10:28, where God destroys 'both body and soul.' We
      don’t believe in hell as a place of eternal torment because that’s not

      is the equivalent of the Greek Haides, by which word it is translated in
      Septuagint... The believer's hope for the future, so far as this had
      place, was not prolonged existence in Sheol, but deliverance from it and
      restoration to new life in God's presence (Job 14:13-15; Job 19:25-27
      Psalm 16:10, 11; Psalm 17:15; Psalm 49:15; Psalm 73:24-26)."

      gates of Sheol will not prevail against Christ’s church because Jesus has
      already broken down its doors. All those united to Christ by faith and
      through the power of his Holy Spirit are no longer prisoners of death."

      Version translates it as grave 31 times, hell 31 times, and pit 3 times.
      Can you imagine the same word being translated as both grave and hell?...
      By its usage we see that Sheol was considered the place or state of all
      the dead -- whether they were good or bad. When used figuratively it could
      mean the consequences of wickedness in the present world, likened to

      significance in Job 40:13; 41:31 in the Septuagint. Homer, the Greek poet,
      spoke of 'dark Tartarus...the deepest pit' (Iliad, 8.13). Here [2 Peter
      2:4], it is used of the abode of evil angels prior to their banishment to
      Gehenna, their ultimate destiny (cf. Mt. 25:41)."
    </p>

    <h2>Gehenna</h2>
    <p>
      Gehenna, the shortened name for the valley of Hinnom, became notorious
      during the reigns of Kings Ahaz and Manasseh as the location where
      children were sacrificed by fire to the god Molech (2 Chronicles 28:3;
      33:6). The valley, we are told in Jeremiah 7:29-34 and 19:1-15, would be
      called a place of slaughter where it was prophesied to be filled with the
      corpses of those who had turned away from God. This valley thus became
      synonymous with extreme divine punishment, where the dead bodies of the
      slain were left unburied and exposed to decay and scavengers, painting a
      vivid picture of desolation and wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gehenna in the New Testament represents not just physical destruction, but
      the culmination of divine judgment where the opportunity for salvation is
      irrevocably withdrawn, and the wicked face complete destruction by God.
      Jesus uses Gehenna eschatologically to illustrate the final death of the
      wicked (Matthew 5:22, 29-30, 18:9). This imagery resonates with Isaiah
      66:24, a verse Jesus quotes when speaking of Gehenna, reinforcing the
      notion of Gehenna as a place of total annihilation. This is consistent
      with Paul who speaks of the ultimate fate of the wicked in terms of
      destruction (Philippians 1:28; 3:18-19; Romans 9:22-24; 2 Thessalonians
      1:8-9).
    </p>
    <p>
      A common myth is that the Valley of Hinnom was a garbage dump that was
      always burning with fire, and therefore provided good imagery for eternal
      torment. However, this is a baseless claim first made by Rabbi David Kimhi
      around A.D. 1200. Although the garbage dump theory is commonly stated in
      study Bibles and commentaries to support the doctrine of eternal torment,
      there is no archeological or literary evidence to back it up. The reality
      is that the Old Testament provides the background for Gehenna as a place
      of slaughter, death, and destruction, a stark contrast to the idea of
      people being tormented and never dying.

    <h2>Fallacies</h2>
    <p>
      Annihilationists deny eternal punishment: This is a strawman. See the
      commentary on Matthew 25:46. Both sides affirm eternal punishment. The
      disagreement is over the nature of that punishment. The punishment is not
      ceasing to exist. Conditionalists don't believe Jesus ceased to exist. The
      punishment is death–being deprived of life. For the damned, this is an
      everlasting punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annihilationists redefine the word eternal: This misunderstands the
      position. Annihilationism is the view that the punishment for sin is
      death, though it does affirm that there is suffering leading up to and
      accompanying that death. Both positions affirm that the consequences of
      sin are indeed eternal. It is not the view that sinners receive the
      punishment of torment for a long time to pay the price of their sins
      before God ends their lives, and it does not teach that God instantly
      annihlates sinners so that they face no pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This view must be wrong because Jehovah's Witnesses believe it: This isn't
      even the genetic fallacy. Annihilationism has strong support in the early
      church until the time of Augustine and is becoming more common among
      conservative, Bible-believing Christians now. This is the guilt by
      association fallacy. Just because this position is held by a heretical
      group, doesn't mean that it is wrong or that others hold the position for
      the same reasons. The arguments given here are exegetical and based on
      accepted hermeneutical principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists deny degrees of punishment: It is argued that
      Conditionalism must deny degrees of punishment since the wicked will all
      face the same fate of death in the end. This does not follow though. If
      you want to understand degrees of capital punishment, consider the
      differences between death by lethal injection, firing squad, burning at
      the stake, and crucifixion. In contrast, the traditional view is that one
      sin and a lifetime of sin both merit everlasting torment. Both views give
      an account for degrees of punishment, even though the latter view appears
      to give a much worse account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists argue that their view is more consistent with God's
      character of love and justice: This is a red herring. The focus should
      remain exegetical first and foremost. There is certainly room to discuss
      the justness of each view, but one's intuition about justice should not be
      treated as the primary argument or motivation for their view. Moreover,
      death, not eternal torment, is consistently said to be the price of sin,
      so it is not hard to understand the belief that capital punishment aligns
      with God's justice. Traditionalists also have explanations for why God
      would be just to inflict eternal torment. Ultimately, we must rely on the
      Bible more than intuition or emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists just want to believe in annihilation because the idea of
      people spending eternity in hell is awful, or they are just theological
      liberals: This is just poisoning the well when people begin with these
      kinds of accusations. The goal is not to psychoanalyze the other side but
      to examine arguments about the biblical view of hell. It may in fact be
      the traditionalists that are not taking the biblical language serious
      enough through constant allegorizing of life and death, perishing,
      destruction, fire, Gehenna, annihilation, and other corresponding
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biblical references to fire and destruction are understood as metaphors
      for annihilation: Trying to claim that this view interprets these
      descriptions non-literally or metaphorically is not only false, it is used
      rhetorically to discount consideration of the view. Destruction and
      annihilation are synonyms, and things that are set on fire are consumed
      and destroyed. Rather, construing these descriptions to mean eternal
      conscious torment, whether or not that is justified, is clearly the
      metaphorical interpretation of these passages.

      instead of speaking in terms of everlasting suffering, the Bible
      predominantly describes the fate of the lost in terms of destruction...
      John Stott has commented that 'it would seem strange, therefore, if people
      who are said to suffer destruction are in fact not destroyed.' He concurs

    <h2>Correcting Assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      The soul is not inherently immortal: Everything that is not God was
      created by God and depends on Him at every moment for its sustained
      existence. The Bible never states that the soul will necessarily live on
      forever. God "is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna." (Mat.
      10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone might not spend eternity somewhere: The idea that everyone will
      experience eternal life, either in heaven or hell, is an assumption that
      must be examined biblically. 1 Corinthians 15 is almost the only text used
      to argue that all people will be raised with immortality and
      incorruptibility; however, in context, this chapter is only about those in
      Christ being raised and says nothing of unbelievers. Verses like John 3:16
      indicate the opposite, that unbelievers are destined to perish.

        >The Neglected Doctrines of Resurrection and Bodily Transformation</a

      results from sin... It explains why Christ’s resurrection is so unique and
      profound, and how if we are to receive eternal life and immortality, it is
      necessary for us to participate in 'a resurrection like his' (Rom 6:5). To
      a dying world, the fact that Jesus died and conquered death for us is very
      good news indeed."

      immortal life is naturally appealing to them... Consequently, evangelism

      to the evangelistic work of traditionalists in the western world, might it
      not be, therefore, that an annihilationist understanding would be
      considerably less scandalous, and therefore that Christian

    <h2>Genesis 2:17</h2>
    <p>
      "but you shall not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for
      in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die."
    </p>
    <p>
      God warned Adam that he would surely die if he ate from the tree of the
      knowledge of good and evil. Natural, literal death is clearly intended
      here. Hence, in Genesis 3:19, God says, "you are dust, and you shall
      return to dust." Therefore, God kicked Adam out of the garden, "lest he
      reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live
      forever" (Gen 3:22). Paul explains that "as sin entered into the world
      through one man, and death through sin, so death passed to all men because
      all sinned." (Rom 5:12). Without the tree of life, all are destined to
      perish and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Revelation, it is revealed that believers will get to partake of the
      tree of life and live forevermore: "On this side of the river and on that
      was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit
      every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
      (Rev 22:2). Paul explains that believers will be made unable to die: "The
      first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from
      heaven... Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can’t inherit
      God’s Kingdom; neither does the perishable inherit imperishable... For
      this perishable body must become imperishable, and this mortal must put on
      immortality." (1 Cor 15:47, 50, 53).
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that some will not inherit the imperishable or receive
      immortality. They will be subject to everlasting death and won't obtain to
      the final age: "But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age
      and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in
      marriage. For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels and
      are children of God, being children of the resurrection." (Lk 20:35-36).

      Victor P. Hamilton, The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17, NICOT (Grand
      Rapids: Eerdmans, 1990), pg. 172: "Here in 2:17 we have translated it as
      <em>as surely as</em> on the basis of its occasional use as an idiom
      meaning 'for certain,' as in 1 K. 2:37, 42, where Shimei is threatened
      with death 'on the day you go forth and cross the brook Kidron.' As the
      next few verses indicate, Shimei could not possibly have been executed 'on
      the day' he exited his house. The verse is underscoring the certainty of

    <p>
      The phrase gnashing of teeth indicates anger, annoyance, and being upset
      at the inability to stop something. Here it is used in conjunction with
      the wicked melting away and perishing. It does not suggest a perpetual
      process of suffering. Neither is gnashing of teeth ever said to last

    </p>
    <p>
      This verse does not teach the immortality of the soul. The Hebrew word
      "olam" is commonly translated as "darkness," "eternity," or "the future."
      This verse is about the insatiable longing for and awareness of something
      beyond this world that God has instilled in human hearts. Humans possess
      an inherent sense of something beyond the temporal world. Yet we are
      unable to fully understand God's workings or be ultimately satisfied in
      this world. This verse describes that existential reality.

    <h1 align="left">The Prophets</h1>
    <h2>Isaiah 26:14, 19 (ESV)</h2>
    <p>
      "They are dead, they will not live; they are shades, they will not arise;
      to that end you have visited them with destruction and wiped out all
      remembrance of them... Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You
      who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of
      light, and the earth will give birth to the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah isn't denying a general future resurrection of all. He's denying
      that the wicked will get to participate in the resurrection life to come.
      They will come out "to the resurrection of judgment" while those saved by
      Jesus will come out "to the resurrection of life" (Jn 5:29). The wicked
      will face eternal destruction in the fires of Gehenna.
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 33:11-12, 14</h2>
    <p>
      "You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to stubble. Your breath is a
      fire that will devour you. The peoples will be like the burning of lime,
      like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire... The sinners in
      Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who among us can
      live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting
      burning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah provides the background for many of the New Testament’s teachings
      about hell. Chaff being burned represents complete devouring and
      destruction (Mat 3:12). Trees (Mat 7:19), weeds (Mat 13:40), and thorns
      and thistles (Heb 6:8) likewise are cut down and burned up. The obvious
      answer to Isaiah's rhetorical question, who among us can live, is that
      they will not be able to continue living in the midst of everlasting,
      devouring fire (Mat 18:8). The fire does not turn them into a juggernaut
      that can take on endless fire. While it may be possible to withstand fire
      for 5 or 10 minutes, this imagery conveys an utterly destructive power
      that will obliterate the wicked.
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 66:15-16</h2>
    <p>
      "For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like
      the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with
      flames of fire. For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword
      on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus is the one who will execute judgment by a "flaming fire" (2 Thes
      1:7). The sword of judgment will fall on the on the lawless one, "whom the
      Lord will kill with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the
      manifestation of his coming" (2 Thes 2:8). Thus, many will be slain and
      face the penalty of "eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and
      from the glory of his might" (2 Thes 1:8).
    </p>

    <h2>Isaiah 66:22-24</h2>
    <p>
      "'For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
      remain before me,' says Yahweh, 'so your offspring and your name shall
      remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one
      Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,' says
      Yahweh. 'They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have
      transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire
      be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus uses this imagery of the worm not dying and the fire not being
      quenched in conjunction with Gehenna, a valley of dead bodies that serves
      as a picture of the final end for unbelievers. Notice that the context in
      both is about dead bodies in the new heavens and new earth. The worms will
      devour. The fire will completely consume. The unrighteous will forever be
      remembered with contempt. Though "unquenchable fire" strikes modern
      readers to mean eternal torment, the Old Testament background demonstrates
      that it refers to a consuming fire that cannot be extinguished.
    </p>

    <h2>Jeremiah 7:32-33 // 19:6-13</h2>
    <p>
      "'Therefore behold, the days come', says Yahweh, 'that it will no more be
      called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of
      Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
      The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and
      for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away.'"

      This is the background for Jesus' teaching about Gehenna (what is commonly
      translated hell, the final end for the unsaved). Gehenna will be called
      "The Valley of Slaughter." God will slay His enemies there. The worms,
      birds, and other scavengers will devour the dead bodies while fire burns
      and consumes them. This picture intensely portrays death, destruction, and
      annihilation, the exact opposite of eternal torment.

    <h2>Jeremiah 31:38-40</h2>
    <p>
      "'Behold, the days come,' says Yahweh, 'that the city will be built to
      Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner. The measuring
      line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn
      toward Goah. The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all
      the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the
      east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be plucked up or thrown down any
      more forever.'"

    <h2>Nahum 1:8-10</h2>
    <p>
      "But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and
      will pursue his enemies into darkness. What do you plot against Yahweh? He
      will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time. For
      entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed
      utterly like dry stubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to the traditional belief that God will keep His enemies alive
      forever to keep sinning, God will instead make a full end to evil. He will
      pursue His enemies into the depths of Sheol. They will all be completely
      consumed like straw. God will have complete victory over sin and death and
      evil.

      them up,' says Yahweh of Armies, 'so that it will leave them neither root
      nor branch. But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness
      arise with healing in its wings. You will go out and leap like calves of
      the stall. You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under

        "For it is a righteous thing with God to repay affliction to those who
        afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us when
        the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming
        fire, punishing those who don’t know God, and to those who don’t obey
        the Good News of our Lord Jesus, who will pay the penalty: eternal
        destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
        when he comes in that day to be glorified in his saints and to be
        admired among all those who have believed, because our testimony to you
        was believed." (2 Thes 1:6-10).

    </section>
    <p>
      God's destruction of the wicked will be complete. There will be no part
      left untouched by the burning furnace and no part left unconsumed. They
      will be like "natural animals to be taken and destroyed" and "will in
      their destroying surely be destroyed" (2 Pet 2:12). Only the righteous
      will arise to healing and life. All those who work wickedness will rise to
      judgment and be burned up with unquenchable fire so that only ashes
      remain.

      always refers to the literal killing of a person... Some claims in
      biblical interpretation are matters of opinion and open to question, but
      this is not one of them... However theologically inconvenient it may be
      for defenders of the traditional doctrine of the eternal torments of hell,

      Notice that it is a day of judgment that is said to be worse. It does not
      say that they will experience an everlasting time of greater misery.
      Whatever way degrees of punishment are worked out for each person, God's
      justice demands that the ultimate end of the unsaved is death. Other than
      the duration, type, and amount suffering, part of the justice may be the
      way they are remembered. The wicked in general will be remembered with
      "everlasting contempt" (Dan 12:2) and "disgust" (Isa 66:24), but mass
      murders will be remembered with greater disdain than liars.

        >Matthew 10:28 is About God, Not the Devil</a
      >, 2022: "The context of Matthew 10:28 is one of the most key factors in
      interpreting it. This is not just generically speaking of destroying.
      Whereas John 10:10 just broadly says the enemy seeks to 'destroy,' Jesus’s
      words in Matthew get much more specific. Jesus is speaking of hell (Greek
      <em>gehenna</em>), the place of final punishment."

    <h2>Matthew 18:8 // 25:41 // Jude 7</h2>
    <p>
      "If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it
      from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled,
      rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal
      fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next verse says, "If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out
      and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one
      eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire" (Mat
      18:9). The parallel of "eternal fire" with "Gehenna of fire" indicates
      that they are referring to the same fate. The Gehenna of fire is where
      God's enemies go to die. Gehenna is The Valley of Slaughter. It's a
      picture of God's enemies being slain, and the dead bodies are utterly
      consumed by scavengers and fire. Jeremiah 19:6-11 says:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no
        more be called ‘Topheth’, nor ‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’, but
        ‘The valley of Slaughter’... I will cause them to fall by the sword
        before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I
        will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for
        the animals of the earth... Even so I will break this people and this
        city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again.
        They will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.”

      Jude tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah "are shown as an example, suffering
      the punishment of eternal fire" (Jude 1:7). The complete destruction of
      Sodom and Gomorrah functions typologically to show the outcome of the
      unrighteous. The eternal fire represents complete destruction:

        "Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh
        out of the sky. He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground" (Gen
        19:24-25).
      </p>

        "and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them
        to destruction, having made them an example to those who would live in
        an ungodly way" (2 Pet 2:6).

        "You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to stubble. Your breath is

        lime, like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire... The
        sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who
        among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with
        everlasting burning?" (Isa 33:11-12, 14).

        >5 More Myths About Hell: A Response to Mark Jones and Crossway</a
      >, 2020: "Throughout his gospel, he has warned that the wicked will be
      punished with death and destruction by the fires of Gehenna (e.g., 3:12;
      7:13-14; 10:28; 13:24-30, 36-43; 18:8-9). Consistent with this message,
      Jesus here says only the righteous will be granted eternal life...
      language, then, of eternal punishment and eternal fire, is language
      warning the unrighteous of eschatological and everlasting death."

      meaning penal infliction cf. 1 Jn 4:18) can be translated as correction,
      punishment, or penalty, and it does not denote a specific type of
      punishment. Nouns of action that are qualified as eternal can either
      indicate that the action continues forever or that the result of the
      action continues forever. The duration of the punishment is everlasting
      and the duration of the life is everlasting. There is a parallel in that
      they both last forever, but there is a contrast in that one is life and
      the other excludes life.

        “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall

        remain. It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one
        Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says
        Yahweh. “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who
        have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will
        their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind” (Isa

      Matthew, Isaiah, and Daniel indicate that life everlasting is reserved for
      the righteous only. Daniel tells us that the unrighteous will feel shame
      when they rise, but he doesn't say they will feel shame forever. Daniel
      and Isaiah both indicate that the unrighteous will be held in contempt
      forever by the righteous, and this does not require the unrighteous to be
      alive. The only punishment with an eternal duration that is consistent
      with these facts is death. Isaiah says that in the new heavens and new
      earth the unrighteous will be dead bodies that are fully eaten by worms
      and utterly consumed by fire. This confirms that death, the privation of
      life, is the punishment for the unrighteous.

        target="_blank"
        >City of God</a
      >, translated by Marcus Dods: "Cicero tells us that the laws recognize
      eight kinds of penalty,—damages, imprisonment, scourging, reparation,
      disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one of these which may be
      compressed into a brevity proportioned to the rapid commission of the
      offence, so that no longer time may be spent in its punishment than in its
      perpetration, unless, perhaps, reparation?... What shall we say of
      imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only for so long a time as he
      spent on the offence for which he is committed?... And as to damages,
      disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly inflicted so as to admit of
      no relaxation or pardon, do not these resemble eternal punishments in so
      far as this short life allows a resemblance? For they are not eternal only
      because the life in which they are endured is not eternal; and yet the
      crimes which are punished with these most protracted sufferings are
      perpetrated in a very brief space of time..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then as to the award of death for any great crime, do the laws reckon the
      punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death is inflicted, or
      in this, that the offender is eternally banished from the society of the
      living? And just as the punishment of the first death cuts men off from
      this present mortal city, so does the punishment of the second death cut
      men off from that future immortal city. For as the laws of this present
      city do not provide for the executed criminal’s return to it, so neither
      is he who is condemned to the second death recalled again to life
      everlasting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if temporal sin is visited with eternal punishment, how, then, they
      say, is that true which your Christ says, 'With the same measure that ye
      mete withal it shall be measured to you again?' and they do not observe
      that 'the same measure' refers, not to an equal space of time, but to the
      retribution of evil or, in other words, to the law by which he who has
      done evil suffers evil. Besides, these words could be appropriately
      understood as referring to the matter of which our Lord was speaking when
      He used them, viz., judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who unjustly
      judges and condemns is himself justly judged and condemned, he receives
      'with the same measure' though not the same thing as he gave. For judgment
      he gave, and judgment he receives, though the judgment he gave was unjust,
      the judgment he receives just."

        >The Case for Conditional Immortality from Matthew</a

      not mean he goes on saving forever, but that the salvation he offers is
      eternal... The same is true for 'eternal redemption,' Christ does not go
      on forever redeeming, but the result of his once for all act of redemption
      is eternal (Heb 9:12). When it comes to 'eternal punishment' (Matt 25:46)
      and 'eternal destruction' (2 Thess 1:9), where 'eternal' modifies an
      action, it seems plausible to suggest that the punishing and destruction
      do not go on forever, but that there is an act of punishment/destruction
      which leads to an eternal result."

    <h2>Mark 9:47-48 // Matthew 5:22 // Isaiah 66:24</h2>

      "...cast into the Gehenna of fire, 'where their worm doesn’t die, and the
      fire is not quenched.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gehenna, shorthand for "The valley of Hinnom," is a place filled with
      unburied corpses that are eaten by scavengers and burned by fire:
    </p>
    <section>
      “Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no more be
      called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of
      Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
      The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and
      for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away. Then I will
      cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem
      the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom
      and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.” (Jeremiah
      7:32-42).
    </section>

    <p>
      Jesus quotes Isaiah 66:24 where it clearly states that corpses are being
      consumed by fire and maggots, not living beings. The imagery of the worm
      and fire in Isaiah is not about eternal conscious torment but emphasizes
      the shame and complete destruction of the wicked:
    </p>
    <section>
      “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
      before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name shall remain. It
      shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to
      another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says Yahweh. “They
      will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed
      against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched,
      and they will be loathsome to all mankind.” (Isaiah 66:22-24).
    </section>
    <p>
      The original Hebrew phrase "does not die" doesn't mean "will never die" in
      other biblical contexts (e.g., Genesis 42:20, Exodus 30:20, Jeremiah
      38:24). It often means "will not die at a particular time or in a
      particular context." In Isaiah 66:24, it means that the worms will not die
      before completely devouring the corpses. That is especially true when it
      is connected to Gehenna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, a fire that "is not quenched" does not imply a fire that burns
      forever. "Quench" primarily means "extinguish." The fire in Isaiah cannot
      be extinguished until it fully consumes its fuel. This imagery emphasizes
      the complete and irreversible nature of the consumption.

      9:48, they explain the context of Isa. 66:24: "By way of invitation, they
      lay out two eternal destinies: participation in the expansive vision of
      all flesh coming to worship Yahweh (66:23; cf. 2:1-5) over against, not
      unlike Mal. 4:4-6, a final, chilling picture of the corpses of the rebels,
      'whose worm will not die, and whose fire will not be quenched.'"

      alive in a place of fire and biting worms (or their symbolic equivalent)
      forever. 2. The terms used about worms not dying and fire not being
      quenched don’t even mean eternal duration in the first place. That part is
      read into the passage by people who already believe that hell is a place
      of eternal torment."

      if that’s true, then clearly 'perish' can’t involve everlasting life as
      well—they are presented as two alternatives! Jesus says a similar thing in

      means that Jesus' words cause or produce life. "I know that his

      commandment results in eternal life. Likewise, John 17:3 presents a cause
      rather than an algebra equation: Knowing God and Jesus causes eternal
      life. In other words, this is what causes eternal life: that they know

      >, 2020: "At face value, the phrase 'eternal life' would mean life that
      lasts for eternity... It makes perfect sense to interpret what Jesus says
      in John 17:3 as a figure of speech to mean that knowing God is what causes
      eternal life... so much of this seems to be little more than a false
      narrative, built upon tradition, that tells us that life and death
      language just obviously is metaphorical and it would be downright
      outrageous to suggest that a straightforward, face value reading of such
      language actually could tell us what hell entails."

    <p>
      Believers and non-believers will be resurrected on the day of the Lord,
      but there will be a resurrection of the saved and a resurrection of the
      unsaved. This dual nature of the resurrection reflects the dual nature of
      the outcomes. Evil-doers will face "the resurrection of judgment" while
      the righteous will come out "to the resurrection of life" (Jn 5:29). The
      unrighteous will awake to "shame" while the righteous will rise to
      "everlasting life" (Dan 12:2). The consistent contrast of judgment with
      life reflects the fact that it will not include life. "Only one is the
      lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy" (Jam 4:12).

      The first death refers to physical death. Man can physically kill you, but

      Verses 7-8 provide important context: "when the Lord Jesus is revealed
      from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, punishing those who
      don’t know God." This is a clear reference to Isaiah 66:15: "For, behold,
      Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots will be like the whirlwind;
      to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire."
      It goes on to say, "For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his
      sword on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many." (Isa 66:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Eternal indicates that this desctruction will never be reversed. The
      unrighteous will be eternally destroyed. Whether this destruction arises
      directly from an act of the Lord, or whether it stems from a definitive
      and complete disconnection from God, the fountain of life, the outcome is
      the same. The result is that "Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by
      his sword on all flesh; and those slain by Yahweh will be many... They
      will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed
      against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched,

      The flood which destroyed the whole world and killed everyone in it except

      upon their consciences, under which they are continually held; or the
      decrees and purposes of God concerning their final punishment and
      destruction, which are immutable and irreversible, and from which there is
      no freeing themselves."

      fire functions as an example because it is a type or anticipation of what
      is to come for all those who reject God. The destruction of Sodom and
      Gomorrah is not merely a historical curiosity; it functions typologically
      as a prophecy of what is in store for the rebellious. The narrative
      stresses the devastation of the Lord raining fire and brimstone upon the
      cities (Gen 19:24–28)."

    <h2>Jude 1:13 // 2 Peter 2:17</h2>
    <p>
      "[These are] wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been
      reserved forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      The unrighteous are held in chains of darkness until the judgment (Jude
      6). Judgment is described as the "eternal fire" which Sodom and Gomorrah
      underwent (Jude 7), and the "fire" is the final fate which the lost must
      be saved from (Jude 23).
    </p>
    <p>
      The blackness of darkness is then the eternal fate of the wicked. Their
      eternal destruction deprives them of "life and breath and all things"
      (Acts 17:25). This language of darkness doesn't have to refer to conscious
      existence. Jude and Peter make it clear that destruction is the end for
      the unrighteous. Job uses similar langauge of darkness when he wished he
      never existed:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        “Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is
        a boy conceived.’ Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above
        seek for it, neither let the light shine on it. Let darkness and the
        shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all
        that makes the day black terrify it. As for that night, let thick
        darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let
        it not come into the number of the months. Behold, let that night be
        barren. Let no joyful voice come therein. Let them curse it who curse
        the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan. Let the stars of its
        twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it
        see the eyelids of the morning, because it didn’t shut up the doors of
        my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.”

      Many modern traditionalists argue that the fires of hell must be
      figurative because hell is described in contradictory ways as a place of
      darkness and a place of fire; however, looking at these passages in more
      detail reveals that these descriptions are not two different descriptions
      of hell. The unrighteous will be held until the great judgment, at which
      time they will be thrown into Gehenna, the lake of fire, where they will
      utterly perish. The contradictory imagery is a clear sign that these are
      not referring to the same reality.

      forever' for these false teachers, that this suggests Hell is to be
      understood as an eternity spent separated from God in some metaphorical
      darkness (because fire produces light and so the fires and darkness of
      Hell cannot be taken literally). But this text follows shortly after verse
      7 in which Jude says Sodom and Gomorrah suffered the punishment of eternal
      fire as an example of what awaits these false teachers. It comes after
      verse 10, too, which indicates along with its parallel in 2 Peter 2:12
      that false teachers will be destroyed like animals are destroyed."

      or apocalyptic, ascribing literalism to its numbers, proper nouns, and
      other images may prevent adjudicating John’s intended meaning— the literal
      sense. A more profitable hermeneutical approach is to reverse the
      interpretive order by placing the symbolic in the foreground while
      shifting the literal into the background."

      In reporting his visionary experiences, John frequently uses symbolic
      language. Sometimes he explains the meaning of the symbols... [I]n
      attempting to understand John’s symbolism, we must consider not only the
      book itself but also his use of the Old Testament... In any case, it is
      important to recognize that the descriptions

      will see, applying the literal-where-possible maxim to prophetic
      literature is problematic, its inadequacy does not mean that Revelation is
      a wax nose, to be manipulated into any shape we choose... The literal
      meaning of symbolic language is the symbolic correspondence between the
      imagery of the language and the referent that it describes... We dare not
      tackle the symbolism of Revelation without immersing our minds in the rich
      imagery of the Old Testament... Revelation makes sense only in light of
      the Old Testament. Not only the visions of such prophets as Ezekiel,
      Daniel, and Zechariah but also historical events such as creation, the
      fall, and the exodus provide the symbolic vocabulary for John’s visions."

      that a symbolic vision and its interpretation is going to be part of the
      warp and woof of the means of communication throughout Revelation. This
      conclusion is based on the supposition that John uses OT references with
      significant degrees of awareness of OT context, for which I will argue
      later... [A] number of authors of both popular and scholarly commentaries
      contend that one should interpret literally except where one is forced to
      interpret symbolically by clear indications of context... But the results
      of the analysis above of 1:1 indicate that... the essence of the book is

      understanding of these Old Testament texts is crucial to the
      interpretation of the Apocalypse at every point along the way and is
      necessary for understanding his literary strategy. Consequently, the Old
      Testament 'forms a body of literature which John expects his readers to
      know and explicitly to recall in detail while reading his own work'.
      Furthermore, a study of Jewish exegetical tradition of various Old
      Testament texts can also shed light on John's own understanding of the

      ['the verb cognate of the noun “sign” in john’s Gospel']... in 1:1 because
      of its parallels with Dan. 2:28-30, 45, where God 'signifies' truths
      through pictorial or symbolic visions. Thus it means to 'communicate by
      symbols' and connotes the need to interpret the reality behind the
      symbol... Symbols are metaphorical utterances that are meant to be
      understood first pictorially and then referentially... The sources for
      interpreting them come from the OT, intertestamental literature, and the
      Greco-Roman world—in other words, in the common world of the original
      readers in the province of Asia."

      Richard Bauckham, Climax of Prophecy, (Edinburgh: T&T, 1993), xi: "It is a
      book designed to be read in constant intertextual relationship with the
      Old Testament. John was writing what he understood to be a work of
      prophetic scripture, the climax of prophetic revelation, which gathered up
      the prophetic meaning of the Old Testament scriptures and disclosed the
      way in which it was being and was to be fulfilled in the last days. His
      work therefore, presupposes and conveys an extensive interpretation of
      large parts of Old Testament prophecy. Allusions are meant to recall the
      Old Testament context, which thereby becomes part of the meaning the
      Apocalypse conveys, and to build up, sometimes by a network of allusion to
      the same Old Testament passage in various parts of the Apocalypse, an
      interpretation of whole passages of Old Testament prophecy."

      Vern S. Poythress, The Returning King (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing,

      'Interpret everything literally, if possible.' That recipe misunderstands
      what kind of book Revelation is. Of course, John literally saw what he
      says he saw. But what he saw was a vision. It was filled with symbols,
      like the Beast of 13:1–8 and the seven blazing lamps in 4:5. It never
      intended to be a direct, nonsymbolical description of the future. People
      living in John’s own time understood this matter instinctively, because
      they recognized that John was writing in an 'apocalyptic' manner, a manner
      already as familiar to them as a political cartoon is to us today."

        >Judgment in the Book Of Revelation</a
      >, 2: "The correspondence of crime and punishment here depends on a
      wordplay, exploiting the double meaning of <em>diaphtheirō</em>, which can
      mean both “destroy,” in the sense of causing to perish, and “ruin,” in the
      sense of corrupting with evil. The destroyers of the earth are the powers
      of evil who are ruining God’s creation with their violence, oppression,
      and idolatrous religion (cf. 19:2). There is an allusion to the equivalent
      wordplay in the Genesis story of the flood (Gen 6:11–13, 17, where s-h-t
      has the same double meaning). In both cases God’s wholesale destruction of
      those who are ruining his creation is justified as necessary for the
      preservation of his creation and its salvation from the evil they are
      doing to it."
    </p>

    <h2>Revelation 14:9-11</h2>
    <p>
      "Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, 'If
      anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
      forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of
      God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be
      tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in
      the presence of the Lamb. The smoke of their torment goes up forever and
      ever. They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his
      image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Old Testament, the cup of God's wrath is a potent symbol of divine
      judgment, sometimes temporary and recoverable, while at other times
      irreversible and destructive (Isa 51:22-52:2; Obad 16; Jer 25:27). Jesus,
      representing humanity, took upon himself the wrathful cup, enduring death
      (Matt 26:39, 42, 44). His death and resurrection mean that his followers
      no longer face this wrath, instead receiving a cup of blessing (Matt
      26:27-29). Revelation portrays the cup as a judgment against "Babylon,"
      the epitome of evil, leading to its inevitable destruction (Rev 16:19;
      18:6, 7-9). It affects all those allied with the beast (Rev 17–19), and
      symbolizes a final, fatal judgment, leading to utter destruction
      characterized by torture, grief, famine, and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image of fire and brimstone is found in references to Sodom and
      Gomorrah (Genesis 19:23, 28; Deuteronomy 29:23; Job 18:15-17; Isaiah
      30:27-33; 34:9-11; Ezekiel 38:22). It paints a picture of decisive
      annihilation and complete destruction, leaving nothing but ashes in its
      wake. This picture appears to be in stark contrast to excruciating,
      unending suffering.
    </p>
    <section>
      "He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the
      plain, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a
      furnace" (Genesis 19:28).
    </section>
    <p>
      Smoke rising forever symbolizes the permanent destruction of the wicked.
      This is the same fate of Edom in Isaiah 34:8-10. The city was destroyed by
      fire, and the smoke rising forever represents the everlasting nature of
      its destruction. The smoke, therefore, stands as a permanent reminder of
      God's final victory over evil.
    </p>
    <section>
      "It won’t be quenched night or day. Its smoke will go up forever. From
      generation to generation, it will lie waste. No one will pass through it
      forever and ever" (Isaiah 34:10).
    </section>
    <p>
      John vividly depicts the plight of those who worship the beast,
      emphasizing that they find no respite "day or night." John consistently
      uses "day and night" in Revelation to describe continuous actions,
      unrelated to time of day, such as the living creatures' praise, the
      martyrs' service, Satan's accusations, and the torment of the unholy
      trinity. Similarly, Isaiah 34:10 uses "night and day" to describe Edom's
      unquenched fire, symbolizing complete destruction. While the fire burns
      continuously without ceasing, it will eventually consume completely.

      ceaseless activity... The lack of rest will continue uninterrupted as long
      as the period of suffering lasts, though there will be an end to the
      period. Therefore, the imagery of Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great
      judgment that will be remembered forever, not one that leads to eternal
      suffering."

      pictured repeatedly in the language of final, decisive destruction, not
      ongoing torment... If the picture in Revelation 18 and 19 is of a

      destroyed... To the gruesome images of Ezekiel, John adds 'devour her
      flesh,' a reference to the total annihilation of the harlot-city... All
      three elements—betrayal, plagues, parousia—are part of the same sovereign
      plan of God by which he will bring world history with all its depravity to
      an end... The irony is that there it is Babylon that does the destroying,

      God saw fit to require. That was true of the temporal judgment against

      the finality of Babylon’s judgment: 'her smoke ascends forever.' The
      wording comes from Isa. 34:9-10, where the portrayal of smoke continually
      ascending serves as a permanent memorial to God’s punishment of Edom for
      its sin. Rev. 14:11 also alludes to Isa. 34:9-10 to describe the
      never-ending effect of God’s judgment of the beast’s followers. Here
      Edom’s fall is taken as an anticipatory typological pattern for the fall
      of the world system, which will never rise again after God’s judgment."

    <p>
      John interprets the "lake of fire" as the "the second death" (Rev 20:14;
      21:8). John is not using symbolism to interpret his symbolism. The vision
      he sees represents death, not torment. This vision is a climatic
      recapitulation of judgment portrayed throughout Revelation (16:14, 16;
      17:14; 19:11-21). Christ's enemies are destroyed. Death and the grave are
      no more. The first things have passed away, and righteousness will be
      forever more.

      destruction. (b) This same verbiage and imagery are borrowed from two
      major OT sources (Ezekiel and Isaiah), showing that this imagery is used
      to denote utter destruction, not an ongoing process. (c) The inanimate
      entities thrown into the lake of fire are later taken to be destroyed, and

      (Satan, the angels, the false prophet, and unbelievers) thrown in."

      city Babylon is pictured as a woman whose judgment in chapter 18 is
      'torment and grief,' which turns out to be 'death, mourning, and famine,'
      and she is 'consumed by fire.' It is not unthinkable, therefore, to
      understand torment of the devil, beast, and false prophet as death and
      consumption by fire which are never reversed."

      "Strictly speaking, even the expression 'they will be tormented forever
      and ever' is figurative... at the least, the phrase figuratively connotes
      a very long time. The context here and in the whole Apocalypse must
      determine whether this is a limited time or an unending period... All
      unbelievers suffering the first death are held in the sphere of 'death and
      Hades,' which is a temporary, preconsummate holding tank to be finally
      replaced by the permanent, consummate 'lake of fire,' which is 'the second
      death' (see on 20:14)."

      judgments, each of which leads up to the Second Coming... The final battle
      in 20:7–10 seems to be the same as the final battle in 16:14, 16; 17:14;
      19:11–21... Most importantly, all of Christ’s enemies are destroyed in
      19:11–21. If 20:1–6 describes events later than 19:11–21, there would be
      no one left for Satan to deceive in 20:3."

      to talk about a permanent dying in the world to come. Almost all pre-NT
      Jewish texts reflect a conditionalist belief in keeping with the Old
      Testament. After that time, some Jewish texts seem to reflect a belief in
      eternal concious torment, but they are the minority. 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch
      are examples, and these are later works. Nearly all of the Qumran
      literature clearly reflects belief in the eschatological annihilation of

      line of reasoning suffers from still another problem. Those over whom John
      says the second death will have no power are those who come to life and
      reign with Christ (20:4-6). Those who are not thrown into the lake of
      fire—the second death—are first raised out of death and Hades (20:13-15).
      The first death, then, is something experienced by both believers and
      unbelievers alike; both are raised from it, and only the unsaved
      experience the second."

        >What is the Second Death? Part 1, Symbols and Meanings</a
      >, 2017: "The traditional view reads this verse backwards as if John saw a
      vision of people dying a second time and was then told that 'the second
      death is the lake of fire'. Traditionalists then take this strange
      definition of death and apply it to other verses like Romans 6:23... They
      say that 'death' does not mean what we normally think of as 'death'.
      Indeed, the traditional view is that the unsaved NEVER actually die.
      Instead they live forever in the lake of fire. Hopefully by now you can
      see that this is backwards."

      Targums, identifies a consistent usage of the term "second death" in texts
      of the Second Temple period and early rabbinical writings. In most cases,
      the "second death" is identical with the judgment, following the
      resurrection, in Gehinnom at the Last Day [indicating that the wicked will

      one who did not deserve it from you; to want to tear Him limb from limb if
      you could, who not only brought evil to no man, but spoke with equal
      kindness to enemies concerning the salvation that was being brought to
      them from God the Ruler; concerning what had to be done so that they might
      escape death and receive an immortality unknown to them? And when the
      strangeness of these things and the unheard promises troubled the minds of
      those who heard them and caused them to hesitate to believe, the Lord of
      every power and the Destroyer of death itself, allowed His human form to
      be killed, so that from the results they might know that the hopes which

      "For they are cast in, and being annihilated, pass away vainly in

      learned from Christ's teaching; and they are such that they may on the one
      hand perish if they have not known God, and on the other be delivered from
      death if they have given heed to His threats and proffered favours. And to
      make manifest what is unknown, this is man's real death, this which leaves
      nothing behind. For that which is seen by the eyes is only a separation of
      soul from body, not the last end — annihilation: this, I say, is man's
      real death, when souls which know not God shall be consumed in
      long-protracted torment with raging fire, into which certain fiercely
      cruel beings shall cast them, who were unknown before Christ, and brought

      >: "For if, out of a former normal state of non-existence, they were
      called into being by the Presence and loving-kindness of the Word, it
      followed naturally that when men were bereft of the knowledge of God and
      were turned back to what was not (for what is evil is not, but what is
      good is), they should, since they derive their being from God who IS, be
      everlastingly bereft even of being; in other words, that they should be
      disintegrated and abide in death and corruption. For man is by nature
      mortal, inasmuch as he is made out of what is not; but by reason of his
      likeness to Him that is (and if he still preserved this likeness by
      keeping Him in his knowledge) he would stay his natural corruption, and
      remain incorrupt" (4.5).
    </p>
    <p>
      "For it were monstrous, firstly, that God, having spoken, should prove
      false — that, when once He had ordained that man, if he transgressed the
      commandment, should die the death, after the transgression man should not
      die, but God's word should be broken. For God would not be true, if, when
      He had said we should die, man died not. Again, it were unseemly that
      creatures once made rational, and having partaken of the Word, should go
      to ruin, and turn again toward non-existence by the way of corruption...
      It was, then, out of the question to leave men to the current of
      corruption; because this would be unseemly, and unworthy of God's
      goodness." (6.3-4, 10).

      before, not being joined to God; for a creature had not joined creatures
      to God, as seeking itself one to join it ; nor would a portion of the
      creation have been the creation's salvation, as needing salvation itself.
      To provide against this also, He sends His own Son, and He becomes Son of
      Man, by taking created flesh; that, since all were under sentence of
      death, He, being other than them all, might Himself for all offer to death
      His own body; and that henceforth, as if all had died through Him, the
      word of that sentence might be accomplished (for 'all died 2 Corinthians
      5:14 ' in Christ), and all through Him might thereupon become free from
      sin and from the curse which came upon it, and might truly abide for ever,
      risen from the dead and clothed in immortality and incorruption."

      from the Bible, and phrases like "eternal death" have been utilized by

      have not provoked him by any previous offense; for to devote to
      destruction whomsoever he pleases, more resembles the caprice of a tyrant
      than the legal sentence of a judge; and, therefore, there is reason to
      expostulate with God, if at his mere pleasure men are, without any desert
      of their own, predestinated to eternal death... Scripture proclaims that

        >A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith: 2nd Edition</a
      >, 2020. In response to the chapter called "Eternal Punishment Construed
      as Annihilation," pgs. 1068-1081:
    </p>
    <p>
      Reymond says in the beginning of this section that John gives us a
      "graphic representation of hell," but just after that, he quotes
      Revelation 14:9-11 and states that "<em>eternal conscious torment</em>
      is [here] said to be the punishment of those who have the mark of the
      beast." These two statements contradict. John is not giving
      straightforward, didactic teaching about hell. He's recording a pictorial
      representation of hell that he sees in a vision, not a vision of hell
      itself. The Old Testament background, parallel judgment passages, and
      John's own interpretation of the symbols are the keys to understanding
      what that imagery represents. Reymond completely disregards the context
      and takes his own interpretation for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if we take the passage at face value without interpreting what each
      symbol represents, Reymond's interpretation of eternal conscious torment
      still does not follow. John only states that these people will be
      tormented in fire, won't have any rest for a time, and the smoke rising
      from this judgment will last forever. Traditionalist scholar G. K. Beale,
      quoted above, agrees that an annihilationist reading is possible because
      "Rev 14:10-11 could indicate a great judgment that will be remembered
      forever, not one that leads to eternal suffering." Furthermore, there are
      conditionalists that do believe that eternal conscious torment is being
      depicted here that symbolizes annihilation. Either way, Reymond has
      decided that eternal conscious torment is the correct view ahead of time
      and skips the necessary exegesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demonstrates a common interpretive problem when it comes to this
      issue. Revelation may be the hardest book to interpret in the New
      Testament. It is full of symbolism and Old Testament allusions which are
      not readily understood by people in a context removed from the original
      audience. Sometimes there is no way to understand the symbols at all
      without being given an interpretation. Thus, taking a surface level
      reading of Revelation 14:9-11 or 20:10, concluding that it teaches eternal
      conscious torment, and then reading that view back into every other
      passage about hell is completely backwards and irresponsible
      hermeneutically.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that short argument from Revelation, Reymond finishes his very first
      paragraph by concluding that "it is clear that the divine judgment
      awaiting evil-doers is certain, just, and eternal." Every conditionalist
      would agree wholeheartedly with this conclusion, except that Reymond
      clearly means eternal torment is certain. Not only is this misrepresenting
      conditionalism as if it denies eternal punishment before he has even
      explained the position, but it's also presenting that poor exegesis of
      Revelation as if it's decisive. Reymond has already precluded the
      possibility of conditionalism with absolutely no biblical support offered.
      The eisegesis that follows was inevitable from his starting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reymond addresses very few Old Testament passages because of his
      presupposition of eternal conscious torment. The Old Testament has much to
      say about the final death and destruction of the wicked, and God putting a
      final end to evil. However, the few texts cited still provide a vivid
      picture of annihilation: the fiery destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the
      destruction of Sihon killing every man, woman, and child, the principle of
      herem ("devotion") to the Lord for complete destruction, the fact that
      every evil deed will be judged, and the prophecy that the redeemed will go
      out in the new heavens and new earth to look on the dead bodies of those
      who rebelled against God which are being eaten by worms and burned.

      That last image comes from Isaiah 66:22-24. The only comment on this
      passage is a quote from a commentary. It affirms that this passage is
      indeed about the final state but explains away the obvious conditionalist
      implications by calling it a "monstrous and inconceivable" picture.
      Actually, it's very clear. The picture is of dead bodies that were slain,
      burned up, consumed, and looked on with contempt. It then cites Mark 9:48
      as support that this is a picture of eternal torment, but that is a
      completely circular argument. Jesus quotes from this passage in Mark 9:48,
      not to make it mean the exact opposite of what it means in context, but
      because the wicked being slain, devoured by an inextinguishable fire, and
      consumed is an accurate picture of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Testament section is hurt by the bad exegesis of the Old Testament
      and many of the objections are already answered above. Jesus uses the
      phrase "unquenchable fire" because the fire can't be put out, so that it
      completely consumes. Reymond acknowledges that the garbage dump theory of
      Gehenna comes "from late Jewish tradition (David Qimchi, c. A.D. 1200)"
      and has no support, but he nevertheless wrongly treats that as the primary
      background over and against the Old Testament. The Old Testament
      background of dead bodies being consumed by fire and eaten by maggots is
      diametrically opposed to the garbage dump myth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeping primarily indicates sadness. Gnashing teeth primarily indicates
      anger. Weeping and gnashing are not said to last eternally, and are
      accurate descriptions of people on death row or being burned alive. He
      says that a "more bearable" (Mat 10:15) judgment day on an annihilationist
      view is difficult to comprehend because everyone ends up dead. Being
      killed by hanging versus being burned alive clearly represent two
      different degrees of capital punishment. On the contrary, it is very hard
      to comprehend how the traditional view accounts for different degrees of
      punishment when one sin merits the same punishment as a billion sins,
      eternal suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if the intermediate state consists of torment, it does not follow
      that the eternal state consists of eternal torment. Just because the
      demons expect torment in the future (Mat 8:29), doesn't mean that they
      expect everlasting torment (and so what if they did?). Tartarus in 2 Peter
      2:4 does not refer to hell. It is the holding place for angels until the
      judgment. That is just a factual error.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for some reason, even though Reymond and Vos think the language of 2
      Thessalonians 1:9 is of annihilation, Vos thinks "that 'annihilation' is
      an extremely abstract idea, too philosophical, in fact." It's not that
      complicated. It just means their final death. He also argues that Paul
      couldn't have been thinking of annihilation because Jesus taught eternal
      torment in the gospels. This again shows the potential danger of arguing
      based on analogy of scripture when you don't want to accept what a verse
      teaches. It's better to carefully exegete the text before attempting to
      apply systematic theology to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This entire chapter illustrates how a bad starting place, misinterpreting
      a passage in Revelation, led to the entire Old and New Testaments being
      read incorrectly. It also illustrates that we can't be dogmatic about
      tradition. We must test all things by the Word of God. Reymond concludes
      the New Testament section without an in depth treatment of Revelation, but
      he assures us of his interpretation about the fires of Revelation by
      stating that "we should understand the realities these biblical passages
      seek to represent to be
      <em>more</em>—not less—horrible than their word depictions." However,
      having a more intolerable, dreadful, and harsh view of hell does not make
      it correct or more convincing.

    <h2>John M. Frame</h2>
    <p>
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief</a
      >
      (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2013). In response to the chapter
      called "Eternal Punishment of Unbelievers (Hell)," pgs. 1081-1083:
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Frame admits that he is reluctant to write about the topic of hell,
      unpleasant as it is, he states, "I must teach only what the Bible
      teaches." This is certainly to be commended; however, the question still
      remains, what does the Bible teach about hell?
    </p>
    <p>
      I certainly agree with Frame that all sinners are under the just
      condemnation of a holy God and in need of a savior. We are saved by faith
      in the Son of God who died on the cross for us. His death provides
      atonement for our sins, but the wrath of God remains on those who don't
      believe in the Son. Frame cites Exodus 15:6-7 to explain the wrath of God,
      but it also provides important background information about the consuming
      fire of God:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh,
        dashes the enemy in pieces. In the greatness of your excellency, you
        overthrow those who rise up against you. You send out your wrath. It
        consumes them as stubble.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Frame states that the "OT descriptions of God's wrath mainly concern what
      happens in this life." The Old Testament speaks of God's enemies being
      slain, consumed by fire, and put to an end. He is beginning to try to
      create a contrast between Old and New Testament language of destruction
      because he believes that the New Testament teaches eternal conscious
      torment. A problem with this approach is that the New Testament uses Old
      Testament language to talk about eschatological judgment. If the Old
      Testament uses annihilation language, it provides strong support for
      conditionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then makes the philosophical argument that punishment in this life
      could never satisfy God's law and cites Hebrews 10:26-27:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the
        truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
        expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the
        adversaries.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      This sounds awfully familiar to the outcome of God's enemies in the Old
      Testament. Eternal conscious torment doesn't teach that God's enemies will
      be devoured. Instead, it teaches that they will continue burning alive
      forever. Thus far, no support for the traditional doctrine can be found
      while much of the language cited provides support for conditionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionalists agree with Frame that the final "punishment is
      everlasting," but Romans 6:23 explains what the punishment for sin is:
      "the wages of sin is death." Frame cites Matthew 25:46 to support the
      eternal aspect of the final judgment:
    </p>
    <section>
      <p>
        These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
        eternal life.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Notice that Jesus contrasts eternal punishment with eternal life. Whatever
      the final punishment is, it can't include eternal life. However, that is
      what traditionalists argue for. They argue that the punishment will be an
      embodied life of suffering in hell forever where the wicked are made
      immortal and never die. Conditionalists, on the other hand, argue that the
      punishment must not include eternal life, which must mean death, the very
      thing that the New Testament says is the punishment for sin many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Frame reveals the real impetus behind his belief in eternal
      conscious torment: Revelation 14:11 yet again! And continuing the pattern,
      there is no consideration given to the context, genre, or background of
      the verse. It's just cited as if it came out of a textbook, rather than an
      apocalyptic book full of Old Testament allusions and bizarre symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frame's only response to annihilationism is that "Scripture suggests the
      opposite, that not only does the fire continue forever, but the torment of
      the wicked continues forever as well (Rev. 14:11; 20:10)." Again, no
      explanation is given. If you remember that John's vision is of a
      representation of hell (it's symbolic), then you realize that Frame hasn't
      even started to give a biblical argument for eternal conscious torment
      because he hasn't tried to interpret any of the symbols. Both passages are
      describing the final judgment. John interprets the lake of fire in
      Revelation 20:10 in clear language two times. The lake of fire is the
      second death (Rev 20:14; 21:8). It means dying a second time, both body
      and soul (Mat 10:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      He provides several references in parentheses for support which, when
      understood in context, provide vivid pictures of annihilation. Mark 9:43
      and 48 contain a quote to Isaiah 66:24, a passage indicating that the
      fires will be inextinguishable, thus burning up the dead bodies
      completely. Luke 16:22-24 and 28 are about Hades, the intermediate state,
      further demonstrating the sloppiness of exegesis in support of the
      traditional view. Revelation 14:11 and 19:3 both indicate that smoke rises
      forever. Likewise, the smoke rises forever from Edom which was destroyed
      by unquenchable fire (Isa 34:8-10). The everlasting smoke symbolizes the
      permanent remembrance of a judgment which results in complete destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other verses in Scripture are very clear on this issue too. Paul speaks
      much of the destruction of the wicked. The language of perishing and dying
      is used all over the New Testament. The Old Testament is very clear about
      the fate of the wicked. All of that clear teaching can't be reinterpreted
      based on the non-exegesis of Revelation. Unfortunately, that's what most
      defenses of the traditional view amount to.

      Annihilationism, pgs. 199-220:
    </p>

    <p>
      Morey's arguments are much better suited to argue against Froom and
      Seventh-Day Adventists. Unfortunately, he doesn't address the kind of
      exegetical and theological points raised so far in this article.
    </p>

    <p>A Brief History</p>
    <p>
      Morey begins by attempting to give a brief history of conditional
      immortality. He claims that annihilationism "was first advanced by
      Arnobius" in the fourth century whom he calls a "Christian" in quotes. It
      would be convenient for Morey if Arnobius really were the first proponent
      of conditionalism several hundred years after the New Testament. And as
      the
      <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01746c.htm" target="_blank"
        >Catholic Encyclopedia</a
      >
      notes:
    </p>
    <section>
      "Arnobius is more earnest in his defence of Christianity than correct in
      his tenets," but "Arnobius is a vigorous apologist for the Christian
      Faith, defends and expounds its noble monotheism (<em
        >deus princeps, deus summus</em
      >), the Divinity of Christ and of the Christian religion, proved by its
      rapid diffusion, its incredible influence over uncivilized peoples, and
      its agreement with the views of the best philosophers."
    </section>
    <p>
      There is no reason to doubt that Arnodius is a true Christian as Morey
      does, but more importantly, Arnobius is following in a tradition of
      conditionalists. It appears that all of the Apostolic Fathers and many
      early Christians were conditionalists, but one example suffices to refute
      the claim that Arnobius is the first. That Irenaeus is a conditionalist is
      very clear in multiple places and is widely recognized by traditionalist
      scholars. Irenaeus (c. A.D. 120-200) in
      <a
        href="https://archive.org/details/SaintIrenaeusAgainstHeresiesComplete/page/n137/mode/1up"
        target="_blank"
        >Against Heresies</a
      >
      writes:
    </p>
    <section>
      "He asked life of You, and You gave him length of days for ever and ever;
      indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts continuance for ever
      and ever on those who are saved... If you have not been faithful in that
      which is little, who will give you that which is great? indicating that
      those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves ungrateful
      to Him who bestowed it, shall justly not receive from Him length of days
      for ever and ever" (2.34.3).
    </section>
    <p>
      Morey's historical argument thus falls flat. It was not a later,
      biblically illiterate Christian who first taught conditionalism (as Morey
      portrays it), but a stream of Christians from the earliest times after the
      New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey repeats the often made claim that the
      <a
        href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xii.x.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Second Council of Constantinople</a
      >
      (A.D. 553) condemned conditionalism as heresy. He provides no quote but is
      most likely refering to anathematism IX which says, "If anyone says or
      thinks that the punishment of demons and of impious men is only temporary,
      and will one day have an end, and that a restoration will take place of
      demons and of impious men, let him be anathema." However, this is clearly
      a condemnation against Origen's universalism, and says nothing contrary to
      conditionalism. On the annihilation view, the punishment is eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I agree with Morey that the traditional view of hell is widespread after
      Augustine, but traditionalist Graham Keith notes that "a century or so
      after Constantine we have a surprising amount of evidence indicating
      widespread denial of eternal punishment [ECT] within the church" (<a
        href="https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1999-3_217.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        >Patristic Views on Hell―Part 1</a
      >). Even at so late a date, ECT was still widely denied in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also agree with Morey that a theologian believing in soul sleep does not
      imply that they believe in annihilationism. He claims that many
      annihilationists argue that soul sleep implies annihilationism naming
      Froom as an example, but I've never heard that claim before.
      Annihilationism is about the final state and doesn't commit one to soul
      sleep which is about the intermediate state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although conditionalism is held by several cult groups today, Seventh-Day
      Adventists are an example of a Christian denomination that holds to
      conditionalism. Morey claims that the publishing of
      <em>The Fire That Consumes</em> by Edward Fudge was done with the hope to
      "introduce Adventist theology into evangelical circles" almost
      conspiratorially. But the question of conditional immortality is quite
      apart from other Seventh-Day Adventist doctrines. Even if that was the
      intention, conditionalism is held by many evangelicals across different
      denominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ends the first section by claiming that annihilationism is on the rise
      because of liberalism and "is regrettably the result of a weak view of
      Scripture which has been developing in certain evangelical circles over
      the last 25 years." But that is incredibly uncharitable to those who are
      committed to biblical innerancy and believe the Bible teaches conditional
      immortality. He poisons the well by painting conditionalism as the liberal
      view before addressing any of their arguments. Just because tradition
      widely teaches a doctrine does not make it biblical!
    </p>

    <p>A Theological Analysis</p>
    <p>
      For some strange reason Morey equates conditional immortality with
      materialism. He claims that "both deny that man has an immaterial soul and
      that man’s soul or spirit survives the death of the body," but this is
      certainly false. As far as the first claim, some conditionalists are
      anthropological physicalists while others are dualists. Christian
      physicalism is not materialism because it affirms God and other spiritual
      realities. It just denies that man's soul is immaterial. For the second
      claim, while evangelical conditionalism teaches that God will "destroy
      both soul and body [of the wicked] in Gehenna" (Mat 10:28), it affirms
      that everyone's soul survives death until the resurrection and final
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey continues to present annihilationism as a cultic view stating that
      "we must point out that it is generally in connection with cultic or
      neo-cultic organizations that this belief is found." If conditionalism is
      such a plainly unbiblical belief, we wouldn't need all the inaccurate
      historical and theological priming against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contra Froom's introduction, conditionalism is attested early, is not a
      form of materialism, was not condemed as heretical by the Second Council
      of Constantinople, is not an inherently cultic or liberal belief, has no
      inherent connection to other Seventh-Day Adventist beliefs, and has strong
      biblical arguments for it that need to be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey raises and responds to twelve conditionalist arguments in the next
      section which primarily come from Froom's
      <em>The Conditionalist Faith of Our Fathers</em> (1965). I have not read
      that work, but I am not impressed by it based on Morey's relaying. Edward
      Fudge's <em>The Fire that Consumes</em> (1982) is barely addressed, but I
      think it is a much stronger presentation of evangelical conditionalism.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 1</p>
    <p>
      Morey responds to the claim that conditionalist arguments have been
      ignored, and adds the gripe that the label "traditionalism" implies that
      ECT is only held because of tradition and not the Bible. While not an
      argument for conditionalism, I am definitely inclined to agree with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morey mentions "Bartlett, Boettner, Grant, A. Hodge, Hovey, Landis,
      Stuart, Martin, etc." as writers who have responded to conditionalism. I
      have not read all of them, but older writers such as Herman Bavinck are
      primarily responding to liberal and emotional arguments. Many modern
      traditionalists such as Morey or Robert L. Reymond continue to argue
      against many of the same bad arguments instead of addressing robust
      evangelical proponents of conditionalism such as Edward Fudge.
      Mischaracterizations and sloppiness abound in traditionalist works.
    </p>
    <p>
      So while responses do exist, there are few serious responses. Even many
      traditionalists such as James White agree with that assessment and agree
      that most proponents of ECT are following it because of tradition and not
      because of a firm biblical understanding, though he does believe the Bible
      teaches it.
    </p>

    <p>Arguments 2, 3, and 12</p>
    <p>
      These responses are against soul sleep. I don't believe in soul sleep so I
      agree with Morey here, but it's irrelevant to the issue at hand. Morey has
      a common modern misunderstanding about the final state. Unbelievers do not
      go straight to hell when they die. They go to hades (the grave). This is
      known as the intermediate state. It is only after the general resurrection
      of all that they face the final judgment and are sent to hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all protestant confessions and historic theologians make that
      distinction and the Bible certainly does, so this argument is useless. He
      assumes (as does Froom it seems) that the intermediate state must be
      exactly like the eternal state, but that is a faulty assumption. The
      intermediate state is like a holding cell until the resurrection,
      judgment, and final damnation to hell. There is no reason to conflate the
      two when the Bible does not. The intermediate state may consist of the
      worst torment imaginable, but that would not change the fact that the
      wicked will face the second death on judgment day.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 4</p>
    <p>
      The conditionalist argument given is that Sheol and Hades both mean grave,
      so there is no intermediate state but instead immediate death. This is a
      really bad argument. Morey rightly rejects it, but for the wrong reason.
      Hades is the grave contrary to what Morey says, but at the end of the age,
      Hades (the grave) will give up the dead so that they can be judged: "Death
      and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one
      according to his works" (Rev 20:13).
    </p>

    <p>Argument 5</p>
    <p>
      The most common terms for the fate of the wicked are "destroyed,"
      "consumed", "perish," etc., which must "mean that they pass into
      nonexistence." Annihilated does not mean nonexistent, but dead, destroyed,
      unalived, unconscience state. The given answer to this argument is that
      apollumi doesn't actually mean destroyed, but "ruin, loss... of
      well-being." There is a good reason most Bible translations don't
      translate that way. When people are "apollumi-ed," they are killed or
      destroyed. When objects are "apollumi-ed," they are ruined or lost. Check
      out Mark Corbett's video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8Lcq51oHRQ" target="_blank"
        >Apollumi: The Word that Tells Us What Happens to People in Hell
        (Annihilation or Eternal Torment?)</a
      >
      to see every use of the word apollumi in the New Testament and uses
      outside the New Testament.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 6</p>
    <p>
      Eternal life means living forever. Only the righteous get eternal life.
      Therefore, only the righteous will live forever. This is a super simple
      and effective argument. His response is that eternal life actually means
      "a quality of divine life." It's obvious that he isn't taking the language
      in a natural way. Of course eternal life has a positive
      quality/connotation to it, but the phrase eternal life does mean living
      forever. Just as people looked up at the raised serpent to save their
      physical lives for a short time (Jn 3:14-15), we look to Jesus to save our
      physical and spiritual lives eternally (Jn 3:16). This isn't complicated
      or cryptic language.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 7</p>
    <p>
      1 Timothy 6:16 says that only God has immortality, so man is not immortal.
      I agree with Morey's response that this means that only God has absolute
      immortality. However, I disagree that the unrighteous will be granted
      immortality. Post-fall humans are mortal, and eternal life and immortality
      is a gift for the righteous at the resurrection as seen in 1 Corinthians
      15 and John 3:16. The burden of proof is on Morey to show that the
      unrighteous will actually be granted eternal life and immortality too.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 8</p>
    <p>
      He presents the argument that Gehenna is a garbage dump whose fire and
      worms will go out after the trash is consumed. However, the first claim
      that Gehenna was a garbage dump comes from Rabbi David Kimhi around A.D.
      1200. This mistake doesn't help his case though. The context for Gehenna
      in Jeremiah 7 indicates that the fire and worms will burn up and consume
      <em>dead bodies</em>. Gehenna is prophesied to be called the valley of
      slaughter because God is going to slay His enemies there. Even if a dump
      is the background, of course the garbage is burned up. But if against all
      common sense, the garbage, flames, and worms are made eternal, the garbage
      still represents dead corpses which can't feel torment.

    <p>Argument 9</p>
    <p>
      I don't argue that olam, aion, and aionios mean something other than
      eternal, but eternal undeniably can refer to something either eternal in
      process or in result when refering to nouns. Examples: Eternal salvation
      means something is eternally saved. If something is eternally saved, it is
      either being saved forever or is forever saved. Eternal destruction means
      something is eternally destroyed. If something is eternally destroyed, it
      is either being destroyed forever or is forever destroyed. Eternal
      punishment means something is eternally punished. If something is
      eternally punished, it is either being punished forever or forever
      punished. This is not controversial and can be found in standard Greek
      lexicons and confirmed by linguistics.

    <p>Argument 10</p>
    <p>
      It is very obvious from the biblical account that the soul is not
      preexistent. It is clear but less obvious that the soul is not necessarily
      immortal. The reason it is valid to claim that ECT is influened by Plato's
      philosophy is that one of the first proponents of ECT, Tertullian,
      literally cites Plato to support the immortality of the soul. Morey admits
      that "the orthodox have always viewed life in this world or in the next as
      a gift of God," which means that he believes God grants the gift
      immortality to sinners at the final judgment. A radical claim that is not
      supported in this section.
    </p>

    <p>Argument 11</p>
    <p>
      The conditionalist argument is that all Jewish and early patristic
      writings support conditionalism. I agree that this claim is overstated.
      While the vast majority of early Jewish writings support conditionalism,
      ECT is occasionally found in some later Jewish writings. And while all the
      Apostolic Fathers appear to support conditionalism, ECT would enter the
      church a little over a century later from Plato-influenced theologians in
      the late second century like Athenagoras of Athens (A.D. 133-190) and
      Tertullian (A.D. 160-240).
    </p>

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      He believes to "have covered all the arguments for conditionalism and
      annihilationism that is to be found in the literature on this subject."
      One of the most obvious arguments is that Christ died for sins. He was our
      substitute on the cross bearing the punishment we deserve. The punishment
      Christ suffered was a painful death. Therefore, the punishment of those
      Christ doesn't save is a painful death. Support that with Romans 6:23:
      "For the wages of sin is death." It is clear from a simple example like
      that Morey does not comprehensively respond to conditionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though there were problems with Morey's arguments, the main issue is that
      the arguments for conditionalism were just bad. They didn't even address
      scripture much at all. Responding to Edward Fudge would have been much
      more fruitful and exegetically focused. Also understanding that
      annihilationism is <em>only</em> about the final fate of the wicked would
      help further the discussion. Conditionalists hold different views on the
      anthropology of man, the intermediate state, and other issues, but these
      are distinct from the doctrine of hell.
