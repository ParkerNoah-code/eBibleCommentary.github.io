  <h1>II. Evidences Of God's Existence</h1>
  <h2>The Cosmological Argument</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    This is not properly an argument from effect to cause; for the proposition
    that every effect must have a cause is simply identical, and means only that
    every caused event must have a cause. It is rather an argument from begun
    existence to a sufficient cause of that beginning, and may be accurately
    stated as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything begun, whether substance or phenomenon, owes its existence to
    some producing cause. The universe, at least so far as its present form is
    concerned, is a thing begun, and owes its existence to a cause which is
    equal to its production. This cause must be indefinitely great.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      It is to be noticed that this argument moves wholly in the realm of
      nature. The argument from man&#x27;s constitution and beginning upon the
      planet is treated under another head (see Anthropological Argument). That
      the present form of the universe is not eternal in the past, but has begun
      to be, not only personal observation but the testimony of geology assures
      us. For statements of the argument, see Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
      (Bohn&#x27;s transl.), 370; Gillespie, Necessary Existence of God,
      8:34-44; Bib. Sac., 1849:613; 1850:613; Porter, Hum. Intellect, 570;
      Herbert Spencer, First Principles, 93. It has often been claimed, as by
      Locke, Clarke, and Robert Hall, that this argument is sufficient to
      conduct the mind to an Eternal and Infinite First Cause. We proceed
      therefore to mention
    </p>

  <p>1. The defects of the Cosmological Argument.</p>

  <p>
    A. It is impossible to show that the universe, so far as its substance is
    concerned, has had a beginning. The law of causality declares, not that
    everything has a cause—for then God himself must have a cause—but rather
    that everything begun has a cause, or in other words, that every event or
    change has a cause.

      Hume, Philos. Works, 2:411 sq., urges with reason that we never saw a
      world made. Many philosophers in Christian lands, as Martineau, Essays,
      1:206, and the prevailing opinions of ante-Christian times, have held
      matter to be eternal. Bowne, Metaphysics, 107—“For being itself, the
      reflective reason never asks a cause, unless the being show signs of
      dependence. It is change that first gives rise to the demand for cause.”
      Martineau, Types, 1:291—“It is not existence, as such, that demands a
      cause, but the coming into existence of what did not exist before. The
      intellectual law of causality is a law for phenomena, and not for entity.”
      See also McCosh, Intuitions, 225-241; Calderwood, Philos. of Infinite, 61.
      Per contra, see Murphy, Scient. Bases of Faith, 49, 195, and Habit and
      Intelligence, 1:55-67; Knight, Lect. on Metaphysics, lect. ii, p. 19.

    B. Granting that the universe, so far as its phenomena are concerned, has
    had a cause, it is impossible to show that any other cause is required than
    a cause within itself, such as the pantheist supposes.

      Flint, Theism, 65—“The cosmological argument alone proves only force, and
      no mere force is God. Intelligence must go with power to make a Being that
      can be called God.” Diman, Theistic Argument: “The cosmological argument
      alone cannot decide whether the force that causes change is permanent
      self-existent mind, or permanent self-existent matter.” Only intelligence
      gives the basis for an answer. Only mind in the universe enables us to
      infer mind in the maker. But the argument from intelligence is not the
      Cosmological, but the Teleological, and to this last belong all proofs of
      Deity from order and combination in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upton, Hibbert Lectures, 201-296—Science has to do with those changes
      which one portion of the visible universe causes in another portion.
      Philosophy and theology deal with the Infinite Cause which brings into
      existence and sustains the entire series of finite causes. Do we ask the
      cause of the stars? Science says: Fire-mist, or an infinite regress of
      causes. Theology says: Granted; but this infinite regress demands for its
      explanation the belief in God. We must believe both in God, and in an
      endless series of finite causes. God is the cause of all causes, the soul
      of all souls: “Centre and soul of every sphere, Yet to each loving heart
      how near!” We do not need, as mere matter of science, to think of any
      beginning.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    C. Granting that the universe most have had a cause outside of itself, it is
    impossible to show that this cause has not itself been caused, i. e.,
    consists of an infinite series of dependent causes. The principle of
    causality does not require that everything begun should be traced back to an
    uncaused cause; it demands that we should assign a cause, but not that we
    should assign a first cause.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      So with the whole series of causes. The materialist is bound to find a
      cause for this series, only when the series is shown to have had a
      beginning. But the very hypothesis of an infinite series of causes
      excludes the idea of such a beginning. An infinite chain has no topmost
      link (versus Robert Hall); an uncaused and eternal succession does not
      need a cause (versus Clarke and Locke). See Whately, Logic, 270; New
      Englander, Jan. 1874:75; Alexander, Moral Science, 221; Pfleiderer, Die
      Religion, 1:160-164; Calderwood, Moral Philos., 225; Herbert Spencer,
      First Principles, 37—criticized by Bowne, Review of H. Spencer, 36. Julius
      Müller, Doct. Sin, 2:128, says that the causal principle is not satisfied
      till by regress we come to a cause which is not itself an effect—to one
      who is causa sui; Aids to Study of German Theology, 15-17—Even if the
      universe be eternal, its contingent and relative nature requires us to
      postulate an eternal Creator; Diman, Theistic Argument, 86—“While the law
      of causation does not lead logically up to the conclusion of a first
      cause, it compels us to affirm it.” We reply that it is not the law of
      causation which compels us to affirm it, for this certainly “does not lead
      logically up to the conclusion.” If we infer an uncaused cause, we do it,
      not by logical process, but by virtue of the intuitive belief within us.
      So substantially Secretan, and Whewell, in Indications of a Creator, and
      in Hist. of Scientific Ideas, 2:321, 322—“The mind takes refuge, in the
      assumption of a First Cause, from an employment inconsistent with its own
      nature”; “we necessarily infer a First Cause, although the palætiological
      sciences only point toward it, but do not lead us to it.”
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    D. Granting that the cause of the universe has not itself been caused, it is
    impossible to show that this cause is not finite, like the universe itself.
    The causal principle requires a cause no greater than just sufficient to
    account for the effect.
  </p>

      We cannot therefore infer an infinite cause, unless the universe is
      infinite—which cannot be proved, but can only be assumed—and this is
      assuming an infinite in order to prove an infinite. All we know of the
      universe is finite. An infinite universe implies infinite number. But no
      number can be infinite, for to any number, however great, a unit can be
      added, which shows that it was not infinite before. Here again we see that
      the most approved forms of the Cosmological Argument are obliged to avail
      themselves of the intuition of the infinite, to supplement the logical
      process. VersusMartineau, Study, 1:416—“Though we cannot directly infer
      the infinitude of God from a limited creation, indirectly we may exclude
      every other position by resort to its unlimited scene of existence
      (space).” But this would equally warrant our belief in the infinitude of
      our fellow men. Or, it is the argument of Clarke and Gillespie (see
      Ontological Argument below). Schiller, Die Grösse der Welt, seems to hold
      to a boundless universe. He represents a tired spirit as seeking the last
      limit of creation. A second pilgrim meets him from the spaces beyond with
      the words: “Steh! du segelst umsonst,—vor dir Unendlichkeit”—“Hold! thou
      journeyest in vain,—before thee is only Infinity.”On the law of parsimony,
      see Sir Wm. Hamilton, Discussions, 628.
    </p>

    2. The value of the Cosmological Argument, then, is simply this,—it proves
    the existence of some cause of the universe indefinitely great. When we go
    beyond this and ask whether this cause is a cause of being, or merely a
    cause of change, to the universe; whether it is a cause apart from the
    universe, or one with it; whether it is an eternal cause, or a cause
    dependent upon some other cause; whether it is intelligent or unintelligent,
    infinite or finite, one or many,—this argument cannot assure us.
