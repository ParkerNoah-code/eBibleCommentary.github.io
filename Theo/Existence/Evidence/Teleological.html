  <h1>II. Evidences Of God's Existence</h1>
  <h2>The Teleological Argument</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    This is not properly an argument from design to a designer; for that design
    implies a designer is simply an identical proposition. It may be more
    correctly stated as follows: Order and useful collocation pervading a system
    respectively imply intelligence and purpose as the cause of that order and
    collocation. Since order and useful collocation pervade the universe, there
    must exist an intelligence adequate to the production of this order, and a
    will adequate to direct this collocation to useful ends.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Etymologically, “teleological argument” = argument to ends or final
      causes, that is, “causes which, beginning as a thought, work themselves
      out into a fact as an end or result” (Porter, Hum. Intellect,
      592-618);—health, for example, is the final cause of exercise, while
      exercise is the efficient cause of health. This definition of the argument
      would be broad enough to cover the proof of a designing intelligence drawn
      from the constitution of man. This last, however, is treated as a part of
      the Anthropological Argument, which follows this, and the Teleological
      Argument covers only the proof of a designing intelligence drawn from
      nature. Hence Kant, Critique of Pure Reason (Bohn&#x27;s trans.), 381,
      calls it the physico-theological argument. On methods of stating the
      argument, see Bib. Sac., Oct. 1867:625. See also Hedge, Ways of the
      Spirit, 155-185; Mozley, Essays Hist. and Theol., 2:365-413.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hicks, in his Critique of Design-Arguments, 347-389, makes two arguments
      instead of one: (1) the argument from order to intelligence, to which he
      gives the name Eutaxiological; (2) the argument from adaptation to
      purpose, to which he would restrict the name Teleological. He holds that
      teleology proper cannot prove intelligence, because in speaking of “ends”
      at all, it must assume the very intelligence which it seeks to prove; that
      it actually does prove simply the intentional exercise of an intelligence
      whose existence has been previously established. “Circumstances, forces or
      agencies converging to a definite rational result imply volition—imply
      that this result is intended—is an end. This is the major premise of this
      new teleology.” He objects to the term “final cause.”The end is not a
      cause at all—it is a motive. The characteristic element of cause is power
      to produce an effect. Ends have no such power. The will may choose them or
      set them aside. As already assuming intelligence, ends cannot prove
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in the main we agree, and count it a valuable help to the
      statement and understanding of the argument. In the very observation of
      order, however, as well as in arguing from it, we are obliged to assume
      the same all-arranging intelligence. We see no objection therefore to
      making Eutaxiology the first part of the Teleological Argument, as we do
      above. See review of Hicks, in Meth. Quar. Rev., July, 1883:569-576. We
      proceed however to certain
    </p>

  <p>1. Further explanations.</p>
  <p>
    A. The major premise expresses a primitive conviction. It is not invalidated
    by the objections: (a) that order and useful collocation may exist without
    being purposed—for we are compelled by our very mental constitution to deny
    this in all cases where the order and collocation pervade a system: (b) that
    order and useful collocation may result from the mere operation of physical
    forces and laws—for these very forces and laws imply, instead of excluding,
    an originating and superintending intelligence and will.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Janet, in his work on Final Causes, 8, denies that finality is a primitive
      conviction, like causality, and calls it the result of an induction. He
      therefore proceeds from (1) marks of order and useful collocation to (2)
      finality in nature, and then to (3) an intelligent cause of this finality
      or “pre-conformity to future event.” So Diman, Theistic Argument, 105,
      claims simply that, as change requires cause, so orderly change requires
      intelligent cause. We have shown, however, that induction and argument of
      every kind presupposes intuitive belief in final cause. Nature does not
      give us final cause; but no more does she give us efficient cause. Mind
      gives us both, and gives them as clearly upon one experience as after a
      thousand. Ladd: “Things have mind in them: else they could not be minded
      by us.” The Duke of Argyll told Darwin that it seemed to him wholly
      impossible to ascribe the adjustments of nature to any other agency than
      that of mind. “Well,” said Darwin, “that impression has often come upon me
      with overpowering force. But then, at other times, it all seems—;” and
      then he passed his hands over his eyes, as if to indicate the passing of a
      vision out of sight. Darwinism is not a refutation of ends in nature, but
      only of a particular theory with regard to the way in which ends are
      realized in the organic world. Darwin would begin with an infinitesimal
      germ, and make all the subsequent development unteleological; see
      Schurman, Belief in God, 193.

      (a) Illustration of unpurposed order in the single throwing of “double
      sixes,”—constant throwing of double sixes indicates design. So arrangement
      of detritus at mouth of river, and warming pans sent to the West
      Indies,—useful but not purposed. Momerie, Christianity and Evolution,
      72—“It is only within narrow limits that seemingly purposeful arrangements
      are produced by chance. And therefore, as the signs of purpose increase,
      the presumption in favor of their accidental origin diminishes.”Elder,
      Ideas from Nature, 81, 82—“The uniformity of a boy&#x27;s marbles shows
      them to be products of design. A single one might be accidental, but a
      dozen cannot be. So atomic uniformity indicates manufacture.”
      Illustrations of purposed order, in Beattie&#x27;s garden,
      Tillotson&#x27;s blind men, Kepler&#x27;s salad. Dr. Carpenter: “The
      atheist is like a man examining the machinery of a great mill, who,
      finding that the whole is moved by a shaft proceeding from a brick wall,
      infers that the shaft is a sufficient explanation of what he sees, and
      that there is no moving power behind it.” Lord Kelvin: “The atheistic idea
      is nonsensical.” J. G. Paton, Life, 2:191—The sinking of a well on the
      island of Aniwa convinces the cannibal chief Namakei that Jehovah God
      exists, the invisible One. See Chauncey Wright, in N. Y. Nation, Jan. 15,
      1874; Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith, 208.

    <p>
      (b) Bowne, Review of Herbert Spencer, 231-247—“Law is method, not cause. A
      man cannot offer the very fact to be explained, as its sufficient
      explanation.” Martineau, Essays, 1:144—“Patterned damask, made not by the
      weaver, but by the loom?”Dr. Stevenson: “House requires no architect,
      because it is built by stone-masons and carpenters?” Joseph Cook: “Natural
      law without God behind it is no more than a glove without a hand in it,
      and all that is done by the gloved hand of God in nature is done by the
      hand and not by the glove. Evolution is a process, not a power; a method
      of operation, not an operator. A book is not written by the laws of
      spelling and grammar, but according to those laws. So the book of the
      universe is not written by the laws of heat, electricity, gravitation,
      evolution, but according to those laws.” G. F. Wright, Ant. and Orig. of
      Hum. Race, lecture IX—“It is impossible for evolution to furnish evidence
      which shall drive design out of nature. It can only drive it back to an
      earlier point of entrance, thereby increasing our admiration for the power
      of the Creator to accomplish ulterior designs by unlikely means.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Evolution is only the method of God. It has to do with the how, not with
      the why, of phenomena, and therefore is not inconsistent with design, but
      rather is a new and higher illustration of design. Henry Ward Beecher:
      “Design by wholesale is greater than design by retail.” Frances Power
      Cobbe: “It is a singular fact that, whenever we find out how a thing is
      done, our first conclusion seems to be that God did not do it.” Why should
      we say: “The more law, the less God?” The theist refers the phenomena to a
      cause that knows itself and what it is doing; the atheist refers them to a
      power which knows nothing of itself and what it is doing (Bowne). George
      John Romanes said that, if God be immanent, then all natural causation
      must appear to be mechanical, and it is no argument against the divine
      origin of a thing to prove it due to natural causation: “Causes in nature
      do not obviate the necessity of a cause in nature.” Shaler, Interpretation
      of Nature, 47—Evolution shows that the direction of affairs is under
      control of something like our own intelligence: “Evolution spells
      Purpose.” Clarke, Christ. Theology, 105—“The modern doctrine of evolution
      has been awake to the existence of innumerable ends within the universe,
      but not to the one great end for the universe itself.” Huxley, Critiques
      and Addresses, 274, 275, 307—“The teleological and mechanical views of the
      universe are not mutually exclusive.”Sir William Hamilton, Metaphysics:
      “Intelligence stands first in the order of existence. Efficient causes are
      preceded by final causes.” See also Thornton, Old Fashioned Ethics,
      199-265; Archbp. Temple, Bampton Lect., 1884:99-123; Owen, Anat. of
      Vertebrates, 3:796; Peirce, Ideality in the Physical Sciences, 1-35;

      Rev., 135.

    B. The minor premise expresses a working-principle of all science, namely,
    that all things have their uses, that order pervades the universe, and that
    the methods of nature are rational methods. Evidences of this appear in the
    correlation of the chemical elements to each other; in the fitness of the
    inanimate world to be the basis and support of life; in the typical forms
    and unity of plan apparent in the organic creation; in the existence and
    coöperation of natural laws; in cosmical order and compensations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This minor premise is not invalidated by the objections: (a) That we
    frequently misunderstand the end actually subserved by natural events and
    objects; for the principle is, not that we necessarily know the actual end,
    but that we necessarily believe that there is some end, in every case of
    systematic order and collocation. (b) That the order of the universe is
    manifestly imperfect; for this, if granted, would argue, not absence of
    contrivance, but some special reason for imperfection, either in the
    limitations of the contriving intelligence itself, or in the nature of the
    end sought (as, for example, correspondence with the moral state and
    probation of sinners).
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      The evidences of order and useful collocation are found both in the
      indefinitely small and the indefinitely great. The molecules are
      manufactured articles; and the compensations of the solar system which
      provide that a secular flattening of the earth&#x27;s orbit shall be made
      up for by a secular rounding of that same orbit, alike show an
      intelligence far transcending our own; see Cooke, Religion and Chemistry,
      and Credentials of Science, 23—“Beauty is the harmony of relations which
      perfect fitness produces; law is the prevailing principle which underlies
      that harmony. Hence both beauty and law imply design. From energy,
      fitness, beauty, order, sacrifice, we argue might, skill, perfection, law,
      and love in a Supreme Intelligence. Christianity implies design, and is
      the completion of the design argument.” Pfleiderer, Philos. Religion,
      1:168—“A good definition of beauty is immanent purposiveness, the
      teleological ideal background of reality, the shining of the Idea through
      phenomena.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowne, Philos. Theism, 85—“Design is never causal. It is only ideal, and
      it demands an efficient cause for its realization. If ice is not to sink,
      and to freeze out life, there must be some molecular structure which shall
      make its bulk greater than that of an equal weight of water.” Jackson,
      Theodore Parker, 355—“Rudimentary organs are like the silent letters in
      many words,—both are witnesses to a past history; and there is
      intelligence in their preservation.” Diman, Theistic Argument: “Not only
      do we observe in the world the change which is the basis of the
      Cosmological Argument, but we perceive that this change proceeds according
      to a fixed and invariable rule. In inorganic nature, general order, or
      regularity; in organic nature, special order or adaptation.”Bowne, Review
      of H. Spencer, 113-115, 224-230: “Inductive science proceeds upon the
      postulate that the reasonable and the natural are one.” This furnished the
      guiding clue to Harvey and Cuvier; see Whewell, Hist. Induct. Sciences,
      2:489-491. Kant: “The anatomist must assume that nothing in man is in
      vain.” Aristotle: “Nature makes nothing in vain.” On molecules as
      manufactured articles, see Maxfield, in Nature, Sept. 25, 1873. See also
      Tulloch, Theism, 116, 120; LeConte, Religion and Science, lect. 2 and 3;
      McCosh, Typical Forms, 81, 420; Agassiz, Essay on Classification, 9, 10;
      Bib. Sac., 1849:626 and 1850:613; Hopkins, in Princeton Review, 1882:181.

    <p>
      (a) Design, in fact that rivers always run by large towns? that springs
      are always found at gambling places? Plants made for man, and man for
      worms? Voltaire: “Noses are made for spectacles—let us wear them!” Pope:
      “While man exclaims ‘See all things for my use,’ ‘See man for mine,’
      replies the pampered goose.” Cherries do not ripen in the cold of winter
      when they do not taste as well, and grapes do not ripen in the heat of
      summer when the new wine would turn to vinegar? Nature divides melons into
      sections for convenience in family eating? Cork-tree made for
      bottle-stoppers? The child who was asked the cause of salt in the ocean,
      attributed it to codfish, thus dimly confounding final cause with
      efficient cause. Teacher: “What are marsupials?” Pupil: “Animals that have
      pouches in their stomachs.”Teacher: “And what do they have pouches for?”
      Pupil: “To crawl into and conceal themselves in, when they are pursued.”
      Why are the days longer in summer than in winter? Because it is the
      property of all natural objects to elongate under the influence of heat. A
      Jena professor held that doctors do not exist because of disease, but that
      diseases exist precisely in order that there may be doctors. Kepler was an
      astronomical Don Quixote. He discussed the claims of eleven different
      damsels to become his second wife, and he likened the planets to huge
      animals rushing through the sky. Many of the objections to design arise
      from confounding a part of the creation with the whole, or a structure in
      the process of development with a structure completed. For illustrations
      of mistaken ends, see Janet, Final Causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Alphonso of Castile took offense at the Ptolemaic System, and
      intimated that, if he had been consulted at the creation, he could have
      suggested valuable improvements. Lange, in his History of Materialism,
      illustrates some of the methods of nature by millions of gun barrels shot
      in all directions to kill a single hare; by ten thousand keys bought at
      haphazard to get into a shut room; by building a city in order to obtain a
      house. Is not the ice a little overdone about the poles? See John Stuart
      Mill&#x27;s indictment of nature, in his posthumous Essays on Religion,
      29—“Nature impales men, breaks men as if on a wheel, casts them to be
      devoured by wild beasts, crushes them with stones like the first Christian
      martyr, starves them with hunger, freezes them with cold, poisons them
      with the quick or slow venom of her exhalations, and has hundreds of other
      hideous deaths in reserve, such as the ingenious cruelty of a Nabis or a
      Domitian never surpassed.” So argue Schopenhauer and Von Hartmann.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctrine of evolution answers many of these objections, by showing
      that order and useful collocation in the system as a whole is necessarily
      and cheaply purchased by imperfection and suffering in the initial stages
      of development. The question is: Does the system as a whole imply design?
      My opinion is of no value as to the usefulness of an intricate machine the
      purpose of which I do not know. If I stand at the beginning of a road and
      do not know whither it leads, it is presumptuous in me to point out a more
      direct way to its destination. Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 20-22—“In order
      to counterbalance the impressions which apparent disorder and immorality
      in nature make upon us, we have to assume that the universe at its root is
      not only rational, but good. This is faith, but it is an act on which our
      whole moral life depends.” Metaphysics, 165—“The same argument which would
      deny mind in nature denies mind in man.” Fisher, Nat. and Meth. of Rev.,
      264—“Fifty years ago, when the crane stood on top of the tower of
      unfinished Cologne Cathedral, was there no evidence of design in the whole
      structure?” Yet we concede that, so long as we cannot with John Stuart
      Mill explain the imperfections of the universe by any limitations in the
      Intelligence which contrived it, we are shut up to regarding them as
      intended to correspond with the moral state and probation of sinners which
      God foresaw and provided for at the creation. Evil things in the universe
      are symbols of sin, and helps to its overthrow. See Bowne, Review of H.
      Spencer, 264, 265; McCosh, Christ. and Positivism, 82 sq.; Martineau,
      Essays, 1:50, and Study, 1:351-398; Porter, Hum. Intellect, 599; Mivart,
      Lessons from Nature, 366-371; Princeton Rev., 1878:272-303; Shaw, on
      Positivism.

    2. Defects of the Teleological Argument. These attach not to the premises
    but to the conclusion sought to be drawn therefrom.
  </p>
  <p>
    A. The argument cannot prove a personal God. The order and useful
    collocations of the universe may be only the changing phenomena of an
    impersonal intelligence and will, such as pantheism supposes. The finality
    may be only immanent finality.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      There is such a thing as immanent and unconscious finality. National
      spirit, without set purpose, constructs language. The bee works
      unconsciously to ends. Strato of Lampsacus regarded the world as a vast
      animal. Aristotle, Phys., 2:8—“Plant the ship-builder&#x27;s skill within
      the timber itself, and you have the mode in which nature produces.” Here
      we see a dim anticipation of the modern doctrine of development from
      within instead of creation from without. Neander: “The divine work goes on
      from within outward.” John Fiske: “The argument from the watch has been
      superseded by the argument from the flower.” Iverach, Theism, 91—“The
      effect of evolution has been simply to transfer the cause from a mere
      external influence working from without to an immanent rational
      principle.” Martineau, Study, 1:349, 350—“Theism is in no way committed to
      the doctrine of a God external to the world ... nor does intelligence
      require, in order to gain an object, to give it externality.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Newman Smyth, Place of Death, 62-80—“The universe exists in some
      all-pervasive Intelligence. Suppose we could see a small heap of brick,
      scraps of metal, and pieces of mortar, gradually shaping themselves into
      the walls and interior structure of a building, adding needed material as
      the work advanced, and at last presenting in its completion a factory
      furnished with varied and finely wrought machinery. Or, a locomotive
      carrying a process of self-repair to compensate for wear, growing and
      increasing in size, detaching from itself at intervals pieces of brass or
      iron endowed with the power of growing up step by step into other
      locomotives capable of running themselves and of reproducing new
      locomotives in their turn.” So nature in its separate parts may seem
      mechanical, but as a whole it is rational. Weismann does not “disown a
      directive power,”—only this power is “behind the mechanism as its final
      cause ... it must be teleological.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressive as are these evidences of intelligence in the universe as a
      whole, and increased in number as they are by the new light of evolution,
      we must still hold that nature alone cannot prove that this intelligence
      is personal. Hopkins, Miscellanies, 18-36—“So long as there is such a
      thing as impersonal and adapting intelligence in the brute creation, we
      cannot necessarily infer from unchanging laws a free and personal God.”
      See Fisher, Supernat. Origin of Christianity, 576-578. Kant shows that the
      argument does not prove intelligence apart from the world (Critique, 370).
      We must bring mind to the world, if we would find mind in it. Leave out
      man, and nature cannot be properly interpreted: the intelligence and will
      in nature may still be unconscious. But, taking in man, we are bound to
      get our idea of the intelligence and will in nature from the highest type
      of intelligence and will we know, and that is man&#x27;s. “Nullus in
      microcosmo spiritus, nullus in macrocosmo Deus.” “We receive but what we
      give, And in our life alone does Nature live.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Teleological Argument therefore needs to be supplemented by the
      Anthropological Argument, or the argument from the mental and moral
      constitution of man. By itself, it does not prove a Creator. See
      Calderwood, Moral Philosophy, 26; Ritter, Hist. Anc. Philos., bk. 9, chap.
      6; Foundations of our Faith, 38; Murphy, Scientific Bases, 215; Habit and
      Intelligence, 2:6, and chap. 27. On immanent finality, see Janet, Final
      Causes, 345-415; Diman, Theistic Argument, 201-203. Since righteousness
      belongs only to personality, this argument cannot prove righteousness in
      God. Flint, Theism, 66—“Power and Intelligence alone do not constitute
      God, though they be infinite. A being may have these, and, if lacking
      righteousness, may be a devil.” Here again we see the need of the
      Anthropological Argument to supplement this.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    B. Even if this argument could prove personality in the intelligence and
    will that originated the order of the universe, it could not prove either
    the unity, the eternity, or the infinity of God; not the unity—for the
    useful collocations of the universe might be the result of oneness of
    counsel, instead of oneness of essence, in the contriving intelligence; not
    the eternity—for a created demiurge might conceivably have designed the
    universe; not the infinity—since all marks of order and collocation within
    our observation are simply finite.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Diman asserts (Theistic Argument, 114) that all the phenomena of the
      universe must be due to the same source—since all alike are subject to the
      same method of sequence, e. g., gravitation—and that the evidence points
      us irresistibly to some one explanatory cause. We can regard this
      assertion only as the utterance of a primitive belief in a first cause,
      not as the conclusion of logical demonstration, for we know only an
      infinitesimal part of the universe. From the point of view of the
      intuition of an Absolute Reason, however, we can cordially assent to the
      words of F. L. Patton: “When we consider Matthew Arnold&#x27;s ‘stream of
      tendency,’ Spencer&#x27;s ‘unknowable,’ Schopenhauer&#x27;s ‘world as
      will,’ and Hartmann&#x27;s elaborate defence of finality as the product of
      unconscious intelligence, we may well ask if the theists, with their
      belief in one personal God, are not in possession of the only hypothesis
      that can save the language of these writers from the charge of meaningless
      and idiotic raving” (Journ. Christ. Philos., April, 1883:283-307).
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient world, which had only the light of nature, believed in many
      gods. William James, Will to Believe, 44—“If there be a divine Spirit of
      the universe, nature, such as we know her, cannot possibly be its ultimate
      word to man. Either there is no spirit revealed in nature, or else it is
      inadequately revealed there; and (as all the higher religions have
      assumed) what we call visible nature, or this world, must be but a veil
      and surface-show whose full meaning resides in a supplementary unseen, or
      other world.” Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge, 234—“But is not
      intelligence itself the mystery of mysteries?... No doubt, intellect is a
      great mystery.... But there is a choice in mysteries. Some mysteries leave
      other things clear, and some leave things as dark and impenetrable as
      ever. The former is the case with the mystery of intelligence. It makes
      possible the comprehension of everything but itself.”

    3. The value of the Teleological Argument is simply this,—it proves from
    certain useful collocations and instances of order which have clearly had a
    beginning, or in other words, from the present harmony of the universe, that
    there exists an intelligence and will adequate to its contrivance. But
    whether this intelligence and will is personal or impersonal, creator or
    only fashioner, one or many, finite or infinite, eternal or owing its being
    to another, necessary or free, this argument cannot assure us.

    In it, however, we take a step forward. The causative power which we have
    proved by the Cosmological Argument has now become an intelligent and
    voluntary power.

      John Stuart Mill, Three Essays on Theism, 168-170—“In the present state of
      our knowledge, the adaptations in nature afford a large balance of
      probability in favor of causation by intelligence.” Ladd holds that,
      whenever one being acts upon its like, each being undergoes changes of
      state that belong to its own nature under the circumstances. Action of one
      body on another never consists in transferring the state of one being to
      another. Therefore there is no more difficulty in beings that are unlike
      acting on one another than in beings that are like. We do not transfer
      ideas to other minds,—we only rouse them to develop their own ideas. So
      force also is positively not transferable. Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 49,
      begins with “the conception of things interacting according to law and
      forming an intelligible system. Such a system cannot be construed by
      thought without the assumption of a unitary being which is the fundamental
      reality of the system. 53—No passage of influences or forces will avail to
      bridge the gulf, so long as the things are regarded as independent. 56—The
      system itself cannot explain this interaction, for the system is only the
      members of it. There must be some being in them which is their reality,
      and of which they are in some sense phases or manifestations. In other
      words, there must be a basal monism.”All this is substantially the view of
      Lotze, of whose philosophy see criticism in Stählin&#x27;s Kant, Lotze,
      and Ritschl, 116-156, and especially 123. Falckenberg, Gesch. der neueren
      Philosophie, 454, shows as to Lotze&#x27;s view that his assumption of
      monistic unity and continuity does not explain how change of condition in
      one thing should, as equalization or compensation, follow change of
      condition in another thing. Lotze explains this actuality by the ethical
      conception of an all-embracing Person. On the whole argument, see Bib.
      Sac., 1849:634; Murphy, Sci. Bases, 216; Flint, Theism, 131-210;
      Pfleiderer, Die Religion, 1:164-174; W. R. Benedict, on Theism and
      Evolution, in Andover Rev., 1886:307-350, 607-622.
