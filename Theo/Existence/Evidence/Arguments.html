  <h1>II. Evidences Of God's Existence</h1>
  <h2>Arguments</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    Although the knowledge of God&#x27;s existence is intuitive, it may be
    explicated and confirmed by arguments drawn from the actual universe and
    from the abstract ideas of the human mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remark 1. These arguments are probable, not demonstrative. For this reason
    they supplement each other, and constitute a series of evidences which is
    cumulative in its nature. Though, taken singly, none of them can be
    considered absolutely decisive, they together furnish a corroboration of our
    primitive conviction of God&#x27;s existence, which is of great practical
    value, and is in itself sufficient to bind the moral action of men.

      Butler, Analogy, Introd., Bohn&#x27;s ed., 72—Probable evidence admits of
      degrees, from the highest moral certainty to the lowest presumption. Yet
      probability is the guide of life. In matters of morals and religion, we
      are not to expect mathematical or demonstrative, but only probable,
      evidence, and the slightest preponderance of such evidence may be
      sufficient to bind our moral action. The truth of our religion, like the
      truth of common matters, is to be judged by the whole evidence taken
      together; for probable proofs, by being added, not only increase the
      evidence, but multiply it. Dove, Logic of Christ. Faith, 24—Value of the
      arguments taken together is much greater than that of any single one.
      Illustrated from water, air and food, together but not separately,
      supporting life; value of £1000 note, not in paper, stamp, writing,
      signature, taken separately. A whole bundle of rods cannot be broken,
      though each rod in the bundle may be broken separately. The strength of
      the bundle is the strength of the whole. Lord Bacon, Essay on Atheism: “A
      little philosophy inclineth man&#x27;s mind to atheism, but depth in
      philosophy bringeth men&#x27;s minds about to religion. For while the mind
      of man looketh upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest in them
      and go no further, but, when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate
      and linked together, it must needs fly to Providence and Deity.” Murphy,
      Scientific Bases of Faith, 221-223—“The proof of a God and of a spiritual
      world which is to satisfy us must consist in a number of different but
      converging lines of proof.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a case where only circumstantial evidence is attainable, many lines of
      proof sometimes converge, and though no one of the lines reaches the mark,
      the conclusion to which they all point becomes the only rational one. To
      doubt that there is a London, or that there was a Napoleon, would indicate
      insanity; yet London and Napoleon are proved by only probable evidence.
      There is no constraining efficacy in the arguments for God&#x27;s
      existence; but the same can be said of all reasoning that is not
      demonstrative. Another interpretation of the facts is possible, but no
      other conclusion is so satisfactory, as that God is; see Fisher, Nature
      and Method of Revelation, 129. Prof. Rogers: “If in practical affairs we
      were to hesitate to act until we had absolute and demonstrative certainty,
      we should never begin to move at all.” For this reason an old Indian
      official advised a young Indian judge “always to give his verdict, but
      always to avoid giving the grounds of it.”

      Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 11-14—“Instead of doubting everything that can
      be doubted, let us rather doubt nothing until we are compelled to
      doubt.... In society we get on better by assuming that men are truthful,
      and by doubting only for special reasons, than we should if we assumed
      that all men are liars, and believed them only when compelled. So in all
      our investigations we make more progress if we assume the truthfulness of
      the universe and of our own nature than we should if we doubted both....
      The first method seems the more rigorous, but it can be applied only to
      mathematics, which is a purely subjective science. When we come to deal
      with reality, the method brings thought to a standstill.... The law the
      logician lays down is this: Nothing may be believed which is not proved.
      The law the mind actually follows is this: Whatever the mind demands for
      the satisfaction of its subjective interests and tendencies may be assumed
      as real, in default of positive disproof.”

    Remark 2. A consideration of these arguments may also serve to explicate the
    contents of an intuition which has remained obscure and only half conscious
    for lack of reflection. The arguments, indeed, are the efforts of the mind
    that already has a conviction of God&#x27;s existence to give to itself a
    formal account of its belief. An exact estimate of their logical value and
    of their relation to the intuition which they seek to express in syllogistic
    form, is essential to any proper refutation of the prevalent atheistic and
    pantheistic reasoning.

      Diman, Theistic Argument, 363—“Nor have I claimed that the existence,
      even, of this Being can be demonstrated as we demonstrate the abstract
      truths of science. I have only claimed that the universe, as a great fact,
      demands a rational explanation, and that the most rational explanation
      that can possibly be given is that furnished in the conception of such a
      Being. In this conclusion reason rests, and refuses to rest in any other.”
      Rückert: “Wer Gott nicht fühlt in sich und allen Lebenskreisen, Dem werdet
      ihr nicht ihn beweisen mit Beweisen.” Harris, Philos. Basis of Theism,
      307—“Theology depends on noetic and empirical science to give the occasion
      on which the idea of the Absolute Being arises, and to give content to the
      idea.” Andrew Fuller, Part of Syst. of Divin., 4:283, questions “whether
      argumentation in favor of the existence of God has not made more sceptics
      than believers.” So far as this is true, it is due to an overstatement of
      the arguments and an exaggerated notion of what is to be expected from
      them. See Nitzsch, Christian Doctrine, translation, 140; Ebrard, Dogmatik,
      1:119, 120; Fisher, Essays on Supernatural Origin of Christianity, 572,
      573; Van Oosterzee, 238, 241.

      “Evidences of Christianity?” said Coleridge, “I am weary of the word.” The
      more Christianity was proved, the less it was believed. The revival of
      religion under Whitefield and Wesley did what all the apologists of the
      eighteenth century could not do,—it quickened men&#x27;s intuitions into
      life, and made them practically recognize God. Martineau, Types, 2:231—Men
      can “bow the knee to the passing Zeitgeist, while turning the back to the
      consensus of all the ages”; Seat of Authority, 312—“Our reasonings lead to
      explicit Theism because they start from implicit Theism.” Illingworth,
      Div. and Hum. Personality, 81—“The proofs are ... attempts to account for
      and explain and justify something that already exists; to decompose a
      highly complex though immediate judgment into its constituent elements,
      none of which when isolated can have the completeness or the cogency of
      the original conviction taken as a whole.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 31, 32—“Demonstration is only a makeshift for
      helping ignorance to insight.... When we come to an argument in which the
      whole nature is addressed, the argument must seem weak or strong,
      according as the nature is feebly, or fully, developed. The moral argument
      for theism cannot seem strong to one without a conscience. The argument
      from cognitive interests will be empty when there is no cognitive
      interest. Little souls find very little that calls for explanation or that
      excites surprise, and they are satisfied with a correspondingly small view
      of life and existence. In such a case we cannot hope for universal
      agreement. We can only proclaim the faith that is in us, in hope that this
      proclamation may not be without some response in other minds and
      hearts.... We have only probable evidence for the uniformity of nature or
      for the affection of friends. We cannot logically prove either. The
      deepest convictions are not the certainties of logic, but the certainties
      of life.”

    Remark 3. The arguments for the divine existence may be reduced to four,
    namely: I. The Cosmological; II. The Teleological; III. The Anthropological;
    and IV. The Ontological. We shall examine these in order, seeking first to
    determine the precise conclusions to which they respectively lead, and then
    to ascertain in what manner the four may be combined.
