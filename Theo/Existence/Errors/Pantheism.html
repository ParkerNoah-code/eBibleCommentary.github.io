  <h1>III. Erroneous Explanations</h1>
  <h2>Idealistic Pantheism</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    Pantheism is that method of thought which conceives of the universe as the
    development of one intelligent and voluntary, yet impersonal, substance,
    which reaches consciousness only in man. It therefore identifies God, not
    with each individual object in the universe, but with the totality of
    things. The current Pantheism of our day is idealistic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The elements of truth in Pantheism are the intelligence and voluntariness of
    God, and his immanence in the universe; its error lies in denying God&#x27;s
    personality and transcendence.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Pantheism denies the real existence of the finite, at the same time that
      it deprives the Infinite of self-consciousness and freedom. See Hunt,
      History of Pantheism; Manning, Half-truths and the Truth; Bayne, Christian
      Life, Social and Individual, 21-53; Hutton, on Popular Pantheism, in
      Essays, 1:55-76—“The pantheist&#x27;s ‘I believe in God’, is a
      contradiction. He says: ‘I perceive the external as different from myself;
      but on further reflection, I perceive that this external was itself the
      percipient agency.’ So the worshiped is really the worshiper after all.”
      Harris, Philosophical Basis of Theism, 173—“Man is a bottle of the
      ocean&#x27;s water, in the ocean, temporarily distinguishable by its
      limitation within the bottle, but lost again in the ocean, so soon as
      these fragile limits are broken.” Martineau, Types, 1:23—Mere immanency
      excludes Theism; transcendency leaves it still possible; 211-225—Pantheism
      declares that “there is nothing but God; he is not only sole cause but
      entire effect; he is all in all.” Spinoza has been falsely called “the
      God-intoxicated man.” “Spinoza, on the contrary, translated God into the
      universe; it was Malebranche who transfigured the universe into God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The later Brahmanism is pantheistic. Rowland Williams, Christianity and
      Hinduism, quoted in Mozley on Miracles, 284—“In the final state
      personality vanishes. You will not, says the Brahman, accept the term
      ‘void’ as an adequate description of the mysterious nature of the soul,
      but you will clearly apprehend soul, in the final state, to be unseen and
      ungrasped being, thought, knowledge, joy—no other than very God.”Flint,
      Theism, 69—“Where the will is without energy, and rest is longed for as
      the end of existence, as among the Hindus, there is marked inability to
      think of God as cause or will, and constant inveterate tendency to
      pantheism.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hegel denies God&#x27;s transcendence: “God is not a spirit beyond the
      stars; he is spirit in all spirit”; which means that God, the impersonal
      and unconscious Absolute, comes to consciousness only in man. If the
      eternal system of abstract thoughts were itself conscious, finite
      consciousness would disappear; hence the alternative is either no God, or
      no man. Stirling: “The Idea, so conceived, is a blind, dumb, invisible
      idol, and the theory is the most hopeless theory that has ever been
      presented to humanity.” It is practical autolatry, or self-deification.
      The world is reduced to a mere process of logic; thought thinks; there is
      thought without a thinker. To this doctrine of Hegel we may well oppose
      the remarks of Lotze: “We cannot make mind the equivalent of the
      infinitive to think,—we feel that it must be that which thinks; the
      essence of things cannot be either existence or activity,—it must be that
      which exists and that which acts. Thinking means nothing, if it is not the
      thinking of a thinker; acting and working mean nothing, if we leave out
      the conception of a subject distinguishable from them and from which they
      proceed.” To Hegel, Being is Thought; to Spinoza, Being has Thought +
      Extension; the truth seems to be that Being has Thought + Will, and may
      reveal itself in Extension and Evolution (Creation).
    </p>
    <p>
      By other philosophers, however, Hegel is otherwise interpreted. Prof. H.
      Jones, in Mind, July, 1893: 289-306, claims that Hegel&#x27;s fundamental
      Idea is not Thought, but Thinking: “The universe to him was not a system
      of thoughts, but a thinking reality, manifested most fully in man.... The
      fundamental reality is the universal intelligence whose operation we
      should seek to detect in all things. All reality is ultimately explicable
      as Spirit, or Intelligence,—hence our ontology must be a Logic, and the
      laws of things must be laws of thinking.” Sterrett, in like manner, in his
      Studies in Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Religion, 17, quotes Hegel&#x27;s
      Logic, Wallace&#x27;s translation, 89, 91, 236: “Spinoza&#x27;s Substance
      is, as it were, a dark, shapeless abyss, which devours all definite
      content as utterly null, and produces from itself nothing that has
      positive subsistence in itself.... God is Substance,—he is, however, no
      less the Absolute Person.” This is essential to religion, but this, says
      Hegel, Spinoza never perceived: “Everything depends upon the Absolute
      Truth being perceived, not merely as Substance, but as Subject.”God is
      self-conscious and self-determining Spirit. Necessity is excluded. Man is
      free and immortal. Men are not mechanical parts of God, nor do they lose
      their identity, although they find themselves truly only in him. With this
      estimate of Hegel&#x27;s system, Caird, Erdmann and Mulford substantially
      agree. This is Tennyson&#x27;s “Higher Pantheism.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth, Ethical Principles, 440—“Hegel conceived the superiority of his
      system to Spinozism to lie in the substitution of Subject for Substance.
      The true Absolute must contain, instead of abolishing, relations; the true
      Monism must include, instead of excluding, Pluralism. A One which, like
      Spinoza&#x27;s Substance, or the Hegelian Absolute, does not enable us to
      think the Many, cannot be the true One—the unity of the Manifold.... Since
      evil exists, Schopenhauer substituted for Hegel&#x27;s Panlogism, which
      asserted the identity of the rational and the real, a blind impulse of
      life,—for absolute Reason he substituted a reasonless Will”—a system of
      practical pessimism. Alexander, Theories of Will, 5—“Spinoza recognized no
      distinction between will and intellectual affirmation or denial.” John
      Caird, Fund. Ideas of Christianity, 1:107—“As there is no reason in the
      conception of pure space why any figures or forms, lines, surfaces,
      solids, should arise in it, so there is no reason in the pure colorless
      abstraction of Infinite Substance why any world of finite things and
      beings should ever come into existence. It is the grave of all things, the
      productive source of nothing.” Hegel called Schelling&#x27;s Identity or
      Absolute “the infinite night in which all cows are black”—an allusion to
      Goethe&#x27;s Faust, part 2, act 1, where the words are added: “and cats
      are gray.”Although Hegel&#x27;s preference of the term Subject, instead of
      the term Substance, has led many to maintain that he believed in a
      personality of God distinct from that of man, his over-emphasis of the
      Idea, and his comparative ignoring of the elements of Love and Will, leave
      it still doubtful whether his Idea was anything more than unconscious and
      impersonal intelligence—less materialistic than that of Spinoza indeed,
      yet open to many of the same objections.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>We object to this system as follows:</p>
  <p>
    1. Its idea of God is self-contradictory, since it makes him infinite, yet
    consisting only of the finite; absolute, yet existing in necessary relation
    to the universe; supreme, yet shut up to a process of self-evolution and
    dependent for self-consciousness on man; without self-determination, yet the
    cause of all that is.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Saisset, Pantheism, 148—“An imperfect God, yet perfection arising from
      imperfection.”Shedd, Hist. Doctrine, 1:13—“Pantheism applies to God a
      principle of growth and imperfection, which belongs only to the finite.”
      Calderwood, Moral Philos., 245—“Its first requisite is moment, or
      movement, which it assumes, but does not account for.” Caro&#x27;s sarcasm
      applies here: “Your God is not yet made—he is in process of manufacture.”
      See H. B. Smith, Faith and Philosophy, 25. Pantheism is practical atheism,
      for impersonal spirit is only blind and necessary force. Angelus Silesius:
      “Wir beten ‘Es gescheh, mein Herr und Gott, dein Wille’; Und sieh&#x27;,
      Er hat nicht Will&#x27;,—Er ist ein ew&#x27;ge Stille”—which Max Müller
      translates as follows: “We pray, ‘O Lord our God, Do thou thy holy Will’;
      and see! God has no will; He is at peace and still.”Angelus Silesius
      consistently makes God dependent for self-consciousness on man: “I know
      that God cannot live An instant without me; He must give up the ghost, If
      I should cease to be.” Seth, Hegelianism and Personality: “Hegelianism
      destroys both God and man. It reduces man to an object of the universal
      Thinker, and leaves this universal Thinker without any true personality.”
      Pantheism is a game of solitaire, in which God plays both sides.

    2. Its assumed unity of substance is not only without proof, but it directly
    contradicts our intuitive judgments. These testify that we are not parts and
    particles of God, but distinct personal subsistences.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Martineau, Essays, 1:158—“Even for immanency, there must be something
      wherein to dwell, and for life, something whereon to act.” Many systems of
      monism contradict consciousness; they confound harmony between two with
      absorption in one. “In Scripture we never find the universe called τὸ πᾶν,
      for this suggests the idea of a self-contained unity: we have everywhere
      τὰ πάντα instead.” The Bible recognizes the element of truth in
      pantheism—God is “through all”; also the element of truth in mysticism—God
      is “in you all”; but it adds the element of transcendence which both these
      fail to recognize—God is “above all” (Eph. 4:6). See Fisher, Essays on
      Supernat. Orig. of Christianity, 539. G. D. B. Pepper: “He who is over all
      and in all is yet distinct from all. If one is over a thing, he is not
      that very thing which he is over. If one is in something, he must be
      distinct from that something. And so the universe, over which and in which
      God is, must be thought of as something distinct from God. The creation
      cannot be identical with God, or a mere form of God.” We add, however,
      that it may be a manifestation of God and dependent upon God, as our
      thoughts and acts are manifestations of our mind and will and dependent
      upon our mind and will, yet are not themselves our mind and will.
    </p>

      Pope wrote: “All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body nature
      is and God the soul.” But Case, Physical Realism, 193, replies: “Not so.
      Nature is to God as works are to a man; and as man&#x27;s works are not
      his body, so neither is nature the body of God.” Matthew Arnold, On
      Heine&#x27;s Grave: “What are we all but a mood, A single mood of the life
      Of the Being in whom we exist, Who alone is all things in one?” Hovey,
      Studies, 51—“Scripture recognizes the element of truth in pantheism, but
      it also teaches the existence of a world of things, animate and inanimate,
      in distinction from God. It represents men as prone to worship the
      creature more than the Creator. It describes them as sinners worthy of
      death ... moral agents.... It no more thinks of men as being literally
      parts of God, than it thinks of children as being parts of their parents,
      or subjects as being parts of their king.” A. J. F. Behrends: “The true
      doctrine lies between the two extremes of a crass dualism which makes God
      and the world two self-contained entities, and a substantial monism in
      which the universe has only a phenomenal existence. There is no identity
      of substance nor division of the divine substance. The universe is
      eternally dependent, the product of the divine Word, not simply
      manufactured. Creation is primarily a spiritual act.” Prof. George M.
      Forbes: “Matter exists in subordinate dependence upon God; spirit in
      coördinate dependence upon God. The body of Christ was Christ
      externalized, made manifest to sense-perception. In apprehending matter, I
      am apprehending the mind and will of God. This is the highest sort of
      reality. Neither matter nor finite spirits, then, are mere phenomena.”

    3. It assigns no sufficient cause for that fact of the universe which is
    highest in rank, and therefore most needs explanation, namely, the existence
    of personal intelligences. A substance which is itself unconscious, and
    under the law of necessity, cannot produce beings who are self-conscious and
    free.

      Gess, Foundations of our Faith, 36—“Animal instinct, and the spirit of a
      nation working out its language, might furnish analogies, if they produced
      personalities as their result, but not otherwise. Nor were these
      tendencies self-originated, but received from an external source.” McCosh,
      Intuitions, 215, 393, and Christianity and Positivism, 180. Seth, Freedom
      as an Ethical Postulate, 47—“If man is an ‘imperium in imperio,’ not a
      person, but only an aspect or expression of the universe or God, then he
      cannot be free. Man may be depersonalized either into nature or into God.
      Through the conception of our own personality we reach that of God. To
      resolve our personality into that of God would be to negate the divine
      greatness itself by invalidating the conception through which it was
      reached.” Bradley, Appearance and Reality, 551, is more ambiguous: “The
      positive relation of every appearance as an adjective to Reality; and the
      presence of Reality among its appearances in different degrees and with
      diverse values; this double truth we have found to be the centre of
      philosophy.” He protests against both “an empty transcendence” and “a
      shallow pantheism.” Hegelian immanence and knowledge, he asserts,
      identified God and man. But God is more than man or man&#x27;s thought. He
      is spirit and life—best understood from the human self, with its thoughts,
      feelings, volitions. Immanence needs to be qualified by transcendence.
      “God is not God till he has become all-in-all, and a God which is
      all-in-all is not the God of religion. God is an aspect, and that must
      mean but an appearance of the Absolute.”Bradley&#x27;s Absolute,
      therefore, is not so much personal as super-personal; to which we reply
      with Jackson, James Martineau, 416—“Higher than personality is lower;
      beyond it is regression from its height. From the equator we may travel
      northward, gaining ever higher and higher latitudes; but, if ever the pole
      is reached, pressing on from thence will be descending into lower
      latitudes, not gaining higher.... Do I say, I am a pantheist? Then, ipso
      facto, I deny pantheism; for, in the very assertion of the Ego, I imply
      all else as objective to me.”
    </p>

  <p>
    4. It therefore contradicts the affirmations of our moral and religious
    natures by denying man&#x27;s freedom and responsibility; by making God to
    include in himself all evil as well as all good; and by precluding all
    prayer, worship, and hope of immortality.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Conscience is the eternal witness against pantheism. Conscience witnesses
      to our freedom and responsibility, and declares that moral distinctions
      are not illusory. Renouf, Hibbert Lect., 234—“It is only out of
      condescension to popular language that pantheistic systems can recognize
      the notions of right and wrong, of iniquity and sin. If everything really
      emanates from God, there can be no such thing as sin. And the ablest
      philosophers who have been led to pantheistic views have vainly endeavored
      to harmonize these views with what we understand by the notion of sin or
      moral evil. The great systematic work of Spinoza is entitled
      &#x27;Ethica&#x27;; but for real ethics we might as profitably consult the
      Elements of Euclid.” Hodge, System. Theology, 1:299-330—“Pantheism is
      fatalistic. On this theory, duty = pleasure; right = might; sin = good in
      the making. Satan, as well as Gabriel, is a self-development of God. The
      practical effects of pantheism upon popular morals and life, wherever it
      has prevailed, as in Buddhist India and China, demonstrate its falsehood.”
      See also Dove, Logic of the Christian Faith, 118; Murphy, Scientific Bases
      of Faith, 202; Bib. Sac., Oct. 1867:603-615; Dix, Pantheism, Introd., 12.
      On the fact of sin as refuting the pantheistic theory, see Bushnell,
      Nature and the Supernat., 140-164.

      Wordsworth: “Look up to heaven! the industrious sun Already half his
      course hath run; He cannot halt or go astray; But our immortal spirits
      may.” President John H. Harris; “You never ask a cyclone&#x27;s opinion of
      the ten commandments.” Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 245—“Pantheism makes man
      an automaton. But how can an automaton have duties?” Principles of Ethics,
      18—“Ethics is defined as the science of conduct, and the conventions of
      language are relied upon to cover up the fact that there is no ‘conduct’
      in the case. If man be a proper automaton, we might as well speak of the
      conduct of the winds as of human conduct; and a treatise on planetary
      motions is as truly the ethics of the solar system as a treatise on human
      movements is the ethics of man.” For lack of a clear recognition of
      personality, either human or divine, Hegel&#x27;s Ethics is devoid of all
      spiritual nourishment,—his “Rechtsphilosophie”has been called “a repast of
      bran.” Yet Professor Jones, in Mind, July, 1893:304, tells us that
      Hegel&#x27;s task was “to discover what conception of the single principle
      or fundamental unity which alone is, is adequate to the differences which
      it carries within it. ‘Being,’ he found, leaves no room for
      differences,—it is overpowered by them.... He found that the Reality can
      exist only as absolute Self-consciousness, as a Spirit, who is universal,
      and who knows himself in all things. In all this he is dealing, not simply
      with thoughts, but with Reality.” Prof. Jones&#x27;s vindication of Hegel,
      however, still leaves it undecided whether that philosopher regarded the
      divine self-consciousness as distinct from that of finite beings, or as
      simply inclusive of theirs. See John Caird, Fund. Ideas of Christianity,
      1:109.

    5. Our intuitive conviction of the existence of a God of absolute perfection
    compels us to conceive of God as possessed of every highest quality and
    attribute of men, and therefore, especially, of that which constitutes the
    chief dignity of the human spirit, its personality.

      Diman, Theistic Argument, 328—“We have no right to represent the supreme
      Cause as inferior to ourselves, yet we do this when we describe it under
      phrases derived from physical causation.” Mivart, Lessons from Nature,
      351—“We cannot conceive of anything as impersonal, yet of higher nature
      than our own,—any being that has not knowledge and will must be
      indefinitely inferior to one who has them.” Lotze holds truly, not that
      God is supra-personal, but that man is infra-personal, seeing that in the
      infinite Being alone is self-subsistence, and therefore perfect
      personality. Knight, Essays in Philosophy, 224—“The radical feature of
      personality is the survival of a permanent self, under all the fleeting or
      deciduous phases of experience; in other words, the personal identity that
      is involved in the assertion ‘I am.’... Is limitation a necessary adjunct
      of that notion?” Seth, Hegelianism: “As in us there is more for ourselves
      than for others, so in God there is more of thought for himself than he
      manifests to us. Hegel&#x27;s doctrine is that of immanence without
      transcendence.” Heinrich Heine was a pupil and intimate friend of Hegel.
      He says: “I was young and proud, and it pleased my vain-glory when I
      learned from Hegel that the true God was not, as my grandmother believed,
      the God who lived in heaven, but was rather myself upon the earth.” John
      Fiske, Idea of God, xvi—“Since our notion of force is purely a
      generalization from our subjective sensations of overcoming resistance,
      there is scarcely less anthropomorphism in the phrase ‘Infinite Power’
      than in the phrase ‘Infinite Person.’ We must symbolize Deity in some form
      that has meaning to us; we cannot symbolize it as physical; we are bound
      to symbolize it as psychical. Hence we may say, God is Spirit. This
      implies God&#x27;s personality.”

    6. Its objection to the divine personality, that over against the Infinite
    there can be in eternity past no non-ego to call forth self-consciousness,
    is refuted by considering that even man&#x27;s cognition of the non-ego
    logically presupposes knowledge of the ego, from which the non-ego is
    distinguished; that, in an absolute mind, self-consciousness cannot be
    conditioned, as in the case of finite mind, upon contact with a not-self;
    and that, if the distinguishing of self from a not-self were an essential
    condition of divine self-consciousness, the eternal personal distinctions in
    the divine nature or the eternal states of the divine mind might furnish
    such a condition.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Pfleiderer, Die Religion, 1:163, 190 sq.—“Personal self-consciousness is
      not primarily a distinguishing of the ego from the non-ego, but rather a
      distinguishing of itself from itself, i. e., of the unity of the self from
      the plurality of its contents.... Before the soul distinguishes self from
      the not-self, it must know self—else it could not see the distinction. Its
      development is connected with the knowledge of the non-ego, but this is
      due, not to the fact of personality, but to the fact of finite
      personality. The mature man can live for a long time upon his own
      resources. God needs no other, to stir him up to mental activity.
      Finiteness is a hindrance to the development of our personality.
      Infiniteness is necessary to the highest personality.” Lotze, Microcosmos,
      vol. 3, chapter 4; transl. in N. Eng., March, 1881:191-200—“Finite spirit,
      not having conditions of existence in itself, can know the ego only upon
      occasion of knowing the non-ego. The Infinite is not so limited. He alone
      has an independent existence, neither introduced nor developed through
      anything not himself, but, in an inward activity without beginning or end,
      maintains himself in himself.” See also Lotze, Philos. of Religion, 55-69;
      H. N. Gardiner on Lotze, in Presb. Rev., 1885:669-673; Webb, in Jour.
      Theol. Studies, 2:49-61.

      Dorner, Glaubenslehre: “Absolute Personality = perfect consciousness of
      self, and perfect power over self. We need something external to waken our
      consciousness—yet self-consciousness comes [logically] before
      consciousness of the world. It is the soul&#x27;s act. Only after it has
      distinguished self from self, can it consciously distinguish self from
      another.” British Quarterly, Jan. 1874:32, note; July, 1884:108—“The ego
      is thinkable only in relation to the non-ego; but the ego is liveable long
      before any such relation.” Shedd, Dogm. Theol., 1:185, 186—In the
      pantheistic scheme, “God distinguishes himself from the world, and thereby
      finds the object required by the subject; ... in the Christian scheme, God
      distinguishes himself from himself, not from something that is not
      himself.” See Julius Müller, Doctrine of Sin, 2:122-126; Christlieb, Mod.

      On the whole subject of Pantheism, see Martineau, Study of Religion,
      2:141-194, esp. 192—“The personality of God consists in his voluntary
      agency as free cause in an unpledged sphere, that is, a sphere
      transcending that of immanent law. But precisely this also it is that
      constitutes his infinity, extending his sway, after it has filled the
      actual, over all the possible, and giving command over indefinite
      alternatives. Though you might deny his infinity without prejudice to his
      personality, you cannot deny his personality without sacrificing his
      infinitude: for there is a mode of action—the preferential, the very mode
      which distinguishes rational beings—from which you exclude him”; 341—“The
      metaphysicians who, in their impatience of distinction, insist on taking
      the sea on board the boat, swamp not only it but the thought it holds, and
      leave an infinitude which, as it can look into no eye and whisper into no
      ear, they contradict in the very act of affirming.” Jean Paul
      Richter&#x27;s “Dream”: “I wandered to the farthest verge of Creation, and
      there I saw a Socket, where an Eye should have been, and I heard the
      shriek of a Fatherless World” (quoted in David Brown&#x27;s Memoir of John
      Duncan, 49-70). Shelley, Beatrice Cenci: “Sweet Heaven, forgive weak
      thoughts! If there should be No God, no Heaven, no Earth, in the void
      world—The wide, grey, lampless, deep, unpeopled world!”

      For the opposite view, see Biedermann, Dogmatik, 638-647—“Only man, as
      finite spirit, is personal; God, as absolute spirit, is not personal. Yet
      in religion the mutual relations of intercourse and communion are always
      personal.... Personality is the only adequate term by which we can
      represent the theistic conception of God.” Bruce, Providential Order,
      76—“Schopenhauer does not level up cosmic force to the human, but levels
      down human will-force to the cosmic. Spinoza held intellect in God to be
      no more like man&#x27;s than the dog-star is like a dog. Hartmann added
      intellect to Schopenhauer&#x27;s will, but the intellect is unconscious
      and knows no moral distinctions.” See also Bruce, Apologetics, 71-90;
      Bowne, Philos. of Theism, 128-134, 171-186; J. M. Whiton, Am. Jour.
      Theol., Apl. 1901:306—Pantheism = God consists in all things; Theism = All
      things consist in God, their ground, not their sum. Spirit in man shows
      that the infinite Spirit must be personal and transcendent Mind and Will.
