  <h1>III. Erroneous Explanations</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>

<section>
  <p>
    Any correct explanation of the universe must postulate an intuitive
    knowledge of the existence of the external world, of self, and of God. The
    desire for scientific unity, however, has occasioned attempts to reduce
    these three factors to one, and according as one or another of the three has
    been regarded as the all-inclusive principle, the result has been
    Materialism, Materialistic Idealism, or Idealistic Pantheism. This
    scientific impulse is better satisfied by a system which we may designate as
    Ethical Monism.

      We may summarize the present chapter as follows: 1. Materialism: Universe
      = Atoms. Reply: Atoms can do nothing without force, and can be nothing
      (intelligible) without ideas. 2. Materialistic Idealism: Universe = Force
      + Ideas. Reply: Ideas belong to Mind, and Force can be exerted only by
      Will. 3. Idealistic Pantheism: Universe = Immanent and Impersonal Mind and
      Will. Reply: Spirit in man shows that the Infinite Spirit must be
      Transcendent and Personal Mind and Will. We are led from these three forms
      of error to a conclusion which we may denominate 4. Ethical Monism:
      Universe = Finite, partial, graded manifestation of the divine Life;
      Matter being God&#x27;s self-limitation under the law of necessity,
      Humanity being God&#x27;s self-limitation under the law of freedom,
      Incarnation and Atonement being God&#x27;s self-limitations under the law
      of grace. Metaphysical Monism, or the doctrine of one Substance,
      Principle, or Ground of Being, is consistent with Psychological Dualism,
      or the doctrine that the soul is personally distinct from matter on the
      one hand and from God on the other.
