  <h1>III. Erroneous Explanations</h1>
  <h2>Materialism</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    Materialism is that method of thought which gives priority to matter, rather
    than to mind, in its explanations of the universe. Upon this view, material
    atoms constitute the ultimate and fundamental reality of which all things,
    rational and irrational, are but combinations and phenomena. Force is
    regarded as a universal and inseparable property of matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The element of truth in materialism is the reality of the external world.
    Its error is in regarding the external world as having original and
    independent existence, and in regarding mind as its product.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Materialism regards atoms as the bricks of which the material universe,
      the house we inhabit, is built. Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)
      estimates that, if a drop of water were magnified to the size of our
      earth, the atoms of which it consists would certainly appear larger than
      boy&#x27;s marbles, and yet would be smaller than billiard balls. Of these
      atoms, all things, visible and invisible, are made. Mind, with all its
      activities, is a combination or phenomenon of atoms. “Man ist was er iszt:
      ohne Phosphor kein Gedanke”—“One is what he eats: without phosphorus, no
      thought.” Ethics is a bill of fare; and worship, like heat, is a mode of
      motion. Agassiz, however, wittily asked: “Are fishermen, then, more
      intelligent than farmers, because they eat so much fish, and therefore
      take in more phosphorus?”
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that much is here attributed to atoms which really belongs
      to force. Deprive atoms of force, and all that remains is extension, which
      = space = zero. Moreover, “if atoms are extended, they cannot be ultimate,
      for extension implies divisibility, and that which is conceivably
      divisible cannot be a philosophical ultimate. But, if atoms are not
      extended, then even an infinite multiplication and combination of them
      could not produce an extended substance. Furthermore, an atom that is
      neither extended substance nor thinking substance is inconceivable. The
      real ultimate is force, and this force cannot be exerted by nothing, but,
      as we shall hereafter see, can be exerted only by a personal Spirit, for
      this alone possesses the characteristics of reality, namely, definiteness,
      unity, and activity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only force but also intelligence must be attributed to atoms, before
      they can explain any operation of nature. Herschel says not only that “the
      force of gravitation seems like that of a universal will,” but that the
      atoms themselves, in recognizing each other in order to combine, show a
      great deal of “presence of mind.” Ladd, Introd. to Philosophy, 269—“A
      distinguished astronomer has said that every body in the solar system is
      behaving as if it knew precisely how it ought to behave in consistency
      with its own nature, and with the behavior of every other body in the same
      system.... Each atom has danced countless millions of miles, with
      countless millions of different partners, many of which required an
      important modification of its mode of motion, without ever departing from
      the correct step or the right time.” J. P. Cooke, Credentials of Science,
      104, 177, suggests that something more than atoms is needed to explain the
      universe. A correlating Intelligence and Will must be assumed. Atoms by
      themselves would be like a heap of loose nails which need to be magnetized
      if they are to hold together. All structures would be resolved, and all
      forms of matter would disappear, if the Presence which sustains them were
      withdrawn. The atom, like the monad of Leibnitz, is “parvus in suo genere
      deus”—“a little god in its nature”—only because it is the expression of
      the mind and will of an immanent God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plato speaks of men who are “dazzled by too near a look at material
      things.” They do not perceive that these very material things, since they
      can be interpreted only in terms of spirit, must themselves be essentially
      spiritual. Materialism is the explanation of a world of which we know
      something—the world of mind—by a world of which we know next to
      nothing—the world of matter. Upton, Hibbert Lectures, 297, 298—“How about
      your material atoms and brain-molecules? They have no real existence save
      as objects of thought, and therefore the very thought, which you say your
      atoms produce, turns out to be the essential precondition of their own
      existence.” With this agree the words of Dr. Ladd: “Knowledge of matter
      involves repeated activities of sensation and reflection, of inductive and
      deductive inference, of intuitional belief in substance. These are all
      activities of mind. Only as the mind has a self-conscious life, is any
      knowledge of what matter is, or can do, to be gained.... Everything is
      real which is the permanent subject of changing states. That which
      touches, feels, sees, is more real than that which is touched, felt,
      seen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      H. N. Gardner, Presb. Rev., 1885:301, 665, 666—“Mind gives to matter its
      chief meaning,—hence matter alone can never explain the universe.” Gore,
      Incarnation, 31—“Mind is not the product of nature, but the necessary
      constituent of nature, considered as an ordered knowable system.” Fraser,
      Philos. of Theism: “An immoral act must originate in the immoral agent; a
      physical effect is not known to originate in its physical cause.” Matter,
      inorganic and organic, presupposes mind; but it is not true that mind
      presupposes matter. LeConte: “If I could remove your brain cap, what would
      I see? Only physical changes. But you—what do you perceive? Consciousness,
      thought, emotion, will. Now take external nature, the Cosmos. The observer
      from the outside sees only physical phenomena. But must there not be in
      this case also—on the other side—psychical phenomena, a Self, a Person, a
      Will?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The impossibility of finding in matter, regarded as mere atoms, any of the
      attributes of a cause, has led to a general abandonment of this old
      Materialism of Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, Condillac, Holbach,
      Feuerbach, Büchner; and Materialistic Idealism has taken its place, which
      instead of regarding force as a property of matter, regards matter as a
      manifestation of force. From this section we therefore pass to
      Materialistic Idealism, and inquire whether the universe can be
      interpreted simply as a system of force and of ideas. A quarter of a
      century ago, John Tyndall, in his opening address as President of the
      British Association at Belfast, declared that in matter was to be found
      the promise and potency of every form of life. But in 1898, Sir William
      Crookes, in his address as President of that same British Association,
      reversed the apothegm, and declared that in life he saw the promise and
      potency of every form of matter. See Lange, History of Materialism; Janet,
      Materialism; Fabri, Materialismus; Herzog, Encyclopädie, art.:
      Materialismus; but esp., Stallo, Modern Physics, 148-170.

    In addition to the general error indicated above, we object to this system
    as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. In knowing matter, the mind necessarily judges itself to be different in
    kind, and higher in rank, than the matter which it knows.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      We here state simply an intuitive conviction. The mind, in using its
      physical organism and through it bringing external nature into its
      service, recognizes itself as different from and superior to matter. See
      Martineau, quoted in Brit. Quar., April, 1882:173, and the article of
      President Thomas Hill in the Bibliotheca Sacra, April, 1852:353—“All that
      is really given by the act of sense-perception is the existence of the
      conscious self, floating in boundless space and boundless time, surrounded
      and sustained by boundless power. The material moved, which we at first
      think the great reality, is only the shadow of a real being, which is
      immaterial.” Harris, Philos. Basis of Theism, 317—“Imagine an
      infinitesimal being in the brain, watching the action of the molecules,
      but missing the thought. So science observes the universe, but misses
      God.”Hebberd, in Journ. Spec. Philos., April, 1886:135.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Browning, “the subtlest assertor of the soul in song,” makes the
      Pope, in The Ring and the Book, say: “Mind is not matter, nor from matter,
      but above.” So President Francis Wayland: “What is mind?” “No matter.”
      “What is matter?” “Never mind.” Sully, The Human Mind,
      2:369—“Consciousness is a reality wholly disparate from material
      processes, and cannot therefore be resolved into these. Materialism makes
      that which is immediately known (our mental states) subordinate to that
      which is only indirectly or inferentially known (external things).
      Moreover, a material entity existing per se out of relation to a cogitant
      mind is an absurdity.” As materialists work out their theory, their
      so-called matter grows more and more ethereal, until at last a stage is
      reached when it cannot be distinguished from what others call spirit.
      Martineau: “The matter they describe is so exceedingly clever that it is
      up to anything, even to writing Hamlet and discovering its own evolution.
      In short, but for the spelling of its name, it does not seem to differ
      appreciably from our old friends, Mind and God.” A. W. Momerie, in
      Christianity and Evolution, 54—“A being conscious of his unity cannot
      possibly be formed out of a number of atoms unconscious of their
      diversity. Any one who thinks this possible is capable of asserting that
      half a dozen fools might be compounded into a single wise man.”

    2. Since the mind&#x27;s attributes of (a) continuous identity, (b)
    self-activity, (c) unrelatedness to space, are different in kind and higher
    in rank than the attributes of matter, it is rational to conclude that mind
    is itself different in kind from matter and higher in rank than matter.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      This is an argument from specific qualities to that which underlies and
      explains the qualities. (a) Memory proves personal identity. This is not
      an identity of material atoms, for atoms change. The molecules that come
      cannot remember those that depart. Some immutable part in the brain?
      organized or unorganized? Organized decays; unorganized = soul. (b)
      Inertia shows that matter is not self-moving. It acts only as it is acted
      upon. A single atom would never move. Two portions are necessary, and
      these, in order to useful action, require adjustment by a power which does
      not belong to matter. Evolution of the universe inexplicable, unless
      matter were first moved by some power outside itself. See Duke of Argyll,
      Reign of Law, 92. (c) The highest activities of mind are independent of
      known physical conditions. Mind controls and subdues the body. It does not
      cease to grow when the growth of the body ceases. When the body nears
      dissolution, the mind often asserts itself most strikingly.

      Kant: “Unity of apprehension is possible on account of the transcendental
      unity of self-consciousness.” I get my idea of unity from the indivisible
      self. Stout, Manual of Psychology, 53—“So far as matter exists
      independently of its presentation to a cognitive subject, it cannot have
      material properties, such as extension, hardness, color, weight, etc....
      The world of material phenomena presupposes a system of immaterial agency.
      In this immaterial system the individual consciousness originates. This
      agency, some say, is thought, others will.” A. J. Dubois, in Century
      Magazine, Dec. 1894:228—Since each thought involves a molecular movement
      in the brain, and this moves the whole universe, mind is the secret of the
      universe, and we should interpret nature as the expression of underlying
      purpose. Science is mind following the traces of mind. There can be no
      mind without antecedent mind. That all human beings have the same mental
      modes shows that these modes are not due simply to environment. Bowne:
      “Things act upon the mind and the mind reacts with knowledge. Knowing is
      not a passive receiving, but an active construing.” Wundt: “We are
      compelled to admit that the physical development is not the cause, but
      much more the effect, of psychical development.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Carus, Soul of Man, 52-64, defines soul as “the form of an organism,”
      and memory as “the psychical aspect of the preservation of form in living
      substance.” This seems to give priority to the organism rather than to the
      soul, regardless of the fact that without soul no organism is conceivable.
      Clay cannot be the ancestor of the potter, nor stone the ancestor of the
      mason, nor wood the ancestor of the carpenter. W. N. Clarke, Christian
      Theology, 99—“The intelligibleness of the universe to us is strong and
      ever present evidence that there is an all-pervading rational Mind, from
      which the universe received its character.” We must add to the maxim,
      “Cogito, ergo sum,” the other maxim, “Intelligo, ergo Deus est.”
      Pfleiderer, Philos. Relig., 1:273—“The whole idealistic philosophy of
      modern times is in fact only the carrying out and grounding of the
      conviction that Nature is ordered by Spirit and for Spirit, as a
      subservient means for its eternal ends; that it is therefore not, as the
      heathen naturalism thought, the one and all, the last and highest of
      things, but has the Spirit, and the moral Ends over it, as its Lord and
      Master.” The consciousness by which things are known precedes the things
      themselves, in the order of logic, and therefore cannot be explained by
      them or derived from them. See Porter, Human Intellect, 22, 131, 132.

    3. Mind rather than matter must therefore be regarded as the original and
    independent entity, unless it can be scientifically demonstrated that mind
    is material in its origin and nature. But all attempts to explain the
    psychical from the physical, or the organic from the inorganic, are
    acknowledged failures. The most that can be claimed is, that psychical are
    always accompanied by physical changes, and that the inorganic is the basis
    and support of the organic. Although the precise connection between the mind
    and the body is unknown, the fact that the continuity of physical changes is
    unbroken in times of psychical activity renders it certain that mind is not
    transformed physical force. If the facts of sensation indicate the
    dependence of mind upon body, the facts of volition equally indicate the
    dependence of body upon mind.
  </p>

      The chemist can produce organic, but not organized, substances. The life
      cannot be produced from matter. Even in living things progress is secured
      only by plan. Multiplication of desired advantage, in the Darwinian
      scheme, requires a selecting thought; in other words the natural selection
      is artificial selection after all. John Fiske, Destiny of the Creature,
      109—“Cerebral physiology tells us that, during the present life, although
      thought and feeling are always manifested in connection with a peculiar
      form of matter, yet by no possibility can thought and feeling be in any
      sense the product of matter. Nothing could be more grossly unscientific
      than the famous remark of Cabanis, that the brain secretes thought as the
      liver secretes bile. It is not even correct to say that thought goes on in
      the brain. What goes on in the brain is an amazingly complex series of
      molecular movements, with which thought and feeling are in some unknown
      way correlated, not as effects or as causes, but as concomitants.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Leibnitz&#x27;s “preëstablished harmony” indicates the difficulty of
      defining the relation between mind and matter. They are like two entirely
      disconnected clocks, the one of which has a dial and indicates the hour by
      its hands, while the other without a dial simultaneously indicates the
      same hour by its striking apparatus. To Leibnitz the world is an aggregate
      of atomic souls leading absolutely separate lives. There is no real action
      of one upon another. Everything in the monad is the development of its
      individual unstimulated activity. Yet there is a preëstablished harmony of
      them all, arranged from the beginning by the Creator. The internal
      development of each monad is so adjusted to that of all the other monads,
      as to produce the false impression that they are mutually influenced by
      each other (see Johnson, in Andover Rev., Apl. 1890:407, 408).
      Leibnitz&#x27;s theory involves the complete rejection of the freedom of
      the human will in the libertarian sense. To escape from this arbitrary
      connection of mind and matter in Leibnitz&#x27;s preëstablished harmony,
      Spinoza rejected the Cartesian doctrine of two God-created substances, and
      maintained that there is but one fundamental substance, namely, God
      himself (see Upton, Hibbert Lectures, 172).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an increased flow of blood to the head in times of mental
      activity. Sometimes, in intense heat of literary composition, the blood
      fairly surges through the brain. No diminution, but further increase, of
      physical activity accompanies the greatest efforts of mind. Lay a man upon
      a balance; fire a pistol shot or inject suddenly a great thought into his
      mind; at once he will tip the balance, and tumble upon his head. Romanes,
      Mind and Motion, 21—“Consciousness causes physical changes, but not vice
      versa. To say that mind is a function of motion is to say that mind is a
      function of itself, since motion exists only for mind. Better suppose the
      physical and the psychical to be only one, as in the violin sound and
      vibration are one. Volition is a cause in nature because it has
      cerebration for its obverse and inseparable side. But if there is no
      motion without mind, then there can be no universe without God.”...
      34—“Because within the limits of human experience mind is only known as
      associated with brain, it does not follow that mind cannot exist without
      brain. Helmholtz&#x27;s explanation of the effect of one of
      Beethoven&#x27;s sonatas on the brain may be perfectly correct, but the
      explanation of the effect given by a musician may be equally correct
      within its category.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Spencer, Principles of Psychology, 1:§ 56—“Two things, mind and
      nervous action, exist together, but we cannot imagine how they are
      related” (see review of Spencer&#x27;s Psychology, in N. Englander, July,
      1873). Tyndall, Fragments of Science, 120—“The passage from the physics of
      the brain to the facts of consciousness is unthinkable.” Schurman,
      Agnosticism and Religion, 95—“The metamorphosis of vibrations into
      conscious ideas is a miracle, in comparison with which the floating of
      iron or the turning of water into wine is easily credible.” Bain, Mind and
      Body, 131—There is no break in the physical continuity. See Brit. Quar.,
      Jan. 1874; art. by Herbert, on Mind and the Science of Energy; McCosh,
      Intuitions, 145; Talbot, in Bap. Quar., Jan. 1871. On Geulincx&#x27;s

    4. The materialistic theory, denying as it does the priority of spirit, can
    furnish no sufficient cause for the highest features of the existing
    universe, namely, its personal intelligences, its intuitive ideas, its
    free-will, its moral progress, its beliefs in God and immortality.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Herbert, Modern Realism Examined: “Materialism has no physical evidence of
      the existence of consciousness in others. As it declares our fellow men to
      be destitute of free volition, so it should declare them destitute of
      consciousness; should call them, as well as brutes, pure automata. If
      physics are all, there is no God, but there is also no man, existing.”
      Some of the early followers of Descartes used to kick and beat their dogs,
      laughing meanwhile at their cries and calling them the “creaking of the
      machine.”Huxley, who calls the brutes “conscious automata,” believes in
      the gradual banishment, from all regions of human thought, of what we call
      spirit and spontaneity: “A spontaneous act is an absurdity; it is simply
      an effect that is uncaused.”
    </p>
    <p>
      James, Psychology, 1:149—“The girl in Midshipman Easy could not excuse the
      illegitimacy of her child by saying that ‘it was a very small one.’ And
      consciousness, however small, is an illegitimate birth in any philosophy
      that starts without it, and yet professes to explain all facts by
      continued evolution.... Materialism denies reality to almost all the
      impulses which we most cherish. Hence it will fail of universal adoption.”
      Clerk Maxwell, Life, 391—“The atoms are a very tough lot, and can stand a
      great deal of knocking about, and it is strange to find a number of them
      combining to form a man of feeling.... 426—I have looked into most
      philosophical systems, and I have seen none that will work without a God.”
      President E. B. Andrews: “Mind is the only substantive thing in this
      universe, and all else is adjective. Matter is not primordial, but is a
      function of spirit.” Theodore Parker: “Man is the highest product of his
      own history. The discoverer finds nothing so tall or grand as himself,
      nothing so valuable to him. The greatest star is at the small end of the
      telescope—the star that is looking, not looked after, nor looked at.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Materialism makes men to be “a serio-comic procession of wax figures or of
      cunning casts in clay” (Bowne). Man is “the cunningest of clocks.” But if
      there were nothing but matter, there could be no materialism, for a system
      of thought, like materialism, implies consciousness. Martineau, Types,
      preface, xii, xiii—“It was the irresistible pleading of the moral
      consciousness which first drove me to rebel against the limits of the
      merely scientific conception. It became incredible to me that nothing was
      possible except the actual.... Is there then no ought to be, other than
      what is?”Dewey, Psychology, 84—“A world without ideal elements would be
      one in which the home would be four walls and a roof to keep out cold and
      wet; the table a mess for animals; and the grave a hole in the ground.”
      Omar Khayyám, Rubaiyat, stanza 72—“And that inverted bowl they call the
      Sky, Whereunder crawling coop&#x27;d we live and die, Lift not your hands
      to It for help—for it As impotently moves as you or I.” Victor Hugo: “You
      say the soul is nothing but the resultant of bodily powers? Why then is my
      soul more luminous when my bodily powers begin to fail? Winter is on my
      head, and eternal spring is in my heart.... The nearer I approach the end,
      the plainer I hear the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Diman, Theistic Argument, 348—“Materialism can never explain the fact that
      matter is always combined with force. Coördinate principles? then dualism,
      instead of monism. Force cause of matter? then we preserve unity, but
      destroy materialism; for we trace matter to an immaterial source. Behind
      multiplicity of natural forces we must postulate some single power—which
      can be nothing but coördinating mind.”Mark Hopkins sums up Materialism in
      Princeton Rev., Nov. 1879:490—“1. Man, who is a person, is made by a
      thing, i. e., matter. 2. Matter is to be worshiped as man&#x27;s maker, if
      anything is to be (Rom. 1:25). 3. Man is to worship himself—his God is his
      belly.” See also Martineau, Religion and Materialism, 25-31, Types, 1:

      and Christian Belief, 145-161; Buchanan, Modern Atheism, 247, 248; McCosh,
