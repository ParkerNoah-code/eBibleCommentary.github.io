  <h1>III. Erroneous Explanations</h1>
  <h2>Materialistic Idealism</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    Idealism proper is that method of thought which regards all knowledge as
    conversant only with affections of the percipient mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its element of truth is the fact that these affections of the percipient
    mind are the conditions of our knowledge. Its error is in denying that
    through these and in these we know that which exists independently of our
    consciousness.
  </p>
  <p>
    The idealism of the present day is mainly a materialistic idealism. It
    defines matter and mind alike in terms of sensation, and regards both as
    opposite sides or successive manifestations of one underlying and unknowable
    force.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Modern subjective idealism is the development of a principle found as far
      back as Locke. Locke derived all our knowledge from sensation; the mind
      only combines ideas which sensation furnishes, but gives no material of
      its own. Berkeley held that externally we can be sure only of
      sensations,—cannot be sure that any external world exists apart from mind.
      Berkeley&#x27;s idealism, however, was objective; for he maintained that
      while things do not exist independently of consciousness, they do exist
      independently of our consciousness, namely, in the mind of God, who in a
      correct philosophy takes the place of a mindless external world as the
      cause of our ideas. Kant, in like manner, held to existences outside of
      our own minds, although he regarded these existences as unknown and
      unknowable. Over against these forms of objective idealism we must put the
      subjective idealism of Hume, who held that internally also we cannot be
      sure of anything but mental phenomena; we know thoughts, feelings and
      volitions, but we do not know mental substance within, any more than we
      know material substance without; our ideas are a string of beads, without
      any string; we need no cause for these ideas, in an external world, a
      soul, or God. Mill, Spencer, Bain and Tyndall are Humists, and it is their
      subjective idealism which we oppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these regard the material atom as a mere centre of force, or a
      hypothetical cause of sensations. Matter is therefore a manifestation of
      force, as to the old materialism force was a property of matter. But if
      matter, mind and God are nothing but sensations, then the body itself is
      nothing but sensations. There is no body to have the sensations, and no
      spirit, either human or divine, to produce them. John Stuart Mill, in his
      Examination of Sir William Hamilton, 1:234-253, makes sensations the only
      original sources of knowledge. He defines matter as “a permanent
      possibility of sensation,”and mind as “a series of feelings aware of
      itself.” So Huxley calls matter “only a name for the unknown cause of the
      states of consciousness”; although he also declares: “If I am compelled to
      choose between the materialism of a man like Büchner and the idealism of
      Berkeley, I would have to agree with Berkeley.” He would hold to the
      priority of matter, and yet regard matter as wholly ideal. Since John
      Stuart Mill, of all the materialistic idealists, gives the most precise
      definitions of matter and of mind, we attempt to show the inadequacy of
      his treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most complete refutation of subjective idealism is that of Sir William
      Hamilton, in his Metaphysics, 348-372, and Theories of
      Sense-perception—the reply to Brown. See condensed statement of
      Hamilton&#x27;s view, with estimate and criticism, in Porter, Human
      Intellect, 236-240, and on Idealism, 129, 132. Porter holds that original
      perception gives us simply affections of our own sensorium; as cause of
      these, we gain knowledge of extended externality. So Sir William Hamilton:
      “Sensation proper has no object but a subject-object.” But both Porter and
      Hamilton hold that through these sensations we know that which exists
      independently of our sensations. Hamilton&#x27;s natural realism, however,
      was an exaggeration of the truth. Bowne, Introd. to Psych. Theory, 257,
      258—“In Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s desire to have no go-betweens in
      perception, he was forced to maintain that every sensation is felt where
      it seems to be, and hence that the mind fills out the entire body.
      Likewise he had to affirm that the object in vision is not the thing, but
      the rays of light, and even the object itself had, at last, to be brought
      into consciousness. Thus he reached the absurdity that the true object in
      perception is something of which we are totally unconscious.” Surely we
      cannot be immediately conscious of what is outside of consciousness.
      James, Psychology, 1:11—“The terminal organs are telephones, and
      brain-cells are the receivers at which the mind listens.” Berkeley&#x27;s
      view is to be found in his Principles of Human Knowledge, § 18 sq. See
      also Presb. Rev., Apl. 1885:301-315; Journ. Spec. Philos., 1884:246-260,
      383-399; Tulloch, Mod. Theories, 360, 361; Encyc. Britannica, art.:
      Berkeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, an idealism which is not open to Hamilton&#x27;s
      objections, and to which most recent philosophers give their adhesion. It
      is the objective idealism of Lotze. It argues that we know nothing of the
      extended world except through the forces which impress our nervous
      organism. These forces take the form of vibrations of air or ether, and we
      interpret them as sound, light, or motion, according as they affect our
      nerves of hearing, sight, or touch. But the only force which we
      immediately know is that of our own wills, and we can either not
      understand matter at all or we must understand it as the product of a will
      comparable to our own. Things are simply “concreted laws of action,” or
      divine ideas to which permanent reality has been given by divine will.
      What we perceive in the normal exercise of our faculties has existence not
      only for us but for all intelligent beings and for God himself: in other
      words, our idealism is not subjective, but objective. We have seen in the
      previous section that atoms cannot explain the universe,—they presuppose
      both ideas and force. We now see that this force presupposes will, and
      these ideas presuppose mind. But, as it still may be claimed that this
      mind is not self-conscious mind and that this will is not personal will,
      we pass in the next section to consider Idealistic Pantheism, of which
      these claims are characteristic. Materialistic Idealism, in truth, is but
      a half-way house between Materialism and Pantheism, in which no permanent
      lodging is to be found by the logical intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lotze, Outlines of Metaphysics, 152—“The objectivity of our cognition
      consists therefore in this, that it is not a meaningless play of mere
      seeming; but it brings before us a world whose coherency is ordered in
      pursuance of the injunction of the sole Reality in the world, to wit, the
      Good. Our cognition thus possesses more of truth than if it copied exactly
      a world that has no value in itself. Although it does not comprehend in
      what manner all that is phenomenon is presented to the view, still it
      understands what is the meaning of it all; and is like to a spectator who
      comprehends the æsthetic significance of that which takes place on the
      stage of a theatre, and would gain nothing essential if he were to see
      besides the machinery by means of which the changes are effected on the
      stage.” Professor C. A. Strong: “Perception is a shadow thrown upon the
      mind by a thing-in-itself. The shadow is the symbol of the thing; and, as
      shadows are soulless and dead, physical objects may seem soulless and
      dead, while the reality symbolized is never so soulful and alive.
      Consciousness is reality. The only existence of which we can conceive is
      mental in its nature. All existence for consciousness is existence of
      consciousness. The horse&#x27;s shadow accompanies him, but it does not
      help him to draw the cart. The brain-event is simply the mental state
      itself regarded from the point of view of the perception.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle: “Substance is in its nature prior to relation” = there can be
      no relation without things to be related. Fichte: “Knowledge, just because
      it is knowledge, is not reality,—it comes not first, but second.” Veitch,
      Knowing and Being, 216, 217, 292, 293—“Thought can do nothing, except as
      it is a synonym for Thinker.... Neither the finite nor the infinite
      consciousness, alone or together, can constitute an object external, or
      explain its existence. The existence of a thing logically precedes the
      perception of it. Perception is not creation. It is not the thinking that
      makes the ego, but the ego that makes the thinking.” Seth, Hegelianism and
      Personality: “Divine thoughts presuppose a divine Being. God&#x27;s
      thoughts do not constitute the real world. The real force does not lie in
      them,—it lies in the divine Being, as living, active Will.” Here was the
      fundamental error of Hegel, that he regarded the Universe as mere Idea,
      and gave little thought to the Love and the Will that constitute it. See

  <p>To this view we make the following objections:</p>
  <p>
    1. Its definition of matter as a “permanent possibility of sensation”
    contradicts our intuitive judgment that, in knowing the phenomena of matter,
    we have direct knowledge of substance as underlying phenomena, as distinct
    from our sensations, and as external to the mind which experiences these
    sensations.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Bowne, Metaphysics, 432—“How the possibility of an odor and a flavor can
      be the cause of the yellow color of an orange is probably unknowable,
      except to a mind that can see that two and two may make five.” See
      Iverach&#x27;s Philosophy of Spencer Examined, in Present Day Tracts, 5:
      no. 29. Martineau, Study, 1:102-112—“If external impressions are
      telegraphed to the brain, intelligence must receive the message at the
      beginning as well as deliver it at the end.... It is the external object
      which gives the possibility, not the possibility which gives the external
      object. The mind cannot make both its cognita and its cognitio. It cannot
      dispense with standing-ground for its own feet, or with atmosphere for its
      own wings.” Professor Charles A. Strong: “Kant held to
      things-in-themselves back of physical phenomena, as well as to
      things-in-themselves back of mental phenomena; he thought
      things-in-themselves back of physical might be identical with
      things-in-themselves back of mental phenomena. And since mental phenomena,
      on this theory, are not specimens of reality, and reality manifests itself
      indifferently through them and through physical phenomena, he naturally
      concluded that we have no ground for supposing reality to be like
      either—that we must conceive of it as ‘weder Materie noch ein denkend
      Wesen’—‘neither matter nor a thinking being’—a theory of the Unknowable.
      Would that it had been also the Unthinkable and the Unmentionable!” Ralph
      Waldo Emerson was a subjective idealist; but, when called to inspect a
      farmer&#x27;s load of wood, he said to his company: “Excuse me a moment,
      my friends; we have to attend to these matters, just as if they were
      real.” See Mivart, On Truth, 71-141.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    2. Its definition of mind as a “series of feelings aware of itself”
    contradicts our intuitive judgment that, in knowing the phenomena of mind,
    we have direct knowledge of a spiritual substance of which these phenomena
    are manifestations, which retains its identity independently of our
    consciousness, and which, in its knowing, instead of being the passive
    recipient of impressions from without, always acts from within by a power of
    its own.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      James, Psychology, 1:226—“It seems as if the elementary psychic fact were
      not thought, or this thought, or that thought, but my thought, every
      thought being owned. The universal conscious fact is not ‘feelings and
      thoughts exist,’ but ‘I think,’ and ‘I feel.’ ” Professor James is
      compelled to say this, even though he begins his Psychology without
      insisting upon the existence of a soul. Hamilton&#x27;s Reid, 443—“Shall I
      think that thought can stand by itself? or that ideas can feel pleasure or
      pain?” R. T. Smith, Man&#x27;s Knowledge, 44—“We say ‘my notions and my
      passions,’ and when we use these phrases we imply that our central self is
      felt to be something different from the notions or passions which belong
      to it or characterize it for a time.” Lichtenberg: “We should say, ‘It
      thinks;’ just as we say, ‘It lightens,’ or ‘It rains.’ In saying ‘Cogito,’
      the philosopher goes too far if he translates it, ‘I think.’ ” Are the
      faculties, then, an army without a general, or an engine without a driver?
      In that case we should not havesensations,—we should only be sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor C. A. Strong: “I have knowledge of other minds. This
      non-empirical knowledge—transcendent knowledge of things-in-themselves,
      derived neither from experience nor reasoning, and assuming that like
      consequents (intelligent movements) must have like antecedents (thoughts
      and feelings), and also assuming instinctively that something exists
      outside of my own mind—this refutes the post-Kantian phenomenalism.
      Perception and memory also involve transcendence. In both I transcend the
      bounds of experience, as truly as in my knowledge of other minds. In
      memory I recognize a past, as distinguished from the present. In
      perception I cognize a possibility of other experiences like the present,
      and this alone gives the sense of permanence and reality. Perception and
      memory refute phenomenalism. Things-in-themselves must be assumed in order
      to fill the gaps between individual minds, and to give coherence and
      intelligibility to the universe, and so to avoid pluralism. If matter can
      influence and even extinguish our minds, it must have some force of its
      own, some existence in itself. If consciousness is an evolutionary
      product, it must have arisen from simpler mental facts. But these simpler
      mental facts are only another name for things-in-themselves. A deep
      prerational instinct compels us to recognize them, for they cannot be
      logically demonstrated. We must assume them in order to give continuity
      and intelligibility to our conceptions of the universe.” See, on
      Bain&#x27;s Cerebral Psychology, Martineau&#x27;s Essays, 1:265. On the
      physiological method of mental philosophy, see Talbot, in Bap. Quar.,
      1871:1; Bowen, in Princeton Rev., March, 1878:423-450; Murray, Psychology,
      279-287.

    3. In so far as this theory regards mind as the obverse side of matter, or
    as a later and higher development from matter, the mere reference of both
    mind and matter to an underlying force does not save the theory from any of
    the difficulties of pure materialism already mentioned; since in this case,
    equally with that, force is regarded as purely physical, and the priority of
    spirit is denied.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Herbert Spencer, Psychology, quoted by Fiske, Cosmic Philosophy,
      2:80—“Mind and nervous action are the subjective and objective faces of
      the same thing. Yet we remain utterly incapable of seeing, or even of
      imagining, how the two are related. Mind still continues to us a something
      without kinship to other things.” Owen, Anatomy of Vertebrates, quoted by
      Talbot, Bap. Quar., Jan. 1871:5—“All that I know of matter and mind in
      themselves is that the former is an external centre of force, and the
      latter an internal centre of force.” New Englander, Sept. 1883:636—“If the
      atom be a mere centre of force and not a real thing in itself, then the
      atom is a supersensual essence, an immaterial being. To make immaterial
      matter the source of conscious mind is to make matter as wonderful as an
      immortal soul or a personal Creator.” See New Englander, July,
      1875:532-535; Martineau, Study, 102-130, and Relig. and Mod. Materialism,
      25—“If it takes mind to construe the universe, how can the negation of
      mind constitute it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      David J. Hill, in his Genetic Philosophy, 200, 201, seems to deny that
      thought precedes force, or that force precedes thought: “Objects, or
      things in the external world, may be elements of a thought-process in a
      cosmic subject, without themselves being conscious.... A true analysis and
      a rational genesis require the equal recognition of both the objective and
      the subjective elements of experience, without priority in time,
      separation in space or disruption of being. So far as our minds can
      penetrate reality, as disclosed in the activities of thought, we are
      everywhere confronted with a Dynamic Reason.” In Dr. Hill&#x27;s account
      of the genesis of the universe, however, the unconscious comes first, and
      from it the conscious seems to be derived. Consciousness of the object is
      only the obverse side of the object of consciousness. This is, as
      Martineau, Study, 1:341, remarks, “to take the sea on board the boat.” We
      greatly prefer the view of Lotze, 2:641—“Things are acts of the Infinite
      wrought within minds alone, or states which the Infinite experiences
      nowhere but in minds.... Things and events are the sum of those actions
      which the highest Principle performs in all spirits so uniformly and
      coherently, that to these spirits there must seem to be a world of
      substantial and efficient things existing in space outside themselves.”
      The data from which we draw our inferences as to the nature of the
      external world being mental and spiritual, it is more rational to
      attribute to that world a spiritual reality than a kind of reality of
      which our experience knows nothing. See also Schurman, Belief in God, 208,
      225.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    4. In so far as this theory holds the underlying force of which matter and
    mind are manifestations to be in any sense intelligent or voluntary, it
    renders necessary the assumption that there is an intelligent and voluntary
    Being who exerts this force. Sensations and ideas, moreover, are explicable
    only as manifestations of Mind.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Many recent Christian thinkers, as Murphy, Scientific Bases of Faith,
      13-15, 29-36, 42-52, would define mind as a function of matter, matter as
      a function of force, force as a function of will, and therefore as the
      power of an omnipresent and personal God. All force, except that of
      man&#x27;s free will, is the will of God. So Herschel, Lectures, 460;
      Argyll, Reign of Law, 121-127; Wallace on Nat. Selection, 363-371;
      Martineau, Essays, 1:63, 121, 145, 265; Bowen, Metaph. and Ethics,
      146-162. These writers are led to their conclusion in large part by the
      considerations that nothing dead can be a proper cause; that will is the
      only cause of which we have immediate knowledge; that the forces of nature
      are intelligible only when they are regarded as exertions of will. Matter,
      therefore, is simply centres of force—the regular and, as it were,
      automatic expression of God&#x27;s mind and will. Second causes in nature
      are only secondary activities of the great First Cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      This view is held also by Bowne, in his Metaphysics. He regards only
      personality as real. Matter is phenomenal, although it is an activity of
      the divine will outside of us. Bowne&#x27;s phenomenalism is therefore an
      objective idealism, greatly preferable to that of Berkeley who held to
      God&#x27;s energizing indeed, but only within the soul. This idealism of
      Bowne is not pantheism, for it holds that, while there are no second
      causes in nature, man is a second cause, with a personality distinct from
      that of God, and lifted above nature by his powers of free will. Royce,
      however, in his Religious Aspect of Philosophy, and in his The World and
      the Individual, makes man&#x27;s consciousness a part or aspect of a
      universal consciousness, and so, instead of making God come to
      consciousness in man, makes man come to consciousness in God. While this
      scheme seems, in one view, to save God&#x27;s personality, it may be
      doubted whether it equally guarantees man&#x27;s personality or leaves
      room for man&#x27;s freedom, responsibility, sin and guilt. Bowne, Philos.
      Theism, 175—“ ‘Universal reason’ is a class-term which denotes no possible
      existence, and which has reality only in the specific existences from
      which it is abstracted.” Bowne claims that the impersonal finite has only
      such otherness as a thought or act has to its subject. There is no
      substantial existence except in persons. Seth, Hegelianism and
      Personality: “Neo-Kantianism erects into a God the mere form of
      self-consciousness in general, that is, confounds consciousness
      überhauptwith a universal consciousness.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowne, Theory of Thought and Knowledge, 318-343, esp. 328—“Is there
      anything in existence but myself? Yes. To escape solipsism I must admit at
      least other persons. Does the world of apparent objects exist for me only?
      No; it exists for others also, so that we live in a common world. Does
      this common world consist in anything more than a similarity of
      impressions in finite minds, so that the world apart from these is
      nothing? This view cannot be disproved, but it accords so ill with the
      impression of our total experience that it is practically impossible. Is
      then the world of things a continuous existence of some kind independent
      of finite thought and consciousness? This claim cannot be demonstrated,
      but it is the only view that does not involve insuperable difficulties.
      What is the nature and where is the place of this cosmic existence? That
      is the question between Realism and Idealism. Realism views things as
      existing in a real space, and as true ontological realities. Idealism
      views both them and the space in which they are supposed to be existing as
      existing only in and for a cosmic Intelligence, and apart from which they
      are absurd and contradictory. Things are independent of our thought, but
      not independent of all thought, in a lumpish materiality which is the
      antithesis and negation of consciousness.” See also Martineau, Study,
      1:214-230, 341. For advocacy of the substantive existence of second
      causes, see Porter, Hum. Intellect, 582-588; Hodge, Syst. Theol., 1:596;
      Alden, Philosophy, 48-80; Hodgson, Time and Space, 149-218; A. J. Balfour,
      in Mind, Oct. 1893: 430.
