  <h1>III. Erroneous Explanations</h1>
  <h2>Ethical Monism</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>
    Ethical Monism is that method of thought which holds to a single substance,
    ground, or principle of being, namely, God, but which also holds to the
    ethical facts of God&#x27;s transcendence as well as his immanence, and of
    God&#x27;s personality as distinct from, and as guaranteeing, the
    personality of man.

      Although we do not here assume the authority of the Bible, reserving our
      proof of this to the next following division on The Scriptures a
      Revelation from God, we may yet cite passages which show that our doctrine
      is not inconsistent with the teachings of holy Writ. The immanence of God
      is implied in all statements of his omnipresence, as for example: Ps.
      139:7 sq.—“Whither shall I go from thy spirit? Or whither shall I flee
      from thy presence?” Jer. 23:23, 24—“Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and
      not a God afar off?... Do not I fill heaven and earth?” Acts 17:27, 28—“he
      is not far from each one of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our
      being.” The transcendence of God is implied in such passages as: 1 Kings
      8:27—“the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee”; Ps.
      113:5—“that hath his seat on high”; Is. 57:15—“the high and lofty One that
      inhabiteth eternity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the faith of Augustine: “O God, thou hast made us for thyself, and
      our heart is restless till it find rest in thee.... I could not be, O my
      God, could not be at all, wert thou not in me; rather, were not I in thee,
      of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things.”
      And Anselm, in his Proslogion, says of the divine nature: “It is the
      essence of the being, the principle of the existence, of all things....
      Without parts, without differences, without accidents, without changes, it
      might be said in a certain sense alone to exist, for in respect to it the
      other things which appear to be have no existence. The unchangeable Spirit
      is all that is, and it is this without limit, simply, interminably. It is
      the perfect and absolute Existence. The rest has come from non-entity, and
      thither returns if not supported by God. It does not exist by itself. In
      this sense the Creator alone exists; created things do not.”

    1. While Ethical Monism embraces the one element of truth contained in
    Pantheism—the truth that God is in all things and that all things are in
    God—it regards this scientific unity as entirely consistent with the facts
    of ethics—man&#x27;s freedom, responsibility, sin, and guilt; in other
    words, Metaphysical Monism, or the doctrine of one substance, ground, or
    principle of being, is qualified by Psychological Dualism, or the doctrine
    that the soul is personally distinct from matter on the one hand, and from
    God on the other.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      Ethical Monism is a monism which holds to the ethical facts of the freedom
      of man and the transcendence and personality of God; it is the monism of
      free-will, in which personality, both human and divine, sin and
      righteousness, God and the world, remain—two in one, and one in two—in
      their moral antithesis as well as their natural unity. Ladd, Introd. to
      Philosophy: “Dualism is yielding, in history and in the judgment-halls of
      reason, to a monistic philosophy.... Some form of philosophical monism is
      indicated by the researches of psycho-physics, and by that philosophy of
      mind which builds upon the principles ascertained by these researches.
      Realities correlated as are the body and the mind must have, as it were, a
      common ground.... They have their reality in the ultimate one Reality;
      they have their interrelated lives as expressions of the one Life which is
      immanent in the two.... Only some form of monism that shall satisfy the
      facts and truths to which both realism and idealism appeal can occupy the
      place of the true and final philosophy.... Monism must so construct its
      tenets as to preserve, or at least as not to contradict and destroy, the
      truths implicated in the distinction between the me and the not-me, ...
      between the morally good and the morally evil. No form of monism can
      persistently maintain itself which erects its system upon the ruins of
      fundamentally ethical principles and ideals.”... Philosophy of Mind,
      411—“Dualism must be dissolved in some ultimate monistic solution. The
      Being of the world, of which all particular beings are but parts, must be
      so conceived of as that in it can be found the one ground of all
      interrelated existences and activities.... This one Principle is an Other
      and an Absolute Mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorner, Hist. Doct. Person of Christ, II, 3:101, 231—“The unity of essence
      in God and man is the great discovery of the present age.... The
      characteristic feature of all recent Christologies is the endeavor to
      point out the essential unity of the divine and human. To the theology of
      the present day, the divine and human are not mutually exclusive, but are
      connected magnitudes.... Yet faith postulates a difference between the
      world and God, between whom religion seeks an union. Faith does not wish
      to be a relation merely to itself, or to its own representations and
      thoughts; that would be a monologue,—faith desires a dialogue. Therefore
      it does not consort with a monism which recognizes only God, or only the
      world; it opposes such a monism as this. Duality is, in fact, a condition
      of true and vital unity. But duality is not dualism. It has no desire to
      oppose the rational demand for unity.” Professor Small of Chicago: “With
      rare exceptions on each side, all philosophy to-day is monistic in its
      ontological presumptions; it is dualistic in its methodological
      procedures.” A. H. Bradford, Age of Faith, 71—“Men and God are the same in
      substance, though not identical as individuals.” The theology of fifty
      years ago was merely individualistic, and ignored the complementary truth
      of solidarity. Similarly we think of the continents and islands of our
      globe as disjoined from one another. The dissociable sea is regarded as an
      absolute barrier between them. But if the ocean could be dried, we should
      see that all the while there had been submarine connections, and the
      hidden unity of all lands would appear. So the individuality of human
      beings, real as it is, is not the only reality. There is the profounder
      fact of a common life. Even the great mountain-peaks of personality are
      superficial distinctions, compared with the organic oneness in which they
      are rooted, into which they all dip down, and from which they all, like
      volcanoes, receive at times quick and overflowing impulses of insight,
      emotion and energy; see A. H. Strong, Christ in Creation and Ethical
      Monism, 189, 190.

    2. In contrast then with the two errors of Pantheism—the denial of
    God&#x27;s transcendence and the denial of God&#x27;s personality—Ethical
    Monism holds that the universe, instead of being one with God and
    conterminous with God, is but a finite, partial and progressive
    manifestation of the divine Life: Matter being God&#x27;s self-limitation
    under the law of Necessity; Humanity being God&#x27;s self-limitation under
    the law of Freedom; Incarnation and Atonement being God&#x27;s
    self-limitations under the law of Grace.
  </p>

    <p>
      The universe is related to God as my thoughts are related to me, the
      thinker. I am greater than my thoughts, and my thoughts vary in moral
      value. Ethical Monism traces the universe back to a beginning, while
      Pantheism regards the universe as coëternal with God. Ethical Monism
      asserts God&#x27;s transcendence, while Pantheism regards God as
      imprisoned in the universe. Ethical Monism asserts that the heaven of
      heavens cannot contain him, but that contrariwise the whole universe taken
      together, with its elements and forces, its suns and systems, is but a
      light breath from his mouth, or a drop of dew upon the fringe of his
      garment. Upton, Hibbert Lectures: “The Eternal is present in every finite
      thing, and is felt and known to be present in every rational soul; but
      still is not broken up into individualities, but ever remains one and the
      same eternal substance, one and the same unifying principle, immanently
      and indivisibly present in every one of that countless plurality of finite
      individuals into which man&#x27;s analyzing understanding dissects the
      Cosmos.” James Martineau, in 19th Century, Apl. 1895:559—“What is Nature
      but the province of God&#x27;s pledged and habitual causality? And what is
      Spirit, but the province of his free causality, responding to the needs
      and affections of his children?... God is not a retired architect, who may
      now and then be called in for repairs. Nature is not self-active, and
      God&#x27;s agency is not intrusive.” Calvin: Pie hoc potest dici, Deum
      esse Naturam.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this doctrine many poets show their sympathy. “Every fresh and new
      creation, A divine improvisation, From the heart of God proceeds.” Robert
      Browning asserts God&#x27;s immanence; Hohenstiel-Schwangau: “This is the
      glory that, in all conceived Or felt, or known, I recognize a Mind—Not
      mine, but like mine—for the double joy, Making all things for me, and me
      for him”; Ring and Book, Pope: “O thou, as represented to me here In such
      conception as my soul allows—Under thy measureless, my atom-width!
      Man&#x27;s mind, what is it but a convex glass, Wherein are gathered all
      the scattered points Picked out of the immensity of sky, To reunite there,
      be our heaven for earth, Our Known Unknown, our God revealed to man?” But
      Browning also asserts God&#x27;s transcendence: in Death in the Desert, we
      read: “Man is not God, but hath God&#x27;s end to serve, A Master to obey,
      a Cause to take, Somewhat to cast off, somewhat to become”; in Christmas
      Eve, the poet derides “The important stumble Of adding, he, the sage and
      humble, Was also one with the Creator”; he tells us that it was God&#x27;s
      plan to make man in his image: “To create man, and then leave him Able,
      his own word saith, to grieve him; But able to glorify him too, As a mere
      machine could never do That prayed or praised, all unaware Of its fitness
      for aught but praise or prayer, Made perfect as a thing of course.... God,
      whose pleasure brought Man into being, stands away, As it were, a
      hand-breadth off, to give Room for the newly made to live And look at him
      from a place apart And use his gifts of brain and heart”; “Life&#x27;s
      business being just the terrible choice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tennyson&#x27;s Higher Pantheism: “The sun, the moon, the stars, the
      seas, the hills, and the plains, Are not these, O soul, the vision of Him
      who reigns? Dark is the world to thee; thou thyself art the reason why;
      For is not He all but thou, that hast power to feel ‘I am I’? Speak to
      him, thou, for he hears, and spirit with spirit can meet; Closer is he
      than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet. And the ear of man cannot
      hear, and the eye of man cannot see; But if we could see and hear, this
      vision—were it not He?” Also Tennyson&#x27;s Ancient Sage: “But that one
      ripple on the boundless deep Feels that the deep is boundless, and itself
      Forever changing form, but evermore One with the boundless motion of the
      deep”; and In Memoriam: “One God, one law, one element, And one far-off
      divine event, Toward which the whole creation moves.” Emerson: “The day of
      days, the greatest day in the feast of life, is that in which the inward
      eye opens to the unity of things”; “In the mud and scum of things
      Something always, always sings.” Mrs. Browning: “Earth is crammed with
      heaven, And every common bush afire with God; But only he who sees takes
      off his shoes.” So manhood is itself potentially a divine thing. All life,
      in all its vast variety, can have but one Source. It is either one God,
      above all, through all, and in all, or it is no God at all. E. M. Poteat,
      On Chesapeake Bay: “Night&#x27;s radiant glory overhead, A softer glory
      there below, Deep answered unto deep, and said: A kindred fire in us doth
      glow. For life is one—of sea and stars, Of God and man, of earth and
      heaven—And by no theologic bars Shall my scant life from God&#x27;s be
      riven.” See Professor Henry Jones, Robert Browning.

    3. The immanence of God, as the one substance, ground and principle of
    being, does not destroy, but rather guarantees, the individuality and rights
    of each portion of the universe, so that there is variety of rank and
    endowment. In the case of moral beings, worth is determined by the degree of
    their voluntary recognition and appropriation of the divine. While God is
    all, he is also in all; so making the universe a graded and progressive
    manifestation of himself, both in his love for righteousness and his
    opposition to moral evil.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      It has been charged that the doctrine of monism necessarily involves moral
      indifference; that the divine presence in all things breaks down all
      distinctions of rank and makes each thing equal to every other; that the
      evil as well as the good is legitimated and consecrated. Of pantheistic
      monism all this is true,—it is not true of ethical monism; for ethical
      monism is the monism that recognizes the ethical fact of personal
      intelligence and will in both God and man, and with these God&#x27;s
      purpose in making the universe a varied manifestation of himself. The
      worship of cats and bulls and crocodiles in ancient Egypt, and the
      deification of lust in the Brahmanic temples of India, were expressions of
      a non-ethical monism, which saw in God no moral attributes, and which
      identified God with his manifestations. As an illustration of the mistakes
      into which the critics of monism may fall for lack of discrimination
      between monism that is pantheistic and monism that is ethical, we quote
      from Emma Marie Caillard: “Integral parts of God are, on monistic
      premises, liars, sensualists, murderers, evil livers and evil thinkers of
      every description. Their crimes and their passions enter intrinsically
      into the divine experience. The infinite Individual in his wholeness may
      reject them indeed, but none the less are these evil finite individuals
      constituent parts of him, even as the twigs of a tree, though they are not
      the tree, and though the tree transcends any or all of them, are yet
      constituent parts of it. Can he whose universal consciousness includes and
      defines all finite consciousnesses be other than responsible for all
      finite actions and motives?”
    </p>
    <p>
      To this indictment we may reply in the words of Bowne, The Divine
      Immanence, 130-133—“Some weak heads have been so heated by the new wine of
      immanence as to put all things on the same level, and make men and mice of
      equal value. But there is nothing in the dependence of all things on God
      to remove their distinctions of value. One confused talker of this type
      was led to say that he had no trouble with the notion of a divine man, as
      he believed in a divine oyster. Others have used the doctrine to cancel
      moral differences; for if God be in all things, and if all things
      represent his will, then whatever is is right. But this too is hasty. Of
      course even the evil will is not independent of God, but lives and moves
      and has its being in and through the divine. But through its mysterious
      power of selfhood and self-determination the evil will is able to assume
      an attitude of hostility to the divine law, which forthwith vindicates
      itself by appropriate reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These reactions are not divine in the highest or ideal sense. They
      represent nothing which God desires or in which he delights; but they are
      divine in the sense that they are things to be done under the
      circumstances. The divine reaction in the case of the good is distinct
      from the divine reaction against evil. Both are divine as representing
      God&#x27;s action, but only the former is divine in the sense of
      representing God&#x27;s approval and sympathy. All things serve, said
      Spinoza. The good serve, and are furthered by their service. The bad also
      serve and are used up in the serving. According to Jonathan Edwards, the
      wicked are useful ‘in being acted upon and disposed of.’ As ‘vessels of
      dishonor’ they may reveal the majesty of God. There is nothing therefore
      in the divine immanence, in its only tenable form, to cancel moral
      distinctions or to minify retribution. The divine reaction against
      iniquity is even more solemn in this doctrine. The besetting God is the
      eternal and unescapable environment; and only as we are in harmony with
      him can there be any peace.... What God thinks of sin, and what his will
      is concerning it can be plainly seen in the natural consequences which
      attend it.... In law itself we are face to face with God; and natural
      consequences have a supernatural meaning.”
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    4. Since Christ is the Logos of God, the immanent God, God revealed in
    Nature, in Humanity, in Redemption, Ethical Monism recognizes the universe
    as created, upheld, and governed by the same Being who in the course of
    history was manifest in human form and who made atonement for human sin by
    his death on Calvary. The secret of the universe and the key to its
    mysteries are to be found in the Cross.
  </p>
  <section>
    <p>
      John 1:1-4 (marg.), 14, 18—“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
      was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with
      God. All things were made through him; and without him was not any thing
      made. That which hath been made was life in him; and the life was the
      light of men.... And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us.... No man
      hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of
      the Father, he hath declared him.” Col. 1:16, 17—“for in him were all
      things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and
      things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or
      powers; all things have been created through him and unto him; and he is
      before all things, and in him all things consist.” Heb. 1:2, 3—“his Son
      ... through whom also he made the worlds ... upholding all things by the
      word of his power”; Eph. 1:22, 23—“the church, which is his body, the
      fulness of him that filleth all in all” = fills all things with all that
      they contain of truth, beauty, and goodness; Col. 2:2, 3, 9—“the mystery
      of God, even Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
      hidden ... for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This view of the relation of the universe to God lays the foundation for a
      Christian application of recent philosophical doctrine. Matter is no
      longer blind and dead, but is spiritual in its nature, not in the sense
      that it is spirit, but in the sense that it is the continual manifestation
      of spirit, just as my thoughts are a living and continual manifestation of
      myself. Yet matter does not consist simply in ideas, for ideas, deprived
      of an external object and of an internal subject, are left suspended in
      the air. Ideas are the product of Mind. But matter is known only as the
      operation of force, and force is the product of Will. Since this force
      works in rational ways, it can be the product only of Spirit. The system
      of forces which we call the universe is the immediate product of the mind
      and will of God; and, since Christ is the mind and will of God in
      exercise, Christ is the Creator and Upholder of the universe. Nature is
      the omnipresent Christ, manifesting God to creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ is the principle of cohesion, attraction, interaction, not only in
      the physical universe, but in the intellectual and moral universe as well.
      In all our knowing, the knower and known are “connected by some Being who
      is their reality,” and this being is Christ, “the Light which lighteth
      every man” (John 1:9). We know in Christ, just as “in him we live, and
      move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28). As the attraction of gravitation
      and the principle of evolution are only other names for Christ, so he is
      the basis of inductive reasoning and the ground of moral unity in the
      creation. I am bound to love my neighbor as myself because he has in him
      the same life that is in me, the life of God in Christ. The Christ in whom
      all humanity is created, and in whom all humanity consists, holds together
      the moral universe, drawing all men to himself and so drawing them to God.
      Through him God “reconciles all things unto himself ... whether things
      upon the earth, or things in the heavens” (Col. 1:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      As Pantheism = exclusive immanence = God imprisoned, so Deism = exclusive
      transcendence = God banished. Ethical Monism holds to the truth contained
      in each of these systems, while avoiding their respective errors. It
      furnishes the basis for a new interpretation of many theological as well
      as of many philosophical doctrines. It helps our understanding of the
      Trinity. If within the bounds of God&#x27;s being there can exist
      multitudinous finite personalities, it becomes easier to comprehend how
      within those same bounds there can be three eternal and infinite
      personalities,—indeed, the integration of plural consciousnesses in an
      all-embracing divine consciousness may find a valid analogy in the
      integration of subordinate consciousnesses in the unit-personality of man;
      see Baldwin, Handbook of Psychology, Feeling and Will, 53, 54.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethical Monism, since it is ethical, leaves room for human wills and for
      their freedom. While man could never break the natural bond which united
      him to God, he could break the spiritual bond and introduce into creation
      a principle of discord and evil. Tie a cord tightly about your finger; you
      partially isolate the finger, diminish its nutrition, bring about atrophy
      and disease. So there has been given to each intelligent and moral agent
      the power, spiritually to isolate himself from God while yet he is
      naturally joined to God. As humanity is created in Christ and lives only
      in Christ, man&#x27;s self-isolation is his moral separation from Christ.
      Simon, Redemption of Man, 339—“Rejecting Christ is not so much refusal to
      become one with Christ as it is refusal to remain one with him, refusal to
      let him be our life.” All men are naturally one with Christ by physical
      birth, before they become morally one with him by spiritual birth. They
      may set themselves against him and may oppose him forever. This our Lord
      intimates, when he tells us that there are natural branches of Christ,
      which do not “abide in the vine” or “bear fruit,” and so are “cast forth,”
      “withered,” and “burned” (John 15:4-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethical Monism, however, since it is Monism, enables us to understand the
      principle of the Atonement. Though God&#x27;s holiness binds him to punish
      sin, the Christ who has joined himself to the sinner must share the
      sinner&#x27;s punishment. He who is the life of humanity must take upon
      his own heart the burden of shame and penalty that belongs to his members.
      Tie the cord about your finger; not only the finger suffers pain, but also
      the heart; the life of the whole system rouses itself to put away the
      evil, to untie the cord, to free the diseased and suffering member.
      Humanity is bound to Christ, as the finger to the body. Since human nature
      is one of the “all things” that “consist” or hold together in Christ (Col
      1:17), and man&#x27;s sin is a self-perversion of a part of Christ&#x27;s
      own body, the whole must be injured by the self-inflicted injury of the
      part, and “it must needs be that Christ should suffer” (Acts 17:3). Simon,
      Redemption of Man, 321—“If the Logos is the Mediator of the divine
      immanence in creation, especially in man; if men are differentiations of
      the effluent divine energy; and if the Logos is the immanent controlling
      principle of all differentiation—i. e., the principle of all form—must not
      the self-perversion of these human differentiations react on him who is
      their constitutive principle?” A more full explanation of the relations of
      Ethical Monism to other doctrines must be reserved to our separate
      treatment of the Trinity, Creation, Sin, Atonement, Regeneration. Portions
      of the subject are treated by Upton, Hibbert Lectures; Le Conte, in
