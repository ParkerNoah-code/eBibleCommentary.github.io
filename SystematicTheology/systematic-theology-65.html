        <p>III. The Intermediate State</p>
        <p>A. THE SCRIPTURAL VIEW OF THE INTERMEDIATE STATE.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE SCRIPTURAL REPRESENTATION OF BELIEVERS BETWEEN DEATH AND THE
          RESURRECTION. The usual position of the Reformed Churches is that the
          souls of believers immediately after death enter upon the glories of
          heaven. In answer to the question, "What comfort does the resurrection
          of the body afford thee?" the Heidelberg Catechism says: "That not
          only my soul, after this life, shall be immediately taken up to Christ
          its Head, but also that this my body, raised by the power of Christ,
          shall again be united with my soul, and made like the glorious body of
          Christ."6 The Westminster Confession speaks in the same spirit, when
          it says that, at death, "The souls of the righteous, being then made
          perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they
          behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full
          redemption of their bodies."7 Similarly, the Second Helvetic
          Confession declares: "We believe that the faithful, after bodily
          death, go directly unto Christ."8 This view would seem to find ample
          justification in Scripture, and it is well to take note of this, since
          during the last quarter of a century some Reformed theologians have
          taken the position that believers at death enter an intermediate
          place, and remain there until the day of the resurrection. The Bible
          teaches, however, that the soul of the believer when separated from
          the body, enters the presence of Christ. Paul says that he is "willing
          rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord."
          2Co_5:8. To the Philippians he writes that he has a "desire to depart
          and to be with Christ," Php_1:23. And Jesus gave the penitent
          malefactor the joyous assurance, "To-day shalt thou be with me in
          paradise,"
        </p>
        <p>
          Luk_23:43. And to be with Christ is also to be in heaven. In the light
          of 2Co_12:3-4 "paradise" can only be a designation of heaven.
          Moreover, Paul says that, "if the earthly house of our tabernacle be
          dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands,
          eternal in the heavens," 2Co_5:1. And the writer of Hebrews cheers the
          hearts of his readers with this thought among others that they "are
          come to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are
          enrolled in heaven," Heb_12:23. That the future state of believers
          after death is greatly to be preferred to the present appears clearly
          from the assertions of Paul in 2Co_5:8 and Php_1:23, quoted above. It
          is a state in which believers are truly alive and fully conscious,
          Luk_16:19-31; 1Th_5:10; a state of rest and endless bliss, Rev_14:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE SCRIPTURAL REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE OF THE WICKED BETWEEN
          DEATH AND THE RESURRECTION. The Westminster Catechism says that the
          souls of the wicked after death "are cast into hell, where they remain
          in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great
          day." Moreover, it adds: "Besides these two places (heaven and hell)
          for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledgeth
          none."9 And the Second Helvetic Confession continues after the
          quotation cited above: "In like manner, we believe that the
          unbelievers are cast headlong into hell, from whence there is no
          return opened to the wicked by any offices of those who live."10 The
          Bible sheds very little direct light on this subject. The only passage
          that can really come into consideration here is the parable of the
          rich man and Lazarus in Luk_16:1-31, where hades denotes hell, the
          place of eternal torment. The rich man found himself in the place of
          torment; his condition was fixed forever; and he was conscious of his
          miserable plight, sought mitigation of the pain he was suffering, and
          desired to have his brethren warned, in order that they might avoid a
          similar doom. In addition to this direct proof there is also an
          inferential proof. If the righteous enter upon their eternal state at
          once, the presumption is that this is true of the wicked as well. We
          leave out of consideration here a couple of passages, which are of
          uncertain interpretation, namely, 1Pe_3:19; 2Pe_2:9.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE DOCTRINE OF THE INTERMEDIATE STATE IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          In the earliest years of the Christian Church there was little thought
          of an intermediate state. The idea that Jesus would soon return as
          Judge made the interval seem to be of little consequence. The problem
          of the intermediate state arose when it became apparent that Jesus
          would not at once return. The real problem that vexed the early
          Fathers, was how to reconcile individual judgment and retribution at
          death with the general judgment and retribution after the
          resurrection. To ascribe too much importance to the former would seem
          to rob the other of its significance, and vice versa. There was no
          unanimity among the early Church Fathers, but the majority of them
          sought to solve the difficulty by assuming a distinct intermediate
          state between death and the resurrection. Says Addison: "For many
          centuries the general conclusion was widely accepted that in a
          subterranean Hades the righteous enjoy a measure of reward not equal
          to their future heaven and the wicked suffer a degree of punishment
          not equal to their future hell. The intermediate state was thus a
          slightly reduced version of ultimate retribution."11 This view was
          held, though with some variations, by such men as Justin Martyr,
          IrenÃ¦us, Tertullian, Novatian, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, and
          Augustine. In the Alexandrian School the idea of the intermediate
          state passed into that of a gradual purification of the soul, and this
          in course of time paved the way for the Roman Catholic doctrine of
          purgatory. There were some, however, who favored the idea that at
          death the souls of the righteous immediately entered heaven, namely,
          Gregory of Nazianze, Eusebius, and Gregory the Great. In the Middle
          Ages the doctrine of an intermediate state was retained, and in
          connection with it the Roman Catholic Church developed the doctrine of
          purgatory. The prevailing opinion was that hell received at once the
          souls of the wicked, but that only those of the righteous who were
          free from every stain of sin, were admitted at once into the
          blessedness of heaven, to enjoy the visio Dei. The martyrs were
          usually reckoned among the favored few. Those who were in need of
          further purification were, according to the prevalent view, detained
          in purgatory for a shorter or longer period of time, as the degree of
          remaining sin might require, and were there purged from sin by a
          purifying fire. Another idea, that was also developed in connection
          with the thought of the intermediate state, was that of the Limbus
          Patrum, where the Old Testament saints were detained until the
          resurrection of Christ. The Reformers, one and all, rejected the
          doctrine of purgatory, and also the whole idea of a real intermediate
          state, which carried with it the idea of an intermediate place. They
          held that those who died in the Lord at once entered the bliss of
          heaven, while those who died in their sins at once descended into
          hell. However, some theologians of the Reformation period assumed a
          difference in degree between the bliss of the former and the judgment
          of the latter before the final judgment, and their final bliss and
          punishment after the great assize. Among the Socinians and the
          Anabaptists there were some who revived the old doctrine held by some
          in the early Church, that the soul of man sleeps from the time of
          death until the resurrection. Calvin wrote a treatise to combat this
          view. Anathema maranatha. The same notion is advocated by some
          Adventist sects and by the Millennial Dawnists. During the nineteenth
          century several theologians, especially in England, Switzerland, and
          Germany, embraced the idea that the intermediate state is a state of
          further probation for those who have not accepted Christ in this life.
          This view is maintained by some up to the present time and is a
          favorite tenet of the Universalists.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE MODERN CONSTRUCTION OF THE DOCTRINE OF SHEOL-HADES</p>
        <p>
          1. STATEMENT OF THE DOCTRINE. There are several representations of the
          Biblical conception of sheol-hades in present day theology, and it is
          quite impossible to consider each one of them separately. The idea is
          quite prevalent at present that the Old Testament conception of sheol
          to which that of hades in the New Testament is supposed to correspond,
          was borrowed from the Gentile notion of the underworld. It is held
          that according to the Old Testament and the New, both the pious and
          the wicked at death enter the dreary abode of the shades, the land of
          forgetfulness, where they are doomed to an existence that is merely a
          dreamy reflection of life on earth. The underworld is in itself
          neither a place of rewards nor a place of punishment. It is not
          divided into different compartments for the good and the bad, but is a
          region without moral distinctions. It is a place of weakened
          consciousness and of slumbrous inactivity, where life has lost its
          interests and the joy of life is turned into sadness. Some are of the
          opinion that the Old Testament represents sheol as the permanent abode
          of all men, while others find that it holds out a hope of escape for
          the pious. Occasionally we meet with a somewhat different
          representation of the Old Testament conception, in which sheol is
          represented as divided into two compartments, namely, paradise and
          gehenna, the former containing either all the Jews or only those who
          faithfully observed the law, and the latter embracing the Gentiles.
          The Jews will be delivered from sheol at the coming of the Messiah,
          while the Gentiles will remain forever in the abode of darkness. The
          New Testament counterpart of this conception of sheol is found in its
          representation of hades. It is not merely held that the Hebrews
          entertained the notion of such an underworld, nor that the Biblical
          writers occasionally accommodated themselves formally in their
          representations to the views of the Gentiles of whom they were
          speaking; but that this is the Scriptural view of the intermediate
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CRITICISM OF THIS MODERN REPRESENTATION. In the abstract it is, of
          course, possible that the idea of such a separate locality, which is
          neither heaven nor hell, in which all the dead are gathered and where
          they remain, either permanently or until some communal resurrection,
          was more or less current in popular Hebrew thought and may have given
          rise to some figurative descriptions of the state of the dead; but it
          can hardly be regarded by those who believe in the plenary inspiration
          of the Bible as an element of the positive teachings of Scripture,
          since it plainly contradicts the Scriptural representation that the
          righteous at once enter glory and the wicked at once descend into the
          place of eternal punishment. Moreover, the following considerations
          can be urged against this view:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The question arises, whether the view of sheol-hades, now so widely
          regarded as Scriptural, is true to fact or not. If it was true to fact
          at the time, when the books of the Bible were written, but is no more
          true to fact to-day, the question naturally rises, What brought about
          the change? And if it was not true to fact, but was a decidedly false
          view â€”and this is the prevalent opinion â€”, then the problem at
          once arises, how this erroneous view could be countenanced and
          sanctioned and even taught positively by the inspired writers of
          Scripture. The problem is not relieved by the consideration, urged by
          some, that the inspiration of Scripture does not carry with it the
          assurance that the Old Testament saints were correct when they spoke
          of men entering some subterranean place at death, because not only
          these saints but also the inspired writers of Scripture employed
          language which, in itself and irrespective of other clear teachings of
          Scripture, might be so interpreted, Num_16:30; Psa_49:15-16; Psa_88:3;
          Psa_89:48; Ecc_9:10; Isa_5:14; Hos_13:14. Were these inspired writers
          in error, when they spoke of both the righteous and the wicked as
          descending into sheol? It may be said that there was development in
          the revelation respecting the future destiny of man, and we have no
          reason to doubt that on this point, as on many others, that which was
          first obscure gradually gained in definiteness and clearness; but this
          certainly does not mean that the true developed out of the false. How
          could this be? Did the Holy Spirit deem it expedient for man that he
          first receive false impressions and obtain erroneous views, and then
          exchange these in course of time for a correct insight into the
          condition of the dead?
        </p>
        <p>
          b. If in the Scriptural representation sheol-hades is really a neutral
          place, without moral distinctions, without blessedness on the one
          hand, but also without positive pain on the other, a place to which
          all alike descend, how can the Old Testament hold up the descent of
          the wicked into sheol as a warning, as it does in several places,
          Job_21:13; Psa_9:17; Pro_5:5; Pro_7:27; Pro_9:18; Pro_15:24;
          Pro_23:14? How can the Bible speak of God's anger burning there,
          Deu_32:22, and how can it use the term sheol as synonymous with
          abaddon that is, destruction, Job_26:6; Pro_15:11; Pro_27:20? This is
          a strong term, which is applied to the angel of the abyss in
          Rev_19:11. Some seek escape from this difficulty by surrendering the
          neutral character of sheol and by assuming that it was conceived of as
          an underworld with two divisions, called in the New Testament paradise
          and gehenna, the former the destined abode of the righteous, and the
          latter that of the wicked; but this attempt can only result in
          disappointment, for the Old Testament contains no trace of such a
          division, though it does speak of sheol as a place of punishment for
          the wicked. Moreover, the New Testament clearly identifies paradise
          with heaven in 2Co_12:2; 2Co_12:4. And, finally, if hades is the New
          Testament designation of sheol and all alike go there, what becomes of
          the special doom of Capernaum, Mat_11:23, and how can it be pictured
          as a place of torment, Luk_16:23? Someone might be inclined to say
          that the threatenings contained in some of the passages mentioned
          refer to a speedy descent into sheol, but there is no indication of
          this in the text whatsoever, except in Job_21:13, where this is
          explicitly stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. If a descent into sheol was the gloomy outlook upon the future, not
          only of the wicked but also of the righteous, how can we explain the
          expressions of gladsome expectation, or joy in the face of death, such
          as we find in Num_23:10; Psa_16:9; Psa_16:11; Psa_17:15; Psa_49:15;
          Psa_73:24.; Psa_73:26; Isa_25:8 (comp. 1Co_15:54)? The expression in
          Psa_49:15 may be interpreted to mean that God will deliver the poet
          out of sheol or from the power of sheol. Notice also what the writer
          of Hebrews says of the Old Testament heroes of faith in Heb_11:13-16.
          The New Testament, of course, speaks abundantly of the joyous outlook
          of believers on the future, and teaches their conscious happiness in
          the disembodied state, Luk_16:23; Luk_16:25; Luk_23:43; Act_7:59;
          2Co_5:1; 2Co_5:6; 2Co_5:8; Php_1:21; Php_1:23; 1Th_5:10; Eph_3:14-15
          ("family in heaven," not in " hades"); Rev_6:9; Rev_6:11; Rev_14:13.
          In 2Co_12:2; 2Co_12:4 "paradise" is used synonymously with "the third
          heaven." In connection with this clear representation of the New
          Testament, it has been suggested that the New Testament believers were
          privileged above those of the Old Testament by receiving immediate
          access to the bliss of heaven. But the question may well be asked,
          What basis is there for assuming such a distinction?
        </p>
        <p>
          d. If the word sheol always denotes the shadowy region to which the
          dead descend, and never has any other meaning, then the Old Testament,
          while it does have a word for heaven as the blessed abode of God and
          of the holy angels, has no word for hell, the place of destruction and
          of eternal punishment. But it is only on the assumption that in some
          passages sheol designates a place of punishment whither the wicked go
          in distinction from the righteous, that the warnings referred to under
          (b) have any point. Sheol is actually sometimes contrasted with
          shamayim (heavens) as in Job_11:8; Psa_139:8; Amo_9:2. Scripture also
          speaks of the deepest or lowest sheol in Deu_32:22. The same
          expression is also found in Psa_86:13, but in that passage is
          evidently used figuratively.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Finally, it should be noticed that there was a difference of
          opinion among scholars as to the exact subject of the descent into
          sheol. The prevailing opinion is that man as a whole is the subject.
          Man descends into sheol and in some obscure fashion continues his
          existence in a world of shadows, where the relations of life still
          reflect those on earth. This representation would seem to be most in
          harmony with the statements of Scripture, Gen_37:35; Job_7:9;
          Job_14:13; Job_21:13; Psa_139:8; Ecc_9:10. There are some which point
          to the fact that the body is included. There is danger that Jacob's
          "gray hairs" will be brought down to sheol Gen_42:38; Gen_44:29;
          Gen_44:31; Samuel comes up as an old man covered with a robe,
          1Sa_28:14; and Shimei's "hoar head" must be brought down to sheol,
          1Ki_2:6; 1Ki_2:9. But if sheol is a place whither all the dead go,
          body and soul, what then is laid in the grave, which is supposed to be
          another place? This difficulty is obviated by those scholars who
          maintain that only the souls descend into sheol, but this can hardly
          be said to be in harmony with the Old Testament representation. It is
          true that there are a few passages which speak of souls as going down
          into, or as being in, sheol, Psa_16:10; Psa_30:3; Psa_86:13;
          Psa_89:48; Pro_23:14, but it is a well known fact that in Hebrew the
          word nephesh (soul) with the pronominal suffix is often, especially in
          poetical language, equivalent to the personal pronoun. Some
          conservative theologians adopted this construction of the Old
          Testament representation, and found in it support for their idea that
          the souls of men are in some intermediate place (a place with moral
          distinctions and separate divisions, however) until the day of the
          resurrection.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. SUGGESTED INTERPRETATION OF SHEOL-HADES. The interpretation of
          these terms is by no means easy, and in suggesting an interpretation
          we do not desire to give the impression that we are speaking with
          absolute assurance. An inductive study of the passages in which the
          terms are found soon dissipates the notion that the terms sheol and
          hades are always used in the same sense, and can in all cases be
          rendered by the same word, whether it be underworld, state of death,
          grave, or hell. This is also clearly reflected in the various
          translations of the Bible. The Holland Version renders the term sheol
          by grave in some passages, and by hell in others. The St. James or
          Authorized Version employs three words in its translation, namely,
          grave, hell, and pit. The English Revisers rather inconsistently
          retained grave or pit in the text of the historical books, putting
          sheol in the margin. They retained hell only in Isa_14:1-32. The
          American Revisers avoid the difficulty by simply retaining the
          original words sheol and hades in their translation. Though the
          opinion has gained wide currency that sheol is simply the underworld
          to which all men descend, this view is by no means unanimous. Some of
          the earlier scholars simply identified sheol and the grave; others
          regard it as the place where the souls of the dead are retained; and
          still others, of whom Shedd, Vos, Aalders, and De Bondt may be
          mentioned, maintain that the word sheol does not always have the same
          meaning. It would seem that the last opinion deserves preference, and
          that the following can be said respecting its different meanings:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The words sheol and hades do not always denote a locality in
          Scripture, but are often used in an abstract sense to designate the
          state of death, the state of the separation of body and soul. This
          state is frequently locally conceived as constituting the realm of
          death, and is sometimes represented as a stronghold with gates, which
          only he who has the keys can lock and unlock, Mat_16:18; Rev_1:18.
          This local representation is in all probability based on a
          generalization of the idea of the grave, into which man descends when
          he enters the state of death. Since both believers and unbelievers at
          the termination of their life enter into the state of death, it can
          very well be said figuratively that they are without distinction in
          sheol or hades. They are all alike in the state of death. The
          parallelism clearly shows what is meant in a passage like 1Sa_2:6 :
          "Jehovah killeth and maketh alive; He bringeth down to sheol, and
          bringeth up." Cf. also Job_14:13-14; Job_17:13; Job_14:1-22;
          Psa_89:48; Hos_13:14, and several other passages. The word hades is
          evidently used more than once in the nonlocal sense of the state of
          the dead in the New Testament, Act_2:27; Act_2:31; Rev_6:8;
          Rev_20:2-8. In the last two passages we have a personification. Since
          the terms may denote the state of death, it is not necessary to prove
          that they never refer to anything that concerns the righteous and the
          wicked alike, but only that they do not denote a place where the souls
          of both are gathered. De Bondt calls attention to the fact that in
          many passages the term sheol is used in the abstract sense of death,
          of the power of death, and of the danger of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. When sheol and hades designate a locality in the literal sense of
          the word, they either refer to what we usually call hell, or to the
          grave. Descent into sheol is threatened as a danger and as a
          punishment for the wicked, Psa_9:17; Psa_49:14; Psa_55:15; Pro_15:11;
          Pro_15:24; Luk_16:23 (hades). The warning and threatening contained in
          these passages is lost altogether, if sheol is conceived of as a
          neutral place whither all go. From these passages it also follows that
          it cannot be regarded as a place with two divisions. The idea of such
          a divided sheol is borrowed from the Gentile conception of the
          underworld, and finds no support in Scripture. It is only of sheol as
          the state of death that we can speak as having two divisions, but then
          we are speaking figuratively. Even the Old Testament testifies to it
          that they who die in the Lord enter upon a fuller enjoyment of the
          blessings of salvation, and therefore do not descend into any
          underworld in the literal sense of the word, Num_23:5; Num_23:10;
          Psa_16:11; Psa_17:15; Psa_73:24; Pro_14:32. Enoch and Elijah were
          taken up, and did not descend into an underworld, Heb_11:5 ff.
          Moreover, sheol, not merely as a state, but also as a place, is
          regarded as in the closest connection with death. If the Biblical
          conception of death is understood in its deep significance, in its
          spiritual meaning, it will readily be seen that sheol cannot be the
          abode of the souls of those who die in the Lord, Pro_5:5; Pro_15:11;
          Pro_27:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also several passages in which sheol and hades seem to
          designate the grave. It is not always easy to determine, however,
          whether the words refer to the grave or to the state of the dead. The
          following are some of the passages that come into consideration here:
          Gen_37:25; Gen_42:38; Gen_44:29; Gen_29:31; 1Ki_2:6; 1Ki_2:9;
          Job_14:13; Job_17:13; Job_21:13; Psa_6:5; Psa_88:3; Ecc_9:10. But
          though the name sheol is also used for the grave, it does not
          necessarily follow that this is the original use of the word, from
          which its use to designate hell is borrowed. In all probability the
          opposite is true. The grave is called sheol, because it symbolizes the
          going down, which is connected with the idea of destruction. For
          believers the Biblical symbolism is changed by Scripture itself. Paul
          says that they go down in death as a grain is sown in the earth, from
          which springs a new, a more abundant, a more glorious life. In the Old
          Testament the word sheol is used more often for grave and less often
          for hell, while in the corresponding use of hades in the New Testament
          the contrary holds.

          D. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DOCTRINES RESPECTING THE ABODE OF THE SOUL AFTER
          DEATH.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. PURGATORY. According to the Church of Rome the souls of those who
          are perfectly pure at death are forthwith admitted to heaven or the
          beatific vision of God, Mat_25:46; Php_1:23; but those who are not
          perfectly cleansed, who are still burdened with the guilt of venial
          sins and have not borne the temporal punishment due to their sins â€”
          and this is the condition of most of the faithful at death â€” must
          undergo a process of cleansing before they can enter into the supreme
          blessedness and joys of heaven. Instead of entering heaven at once,
          they enter purgatory. Purgatory is not a place of probation, but a
          place of purification and of preparation for the souls of believers
          who are sure of an ultimate entrance into heaven, but are not yet fit
          to enter upon the bliss of the beatific vision. During the stay of
          these souls in purgatory they suffer the pain of loss, that is, the
          anguish resulting from the fact that they are excluded from the
          blessed sight of God, and also endure "the punishment of sense," that
          is, suffer positive pains, which afflict the soul. The length of their
          stay in purgatory cannot be determined beforehand. The duration as
          well as the intensity of their sufferings varies according to the
          degree of purification still needed. They can be shortened and
          alleviated by the prayers and the good works of the faithful on earth,
          and especially by the sacrifice of the mass. It is possible that one
          must remain in purgatory until the time of the last judgment. The Pope
          is supposed to have jurisdiction over purgatory. It is his peculiar
          prerogative to grant indulgences, lightening the purgatorial
          sufferings or even terminating them. The main support for this
          doctrine is found in 2Ma_12:42-45, and therefore in a book that is not
          recognized as canonical by the Protestants. But this passage proves
          too much, that is, more than the Roman Catholics themselves can
          consistently admit, namely, the possible deliverance of soldiers from
          purgatory who had died in the mortal sin of idolatry. Certain passages
          of Scripture are also supposed to favor this doctrine, such as
          Isa_4:4; Mic_7:8; Zec_9:11; Mal_3:2-3; Mat_12:32; 1Co_3:13-15;
          1Co_15:29. It is perfectly evident, however, that these passages can
          be made to support the doctrine of purgatory only by a very forced
          exegesis. The doctrine finds absolutely no support in Scripture, and
          moreover, rests on several false premises, such as (a) that we must
          add something to the work of Christ; (b) that our good works are
          meritorious in the strict sense of the word; (c) that we can perform
          works of supererogation, works in excess of the commands of duty; and
          (d) that the Church's power of the keys is absolute in a judicial
          sense. According to it the Church can shorten, alleviate, and even
          terminate the sufferings of purgatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE LIMBUS PATRUM. The Latin word limbus (fringe) was used in the
          Middle Ages to denote two places on the fringe or outskirts of hell,
          namely, the Limbus Patrum and the Limbus Infantum. The former is the
          place where, according to the teachings of Rome, the souls of the Old
          Testament saints were detained in a state of expectation until the
          Lord's resurrection from the dead. After His death on the cross Christ
          is supposed to have descended into the abode of the fathers, to
          release them from their temporary confinement and to carry them in
          triumph to heaven. This is the Roman Catholic interpretation of
          Christ's descent into hades. Hades is regarded as the dwelling place
          of the departed spirits, having two divisions, one for the righteous
          and one for the wicked. The division inhabited by the spirits of the
          righteous was the Limbus Patrum, known to the Jews as Abraham's bosom,
          Luk_16:23, and paradise, Luk_23:43. It is maintained that heaven was
          not open to any man until Christ had actually made propitiation for
          the sin of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE LIMBUS INFANTUM. This is the abode of the souls of all
          unbaptized children, irrespective of their descent from heathen or
          from Christian parents. According to the Roman Catholic Church
          unbaptized children cannot be admitted to heaven, cannot enter the
          Kingdom of God, Joh_3:5. There was always a natural repugnance,
          however, to the idea that these children should be tortured in hell,
          and Roman Catholic theologians sought a way of escape from the
          difficulty. Some thought that such children might perhaps be saved by
          the faith of their parents, and others, that God might commission the
          angels to baptize them. But the prevailing opinion is that, while they
          are excluded from heaven, they are consigned to a place on the
          outskirts of hell, where its terrible fires do not reach. They remain
          in this place forever without any hope of deliverance. The Church has
          never defined the doctrine of the Limbus Infantum, and the opinions of
          the theologians vary as to the exact condition of the children
          confined in it. The prevailing opinion is, however, that they suffer
          no positive punishment, no "pain of sense," but are simply excluded
          from the blessings of heaven. They know and love God by the use of
          their natural powers, and have full natural happiness.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE STATE OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH ONE OF CONSCIOUS EXISTENCE.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE TEACHING OF SCRIPTURE ON THIS POINT. The question has been
          raised, whether the soul after death remains actively conscious and is
          capable of rational and religious action. This has sometimes been
          denied on the general ground that the soul in its conscious activity
          is dependent on the brain, and therefore cannot continue to function
          when the brain is destroyed. But, as already pointed out in the
          preceding (pp. 677 f.), the cogency of this argument may well be
          doubted. "It is," to use the words of Dahle, "based on the error of
          confusing the worker with his machine." From the fact that the human
          consciousness in the present life transmits its effects through the
          brain, it does not necessarily follow that it can work in no other
          way. In arguing for the conscious existence of the soul after death,
          we place no reliance on the phenomena of present day spiritualism, and
          do not even depend on philosophical arguments, though these are not
          without force. We seek our evidence in the Word of God, and
          particularly in the New Testament. The rich man and Lazarus converse
          together, Luk_16:19-31. Paul speaks of the disembodied state as a
          "being at home with the Lord," and as something to be desired above
          the present life, 2Co_5:6-9; Php_1:23. Surely, he would hardly speak
          after that fashion about an unconscious existence, which is a virtual
          non-existence. In Heb_12:23 believers are said to have come to... "the
          spirits of just men made perfect," which certainly implies their
          conscious existence. Moreover, the spirits under the altar are crying
          out for vengeance on the persecutors of the Church, Rev_6:9, and the
          souls of the martyrs are said to reign with Christ, Rev_20:4. This
          truth of the conscious existence of the soul after death has been
          denied in more than one form.
        </p>
        <p>2. THE DOCTRINE OF THE SLEEP OF THE SOUL (PSYCHOPANNYCHY).</p>
        <p>
          a. Statement of the doctrine. This is one of the forms in which the
          conscious existence of the soul after death is denied. It maintains
          that, after death, the soul continues to exist as an individual
          spiritual being, but in a state of unconscious repose. Eusebius makes
          mention of a small sect in Arabia that held this view. During the
          Middle Ages there were quite a few so-called Psychopannychians, and at
          the time of the Reformation this error was advocated by some of the
          Anabaptists. Calvin even wrote a treatise against them under the title
          Psychopannychia. In the nineteenth century this doctrine was held by
          some of the Irvingites in England, and in our day it is one of the
          favorite doctrines of the Russellites or Millennial Dawnists of our
          own country. According to the latter body and soul descend into the
          grave, the soul in a state of sleep, which really amounts to a state
          of non-existence. What is called the resurrection is in reality a new
          creation. During the millennium the wicked will have a second chance,
          but if they show no marked improvement during the first hundred years,
          they will be annihilated. If in that period they give evidence of some
          amendment of life, their probation will continue, but only to end in
          annihilation, if they remain impenitent. There is no hell, no place of
          eternal torment. The doctrine of the sleep of soul seems to have a
          peculiar fascination for those who find it hard to believe in a
          continuance of consciousness apart from the corporeal organism.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Supposed Scriptural warrant for this doctrine. Scripture proof for
          this doctrine is found especially in the following: (1) Scripture
          often represents death as a sleep, Mat_9:24; Act_7:60; 1Co_15:51;
          1Th_4:13. This sleep, it is said, cannot be a sleep of the body, and
          therefore must be a sleep of the soul. (2) Certain passages of
          Scripture teach that the dead are unconscious, Psa_6:5; Psa_30:9;
          Psa_115:17; Psa_146:4; Ecc_9:10; Isa_38:18-19. This is contrary to the
          idea that the soul continues its conscious existence. (3) The Bible
          teaches that the destinies of men will be determined by a final
          judgment and will be a surprise to some. Consequently, it is
          impossible to assume that the soul enters upon its destiny immediately
          after death, Mat_7:22-23; Mat_25:37-39; Mat_25:44; Joh_5:29; Rev_20:12
          f. (4) None of those who were raised from the dead have ever given any
          account of their experiences. This can best be understood on the
          assumption that their souls were unconscious in their disembodied
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Consideration of the arguments presented. The preceding arguments
          may be answered as follows in the order in which they were stated: (1)
          It should be noted that the Bible never says that the soul falls
          asleep, nor that the body does so, but only the dying person. And this
          Scriptural representation is simply based on the similarity between a
          dead body and a body asleep. It is not unlikely that Scripture uses
          this euphemistic expression, in order to suggest to believers the
          comforting hope of the resurrection. Moreover, death is a break with
          the life of the world round about us, and in so far is a sleep, a
          rest. Finally, it should not be forgotten that the Bible represents
          believers as enjoying a conscious life in communion with God and with
          Jesus Christ immediately after death, Luk_16:19-31; Luk_23:43;
          Act_7:59; 2Co_5:8; Php_1:23; Rev_6:9; Rev_7:9; Rev_20:4. (2) The
          passages which seem to teach that the dead are unconscious are clearly
          intended to stress the fact that in the state of death man can no more
          take part in the activities of this present world. Says Hovey: "The
          work of the artisan is arrested, the voice of the singer is hushed,
          the scepter of the king falls. The body returns to the dust, and the
          praise of God in this world ceases forever." (3) It is sometimes
          represented as if man's eternal destiny depends upon a trial at the
          last day, but this is evidently a mistake. The day of judgment is not
          necessary to reach a decision respecting the reward or punishment of
          each man, but only for the solemn announcement of the sentence, and
          for the revelation of the justice of God in the presence of men and
          angels. The surprise of which some of the passages give evidence
          pertains to the ground on which the judgment rests rather than to the
          judgment itself. (4) It is true that we do not read that any of those
          who were raised from the dead ever told anything about their
          experiences between their death and resurrection. But this is a mere
          argument from silence, which is quite worthless in this case, since
          the Bible clearly teaches the conscious existence of the dead. It may
          well be, however, that those persons were silent about their
          experiences, but this can readily be explained on the assumption that
          they were not permitted to tell about them, or that they could not
          give an account of them in human language. Cf. 2Co_12:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE DOCTRINE OF ANNIHILATIONISM AND OF CONDITIONAL IMMORTALITY.
        </p>
        <p>
          a.Statement of these doctrines. According to these doctrines there is
          no conscious existence, if any existence at all, of the wicked after
          death. The two are one in their conception of the state of the wicked
          after death, but differ in a couple of fundamental points.
          Annihilationism teaches that man was created immortal, but that the
          soul, which continues in sin, is by a positive act of God deprived of
          the gift of immortality, and ultimately destroyed, or (according to
          some) forever bereaved of consciousness, which is practically
          equivalent to being reduced to non-existence. According to the
          doctrine of conditional immortality, on the other hand, immortality
          was not a natural endowment of the soul, but is a gift of God in
          Christ to those who believe. The soul that does not accept Christ
          ultimately ceases to exist, or loses all consciousness. Some of the
          advocates of these doctrines teach a limited duration of conscious
          suffering for the wicked in the future life, and thus retain something
          of the idea of positive punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          b.These doctrines in history. The doctrine of annihilationism was
          taught by Arnobius and the early Socinians, and by the philosophers
          Locke and Hobbes, but was not popular in its original form. In the
          previous century, however, the old idea of annihilation was revived
          with some modifications under the name of conditional immortality, and
          in its new form found considerable favor. It was advocated by E.
          White, J. B. Heard, and the Prebendaries Constable and Row in England,
          by Richard Rothe in Germany, by A. Sabatier in France, by E. Petavel
          and Ch. Secretan in Switzerland, and by C. F. Hudson, W. R.
          Huntington, L. C. Baker, and L. W. Bacon in our own country, and
          therefore deserves special notice. They do not all put the doctrine in
          the same form, but agree in the fundamental position that man is not
          immortal in virtue of his original constitution, but is made immortal
          by a special act or gift of grace. As far as the wicked are concerned
          some maintain that these retain a bare existence, though with an utter
          loss of consciousness, while others assert that they perish utterly
          like the beasts, though it may be after longer or shorter periods of
          suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Arguments adduced in favor of this doctrine. Support for this
          doctrine is found partly in the language of some of the early Church
          Fathers, which seems to imply at least that only believers receive the
          gift of immortality, and partly also in some of the most recent
          theories of science, which deny that there is any scientific proof for
          the immortality of the soul. The main support for it, however, is
          sought in Scripture. It is said that the Bible: (1) teaches that God
          only is inherently immortal, 1Ti_6:16; (2) never speaks of the
          immortality of the soul in general, but represents immortality as a
          gift of God to those who are in Christ Jesus, Joh_10:27-28; Joh_17:3;
          Rom_2:7; Rom_6:22-23; Gal_6:8; and (3) threatens sinners with "death"
          and "destruction," asserting that they will "perish," terms which are
          to be taken to mean that unbelievers will be reduced to non-existence,
          Mat_7:13; Mat_10:28; Joh_3:16; Rom_6:23; Rom_8:13; 2Th_1:9.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Consideration of these arguments. It cannot be said that the
          arguments in favor of this doctrine are conclusive. The language of
          the early Church Fathers is not always exact and self-consistent, and
          admits of another interpretation. And the speculative thought of the
          ages has, on the whole, been favorable to the doctrine of immortality,
          while science has not succeeded in disproving it. The Scriptural
          arguments may be answered in order as follows: (1) God is indeed the
          only one that has inherent immortality. Man's immortality is derived,
          but this is not equivalent to saying that he does not possess it in
          virtue of his creation. (2) In the second argument the bare
          immortality or continued existence of the soul is confused with
          eternal life, while the latter is a far richer concept. Eternal life
          is indeed the gift of God in Jesus Christ, a gift which the wicked do
          not receive, but this does not mean that they will not continue to
          exist. (3) The last argument arbitrarily assumes that the terms
          "death," "destruction," and "perish" denote a reduction to
          non-existence. It is only the baldest literalism that can maintain
          this, and then only in connection with some of the passages quoted by
          the advocates of this theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Arguments against this doctrine. The doctrine of conditional
          immortality is plainly contradicted by Scripture where it teaches: (1)
          that sinners as well as saints will continue to exist forever,
          Ecc_12:7; Mat_25:46; Rom_2:8-10; Rev_14:11; Rev_20:10; (2) that the
          wicked will suffer eternal punishment, which means that they will be
          forever conscious of a pain which they will recognize as their just
          desert, and therefore will not be annihilated, cf. the passages just
          mentioned; and (3) that there will be degrees in the punishment of the
          wicked, while extinction of being or consciousness admits of no
          degrees, but constitutes a punishment that is alike for all,
          Luk_12:47-48; Rom_2:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following considerations are also decidedly opposed to this
          particular doctrine: (1) Annihilation would be contrary to all
          analogy. God does not annihilate His work, however much He may change
          its form. The Biblical idea of death has nothing in common with
          annihilation. Life and death are exact opposites in Scripture. If
          death means simply the cessation of being or consciousness, life must
          mean only the continuation of these; but as a matter of fact it means
          much more than that, cf. Rom_8:6; 1Ti_4:8; 1Jn_3:14. The term has a
          spiritual connotation, and so has the word death. Man is spiritually
          dead before he falls a prey to physical death, but this does not
          involve a loss of being or consciousness, Eph_2:1-2; 1Ti_5:6;
          Col_2:13; Rev_3:1. (2) Annihilation can hardly be called a punishment,
          since this implies a consciousness of pain and ill- desert, while,
          when existence terminates, consciousness also ceases. It might at most
          be said that the dread of annihilation would be a punishment, but this
          punishment would not be commensurate with the transgression. And
          naturally the dread of a man who never had within him the spark of
          immortality, will never equal that of him who has eternity in his
          heart, Ecc_3:11. (3) It often happens that people consider the
          extinction of being and of consciousness a very desirable thing, when
          they grow tired of life. For these such a punishment would be in
          reality a blessing.

        <p>F. THE INTERMEDIATE STATE NOT A STATE OF FURTHER PROBATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. STATEMENT OF THE DOCTRINE. The theory of the so-called "second
          probation" found considerable favor in the theological world of the
          nineteenth century. It is advocated, among others, by Mueller, Dorner,
          and Nitzsch in Germany, by Godet and Gretillat in Switzerland, by
          Maurice, Farrar, and Plumptre in England, and by Newman Smythe,
          Munger, Cox, Jukes and several Andover theologians in our own country.
          This theory is to the effect that salvation through Christ is still
          possible in the intermediate state for certain classes or, perhaps,
          for all; and that this is offered on substantially the same terms as
          at present, namely, faith in Christ as Saviour. Christ is made known
          to all who still need Him unto salvation, and acceptance of Him is
          urged on all. No one is condemned to hell without being subjected to
          this test, and only they are condemned who resist this offer of grace.
          The eternal state of man will not be irrevocably fixed until the day
          of judgment. The decision made between death and the resurrection will
          decide, whether one will be saved or not. The fundamental principle on
          which this theory rests, is that no man will perish without having
          been offered a favorable opportunity to know and accept Jesus. Man is
          condemned only for the obstinate refusal to accept the salvation that
          is offered in Christ Jesus. Opinions differ, however, as to the
          persons to whom the gracious opportunity to accept Christ will be
          offered in the intermediate state. The general opinion is that it will
          certainly be extended to all children who die in infancy, and to the
          adult heathen who in this life have not heard of Christ. The majority
          hold that it will even be granted to those who lived in Christian
          lands, but in this present life never properly considered the claims
          of Christ. Again, there is great diversity of opinion as to the agency
          and the methods by which this saving work will be carried on in the
          future. Moreover, while some entertain the largest hope as to the
          outcome of the work, others are less sanguine in their expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH THIS DOCTRINE RESTS. This theory is founded
          in part on general considerations of what might be expected of the
          love and justice of God, and on an easily understood desire to make
          the gracious work of Christ as inclusive as possible, rather than on
          any solid Scriptural foundation. The main Scriptural basis for it is
          found in 1Pe_3:19; 1Pe_4:6, which are understood to teach that Christ
          in the period between His death and resurrection preached to the
          spirits in hades. But these passages furnish but a precarious
          foundation, since they are capable of quite a different
          interpretation.12 And even if these passages did teach that Christ
          actually went into the underworld to preach, His offer of salvation
          would extend only to those who died before His crucifixion. They also
          refer to passages which, in their estimation, represent unbelief as
          the only ground of condemnation, such as Joh_3:18; Joh_3:36;
          Mar_16:15-16; Rom_10:9-12; Eph_4:18; 2Pe_2:3-4; 1Jn_4:3. But these
          passages only prove that faith in Christ is the way of salvation,
          which is by no means the same as proving that a conscious rejection of
          Christ is the only ground of condemnation. Unbelief is undoubtedly a
          great sin, and one that stands out prominently in the lives of those
          to whom Christ is preached, but it is not the only form of revolt
          against God, nor the only ground of condemnation. Men are already
          under condemnation when Christ is offered to them. Other passages,
          such as Mat_13:31-32; 1Co_15:24-28; and Php_2:9-11 are equally
          inconclusive. Some of them prove too much and therefore prove nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS DOCTRINE. The following considerations can
          be urged against this theory: (a) Scripture represents the state of
          unbelievers after death as a fixed state. The most important passage
          that comes into consideration here is Luk_16:19-31. Other passages are
          Ecc_11:3 (of uncertain interpretation); Joh_8:21; Joh_8:24; 2Pe_2:4;
          2Pe_2:9; Jud_1:7-13 (comp. 1Pe_3:19). (b) It also invariably
          represents the coming final judgment as determined by the things that
          were done in the flesh, and never speaks of this as dependent in any
          way on what occurred in the intermediate state, Mat_7:22-24;
          Mat_7:22-23; Mat_25:34-46; Luk_12:47-48; 2Co_5:9-10; Gal_6:7-8;
          2Th_1:8; Heb_9:27. (c) The fundamental principle of this theory, that
          only the conscious rejection of Christ and His gospel, causes men to
          perish, is un-Scriptural. Man is lost by nature, and even original
          sin, as well as all actual sins, makes him worthy of condemnation. The
          rejection of Christ is undoubtedly a great sin, but is never
          represented as the only sin that leads to destruction. (d) Scripture
          teaches us that the Gentiles perish, Rom_1:32; Rev_21:8; Rev_21:8.
          There is no Scripture evidence on which we can base the hope that
          adult Gentiles, or even Gentile children that have not yet come to
          years of discretion, will be saved. (e) The theory of a future
          probation is also calculated to extinguish all missionary zeal. If the
          Gentiles can decide as to the acceptance of Christ in the future, it
          can only bring a speedier and increased judgment upon many, if they
          are placed before the choice now. Why not leave them in ignorance as
          long as possible?
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: Is the position tenable that sheol-hades
          always designates an underworld whither all the dead go? Why is it
          objectionable to believe that the Bible in its statements respecting
          sheol and hades simply reflects the popular notions of the day? Must
          we assume that the righteous and the wicked at death enter some
          temporary and provisional abode, and do not at once enter upon their
          eternal destiny? In what sense is the intermediate state only
          transitional? How did the notion of purgatory arise? How do Catholics
          conceive of the purgatorial fire? Is this fire merely purifying or
          also penal? What sound element do some Lutherans recognize in the
          doctrine of purgatory? What mixture of heresies do we meet with in
          Millennial Dawnism? Does the intermediate state, according to
          Scripture, represent a third aion between the aion houtos and the aion
          ho mellon? Is the Scriptural emphasis on the present as "the day of
          salvation" in harmony with the doctrine of a future probation?
