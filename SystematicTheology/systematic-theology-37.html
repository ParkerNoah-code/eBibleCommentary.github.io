        <p>V. Divergent Theories of the Atonement</p>
        <p>
          Since the atonement is clearly something objective, something that has
          a Godward direction, strictly speaking only those theories can come
          into consideration here that represent the work of Christ as intended
          primarily to ward off the wrath of God and divine punishment from
          sinners rather than to change the sinner's attitude to God from one of
          hostility to one of friendship. Theories that are entirely subjective
          and conceive of the work of Christ exclusively as bearing on the
          sinner's moral condition might, in strict logic, be left out of
          consideration altogether. They might conceivably be considered as
          theories of reconciliation, but can hardly be regarded as theories of
          atonement. Miley argues that there really can be no more than two
          theories of atonement. He points out that the atonement, as an
          objective ground for the forgiveness of sins, must answer to a
          necessity which will naturally determine its nature. This necessity
          must lie, either in the requirement of an absolute justice which must
          punish sin, or in the rectoral office of justice as an obligation to
          conserve the interests of moral government. In the first case one
          arrives at the satisfaction theory; in the second, at the governmental
          theory, which is preferred by Miley and finds great favor with the
          Methodists in general. Alfred Cave ascribes an objective character
          also to the theory of the early Arminians, in which the death of
          Christ is regarded as a substitute for the penalty imposed on sinners;
          and to the theory of McLeod Campbell, which finds the real
          significance of the work of Christ in His vicarious repentance. And it
          is undoubtedly true that both of these do contain an objective
          element. But in addition to these there are several purely subjective
          theories. Though these are not, strictly speaking, theories of
          atonement, yet they call for consideration, since they are considered
          as such in many circles. The following are the most important
          theories:
        </p>
        <p>A. THEORIES OF THE EARLY CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          There were two theories in the early Church that call for brief
          mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE RANSOM TO SATAN THEORY. This is based on the singular notion
          that the death of Christ constituted a ransom paid to Satan, in order
          to cancel the just claims which the latter had on man. Origen, one of
          the chief advocates of this theory, held that Satan was deceived in
          the bargain, since the outcome proved that he could not stand in the
          presence of the holy Christ, and was not able to retain his hold on
          Him. This theory found favor with several of the early Church Fathers,
          though they did not always state it in exactly the same form. It
          proved to be rather tenacious, for the echo of it was still heard in
          the days of Anselm. Yet it was found to be so incongruous that it
          gradually disappeared for lack of intelligent support. Mackintosh
          speaks of this theory as the exoteric theory of the early Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE RECAPITULATION THEORY. IrenÃ¦us, who also expresses the idea
          that the death of Christ satisfied the justice of God and thus
          liberated man, nevertheless gave great prominence to the
          recapitulation theory, that is, to the idea, as Orr expresses it,
          "that Christ recapitulates in Himself all the stages of human life,
          including those which belong to our state as sinners." By His
          incarnation and human life He reverses the course on which Adam by his
          sin started humanity and thus becomes a new leaven in the life of
          mankind. He communicates immortality to those who are united to Him by
          faith and effects an ethical transformation in their lives, and by His
          obedience compensates for the disobedience of Adam. This, according to
          Mackintosh, was the esoteric theory of the early Church.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE SATISFACTION THEORY OF ANSELM (COMMERCIAL THEORY).</p>
        <p>
          The theory of Anselm is sometimes identified with that of the
          Reformers, which is also known as the satisfaction theory, but the two
          are not identical. Some seek to prejudice others against it by calling
          it "the commercial theory." Anselm stressed the absolute necessity of
          the atonement by grounding it in the very nature of God. According to
          him sin consists in the creature's withholding from God the honor
          which is His due. By the sin of man God was robbed of His honor, and
          it was necessary that this should be vindicated. This could be done in
          either of two ways: by punishment or by satisfaction. The mercy of God
          prompted Him to seek it in the way of satisfaction, and more
          particularly through the gift of His Son, which was the only way,
          since an infinite satisfaction was required. Christ rendered obedience
          to the law, but since this was nothing more than His duty as man, it
          did not constitute any merit on His part. In addition to that,
          however, He also suffered and died in the performance of His duty; and
          since He as a sinless being was under no obligation to suffer and to
          die, He thus brought infinite glory to God. This was a work of
          supererogation on the part of Christ, which merited, and also brought,
          a reward; but since Christ as the Son of God needed nothing for
          Himself, the reward was passed on to sinners in the form of the
          forgiveness of sins and of future blessedness for all those who live
          according to the commandments of the gospel. Anselm was the first to
          work out a rather complete doctrine of the atonement, and in many
          respects his theory points in the right direction. However, it is open
          to several points of criticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is not consistent in its representation of the necessity of the
          atonement. It ostensibly does not ground this necessity in the justice
          of God which cannot brook sin, but in the honor of God which calls for
          amends or reparation. He really starts out with the principle of
          "private law" or custom, according to which an injured party may
          demand whatever satisfaction he sees fit; and yet argues for the
          necessity of the atonement in a way which only holds on the standpoint
          of public law.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This theory really has no place for the idea that Christ by
          suffering endured the penalty of sin, and that His suffering was
          strictly vicarious. The death of Christ is merely a tribute offered
          voluntarily to the honor of the Father. It constitutes a
          supererogatory merit, compensating for the demerits of others; and
          this is really the Roman Catholic doctrine of penance applied to the
          work of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The scheme is also one-sided and therefore insufficient in that it
          bases redemption exclusively on the death of Christ, conceived as a
          material contribution to the honor of God, and excludes the active
          obedience of Christ as a contributing factor to His atoning work. The
          whole emphasis is on the death of Christ, and no justice is done to
          the redemptive significance of His life.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. In Anselm's representation there is merely an external transfer of
          the merits of Christ to man. It contains no indication of the way in
          which the work of Christ for man is communicated to man. There is no
          hint of the mystical union of Christ and believers, nor of faith as
          accepting the righteousness of Christ. Since the whole transaction
          appears to be rather commercial, the theory is often called the
          commercial theory.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE MORAL INFLUENCE THEORY.</p>
        <p>
          This theory was first advocated by Abelard in opposition to Anselm,
          and since his day found many ardent supporters. The fundamental idea
          is always the same, though it has assumed different forms at the hands
          of such men as Young, Maurice, Bushnell, Stevens, David Smith, and
          many others. The fundamental idea is that there is no principle of the
          divine nature which necessarily calls for satisfaction on the part of
          the sinner; and that the death of Christ should not be regarded as an
          expiation for sin. It was merely a manifestation of the love of God,
          suffering in and with His sinful creatures, and taking upon Himself
          their woes and griefs. This suffering did not serve to satisfy the
          divine justice, but to reveal the divine love, so as to soften human
          hearts and to lead them to repentance. It assures sinners that there
          is no obstacle on the part of God which would prevent Him from
          pardoning their sins. Not only can He do this without receiving
          satisfaction, but He is even eager to do it. The only requirement is
          that sinners come to Him with penitent hearts. The following
          objections may be urged against this theory:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This theory is contrary to the plain teachings of Scripture, which
          represents the atoning work of Christ as necessary, not primarily to
          reveal the love of God, but to satisfy His justice; regards the
          sufferings and death of Christ as propitiatory and penal; and teaches
          that the sinner is not susceptible to the moral influence of the
          sacrificial work of Christ until the righteousness of Christ has
          become his own by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. While it is undoubtedly true that the cross of Christ was the
          supreme manifestation of the love of God, it can be regarded as such
          only from the point of view of the penal substitutionary doctrine of
          the atonement, according to which the sufferings and death of Christ
          were absolutely necessary for the salvation of sinners. But according
          to the moral influence theory they merely served the purpose of making
          an impression on man, which God might have done in many other ways;
          and therefore were not necessary. And if they were not necessary, they
          were indeed a cruel manifestation of God's love, â€” a contradiction
          in terms. The sufferings and death of Christ were a manifestation of
          God's love only, if it was the only way to save sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This theory robs the atonement of its objective character, and
          thereby ceases to be a real theory of the atonement. It is at most
          only a one-sided theory of reconciliation. In fact, it is not even
          that, for subjective reconciliation is only possible on the basis of
          an objective reconciliation. It really confounds God's method of
          saving man with man's experience of being saved, by making the
          atonement itself to consist in its effects in the life of the
          believer, in union with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Finally, this theory fails on its own principle. It is undoubtedly
          true that necessary suffering, that is, suffering for some saving
          purpose which could not be realized in any other way, is apt to make a
          deep impression. But the effect of a voluntary suffering, which is
          entirely unnecessary and uncalled for, is quite different. As a matter
          of fact, it is disapproved by the Christian conscience.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE EXAMPLE THEORY.</p>
        <p>
          This theory was advocated by the Socinians in the sixteenth century,
          in opposition to the doctrine of the Reformers, that Christ
          vicariously atoned for the sin of mankind. Its fundamental principle
          is, that there is no retributive justice in God which requires
          absolutely and inexorably that sin be punished. His justice does not
          prevent Him from pardoning whom He will without demanding any
          satisfaction. The death of Christ did not atone for sin, neither did
          it move God to pardon sin. Christ saves men by revealing to them the
          way of faith and obedience as the way of eternal life, by giving them
          an example of true obedience both in His life and in His death, and by
          inspiring them to lead a similar life. This view really establishes no
          direct connection between the death of Christ and the salvation of
          sinners. Yet it holds that the death of Christ may be said to expiate
          the sins of man in view of the fact that Christ, as a reward for His
          obedience unto death, received power to bestow eternal life on
          believers. This theory is objectionable for various reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is really a revival and concoction of several ancient heresies:
          of Pelagianism, with its denial of human depravity and its assertion
          of the natural ability of man to save himself; of the adoptionist
          doctrine, with its belief that the man Christ was adopted to be the
          Messianic Son of God on account of His obedience; of the Scotist
          doctrine of an arbitrary will in God; and of the emphasis of some of
          the early Church Fathers on the saving efficacy of the example of
          Christ. Consequently it is open to all the objections that militate
          against these views.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is entirely un-Scriptural in its conception of Christ as a mere
          man of exceptional qualities; in its view of sin, in which the
          character of sin as guilt, so strongly emphasized by the Word of God,
          is entirely ignored; in its one-sided emphasis on the redemptive
          significance of the life of Christ; and in its representation of the
          death of Christ as a martyr's death, while failing to account for the
          unmartyrlike anguish of Christ on the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It fails to account for the salvation of those who lived before the
          incarnation and of infants. If the life and sufferings of Christ
          merely save men by their exemplary character, the question naturally
          arises, how they who lived prior to the coming of Christ, and they who
          die in infancy can derive any benefit from them. Yet there is clear
          Scriptural evidence for the fact that the work of Christ was also
          retrospective in its efficacy, and that little children also share in
          the benefits of His atoning death.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Moreover, while it is perfectly true that Christ is also
          represented as an example in Scripture, He is nowhere represented as
          an example after which unbelieving sinners must pattern, and which
          will save them if they do; and yet this is the necessary assumption of
          the theory under consideration. The example of Christ is one which
          only His people can follow, and to which even they can make but a
          slight approach. He is our Redeemer before He can be our example.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE GOVERNMENTAL THEORY.</p>
        <p>
          The governmental theory was intended to be a mean between the doctrine
          of the atonement, as taught by the Reformers, and the Socinian view.
          It denies that the justice of God necessarily demands that all the
          requirements of the law be met. The law is merely the product of God's
          will, and He can alter or even abrogate it, just as He pleases. While
          in strict justice the sinner deserved eternal death, that sentence is
          not strictly executed, for believers are set free. For them the
          penalty is set aside, and that without strict satisfaction. Christ did
          indeed render a certain satisfaction, but this was only a nominal
          equivalent of the penalty due to man; something which God was pleased
          to accept as such. If the question is asked, why God did not remit the
          penalty outright, as He might have done, the answer is that He had to
          reveal in some way the inviolable nature of the law and His holy
          displeasure against sin, in order that He, the moral Ruler of the
          universe, might be able to maintain His moral government. This theory,
          first advocated by Grotius, was adopted by Wardlaw and several New
          England theologians, and is also supported in such recent works as
          those of Dale, A. Cave, Miley, Creighton, and others. It is open to
          the following objections:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It clearly rests upon certain false principles. According to it the
          law is not an expression of the essential nature of God, but only of
          His arbitrary will, and is therefore subject to change; and the aim of
          the so-called penalty is not to satisfy justice, but only to deter men
          from future offenses against the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. While it may be said to contain a true element, namely, that the
          penalty inflicted on Christ is also instrumental in securing the
          interests of the divine government, it makes the mistake of
          substituting for the main purpose of the atonement one which can, in
          the light of Scripture, only be regarded as a subordinate purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It gives an unworthy representation of God. He originally threatens
          man, in order to deter him from transgression, and does not execute
          the threatened sentence, but substitutes something else for it in the
          punishment inflicted on Christ. And now He again threatens those who
          do not accept Christ. But how is it possible to have any assurance
          that He will actually carry out His threat?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is also contrary to Scripture, which certainly represents the
          atonement of Christ as a necessary revelation of the righteousness of
          God, as an execution of the penalty of the law, as a sacrifice by
          which God is reconciled to the sinner, and as the meritorious cause of
          the salvation of sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Like the moral influence and the example theories, it also fails to
          explain how the Old Testament saints were saved. If the punishment
          inflicted on Christ was merely for the purpose of deterring men from
          sin, it had no retroactive significance. How then were people saved
          under the old dispensation; and how was the moral government of God
          maintained at that time?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Finally, this theory, too, fails on its own principle. A real
          execution of the penalty might make a profound impression on the
          sinner, and might act as a real deterrent, if man's sinning or not
          sinning were, even in his natural state, merely contingent on the
          human will, which it is not; but such an impression would hardly be
          made by a mere sham exhibition of justice, designed to show God's high
          regard for the law.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE MYSTICAL THEORY.</p>
        <p>
          The mystical theory has this in common with the moral influence
          theory, that it conceives of the atonement exclusively as exercising
          influence on man and bringing about a change in him. At the same time
          it differs from the moral influence theory in that it conceives of the
          change wrought in man, not primarily as an ethical change in the
          conscious life of man, but as a deeper change in the subconscious life
          which is brought about in a mystical way. The basic principle of this
          theory is that, in the incarnation, the divine life entered into the
          life of humanity, in order to lift it to the plane of the divine.
          Christ possessed human nature with its inborn corruption and
          predisposition to moral evil; but through the influence of the Holy
          Spirit He was kept from manifesting this corruption in actual sin,
          gradually purified human nature, and in His death completely
          extirpated this original depravity and reunited that nature to God. He
          entered the life of mankind as a transforming leaven, and the
          resulting transformation constitutes His redemption. This is in
          effect, though with differences of detail, the theory of
          Schleiermacher, Edward Irving, Menken, and Stier. Even Kohlbruegge
          seemed inclined to accept it in a measure. It is burdened, however,
          with the following difficulties:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It takes no account of the guilt of man. According to Scripture the
          guilt of man must be removed, in order that he may be purified of his
          pollution; but the mystical theory, disregarding the guilt of sin,
          concerns itself only with the expulsion of the pollution of sin. It
          knows of no justification, and conceives of salvation as consisting in
          subjective sanctification.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It rests upon false principles, where it finds in the natural order
          of the universe an exhaustive expression of the will and nature of
          God, regards sin exclusively as a power of moral evil in the world,
          which involves no guilt and deserves no punishment, and looks upon
          punishment as a mere reaction of the law of the universe against the
          transgressor, and not at all as a revelation of the personal wrath of
          God against sin.

          3. It contradicts Scripture where it makes Christ share in the
          pollution of sin and hereditary depravity, and deduces the necessity
          of His death from the sinfulness of His own nature (not all do this).
          By doing this, it makes it impossible to regard Him as the sinless
          Saviour who, just because of His sinlessness, could take the place of
          sinners and pay the penalty for them.

          4. It has no answer to the question, how those who lived before the
          incarnation can share in the redemption of Jesus Christ. If Christ in
          some realistic way drove out the pollution of sin during the time of
          His sojourn on earth, and now continues to drive it out; and if the
          salvation of man depends on this subjective process, how then could
          the Old Testament saints share in this salvation?

        <p>G. THE THEORY OF VICARIOUS REPENTANCE.</p>
        <p>
          This theory of McLeod Cambell is also called the theory of sympathy
          and identification. It proceeds on the gratuitous assumption that a
          perfect repentance would have availed as a sufficient atonement for
          sin, if man had only been capable of an adequate repentance, which he
          was not. Now Christ offered to God, in behalf of humanity, the
          requisite repentance, and by so doing fulfilled the conditions of
          forgiveness. His work really consisted in the vicarious confession of
          sin in behalf of man. The question naturally arises, how the death of
          Christ is related to this vicarious repentance and confession. And the
          answer is that Christ, by His suffering and death, entered
          sympathetically into the Father's condemnation of sin, brought out the
          heinousness of sin and condemned sin; and this was viewed by the
          Father as a perfect confession of our sins. This condemnation of sin
          is also calculated to produce in man that holiness which God demands
          of sinful humanity. This theory labors under the following
          difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It can readily be understood that Christ as man could enter
          sympathetically into our afflictions and temptations, and into the
          feeling of our infirmities; but it is not at all clear how the
          incarnation enabled Him to enter into a fellow-feeling with us with
          respect to our sins. He was sinless, a total stranger to sin as a
          corrupting power in His life, and therefore could hardly identify
          Himself in a moral sense with sinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. While it may be admitted that, according to Scripture, Christ did
          sympathize with the sinners whom He came to save, this sympathy is
          certainly not represented as being the whole or even the most
          important part of His redemptive work. All the emphasis is on the fact
          that He vicariously endured the penalties that were due to sinners and
          met the requirements of the law in a life of obedience. Yet this
          theory, while recognizing the retributive justice of God and the
          demerit of sin, denies the necessity and possibility of penal
          substitution, and asserts that the work of Christ in behalf of sinners
          consisted, not in His suffering for them, but in the vicarious
          confession of their sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The theory proceeds on erroneous principles, namely, that sin does
          not necessarily make men liable to punishment; that the justice and
          holiness of God did not, as a matter of course, call for an objective
          atonement; and that the only necessity for redemptive help followed
          from the inability of man to repent in true fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Finally, a vicarious confession, such as this theory implies, is
          really a contradiction in terms. Confession is something altogether
          subjective, and to be valid must be personal. It is the outcome of a
          personal consciousness of sin, and is also personal in its effects. It
          is hard to see how such a vicarious repentance can release others from
          the obligation to repent. Moreover, this theory has no Scriptural
          foundation.
