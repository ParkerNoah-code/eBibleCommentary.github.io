        <p>IV. The Dual Aspect of the Covenant</p>
        <p>
          In speaking of the contracting parties in the covenant of grace it was
          already intimated that the covenant may be considered from two
          different points of view. There are two different aspects of the
          covenant, and now the question arises, In what relation do these two
          stand to each other? This question has been answered in different
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>A. AN EXTERNAL AND AN INTERNAL COVENANT.</p>
        <p>
          Some have distinguished between an external and an internal covenant.
          The external covenant was conceived as one in which a person's status
          depends entirely on the performance of certain external religious
          duties. His position is entirely correct, if he does what is required
          of him, somewhat in the Roman Catholic sense. Among Israel this
          covenant assumed a national form. Perhaps no one worked out the
          doctrine of an external covenant with greater consistency than Thomas
          Blake. The dividing line between the external and the internal
          covenant was not always represented in the same way. Some connected
          baptism with the external, and confession of faith and the Lord's
          Supper, with the internal covenant; others thought of baptism and
          confession as belonging to the external covenant, and of the Lord's
          Supper as the sacrament of the internal covenant. But the trouble is
          that this whole representation results in a dualism in the conception
          of the covenant that is not warranted by Scripture; it yields an
          external covenant that is not interpenetrated by the internal. The
          impression is created that there is a covenant in which man can assume
          an entirely correct position without saving faith; but the Bible knows
          of no such covenant. There are, indeed, external privileges and
          blessings of the covenant, and there are persons who enjoy these only;
          but such cases are abnormalities that cannot be systematized. The
          distinction between an external and an internal covenant does not
          hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          This view must not be confused with another and related view, namely,
          that there is an external and an internal aspect of the covenant of
          grace (Mastricht and others). According to this some accept their
          covenant responsibilities in a truly spiritual way, from the heart,
          while others accept them only by an external profession with the
          mouth, and therefore are only apparently in the covenant. Mastricht
          refers to Judas Iscariot, Simon the sorcerer, those who have temporal
          faith, and others. But the trouble is that, according to this view,
          the non-elect and non-regenerate are merely external appendages to the
          covenant, and are simply regarded as children of the covenant by us
          because of our short-sightedness, but are no covenant children at all
          in the sight of God. They are not really in the covenant, and
          therefore cannot really become covenant breakers either. It offers no
          solution of the problem in what sense the non-elect and non-
          regenerate, who are members of the visible Church, are children of the
          covenant also in the sight of God, and can therefore become covenant
          breakers.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE ESSENCE AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COVENANT.</p>
        <p>
          Others, as for instance, Olevianus and Turretin, distinguish between
          the essence and the administration of the covenant. According to
          Turretin the former corresponds to the internal calling and the
          invisible Church formed by means of this calling; and the latter, to
          the external calling and the visible Church, as consisting of those
          who are called externally by the Word. The administration of the
          covenant consists only in the offer of salvation in the preaching of
          the Word, and in the other external privileges in which all share who
          have a place in the Church, including many non-elect. The essence of
          the covenant, however, also includes the spiritual reception of all
          the blessings of the covenant, the life in union with Christ, and
          therefore extends to the elect only. This distinction certainly
          contains an element of truth, but is not altogether logical and clear.
          While essence and form would constitute an antithesis, essence and
          administration do not. They may refer to the invisible and the visible
          Church, as Turretin seems to intend, or to the final end or
          realization and the announcement of the covenant, as Olevianus
          understands the distinction. But if the former is meant, it would be
          better to speak of essence and revelation; and if the latter is
          intended, it would be preferable to speak of the aim and the means of
          its realization. Here, too, the question remains unanswered, whether
          and in how far the non-elect are covenant children also in the sight
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>C. A CONDITIONAL AND AN ABSOLUTE COVENANT.</p>
        <p>
          Still others, as for instance, Koelman, speak of a conditional and an
          absolute covenant. Koelman emphasizes the fact that, when an external
          and an internal covenant are distinguished, only a single covenant is
          meant, and the terms "external" and "internal" simply serve to stress
          the fact that all are not in the covenant in exactly the same way.
          Some are in it merely by an external confession, to the enjoyment of
          external privileges, and others by a hearty acceptance of it, to the
          enjoyment of the blessings of salvation. Likewise, he wishes it to be
          clearly understood that, when he says that some are in the covenant
          externally and conditionally, he does not mean to assert that they are
          not really in the covenant, but only that they cannot obtain the
          promised blessings of the covenant, except by complying with the
          condition of the covenant. This representation, too, undoubtedly
          contains an element of truth, but in Koelman it is linked up in such a
          way with the notion of an external and an internal covenant, that he
          comes dangerously near to the error of accepting two covenants,
          especially when he claims that during the New Testament dispensation
          God incorporates whole nations and kingdoms in the covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          D. THE COVENANT AS A PURELY LEGAL RELATIONSHIP AND AS A COMMUNION OF
          LIFE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reformed theologians, such as Kuyper, Bavinck, and Honig, speak of two
          sides of the covenant, the one external and the other internal. Dr.
          Vos uses terms that are more specific, when he distinguishes between
          the covenant as a purely legal relationship and the covenant as a
          communion of life. There is clearly a legal and a moral side to the
          covenant. The covenant may be regarded as an agreement between two
          parties, with mutual conditions and stipulations, and therefore as
          something in the legal sphere. The covenant in that sense may exist
          even when nothing is done to realize its purpose, namely the condition
          to which it points and for which it calls as the real ideal. The
          parties that live under this agreement are in the covenant, since they
          are subject to the mutual stipulations agreed upon. In the legal
          sphere everything is considered and regulated in a purely objective
          way. The determining factor in that sphere is simply the relation
          which has been established, and not the attitude which one assumes to
          that relation. The relation exists independently of one's inclination
          or disinclination, one's likes and dislikes, in connection with it. It
          would seem to be in the light of this distinction that the question
          should be answered, Who are in the covenant of grace? If the question
          is asked with the legal relationship, and that only, in mind, and
          really amounts to the query, Who are in duty bound to live in the
          covenant, and of whom may it be expected that they will do this?
          â€”the answer is, believers and their children. But if the question is
          asked with a view to the covenant as a communion of life, and assumes
          the quite different form, In whom does this legal relationship issue
          in a living communion with Christ? â€” the answer can only be, only in
          the regenerate, who are endowed with the principle of faith, that is,
          in the elect.
        </p>
        <p>
          This distinction is warranted by Scripture. It is hardly necessary to
          cite passages proving that the covenant is an objective compact in the
          legal sphere, for it is perfectly evident that we have such a compact
          wherever two parties agree as in the presence of God to perform
          certain things affecting their mutual relation, or one party promises
          to bestow certain benefits on the other, provided the latter fulfills
          the conditions that are laid down. That the covenant of grace is such
          a compact is abundantly evident from Scripture. There is the condition
          of faith, Gen_15:6, compared with Rom_4:3 ff., Rom_4:20 ff.; Hab_2:4;
          Gal_3:14-18; Heb_11:1-40; and there is also the promise of spiritual
          and eternal blessings, Gen_17:7; Gen_12:3; Isa_43:25; Eze_36:27;
          Rom_4:5 ff.; Gal_3:14; Gal_3:18. But it is also clear that the
          covenant in its full realization is something more than that, namely,
          a communion of life. This may be already symbolically expressed in the
          act of passing between the parts of the animals slain at the
          establishment of the covenant with Abraham, Gen_15:9-17. Moreover, it
          is indicated in such passages as Psa_25:14; Psa_89:33-34;
          Psa_103:17-18; Jer_31:33-34 (Heb_8:10-12); Eze_36:25-28; 2Co_6:16;
          Rev_21:2-3. Now the question arises as to the relation between the
          sinner's being under the "bond of the covenant" as a legal
          relationship and his living in the communion of the covenant. The two
          cannot be conceived of as existing alongside of each other without
          some inner connection, but must be regarded as being most intimately
          related to each other, in order to avoid all dualism. When one takes
          the covenant relation upon himself voluntarily, the two must naturally
          go together; if they do not, a false relation ensues. But in the case
          of those who are born in the covenant the question is more difficult.
          Is the one then possible without the other? Is the covenant in that
          case a bare legal relationship, in which that which ought to be â€”
          but is not â€” takes the place of the glorious realities for which the
          covenant stands? Is there any reasonable ground to expect that the
          covenant relation will issue in a living communion; that for the
          sinner, who is of himself unable to believe, the covenant will
          actually become a living reality? In answer to this question it may be
          said that God undoubtedly desires that the covenant relationship shall
          issue in a covenant life. And He Himself guarantees by His promises
          pertaining to the seed of believers that this will take place, not in
          the case of every individual, but in the seed of the covenant
          collectively. On the basis of the promise of God we may believe that,
          under a faithful administration of the covenant, the covenant relation
          will, as a rule, be fully realized in a covenant life.
        </p>
        <p>E. MEMBERSHIP IN THE COVENANT AS A LEGAL RELATIONSHIP.</p>
        <p>
          In discussing membership in the covenant as a legal relationship, it
          should be borne in mind that the covenant in this sense is not merely
          a system of demands and promises, demands that ought to be met, and
          promises that ought to be realized; but that it also includes a
          reasonable expectation that the external legal relationship will carry
          with it the glorious reality of a life in intimate communion with the
          covenant God. This is the only way in which the idea of the covenant
          is fully realized.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. ADULTS IN THE COVENANT. Adults can only enter this covenant
          voluntarily by faith and confession. From this it follows that in
          their case, unless their confession be false, entrance into the
          covenant as a legal relationship and into the covenant as a communion
          of life coincide. They not merely take upon themselves the performance
          of certain external duties; nor do they merely promise in addition to
          this, that they will exercise saving faith in the future; but they
          confess that they accept the covenant with a living faith, and that it
          is their desire and intention to continue in this faith. They enter
          upon the full covenant life at once therefore, and this is the only
          way in which they can enter the covenant. This truth is implicitly or
          explicitly denied by all those who connect the confession of faith
          with a merely external covenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CHILDREN OF BELIEVERS IN THE COVENANT. With respect to the children
          of believers, who enter the covenant by birth, the situation is, of
          course, somewhat different. Experience teaches that, though by birth
          they enter the covenant as a legal relationship, this does not
          necessarily mean that they are also at once in the covenant as a
          communion of life. It does not even mean that the covenant relation
          will ever come to its full realization in their lives. Yet even in
          their case there must be a reasonable assurance that the covenant is
          not or will not remain a mere legal relationship, with external duties
          and privileges, pointing to that which ought to be, but is also or
          will in time become a living reality. This assurance is based on the
          promise of God, which is absolutely reliable, that He will work in the
          hearts of the covenant youth with His saving grace and transform them
          into living members of the covenant. The covenant is more than the
          mere offer of salvation, more even than the offer of salvation plus
          the promise to believe the gospel. It also carries with it the
          assurance, based on the promises of God, who works in the children of
          the covenant "when, where, and how He pleaseth," that saving faith
          will be wrought in their hearts. As long as the children of the
          covenant do not reveal the contrary, we shall have to proceed on the
          assumption that they are in possession of the covenant life.
          Naturally, the course of events may prove that this life is not yet
          present; it may even prove that it is never realized in their lives.
          The promises of God are given to the seed of believers collectively,
          and not individually. God's promise to continue His covenant and to
          bring it to full realization in the children of believers, does not
          mean that He will endow every last one of them with saving faith. And
          if some of them continue in unbelief, we shall have to bear in mind
          what Paul says in Rom_9:6-8. They are not all Israel who are of
          Israel; the children of believers are not all children of promise.
          Hence it is necessary to remind even children of the covenant
          constantly of the necessity of regeneration and conversion. The mere
          fact that one is in the covenant does not carry with it the assurance
          of salvation. When the children of believers grow up and come to years
          of discretion, it is, of course, incumbent on them to accept their
          covenant responsibilities voluntarily by a true confession of faith.
          Failure to do this is, strictly speaking, a denial of their covenant
          relationship. It may be said therefore that the legal relationship in
          which the children of believers stand, precedes the covenant as a
          communion of life and is a means to its realization. But in
          emphasizing the significance of the covenant as a means to an end, we
          should not stress exclusively, nor even primarily, the demands of God
          and the resulting duty of man, but especially the promise of the
          effectual operation of the grace of God in the hearts of covenant
          children. If we stress the covenant responsibilities only or
          excessively, and fail to give due prominence to the fact that in the
          covenant God gives whatsoever He demands of us, in other words, that
          His promises cover all His requirements, we are in danger of falling
          into the snare of Arminianism.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. UNREGENERATE IN THE COVENANT. From the preceding it follows that
          even unregenerate and unconverted persons may be in the covenant.
          Ishmael and Esau were originally in the covenant, the wicked sons of
          Eli were covenant children, and the great majority of the Jews in the
          days of Jesus and the apostles belonged to the covenant people and
          shared in the covenant promises, though they did not follow the faith
          of their father Abraham. Hence the question arises, in what sense such
          persons may be regarded as being in the covenant. Dr. Kuyper says that
          they are not essential participants of the covenant, though they are
          really in it; and Dr. Bavinck says that they are in foedere (in the
          covenant), but not de foedere (of the covenant). The following may be
          said regarding their position in the covenant:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. They are in the covenant as far as their responsibility is
          concerned. Because they stand in the legal covenant relationship to
          God, they are in duty bound to repent and believe. If they do not turn
          to God and accept Christ by faith, when they come to years of
          discretion, they will be judged as breakers of the covenant. The
          special relationship in which they are placed to God, therefore, means
          added responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. They are in the covenant in the sense that they may lay claim to
          the promises which God gave when He established His covenant with
          believers and their seed. Paul even says of his wicked kinsmen, "whose
          is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of
          the law, and the service of God, and the promises," Rom_9:4. As a rule
          God gathers the number of His elect out of those who stand in this
          covenant relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. They are in the covenant in the sense that they are subject to the
          ministrations of the covenant. They are constantly admonished and
          exhorted to live according to the requirements of the covenant. The
          Church treats them as covenant children, offers them the seals of the
          covenant, and exhorts them to a proper use of these. They are the
          guests who are first called to the supper, the children of the
          kingdom, to whom the Word must be preached first of all, Mat_8:12;
          Luk_14:16-24; Act_13:46.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. They are in the covenant also as far as the common covenant
          blessings are concerned. Though they do not experience the
          regenerating influence of the Holy Spirit, yet they are subject to
          certain special operations and influences of the Holy Spirit. The
          Spirit strives with them in a special manner, convicts them of sin,
          enlightens them in a measure, and enriches them with the blessings of
          common grace, Gen_6:3; Mat_13:18-22; Heb_6:4-6.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that, while the covenant is an eternal and
          inviolable covenant, which God never nullifies, it is possible for
          those who are in the covenant to break it. If one who stands in the
          legal covenant relationship does not enter upon the covenant life, he
          is nevertheless regarded as a member of the covenant. His failure to
          meet the requirements of the covenant involves guilt and constitutes
          him a covenant breaker, Jer_31:32; Eze_44:7. This explains how there
          may be, not merely a temporary, but a final breaking of the covenant,
          though there is no falling away of the saints.
