            >Whether the term “free will” or self-determining (autexousiou)
            power should be retained in the Christian schools. And to what
            faculty of the soul does it properly belong—the intellect or
            will?</a

            has the power to incline itself to good, not only civil and
            externally moral, but internal and spiritual, answering accurately
            to the will of God prescribed in the law.</a
