          THIRD QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Whether the formal reason of free will consists in indifference or
            in rational spontaneity. The former we deny; the latter we affirm
            against papists, Socinians and Remonstrants</em
          >
        </p>
        <h2>Free will in the genus of being.</h2>
        <p>
          I. Free will can be viewed either in the genus of being and absolutely
          (as belonging to a rational being in every state); or in the genus of
          morals and in relation to various states (either of sin or of
          righteousness). In this question, we treat of it in the former sense;
          in the following, we will discuss it in the latter sense.
        </p>
        <h2>It is not placed in indifference, but in willingness.</h2>
        <p>
          II. Concerning the formal reason of free will, it can be disputed: (1)
          kat’ arsin and negatively that we may see in what it does not consist;
          (2) kata thesin and positively that it may be evident in what it does
          properly consist. As to the former, we must oppose the error of the
          adversaries who place its formal reason in indifference. As to the
          latter, we must establish the orthodox truth which asserts that it is
          placed in rational willingness.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We contend here against the Jesuits, Socinians and Remonstrants
          who (following Pelagius) place the essence of free will in
          indifference (adiaphoria) and are wont to define it as “the faculty by
          which all things requisite for acting being posited, the will can act
          or not act.” Now those are called requisites to action without which
          the action cannot be performed (such as the decree of God and his
          concourse; the judgment of the mind; and other circumstances which
          belong here).
        </p>
        <h2>Statement of the question.</h2>
        <p>
          IV. Hence it is evident that it is not inquired here concerning
          indifference in the first act or in a divided sense, as to
          simultaneity of power which is called passive and objective (to wit,
          whether the will considered absolutely from its natural constitution,
          the requisites to action being withdrawn, is determinable to various
          objects and holds itself indifferently towards them). We do not deny
          that the will of itself is so prepared that it can either elicit or
          suspend the act (which is the liberty of exercise and of
          contradiction) or be carried to both of opposite things (which is the
          liberty of contrariety and of specification). We also confess that the
          will is indifferent as long as the intellect remains doubtful and
          uncertain whither to tum itself. But concerning indifference in the
          second act and in a compound sense (as to simultaneity of power called
          active and subjective)—whether the will (all requisites to acting
          being posited; for example, the decree of God and his concourse; the
          judgment of the practical intellect, etc.) is always so indifferent
          and undetermined that it can act or not act. This our opponents
          pretend in order that its own liberty may be left to the will. We deny
          it.
        </p>
        <h2>Liberty does not consist in indifference.</h2>
        <p>
          V. First, such an indifference to opposites is found in no free agent,
          whether created or uncreated: neither in God, who is good most freely
          indeed, yet not indifferently (as if he could be evil), but
          necessarily and immutably; nor in Christ, who obeyed God most freely
          and yet most necessarily because he could not sin; nor in angels and
          the blessed, who worship God with the highest willingness and yet are
          necessarily determined to good; nor in devils and reprobates, who
          cannot help sinning, although they sin freely. So neither the
          constancy and immutability of the former in good destroys, but
          perfects their liberty; nor the inextricable obstinacy and firmness of
          the latter in evil prevents them from sinning most heinously and so
          deserving the heaviest punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. What objection can be made here? (1) Is the divine liberty the
          same as ours? We answer that just in proportion to God’s liberty being
          more perfect than ours, so ought it to be farther removed from
          indifference (which instead of being a virtue is a defect of liberty).
          (2) That Christ, although he never sinned, still was not absolutely
          unable to sin; and that it is not repugnant to his nature, will or
          office to be able to sin? This blasphemy Episcopius and other
          Remonstrants have not blushed to put forth. We answer that far be it
          from us either to think or say any such thing concerning the
          immaculate Son of God whom we know to have been holy (akakon),
          undefiled (amianton), separate from sinners; who not only had no
          intercourse with sin, but could not have both because he was the Son
          of God and because he was our Redeemer (who if he could have sinned,
          could not also have saved us). Nor if he could be miserable could he
          for the same reason be a sinner. Misery for a time is not opposed to
          his most holy nature and contributed to the execution of his office
          because he was bound to pay the punishment of our sin and so to bear
          it by suffering. But he could not deserve it. (3) That the liberty of
          the saints on earth and in heaven is different? We answer that since
          the formal reason of liberty ought to be the same as to essentials, if
          the latter have a most perfect liberty without indifference, it cannot
          be said to belong to its essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Second, the will can never be without determination as well
          extrinsic from the providence of God, as intrinsic from the judgment
          of the intellect (as has been shown). Bellarmine himself proves this
          by various arguments (“De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio,” 3.8 in Opera
          [1858], 4:338—40). Therefore when all the requisites for acting are
          posited, it cannot act or not act. Otherwise it would neither be
          created (because it would not depend upon God); nor rational (because
          it would act against the judgment of reason and seek evil as evil).
          Nor is it an objection that it is said to be of the nature of free
          will to determine itself (because subordinates do not contend against
          each other). It is indeed of the nature of the will to be determined
          by itself, but not by itself alone. Thus the determination of the will
          does not exclude, but supposes the determination of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Third, the volition of the highest good and of the ultimate end
          cannot be without the highest willingness. And yet it is not without
          great and unavoidable necessity. From the consent of our opponents
          themselves and the decisions of philosophers, we cannot abstain from
          seeking the highest good because no one can bring himself to wish to
          be miserable. Nor can it be said that free will is not occupied about
          the highest good or ultimate end, but only about the election of
          means. In the seeking for the highest good (true or false), the
          relation of virtue or of vice is principally situated. It is necessary
          that liberty (without which there is no relation either of virtue or
          of vice) should be occupied about it no less than about the means.
          Again, since the means are granted (having a necessary connection with
          the end and about whose election the will is occupied), it will be
          occupied freely indeed in electing them, but yet necessarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Fourth, the indifference of the will being assumed: (1) the use of
          prayers and exhortations is taken away because God is asked to convert
          and sanctify us in vain, exhortations are employed in vain, if (any
          action of God being posited) the will cannot be moved from a state of
          equilibrium, and it remains always in its power to convert itself or
          not; (2) the promises of God concerning the production of holiness,
          and the efficacy of grace would be vain because he could not perform
          what he promised; for whatever he would perform about the will, it
          would always remain in equilibrium and indifference (adiaphoria). Now
          how could he thus be said to give to will and to do and so make a new
          heart? (3) All our consolation is gone because in whatever manner God
          acts in us, we can never be certain of grace if it depends always upon
          the will to admit or reject it and thus to frustrate every operation
          of God. (4) The empire of God over the will is destroyed (which would
          be independent of its own right) if, all the requisites for acting
          being furnished, it can act or not act. So man will be the author and
          principal cause of his own conversion, not God, because all the
          operations of grace being supplied, the will will always be in
          equilibrium, nor be determined by any other than itself.
        </p>
        <h2>Liberty ts placed in willingness.</h2>
        <p>
          X. Since, therefore, the formal reason of liberty is not placed in
          indifference, it cannot be sought elsewhere than in rational
          willingness, by which man does what he pleases by a previous judgment
          of reason. Thus two things must here be joined together to its
          constitution: (1) the choice (to proairetikon) so that what is done is
          not done by a blind impulse and a certain brute instinct, but from
          choice (ek proaireseds) and the previous light of reason and the
          judgment of the practical intellect; (2) the voluntariness (to
          hekousion) so that what is done may be done spontaneously and freely
          and without compulsion. Hence the philosopher calls it hekousion
          probebouleumenon (Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics 3.2.17 [Loeb,
          132—33]).
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. That this is the formal reason of free will is plainly gathered
          from this that it agrees with all, alone and always. Thus there is no
          free agent (either created or uncreated) in which these two
          characteristics are not found; nor for a time only, but always, so
          that this rational willingness being posited, liberty is posited;
          removed it is taken away. Hence it follows that it is an inseparable
          adjunct of the rational agent, attending him in every state so that he
          cannot be rational without on that very account being free; nor can he
          be deprived of liberty without being despoiled also of reason. This
          also proves that free will absolutely considered and in the genus of
          being can never be taken away from man in whatever state he may be. If
          this is denied by some to man in a state of sin, it ought to be
          understood not so much physically and absolutely as morally and
          relatively (not so much with regard to essence, as with regard to
          strength, as will afterwards be shown).
        </p>
        <h2>Sources of solution.</h2>
        <p>
          XII. The principle of election can be in its own nature indifferent
          and undetermined in the divided sense—as to the first act and
          simultaneity of power; but not in the compound sense—as to the second
          act or the power of simultaneity. To be free, election ought to enjoy
          an immunity from coaction and physical necessity; but not from the
          extrinsic necessity of dependence upon God and the intrinsic of
          determination by the intellect. And so far is the determination to one
          thing (made by the reason) from taking away free election, that it
          rather makes it perfect. It therefore elects this or that because
          determined to it by a judgment of the intellect.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. The natural brute, not knowing itself, does not have a relation
          of vice or virtue; but only the natural rational. Sin is called
          natural not as nature is opposed to free will, but as nature is
          opposed to grace. A place is granted for obedience or disobedience
          even without indifference and with a determination to one (as in
          Christ immutably determined to obey the Father and in the devils
          necessarily determined to disobey him, yet still sinning most freely
          and worthy of the severest punishment). The nature of obedience is not
          placed in this—that man can obey or not obey; but in this —that man
          obeys freely and without compulsion from previous reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. So far is the use of exhortations and commands from being taken
          away by our opinion, that it is the rather more strongly asserted. For
          if it is certain that the will is determined by the intellect, the
          intellect must first be persuaded before it can influence the will.
          And yet how can it be persuaded except by reasons and exhortations?
          Although a compliance with the exhortation is impossible by us without
          grace; still not the less properly can it be addressed to us because
          it is a duty owed by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. That a place may be granted for reward or punishment, it is not
          necessary that there should be indifference in the will to either of
          two opposites. It suffices that there be a spontaneity and willingness
          depending upon a judgment of the reason (such as there is in all men).
