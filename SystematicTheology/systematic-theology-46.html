        <p>VI. Regeneration and Efectual Calling</p>
        <p>A. THE SCRIPTURAL TERMS FOR REGENERATION AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE TERMS THAT COME INTO CONSIDERATION. The Greek word for
          "regeneration" (palingenesia) is found only in Mat_19:28 and Tit_3:5;
          and only in the last named passage does it refer to the beginning of
          the new life in the individual Christian. The idea of this beginning
          is more commonly expressed by the verb gennao (with anothen in
          Joh_3:3), or its compositum anagennao. These words mean either to
          beget, to beget again, or to bear or give birth, Joh_1:13; Joh_3:3-8;
          1Pe_1:23; 1Jn_2:29; 1Jn_3:9; 1Jn_4:7; 1Jn_5:4; 1Jn_5:18. In one
          passage, namely, Jas_1:18, the word apokueo, to bear or bring forth,
          is employed. Furthermore, the thought of the production of a new life
          is expressed by the word ktizo, to create, Eph_2:10, and the product
          of this creation is called a kaine ktisis (a new creature), 2Co_5:17;
          Gal_6:15, or a kainos anthropos (a new man), Eph_4:24. Finally, the
          term suzoopoieo, to make alive with, to quicken with, is also used in
          a couple of passages, Eph_5:5; Col_2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE TERMS. These terms carry with them
          several important implications, to which attention should be directed.
          (a) Regeneration is a creative work of God, and is therefore a work in
          which man is purely passive, and in which there is no place for human
          co-operation. This is a very important point, since it stresses the
          fact that salvation is wholly of God. (b) The creative work of God
          produces a new life, in virtue of which man, made alive with Christ,
          shares the resurrection life, and can be called a new creature,
          "created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that
          we should walk in them," Eph_2:10. (c) Two elements must be
          distinguished in regeneration, namely, generation or the begetting of
          the new life, and bearing or bringing forth, by which the new life is
          brought forth out of its hidden depths. Generation implants the
          principle of the new life in the soul, and the new birth causes this
          principle to begin to assert itself in action. This distinction is of
          great importance for a proper understanding of regeneration.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE USE OF THE TERM "REGENERATION" IN THEOLOGY.</p>
        <p>
          1. IN THE EARLY CHURCH AND IN ROMAN CATHOLIC THEOLOGY. In the mind of
          the early Church the term "regeneration" did not stand for a sharply
          defined concept. It was used to denote a change closely connected with
          the washing away of sins, and no clear distinction was made between
          regeneration and justification. As identified with baptismal grace,
          the former was understood especially as a designation of the remission
          of sin, though the idea of a certain moral renovation was not
          excluded. Even Augustine did not draw a sharp line here, but did
          distinguish between regeneration and conversion. To him regeneration
          included, in addition to the remission of sin, only an initial change
          of the heart, followed by conversion later on. He conceived of it as a
          strictly monergistic work of God, in which the human subject cannot
          cooperate, and which man cannot resist. For Pelagius, of course,
          "regeneration" did not mean the birth of a new nature, but the
          forgiveness of sins in baptism, the illumination of the mind by the
          truth, and the stimulation of the will by divine promises. The
          confusion of regeneration and justification, already apparent in
          Augustine, became even more pronounced in Scholasticism. In fact,
          justification became the more prominent concept of the two, was
          thought of as including regeneration, and was conceived of as an act
          in which God and man co-operate. Justification, according to the
          common representation, included the infusion of grace, that is, the
          birth of a new creature or regeneration, and the forgiveness of sin
          and the removal of the guilt attaching to it. There was a difference
          of opinion, however, as to which of these two elements is the logical
          prius. According to Thomas Aquinas the infusion of grace is first, and
          the forgiveness of sins is, at least in a certain sense, based on
          this; but according to Duns Scotus the forgiveness of sin is first,
          and is basic to the infusion of grace. Both elements are effected by
          baptism ex opere operato. The opinion of Thomas Aquinas gained the
          upper hand in the Church. Up to the present time there is a certain
          confusion of regeneration and justification in the Roman Catholic
          Church, which is, no doubt, largely due to the fact that justification
          is not conceived as a forensic act, but as an act or process of
          renewal. In it man is not declared but made just. Says Wilmers in his
          Handbook of the Christian Religion: "As justification is a spiritual
          renewal and regeneration, it follows that sin is really destroyed by
          it, and not, as the Reformers maintained, merely covered, or no longer
          imputed."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. BY THE REFORMERS AND IN THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES. Luther did not
          entirely escape the confusion of regeneration with justification.
          Moreover, he spoke of regeneration or the new birth in a rather broad
          sense. Calvin also used the term in a very comprehensive sense as a
          designation of the whole process by which man is renewed, including,
          besides the divine act which originates the new life, also conversion
          (repentance and faith) and sanctification.44 Several seventeenth
          century authors fail to distinguish between regeneration and
          conversion, and use the two terms interchangeably, treating of what we
          now call regeneration under vocation or effectual calling. The Canons
          of Dort also use the two words synonymously,45 and the Belgic
          Confession seems to speak of regeneration in an even wider sense.46
          This comprehensive use of the term "regeneration" often led to
          confusion and to the disregard of very necessary distinctions. For
          instance, while regeneration and conversion were identified,
          regeneration was yet declared to be monergistic, in spite of the fact
          that in conversion man certainly co-operates. The distinction between
          regeneration and justification had already become clearer, but it
          gradually became necessary and customary also to employ the term
          "regeneration" in a more restricted sense. Turretin defines two kinds
          of conversion: first, a "habitual" or passive conversion, the
          production of a disposition or habit of the soul, which, he remarks,
          might better be called "regeneration"; and, secondly, an "actual" or
          "active" conversion, in which this implanted habit or disposition
          becomes active in faith and repentance. In present day Reformed
          theology the word "regeneration" is generally used in a more
          restricted sense, as a designation of that divine act by which the
          sinner is endowed with new spiritual life, and by which the principle
          of that new life is first called into action. So conceived, it
          includes both the "begetting again" and the "new birth," in which the
          new life becomes manifest. In strict harmony, however, with the
          literal meaning of the word "regeneration" the term is sometimes
          employed in an even more limited sense, to denote simply the
          implanting of the new life in the soul, apart from the first
          manifestations of this life. In modern liberal theology the term
          "regeneration' acquired a different meaning. Schleiermacher
          distinguished two aspects of regeneration, namely, conversion and
          justification, and held that in regeneration "a new religious
          consciousness is produced in the believer by the common Christian
          spirit of the community, and new life, or 'sanctification,' is
          prepared for." (Pfleiderer.) That "Christian spirit of the community"
          is the result of an influx of the divine life, through Christ, into
          the Church, and is called "the Holy Spirit" by Schleiermacher. The
          Modern view is well stated in these words of Youtz: "Modern
          interpretation inclines to return to the symbolical use of the
          conception of Regeneration. Our ethical realities deal with
          transformed characters. Regeneration expresses thus a radical, vital,
          ethical change, rather than an absolutely new metaphysical beginning.
          Regeneration is a vital step in the natural development of the
          spiritual life, a radical readjustment to the moral processes of
          life."47 Students of the Psychology of Religion generally fail to
          distinguish between regeneration and conversion. They regard it as a
          process in which man's attitude to life changes from the autocentric
          to the heterocentric. It finds its explanation primarily in the
          sub-conscious life, and does not necessarily involve anything
          supernatural. James says: "To be converted, to be regenerated, to
          receive grace, to experience religion, to gain an assurance, are so
          many phrases which denote the process, gradual or sudden, by which a
          self hitherto divided, and consciously wrong, inferior and unhappy,
          becomes unified and consciously right, superior and happy, in
          consequence of its firmer hold upon religious realities."48 According
          to Clark, "Students have agreed in discerning three distinct steps in
          conversion: (1) A period of 'storm and stress,' or sense of sin, or
          feeling of inward disharmony, known to theology as 'conviction of sin'
          and designated by James as 'soul sickness.' (2) An emotional crisis
          which marks a turning point. (3) A succeeding relaxation attended by a
          sense of peace, rest, inner harmony, acceptance with God, and not
          infrequently motor and sensory reflexes of various sorts."49

        <p>C. THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF REGENERATION.</p>
        <p>
          Relative to the nature of regeneration there are several
          misconceptions which should be avoided. It may be well to mention
          these first, before stating the positive qualifications of this
          re-creative work of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. MISCONCEPTIONS. (a) Regeneration is not a change in the substance
          of human nature, as was taught by the ManichÃ¦ans and in the days of
          the Reformation by Flacius Illyricus, who conceived of original sin as
          a substance, to be replaced by another substance in regeneration. No
          new physical seed or germ is implanted in man; neither is there any
          addition to, or subtraction from, the faculties of the soul. (b)
          Neither is it simply a change in one or more of the faculties of the
          soul, as, for instance, of the emotional life (feeling or heart), by
          removing the aversion to divine things, as some evangelicals conceive
          of it; or of the intellect, by illuminating the mind that is darkened
          by sin, as the Rationalists regard it. It affects the heart,
          understood in the Scriptural sense of the word, that is, as the
          central and all-controlling organ of the soul, out of which are the
          issues of life. This means that it affects human nature as a whole.
          (c) Nor is it a complete or perfect change of the whole nature of man,
          or of any part of it, so that it is no more capable of sin, as was
          taught by the extreme Anabaptists and by some other fanatical sects.
          This does not mean that it does not in principle affect the entire
          nature of man, but only that it does not constitute the whole change
          that is wrought in man by the operation of the Holy Spirit. It does
          not comprise conversion and sanctification.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. POSITIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF REGENERATION. The following positive
          assertions may be made respecting regeneration:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Regeneration consists in the implanting of the principle of the new
          spiritual life in man, in a radical change of the governing
          disposition of the soul, which, under the influence of the Holy
          Spirit, gives birth to a life that moves in a Godward direction. In
          principle this change affects the whole man: the intellect,
          1Co_2:14-15; 2Co_4:6; Eph_1:18; Col_3:10; the will, Psa_110:3;
          Php_2:13; 2Th_3:5; Heb_13:21; and the feelings or emotions,
          Psa_42:1-2; Mat_5:4; 1Pe_1:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It is an instantaneous change of man's nature, affecting at once
          the whole man, intellectually, emotionally, and morally. The assertion
          that regeneration is an instantaneous change implies two things: (1)
          that it is not a work that is gradually prepared in the soul, as the
          Roman Catholics and all Semi-Pelagians teach; there is no intermediate
          stage between life and death; one either lives or is dead; and (2)
          that it is not a gradual process like sanctification. It is true that
          some Reformed authors have occasionally used the term "regeneration"
          as including even sanctification, but that was in the days when the
          ordo salutis was not as fully developed as it is to-day.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. It is in its most limited sense a change that occurs in the
          sub-conscious life. It is a secret and inscrutable work of God that is
          never directly perceived by man. The change may take place without
          man's being conscious of it momentarily, though this is not the case
          when regeneration and conversion coincide; and even later on he can
          perceive it only in its effects. This explains the fact that a
          Christian may, on the one hand, struggle for a long time with doubts
          and uncertainties, and can yet, on the other hand, gradually overcome
          these and rise to the heights of assurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. DEFINITION OF REGENERATION. From what was said in the preceding
          respecting the present use of the word "regeneration," it follows that
          regeneration may be defined in two ways. In the strictest sense of the
          word we may say: Regeneration is that act of God by which the
          principle of the new life is implanted in man, and the governing
          disposition of the soul is made holy. But in order to include the idea
          of the new birth as well as that of the "begetting again," it will be
          necessary to complement the definition with the following words: . . .
          " and the first holy exercise of this new disposition is secured. "
        </p>
        <p>
          D. EFFECTUAL CALLING IN RELATION TO EXTERNAL CALLING AND REGENERATION.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. ITS INSEPARABLE CONNECTION WITH EXTERNAL CALLING. The calling of
          God may be said to be one, and the distinction between an external and
          an internal or effectual calling merely calls attention to the fact
          that this one calling has two aspects. This does not mean that these
          two aspects are always united and always go together. We do not aver
          with the Lutherans that "the inner call is always concurrent with the
          hearing of the word."50 It does mean, however, that where the inner
          call comes to adults, it is mediated by the preaching of the Word. It
          is the same Word that is heard in the external call, and that is made
          effective in the heart in the internal calling. Through the powerful
          application of the Holy Spirit the external call passes right into the
          internal.51 But while this calling is closely connected with the
          external call and forms a unit with it, there are certain points of
          difference: (a) It is a calling by the Word, savingly applied by the
          operation of the Holy Spirit, 1Co_1:23-24; 1Pe_2:9; (b) it is a
          powerful calling, that is, a calling that is effectual unto salvation,
          Act_13:48; 1Co_1:23-24; and (c) it is without repentance, that is, it
          is a call that is not subject to change and that is never withdrawn,
          Rom_11:29.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTERNAL CALL. The following characteristics
          should be noted:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. It works by moral suasion plus the powerful operation of the Holy
          Spirit. The question arises, whether in this calling (as distinguished
          from regeneration) the Word of God works in a creative way, or by
          moral suasion. Now there is no doubt about it that the Word of God is
          sometimes said to work in a creative manner, Gen_1:3; Psa_33:6;
          Psa_33:9; Psa_147:15; Rom_4:17 (though this may be interpreted
          differently). But these passages refer to the word of God's power, to
          His authoritative command, and not to the word of preaching with which
          we are concerned here. The Spirit of God operates through the
          preaching of the Word only in a morally persuasive way, making its
          persuasions effective, so that man listens to the voice of his God.
          This follows from the very nature of the Word, which addresses itself
          to the understanding and the will.52 It should be borne in mind,
          however, that this moral suasion does not yet constitute the whole of
          the internal call; there must be in addition to this a powerful
          operation of the Holy Spirit, applying the Word to the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. It operates in the conscious life of man. This point is most
          intimately connected with the preceding. If the word of preaching does
          not operate creatively, but only in a moral and persuasive way, it
          follows that it can work only in the conscious life of man. It
          addresses the understanding, which the Spirit endows with spiritual
          insight into the truth, and through the understanding influences the
          will effectively, so that the sinner turns to God. The internal
          calling necessarily issues in conversion, that is, in a conscious
          turning away from sin in the direction of holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. It is teleological. Internal calling is of a teleological
          character, that is, it calls man to a certain end: to the great goal
          to which the Holy Spirit is leading the elect, and, consequently also
          to the intermediate stages on the way to this final destiny. It is a
          calling to the fellowship of Jesus Christ, 1Co_1:9; to inherit
          blessing, 1Pe_3:9; to liberty, Gal_5:13; to peace, 1Co_7:15; to
          holiness, 1Th_4:7; to one hope, Eph_4:4; to eternal life, 1Ti_6:12;
          and to God's kingdom and glory, 1Th_2:12.
        </p>
        <p>3. THE RELATION OF EFFECTUAL CALLING TO REGENERATION.</p>
        <p>
          a. The identification of the two in seventeenth century theology. It
          is a well known fact that in seventeenth century theology effectual
          calling and regeneration are often identified, or if not entirely
          identified, then at least in so far that regeneration is regarded as
          included in calling. Several of the older theologians have a separate
          chapter on calling, but none on regeneration. According to the
          Westminster Confession, X. 2, effectual calling includes regeneration.
          This view finds some justification in the fact that Paul, who uses the
          term "regeneration" but once, evidently conceives of it as included in
          calling in Rom_8:30. Moreover, there is a sense in which calling and
          regeneration are related as cause and effect. It should be borne in
          mind, however, that in speaking of calling as including, or as being
          causally related to, regeneration, we do not have in mind merely what
          is technically termed internal or effectual calling, but calling in
          general, including even a creative calling. The extensive use in
          Post-Reformation times of the term "calling" rather than
          "regeneration," to designate the beginning of the work of grace in the
          life of sinners, was due to a desire to stress the close connection
          between the Word of God and the operation of His grace. And the
          prevalence of the term "calling" in the apostolic age finds its
          explanation and justification in the fact that, in the case of those
          who were in that missionary period gathered into the Church,
          regeneration and effectual calling were generally simultaneous, while
          the change was reflected in their conscious life as a powerful calling
          from God. In a systematic presentation of the truth, however, we
          should carefully discriminate between calling and regeneration.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Points of difference between regeneration and effectual calling.
          Regeneration in the strictest sense of the word, that is, as the
          begetting again, takes place in the sub-conscious life of man, and is
          quite independent of any attitude which he may assume with reference
          to it. Calling, on the other hand, addresses itself to the
          consciousness, and implies a certain disposition of the conscious
          life. This follows from the fact that regeneration works from within,
          while calling comes from without. In the case of children we speak of
          regeneration rather than calling. Furthermore, regeneration is a
          creative, a hyper-physical operation of the Holy Spirit, by which man
          is brought from one condition into another, from a condition of
          spiritual death into a condition of spiritual life. Effectual calling,
          on the other hand, is teleological, draws out the new life and points
          it in a God-ward direction. It secures the exercises of the new
          disposition and brings the new life into action.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The relative order of calling and regeneration. This is perhaps
          best understood, if we note the following stages: (1) Logically, the
          external call in the preaching of the Word (except in the case of
          children) generally precedes or coincides with the operation of the
          Holy Spirit, by which the new life is produced in the soul of man. (2)
          Then by a creative word God generates the new life, changing the inner
          disposition of the soul, illuminating the mind, rousing the feelings,
          and renewing the will. In this act of God the ear is implanted that
          enables man to hear the call of God to the salvation of his soul. This
          is regeneration in the most restricted sense of the word. In it man is
          entirely passive. (3) Having received the spiritual ear, the call of
          God in the gospel is now heard by the sinner, and is brought home
          effectively to the heart. The desire to resist has been changed to a
          desire to obey, and the sinner yields to the persuasive influence of
          the Word through the operation of the Holy Spirit. This is the
          effectual calling through the instrumentality of the word of
          preaching, effectively applied by the Spirit of God. (4) This
          effectual calling, finally, secures, through the truth as a means, the
          first holy exercises of the new disposition that is born in the soul.
          The new life begins to manifest itself; the implanted life issues in
          the new birth. This is the completion of the work of regeneration in
          the broader sense of the word, and the point at which it turns into
          conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we should not make the mistake of regarding this logical order as
          a temporal order that will apply in all cases. The new life is often
          implanted in the hearts of children long before they are able to hear
          the call of the gospel; yet they are endowed with this life only where
          the gospel is preached. There is, of course, always a creative call of
          God by which the new life is produced. In the case of those who live
          under the administration of the gospel the possibility exists that
          they receive the seed of regeneration long before they come to years
          of discretion and therefore also long before the effectual calling
          penetrates to their consciousness. It is very unlikely, however, that,
          being regenerated, they will live in sin for years, even after they
          have come to maturity, and give no evidences at all of the new life
          that is in them. On the other hand, in the case of those who do not
          live under the administration of the covenant, there is no reason to
          assume an interval between the time of their regeneration and that of
          their effectual calling. In the effectual call they at once become
          conscious of their renewal, and immediately find the seed of
          regeneration germinating into the new life. This means that
          regeneration, effective calling, and conversion all coincide.
        </p>
        <p>E. THE NECESSITY OF REGENERATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. THIS NECESSITY IS DENIED BY MODERN LIBERAL THEOLOGY. The necessity
          of regeneration, as this is understood by the Christian Church, is
          naturally denied in modern liberal theology. It is not in accord with
          the teaching of Rousseau, that man is by nature good. Any radical
          change or complete turnabout in the life of a man who is essentially
          good, would be a change for the worse. Liberals speak of salvation by
          character, and the only regeneration of which they know is a
          regeneration conceived as "a vital step in the natural development of
          the spiritual life, a radical readjustment to the moral processes of
          life." (Youtz.) Many teach a series of ethical renewals. Emerton says:
          "The character thus gained and proven and held fast is redemption.
          There is no other worthy definition of the word. It is the redemption
          of man's lower self by the domination of his higher self. It is the
          spiritual redeeming the material, the divine that is in every man
          redeeming the animal."53
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IT FOLLOWS FROM WHAT SCRIPTURE TEACHES CONCERNING THE NATURAL
          CONDITION OF MAN. Holiness or conformity to the divine law is the
          indispensable condition of securing divine favor, attaining peace of
          conscience, and enjoying fellowship with God. Heb_12:14. Now the
          condition of man by nature is, according to Scripture, both in
          disposition and act, exactly the opposite of that holiness which is so
          indispensable. Man is described as dead through trespasses and sins,
          Eph_2:1, and this condition calls for nothing less than a restoration
          to life. A radical internal change is necessary, a change by which the
          whole disposition of the soul is altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IT IS ALSO EXPRESSLY ASSERTED BY SCRIPTURE. Scripture does not
          leave us in doubt about the necessity of regeneration, but asserts
          this in the clearest terms. Jesus says: "Verily, verily, I say unto
          thee, Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God,"
          Joh_3:3. 54 This statement of the Saviour is absolute and leaves no
          room for exceptions. The same truth is clearly brought out in some of
          the statements of Paul, as, for instance, in 1Co_2:14 : "But the
          natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
          are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
          spiritually discerned"; Gal_6:15 : "For in Christ Jesus neither is
          circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." Cf.
          also Jer_13:23; Rom_3:11; Eph_2:3-4.
        </p>
        <p>F. THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF REGENERATION.</p>
        <p>
          There are only three fundamentally different views that come into
          consideration here, and all the others are modifications of these.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE HUMAN WILL. According to the Pelagian conception regeneration
          is solely an act of the human will, and is practically identical with
          self-reformation. With some slight differences this is the view of
          modern liberal theology. A modification of this view is that of the
          Semi-Pelagian and Arminian, who regard it as, at least in part, an act
          of man, co-operating with divine influences applied through the truth.
          This is the synergistic theory of regeneration. Both of these views
          involve a denial of the total depravity of man, so plainly taught in
          the Word of God, Joh_5:42; Rom_3:9-18; Rom_7:18; Rom_7:23; Rom_8:7;
          2Ti_3:4, and of the Scripture truth that it is God who inclines the
          will, Rom_9:16; Php_2:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE TRUTH. According to this view the truth as a system of motives,
          presented to the human will by the Holy Spirit, is the immediate cause
          of the change from unholiness to holiness. This was the view of Lyman
          Beecher and of Charles G. Finney. It assumes that the work of the Holy
          Spirit differs from that of the preacher only in degree. Both work by
          persuasion only. But this theory is quite unsatisfactory. The truth
          can be a motive to holiness only if it is loved, while the natural man
          does not love the truth, but hates it, Rom_1:18; Rom_1:25.
          Consequently the truth, presented externally, cannot be the efficient
          cause of regeneration.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE HOLY SPIRIT. The only adequate view is that of the Church of
          all ages, that the Holy Spirit is the efficient cause of regeneration.
          This means that the Holy Spirit works directly on the heart of man and
          changes its spiritual condition. There is no co-operation of the
          sinner in this work whatsoever. It is the work of the Holy Spirit
          directly and exclusively, Eze_11:19; Joh_1:13; Act_16:14; Rom_9:16;
          Php_2:13. Regeneration, then, is to be conceived monergistically. God
          alone works, and the sinner has no part in it whatsoever. This, of
          course, does not mean, that man does not co-operate in later stages of
          the work of redemption. It is quite evident from Scripture that he
          does.
        </p>
        <p>G. THE USE OF THE WORD OF GOD AS AN INSTRUMENT IN REGENERATION.</p>
        <p>
          The question arises, whether the Word of God is used as a means in
          regeneration or not; or, as it is frequently put, whether regeneration
          is mediate or immediate.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE PROPER IMPORT OF THE QUESTION. Careful discrimination is
          required, in order to avoid misunderstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. When the older Reformed theologians insisted on the immediate
          character of regeneration, they often gave the term "immediate" a
          connotation which it does not have to-day. Some of the representatives
          of the school of Saumur, as Cameron and Pajon, taught that in
          regeneration the Holy Spirit supernaturally illumines and convinces
          the mind or the intellect in such a powerful manner that the will
          cannot fail to follow the prevalent dictate of the practical judgment.
          He works immediately only on the intellect, and through this mediately
          on the will. According to them there is no immediate operation of the
          Holy Spirit on the will of man. In opposition to these men, Reformed
          theologians generally stressed the fact that in regeneration the Holy
          Spirit also operates directly on the will of man, and not merely
          through the mediation of the intellect. Today the question of mediate
          or immediate regeneration is a slightly different, though related,
          one. It is the question of the use of the Word of God as a means in
          the work of regeneration.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The exact form of the question ought to be carefully noted. The
          question is not, whether God works regeneration by means of a creative
          word. It is generally admitted that He does. Neither is it, whether He
          employs the word of truth, the word of preaching in the new birth as
          distinguished from the divine begetting of the new man, that is, in
          securing the first holy exercises of the new life. The real question
          is, whether God, in implanting or generating the new life, employs the
          word of Scripture or the word of preaching as an instrument or means.
          The discussion of this matter often suffered in the past from the lack
          of proper discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. CONSIDERATIONS THAT FAVOR A NEGATIVE ANSWER. Dr. Shedd says: "The
          influence of the Holy Spirit is distinguishable from that of the
          truth; from that of man upon man; and from that of any instrument or
          means whatever. His energy acts directly upon the human soul itself.
          It is the influence of spirit upon spirit; of one of the trinitarian
          persons upon a human person. Neither the truth, nor a fellow-man, can
          thus operate directly upon the essence of the soul itself."55 The
          following considerations favor this view:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Regeneration is a creative act, by which the spiritually dead
          sinner is restored to life. But the truth of the gospel can only work
          in a moral and persuasive way. Such an instrument has no effect on the
          dead. To assert its use would seem to imply a denial of the spiritual
          death of man; which, of course, is not intended by those who take this
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Regeneration takes place in the sphere of the sub-conscious, that
          is, outside of the sphere of conscious attention, while the truth
          addresses itself to the consciousness of man. It can exercise its
          persuasive influence only when man's attention is fixed on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The Bible distinguishes the influence of the Holy Spirit from that
          of the Word of God, and declares that such an influence is necessary
          for the proper reception of the truth, Joh_6:64-65; Act_16:14;
          1Co_2:12-15; Eph_1:17-20. Notice particularly the case of Lydia, of
          whom Luke says: "She heard us (ekouen, impf.), whose heart the Lord
          opened (dienoixen, aor., single act), that she attended (prosechein
          inf. of result or purpose) unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
        </p>
        <p>3. SCRIPTURE PASSAGES THAT SEEM TO PROVE THE CONTRARY.</p>
        <p>
          a. In Jas_1:18 we read: "Of his own will he brought us forth by the
          word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His
          creatures." This passage does not prove that the new generation is
          mediated by the Word of God, for the term here used is apokuesen,
          which does not refer to begetting, but to giving birth. They who
          believe in immediate regeneration do not deny that the new birth, in
          which the new life first becomes manifest, is secured by the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Peter exhorts believers to love one another fervently in view of
          the fact that they have been "begotten again, not of corruptible seed,
          but of incorruptible, through the Word of God, which liveth and
          abideth." 1Pe_1:23. It is not correct to say, as some have done, that
          "the Word" in this verse is the creative word, or the second person in
          the Trinity, for Peter himself informs us that he has in mind the word
          that was preached unto the readers, 1Pe_1:25. But it is perfectly in
          order to point out that even gennao (the word here used) does not
          always refer to the masculine begetting, but may also denote the
          feminine giving birth to children. This is perfectly evident from such
          passages as Luk_1:13; Luk_1:57; Luk_23:29; Joh_16:21; Gal_4:24.
          Consequently, there is no warrant for the assertion that Peter in this
          passage refers to the initial act in regeneration, namely, the
          begetting. And if it refers to regeneration in a broader sense, then
          the passage offers no difficulty whatsoever in connection with the
          matter under consideration. The idea that it refers to the new birth
          here, is favored by the fact that the readers are represented as
          having been born again out of a seed that was evidently already
          implanted in the soul, cf. Joh_1:13. It is not necessary to identify
          the seed with the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The Parable of the Sower is sometimes urged in favor of the idea
          that regeneration takes place through the Word. The seed in this
          parable is the word of the kingdom. The argument is that the life is
          in the seed and comes forth out of the seed. Consequently, the new
          life comes forth out of the seed of the Word of God. But, in the first
          place, this is over-shooting the mark, for it will hardly do to say
          that the Spirit or the principle of the new life is shut up in the
          Word, just as the living germ is shut up in the seed. This reminds one
          somewhat of the Lutheran conception of calling, according to which the
          Spirit is in the Word so that the call would always be effective, if
          man did not put a stumbling-block in the way. And, in the second
          place, this is pressing a point which is not at all in the tertium
          comparationis. The Saviour wants to explain in this parable how it
          comes about that the seed of the Word bears fruit in some cases, and
          not in others. It bears fruit only in those cases in which it falls in
          good ground, in hearts so prepared that they understand the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE RELEVANT TEACHINGS OF OUR CONFESSIONAL STANDARDS. The following
          passages come into consideration here: Conf. Belg., Articles XXIV and
          XXXV; Heid. Cat., Q. 54; Canons of Dort, III and IV, Articles
          11,12,17; and, finally, the Conclusions of Utrecht, adopted by our
          Church in 1908. From these passages it is perfectly evident that our
          confessional writings speak of regeneration in a broad sense, as
          including both the origin of the new life and its manifestation in
          conversion. We are even told that faith regenerates the sinner.56
          There are passages which seem to say that the Word of God is
          instrumental in the work of regeneration.57 Yet they are couched in
          such language that it still remains doubtful, whether they actually
          teach that the principle of the new life is implanted in the soul by
          the instrumentality of the Word. They fail to discriminate carefully
          between the various elements which we distinguish in regeneration. In
          the Conclusions of Utrecht we read: "As far as the third point, that
          of immediate regeneration, is concerned, Synod declares that this
          expression can be used in a good sense, in so far as our churches have
          always confessed, over against the Lutheran and the Roman Catholic
          Church, that regeneration is not effected through the Word or the
          Sacraments as such, but by the almighty regenerating work of the Holy
          Spirit; that this regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, however, may
          not in that sense be divorced from the preaching of the Word, as if
          both were separated from each other; for, although our Confession
          teaches that we need not be in doubt respecting the salvation of our
          children which die in infancy, though they have not heard the
          preaching of the gospel, and our confessional standards nowhere
          express themselves as to the manner in which regeneration is effected
          in the case of these and other children, â€” yet it is, on the other
          hand, certain that the gospel is a power of God unto salvation for
          every one who believes, and that in the case of adults the
          regenerating work of the Holy Spirit accompanies the preaching of the
          gospel."58
        </p>
        <p>H. DIVERGENT VIEWS OF REGENERATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. THE PELAGIAN VIEW. According to the Pelagians man's freedom and
          personal responsibility implies that he is at all times just as able
          to desist from sin as to commit sin. Only acts of conscious volition
          are regarded as sin. Consequently, regeneration simply consists in
          moral reformation. It means that the man who formerly chose to
          transgress the law, now chooses to live in obedience to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. BAPTISMAL REGENERATION. This is not always represented in the same
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In the Church of Rome. According to the Roman Catholic Church
          regeneration includes not only spiritual renewal, but also
          justification or the forgiveness of sins, and is effected by means of
          baptism. In the case of children the work of regeneration is always
          effective; not so in the case of adults. These can gratefully accept
          and utilize the grace of regeneration, but can also resist it and make
          it ineffective. Moreover, it is always possible that they who have
          appropriated it will lose it again.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the Anglican Church. The Church of England is not unanimous on
          this point, but represents two different tendencies. The so-called
          Puseyites are in essential agreement with the Church of Rome. But
          there is also an influential party in the Church which distinguishes
          two kinds of regeneration: the one consisting merely in a change of
          one's relation to the Church and the means of grace; and the other, in
          a fundamental change of human nature. According to this party only the
          former is effected by baptism. This regeneration includes no spiritual
          renewal. By means of it man merely enters into a new relation to the
          Church, and becomes a child of God in the same sense in which the Jews
          became children of God through the covenant of which circumcision was
          a seal.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In the Lutheran Church. Luther and his followers did not succeed in
          purging their Church from the leaven of Rome on this point. On the
          whole the Lutherans maintain, in opposition to Rome, the monergistic
          character of regeneration. They regard man as entirely passive in
          regeneration and incapable of contributing anything to it, though
          adults can resist it for a long time. At the same time some teach that
          baptism, working ex opere operato, is the usual means by which God
          effects regeneration. It is the usual, but not the only means, for the
          preaching of the Word may also produce it. They speak of two kinds of
          regeneration, namely, regeneratio prima by which the new life is
          begotten, and the regeneratio secunda orrenovatio, by which the new
          life is led in a God-ward direction. While children receive the
          regeneratio prima by means of baptism, adults, who receive the first
          regeneration by means of the Word, become partakers of the regeneratio
          secunda through baptism. According to the Lutherans regeneration is
          amissible. But through the grace of God it can be restored in the
          heart of the penitent sinner, and that without re-baptism. Baptism is
          a pledge of God's continued readiness to renew the baptized and to
          pardon his sins. Moreover, regeneration is not always accomplished at
          once, but is often a gradual process in the life of adults.

          3. THE ARMINIAN VIEW. According to the Arminians regeneration is not
          exclusively a work of God, nor exclusively a work of man. It is the
          fruit of man's choice to co-operate with the divine influences exerted
          by means of the truth. Strictly speaking, the work of man is prior to
          that of God. They do not assume that there is a preceding work of God
          by which the will is inclined to the good. Naturally, they also
          believe that the grace of regeneration can be lost. The Wesleyan
          Arminians altered this view in so far that they stress the fact that
          regeneration is the work of the Holy Spirit, be it in co-operation
          with the human will. They do assume a prior operation of the Holy
          Spirit to enlighten, awaken, and draw man. However, they also believe
          that man can resist this work of the Holy Spirit, and that, as long as
          he does this, he remains in his unregenerate condition.

          4. THE VIEW OF THE MEDIATING THEOLOGIANS. This is cast in a
          pantheistic mold. After the incarnation there are no two separate
          natures in Christ, but only a divine-human nature, a fusion of divine
          and human life. In regeneration a part of that divine-human life
          passes over into the sinner. This does not require a separate
          operation of the Holy Spirit whenever a sinner is regenerated. The new
          life has been communicated to the Church once for all, is now the
          permanent possession of the Church, and passes from the Church into
          the individual. Communion with the Church also insures participation
          of the new life. This view ignores the legal aspect of the work of
          Christ entirely. Moreover, it makes it impossible to hold that any one
          could be regenerated before the divine-human life of Christ came into
          existence. The Old Testament saints cannot have been regenerated.
          Schleiermacher is the father of this view.

          5. THE TRICHOTOMIC VIEW. Some theologians constructed a peculiar
          theory of regeneration on the basis of the trichotomic view of human
          nature. This view proceeds on the assumption that man consists of
          three parts, â€” body, soul, and spirit. It is generally assumed,
          though there are variations on this point, that sin has its seat only
          in the soul, and not in the spirit (pneuma). If it had penetrated to
          the spirit, man would have been irretrievably lost, just as the
          devils, who are pure spiritual beings. The spirit is the higher,
          divine life in man, destined to control the lower life. By the
          entrance of sin into the world the influence of the spirit on the
          lower life is weakened very much; but by regeneration it is
          strengthened again and harmony is restored in the life of man. This
          is, of course, a purely rationalistic theory.59

          6. THE VIEW OF MODERN LIBERALISM. The liberal theologians of the
          present day do not all have the same view of regeneration. Some of
          them speak in terms that remind one of Schleiermacher. More generally,
          however, they sponsor a purely naturalistic view. They are averse to
          the idea that regeneration is a supernatural and recreative work of
          God. In virtue of the immanent God every man has a divine principle
          within him and thus possesses potentially all that is necessary unto
          salvation. The one thing that is necessary, is that man become
          conscious of his potential divinity, and that he consciously yield to
          the guidance of the higher principle within him. Regeneration is
          simply an ethical change of character.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What other terms and expressions does the
          Bible use to designate the work of regeneration? Does the Bible
          sharply distinguish between calling, regeneration, conversion, and
          sanctification? How do you account for it that the Roman Catholic
          Church includes even justification in regeneration? How do
          regeneration and conversion differ? Is there such a thing as
          prevenient grace, preceding and preparing for regeneration? What is
          active, as distinguished from passive, regeneration? Does man's
          passivity in regeneration last for any length of time? Does not the
          view that the Word of God is not instrumental in effecting
          regeneration, make the preaching of the Word seem futile and quite
          unnecessary? Does it not lead to the verge of mysticism?
