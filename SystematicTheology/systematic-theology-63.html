        <p>I. Physical Death</p>
        <p>
          The Scriptural idea of death includes physical, spiritual, and eternal
          death. Physical and spiritual death are naturally discussed in
          connection with the doctrine of sin, and eternal death is considered
          more particularly in general eschatology. For that reason a discussion
          of death in any sense of the word might seem to be out of place in
          individual eschatology. Yet it can hardly be left out of consideration
          altogether in an attempt to link up past generations with the final
          consummation.
        </p>
        <p>A. THE NATURE OF PHYSICAL DEATH.</p>
        <p>
          The Bible contains some instructive indications as to the nature of
          physical death. It speaks of this in various ways. In Mat_10:28;
          Luk_12:4, it is spoken of as the death of the body, as distinguished
          from that of the soul (psuche). Here the body is considered as a
          living organism, and the psuche is evidently the pneuma of man, the
          spiritual element which is the principle of his natural life. This
          view of natural death also underlies the language of Peter in
          1Pe_3:14-18. In other passages it is described as the termination of
          the psuche, that is, of animal life or living, or as the loss of this,
          Mat_2:20; Mar_3:4; Luk_6:9; Luk_14:26; Joh_12:25; Joh_13:37-38;
          Act_15:26; Act_20:24, and other passages.5 And, finally, it is also
          represented as a separation of body and soul, Ecc_12:7 (comp.
          Gen_2:7); Jas_2:26, an idea that is also basic to such passages as
          Joh_19:30; Act_7:59; Php_1:23. Cf. also the use of exodus in Luk_9:31;
          2Pe_1:15-16. In view of all this it may be said that, according to
          Scripture, physical death is a termination of physical life by the
          separation of body and soul. It is never an annihilation, though some
          sects represent the death of the wicked as such. God does not
          annihilate anything in His creation. Death is not a cessation of
          existence, but a severance of the natural relations of life. Life and
          death are not opposed to each other as existence and non-existence,
          but are opposites only as different modes of existence. It is quite
          impossible to say exactly what death is. We speak of it as the
          cessation of physical life, but then the question immediately arises,
          Just what is life? And we have no answer. We do not know what life is
          in its essential being, but know it only in its relations and actions.
          And experience teaches us that, where these are severed and cease,
          death enters. Death means a break in the natural relations of life. It
          may be said that sin is per se death, because it represents a break in
          the vital relation in which man, as created in the image of God,
          stands to his Maker. It means the loss of that image, and consequently
          disturbs all the relations of life. This break is also carried through
          in that separation of body and soul which is called physical death.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE CONNECTION OF SIN AND DEATH.</p>
        <p>
          Pelagians and Socinians teach that man was created mortal, not merely
          in the sense that he could fall a prey to death, but in the sense that
          he was, in virtue of his creation, under the law of death, and in
          course of time was bound to die. This means that Adam was not only
          susceptible to death, but was actually subject to it before he fell.
          The advocates of this view were prompted primarily by the desire to
          evade the proof for original sin derived from the suffering and death
          of infants. Present day science seems to support this position by
          stressing the fact that death is the law of organized matter, since it
          carries within it the seed of decay and dissolution. Some of the early
          Church Fathers and some later theologians, such as Warburton and
          Laidlaw, take the position that Adam was indeed created mortal, that
          is, subject to the law of dissolution, but that the law was effective
          in his case only because he sinned. If he had proved himself to be
          obedient, he would have been exalted to a state of immortality. His
          sin brought about no change in his constitutional being in this
          respect, but under the sentence of God left him subject to the law of
          death, and robbed him of the boon of immortality, which he might have
          had without experiencing death. On this view the actual entrance of
          death, of course, remains penal. It is a view which might be made to
          fit in very well with the supralapsarian position, but is not demanded
          by this. In reality this theory merely seeks to square the facts, as
          they are revealed in the Word of God, with the dicta of science, but
          even these do not make it imperative. Suppose that science had proved
          conclusively that death reigned in the vegetable and animal world
          before the entrance of sin, then it would not yet necessarily follow
          that it also prevailed in the world of rational and moral beings. And
          even if it were established beyond the shadow of a doubt that all
          physical organisms, the human included, now carry within them the
          seeds of dissolution, this would not yet prove that man was not an
          exception to the rule before the fall. Shall we say that the almighty
          power of God, by which the universe was created, was not sufficient to
          continue man in life indefinitely? Moreover we ought to bear in mind
          the following Scriptural data: (1) Man was created in the image of God
          and this, in view of the perfect condition in which the image of God
          existed originally, would seem to exclude the possibility of his
          carrying within him the seeds of dissolution and mortality. (2)
          Physical death is not represented in Scripture as the natural result
          of the continuation of the original condition of man, due to his
          failure to rise to the height of immortality by the path of obedience;
          but as the result of his spiritual death, Rom_6:23; Rom_5:21;
          1Co_15:56; Jas_1:15. (3) Scriptural expressions certainly point to
          death as something introduced into the world of humanity by sin, and
          as a positive punishment for sin, Gen_2:17; Gen_3:19; Rom_5:12;
          Rom_5:17; 1Co_15:21; Jas_1:15. (4) Death is not represented as
          something natural in the life of man, a mere falling short of an
          ideal, but very decidedly as something foreign and hostile to human
          life: it is an expression of divine anger, Psa_90:7; Psa_90:11, a
          judgment, Rom_1:32, a condemnation, Rom_5:16, and a curse, Gal_3:13,
          and fills the hearts of the children of men with dread and fear, just
          because it is felt to be something unnatural. All this does not mean,
          however, that there may not have been death in some sense of the word
          in the lower creation apart from sin, but even there the entrance of
          sin evidently brought a bondage of corruption that was foreign to the
          creature, Rom_8:20-22. In strict justice God might have imposed death
          on man in the fullest sense of the word immediately after his
          transgression, Gen_2:17. But by His common grace He restrained the
          operation of sin and death, and by His special grace in Christ Jesus
          He conquered these hostile forces, Rom_5:17; 1Co_15:45; 2Ti_1:10;
          Heb_2:14; Rev_1:18 ; Rev_20:14. Death now accomplishes its work fully
          only in the lives of those who refuse the deliverance from it that is
          offered in Jesus Christ. Those who believe in Christ are freed from
          the power of death, are restored to communion with God, and are
          endowed with an endless life, Joh_3:36; Joh_6:40; Rom_5:17-21;
          Rom_8:23; 1Co_15:26; 1Co_15:51-57; Rev_20:14; Rev_21:3-4.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEATH OF BELIEVERS.</p>
        <p>
          The Bible speaks of physical death as a punishment, as "the wages of
          sin." Since believers are justified, however, and are no more under
          obligation to render any penal satisfaction, the question naturally
          arises, Why must they die? It is quite evident that for them the penal
          element is removed from death. They are no more under the law, either
          as a requirement of the covenant of works or as a condemning power,
          since they have obtained a complete pardon for all their sins. Christ
          became a curse for them, and thus removed the penalty of sin. But if
          this is so, why does God still deem it necessary to lead them through
          the harrowing experience of death? Why does He not simply transfer
          them to heaven at once? It cannot be said that the destruction of the
          body is absolutely essential to a perfect sanctification, since that
          is contradicted by the examples of Enoch and Elijah. Neither does it
          satisfy to say that death sets the believer free from the ills and
          sufferings of the present life, and from the trammels of the dust, by
          liberating the spirit from the present coarse and sensual body. God
          might effect this deliverance also by a sudden transformation, such as
          living saints will experience at the time of the parousia. It is quite
          evident that the death of believers must be regarded as the
          culmination of the chastisements which God has ordained for the
          sanctification of His people. While death in itself remains a real
          natural evil for the children of God, something unnatural, which is
          dreaded by them as such, it is made subservient in the economy of
          grace to their spiritual advancement and to the best interests of the
          Kingdom of God. The very thought of death, bereavements through death,
          the feeling that sicknesses and sufferings are harbingers of death,
          and the consciousness of the approach of death, â€” all have a very
          beneficial effect on the people of God. They serve to humble the
          proud, to mortify carnality, to check worldliness and to foster
          spiritual-mindedness. In the mystical union with their Lord believers
          are made to share the experiences of Christ. Just as He entered upon
          His glory by the pathway of sufferings and death, they too can enter
          upon their eternal reward only through sanctification. Death is often
          the supreme test of the strength of the faith that is in them, and
          frequently calls forth striking manifestations of the consciousness of
          victory in the very hour of seeming defeat, 1Pe_4:12-13. It completes
          the sanctification of the souls of believers, so that they become at
          once "the spirits of just men made perfect," Heb_12:23; Rev_21:27.
          Death is not the end for believers, but the beginning of a perfect
          life. They enter death with the assurance that its sting has been
          removed, 1Co_15:55, and that it is for them the gateway of heaven.
          They fall asleep in Jesus, 2Th_1:7, and know that even their bodies
          will at last be snatched out of the power of death, to be forever with
          the Lord, Rom_8:11; 1Th_4:16-17. Jesus said, "He that believeth on me,
          though he die, yet shall he live." And Paul had the blessed
          consciousness that for him to live was Christ, and to die was gain.
          Hence he could also speak in jubilant notes at the end of his career:
          "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept
          the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
          righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give to me
          at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved
          His appearing," 2Ti_4:7-8.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What is the fundamental idea of the
          Biblical conception of death? Is death merely the natural result of
          sin, or is it a positive punishment for sin? If it is the latter, how
          can this be proved from Scripture? In what sense was man, as he was
          created by God, mortal; and in what sense, immortal? How can you
          disprove the position of the Pelagians? In what sense has death really
          ceased to be death for believers? What purpose does death serve in
          their lives? When is the power of death completely terminated for
          them?
