        <p>I. The Doctrine of Christ in History</p>
        <p>THE RELATION BETWEEN ANTHROPOLOGY AND CHRISTOLOGY.</p>
        <p>
          THERE is a very close connection between the doctrine of man and the
          doctrine of Christ. The former deals with man, created in the image of
          God and endowed with true knowledge, righteousness and holiness, but
          through wilful transgression of the law of God despoiled of his true
          humanity and transformed into a sinner. It points to man as a highly
          privileged creature of God, still bearing some of the traces of his
          original glory, but yet as a creature that has lost its birthright,
          its true freedom, and its original righteousness and holiness. This
          means that it directs attention, not merely, nor even primarily, to
          the creatureliness, but to the sinfulness of man. It emphasizes the
          ethical distance between God and man, the distance resulting from the
          fall of man, which neither man nor angels can bridge; and is as such
          virtually a cry for divine help. Christology is in part the answer to
          that cry. It acquaints us with the objective work of God in Christ to
          bridge the chasm, and to remove the distance. It shows us God coming
          to man, to remove the barriers between God and man by meeting the
          conditions of the law in Christ, and to restore man to His blessed
          communion. Anthropology already directs attention to the gracious
          provision of God for a covenant of friendship with man, which provides
          for a life of blessed communion with God; but it is a covenant which
          is effective only in and through Christ. And therefore the doctrine of
          Christ, as the Mediator of the covenant, must necessarily follow.
          Christ, typified and predicted in the Old Testament as the Redeemer of
          man, came in the fulness of time, to tabernacle among men and to
          effect an eternal reconciliation.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST BEFORE THE REFORMATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. UP TO THE COUNCIL OF CHALCEDON. In the early Christian literature
          Christ stands out as both human and divine, the Son of Man, but also
          the Son of God. His sinless character is maintained, and He is
          regarded as a proper object of worship. Naturally, the problem
          presented by Christ, as at once God and man, and the difficulties
          involved in such a conception, were not fully felt by the early
          Christian mind and only dawned on it in the light of controversy. It
          was but natural that Judaism, with its strong emphasis on monotheism,
          should exercise considerable influence on the early Christians of
          Jewish extraction. The Ebionites (or part of them) felt constrained,
          in the interest of monotheism, to deny the deity of Christ. They
          regarded Him as a mere man, the son of Joseph and Mary, who was
          qualified at His baptism to be the Messiah, by the descent of the Holy
          Spirit upon Him. There were others in the early Church whose doctrine
          of Christ was constructed on similar lines. The Alogi, who rejected
          the writings of John, because they regarded his doctrine of the Logos
          as in conflict with the rest of the New Testament, also saw in Jesus a
          mere man, though miraculously born of a virgin, and taught that Christ
          descended on Him at baptism, conferring on Him supernatural powers. In
          the main this was also the position of the Dynamic Monarchians. Paul
          of Samosata, its main representative, distinguished between Jesus and
          the Logos. He regarded the former as a man like every other man, born
          of Mary, and the latter, as the impersonal divine reason, which took
          up its abode in Christ in a pre-eminent sense, from the time of His
          baptism, and thus qualified Him for His great task. In view of this
          denial it was part of the task of the early Apologetes to defend the
          doctrine of the deity of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there were some who sacrificed the deity to the humanity of Christ,
          there were others who reversed the order. The Gnostics were profoundly
          influenced by the dualistic conception of the Greeks, in which matter
          as inherently evil is represented as utterly opposed to spirit; and by
          a mystic tendency to regard earthly things as allegorical
          representations of great cosmic redeeming processes. They rejected the
          idea of an incarnation, a manifestation of God in a visible form,
          since it involved a direct contact of spirit with matter. Harnack says
          that the majority of them regarded Christ as a Spirit consubstantial
          with the Father. According to some He descended upon the man Jesus at
          the time of His baptism, but left Him again before His crucifixion;
          while according to others He assumed a merely phantasmal body. The
          Modalistic Monarchians also denied the humanity of Christ, partly in
          the interest of His deity, and partly to preserve the unity of the
          Divine Being. They saw in Him merely a mode or manifestation of the
          one God, in whom they recognized no distinction of persons. The
          Anti-Gnostic and Alexandrian Fathers took up the defense of the deity
          of Christ, but in their defense did not altogether escape the error of
          representing Him as subordinate to the Father. Even Tertullian taught
          a species of subordination, but especially Origen, who did not
          hesitate to speak of a subordination as to essence. This became a
          steppingstone for Arianism, in which Christ is distinguished from the
          Logos as the divine reason, and is represented as a pre-temporal,
          superhuman creature, the first of the creatures, not God and yet more
          than man. Athanasius took issue with Arius, and strongly defended the
          position that the Son is consubstantial with, and of the same essence
          as, the Father, a position that was officially adopted by the council
          of Nicea in 321. Semi-Arianism proposed a via media by declaring the
          Son to be of a similar essence as the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the doctrine of the deity of the Son was officially established,
          the question naturally arose as to the relation in which the two
          natures in Christ stand to each other. Apollinaris offered a solution
          of the problem. Accepting the Greek trichotomic conception of man as
          consisting of body, soul, and spirit, he took the position that the
          Logos took the place of the spirit (pneuma) in man, which he regarded
          as the seat of sin. His chief interest was to secure the unity of the
          person in Christ, without sacrificing His real deity; and also to
          guard the sinlessness of Christ. But he did so at the expense of the
          complete humanity of the Saviour, and consequently his position was
          explicitly condemned by the Council of Constantinople in 381. One of
          the things for which Apollinaris contended was the unity of the person
          in Christ. That this was really in danger became quite apparent in the
          position taken by the school of Antioch, which exaggerated the
          distinction of the two natures in Christ. Theodore of Mopsuestia and
          Nestorius stressed the complete manhood of Christ, and conceived of
          the indwelling of the Logos in Him as a mere moral indwelling, such as
          believers also enjoy, though not to the same degree. They saw in
          Christ a man side by side with God, in alliance with God, sharing the
          purpose of God, but not one with Him in the oneness of a single
          personal life, â€” a Mediator consisting of two persons. In opposition
          to them Cyril of Alexandria strongly emphasized the unity of the
          person in Christ, and in the estimation of his opponents denied the
          two natures. While they in all probability misunderstood him, Eutychus
          and his followers certainly appealed to him, when they took up the
          position that the human nature of Christ was absorbed by the divine,
          or that the two were fused into a single nature, a position involving
          the denial of the two natures in Christ. The Council of Chalcedon in
          451 condemned both of these views and maintained the unity of the
          person as well as the duality of the natures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. AFTER THE COUNCIL OF CHALCEDON. For some time the Eutychian error
          was continued by the Monophysites and the Monothelites, but was
          finally overcome by the Church. The further danger that the human
          nature of Christ would be regarded as entirely impersonal was warded
          off by Leontius of Byzantium, when he pointed out that it is not
          impersonal but in-personal, having its personal subsistence in the
          person of the Son of God. John of Damascus, in whom the Christology of
          the East reached its highest development, added the idea that there is
          a circumincession of the divine and the human in Christ, a
          communication of the divine attributes to the human nature, so that
          the latter is deified and we may also say that God suffered in the
          flesh. He shows a tendency to reduce the human nature to the position
          of a mere organ or instrument of the Logos, yet he admits that there
          is a co-operation of the two natures, and that the one person acts and
          wills in each nature, though the human will is always subject to the
          divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Western Church Felix, bishop of Urgella, advocated adoptionism.
          He regarded Christ as to His divine nature, that is, the Logos, as the
          onlybegotten Son of God in the natural sense, but considered Christ on
          His human side as a Son of God merely by adoption. He sought to
          preserve the unity of the person by stressing the fact that, from the
          time of His conception, the Son of Man was taken up into the unity of
          the person of the Son of God. Thus a distinction was made between a
          natural and an adoptive sonship, and the latter did not begin with the
          natural birth of Christ, but had its inception at the time of His
          baptism and was consummated in the resurrection. It was a spiritual
          birth that made Christ the adopted Son of God. The Church saw the
          unity of the person in Christ once more endangered by this view, and
          therefore it was condemned by the Synod of Frankfort in 794 A.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Middle Ages added very little to the doctrine of the person of
          Christ. Due to various influences, such as the emphasis on the
          imitation of Christ, the theories of the atonement, and the
          development of the doctrine of the mass, the Church retained a strong
          grasp on the full humanity of Christ. "The deity of Christ," says
          Mackintosh, "came into view rather as the infinite co-efficient
          raising human action and passion to an infinite value." And yet some
          of the Scholastics in their Christology set forth a docetic view of
          Christ. Peter the Lombard did not hesitate to say that in respect of
          His humanity Christ was nothing at all. But this Nihilism was
          condemned by the Church. Some new points were stressed by Thomas
          Aquinas. According to him the person of the Logos became composite at
          the incarnation, and its union with the manhood "hindered" the latter
          from arriving at an independent personality. The human nature of
          Christ received a twofold grace in virtue of its union with the Logos,
          (a) the gratia unionis, imparting to it a special dignity, so that it
          even became an object of worship, and (b) the gratia habitualis, which
          sustained it in its relationship to God. The human knowledge of Christ
          was twofold, namely, an infused and an acquired knowledge. There are
          two wills in Christ, but ultimate causality belongs to the divine
          will, to which the human will is always subject.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST AFTER THE REFORMATION.</p>
        <p>
          1. UP TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. The Reformation did not bring any
          great changes in the doctrine of the person of Christ. Both the Church
          of Rome and the Churches of the Reformation subscribed to the doctrine
          of Christ as it was formulated by the Council of Chalcedon. Their
          important and deep-seated differences lay elsewhere. There is one
          peculiarity of Lutheran Christology that deserves special mention.
          Luther's doctrine of the physical presence of Christ in the Lord's
          supper led to the characteristically Lutheran view of the communicatio
          idiomatum, to the effect "that each of Christ's natures permeates the
          other (perichoresis), and that His humanity participates in the
          attributes of His divinity."1It is held that the attributes of
          omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence were communicated to the
          human nature of Christ at the time of the incarnation. The question
          naturally arose, how this could be harmonized with what we know of the
          earthly life of Jesus. This question led to a difference of opinion
          among Lutheran theologians. Some held that Christ laid aside the
          divine attributes received in the incarnation, or used them only
          occasionally, while others said that He continued in possession of
          them during His entire earthly life, but concealed them or used them
          only secretly. Some Lutherans now seem inclined to discard this
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reformed theologians saw in this Lutheran doctrine a species of
          Eutychianism or of the fusion of the two natures in Christ. Reformed
          theology also teaches a communication of attributes, but conceives of
          it in a different way. It believes that, after the incarnation, the
          properties of both natures can be attributed to the one person of
          Christ. The person of Christ can be said to be omniscient, but also,
          to have but limited knowledge; can be regarded as omnipresent, but
          also as being limited at any particular time to a single place. Hence
          we read in the Second Helvetic Confession: "We acknowledge, therefore,
          that there be in one and the same Jesus our Lord two natures â€” the
          divine and the human nature; and we say that these are so conjoined or
          united that they are not swallowed up, confounded, or mingled
          together, but rather united or joined together in one person (the
          properties of each being safe and remaining still), so that we do
          worship one Christ, our Lord, and not two. . . . Therefore we do not
          think nor teach that the divine nature in Christ did suffer, or that
          Christ, according to His human nature, is yet in the world, and so in
          every place."2
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IN THE NINTEENTH CENTURY. About the beginning of the nineteenth
          century a great change took place in the study of the person of
          Christ. Up to that time the point of departure had been prevailingly
          theological, and the resulting Christology was theocentric; but during
          the last part of the eighteenth century there was a growing conviction
          that better results could be attained by starting closer at home,
          namely, with the study of the historical Jesus. Thus the so-called
          "second Christological period" was ushered in. The new point of view
          was anthropological, and the result was anthropocentric. It proved to
          be destructive of the faith of the Church. A far-reaching and
          pernicious distinction was made between the historical Jesus,
          delineated by the writers of the Gospels, and the theological Christ,
          who was the fruit of the fertile imagination of theological thinkers,
          and whose image is now reflected in the creeds of the Church. The
          supernatural Christ made way for a human Jesus; and the doctrine of
          the two natures, for the doctrine of a divine man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schleiermacher stood at the head of the new development. He regarded
          Christ as a new creation, in which human nature is elevated to the
          plane of ideal perfection. Yet his Christ can hardly be said to rise
          above the human level. The uniqueness of His person consists in the
          fact that He possesses a perfect and unbroken sense of union with the
          divine, and also realizes to the full the destiny of man in His
          character of sinless perfection. His supreme dignity finds its
          explanation in a special presence of God in Him, in His unique
          God-consciousness. Hegel's conception of Christ is part and parcel of
          his pantheistic system of thought. The Word become flesh means for him
          God become incarnate in humanity, so that the incarnation really
          expresses the oneness of God and man. The incarnation of Christ was,
          so it seems, merely the culmination of a racial process. While mankind
          in general regards Jesus only as a human teacher, faith recognizes Him
          as divine and finds that by His coming into the world the
          transcendence of God is changed into immanence. Here we meet with a
          pantheistic identification of the human and the divine in the doctrine
          of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something of this is also seen in the Kenotic theories, which
          represent a rather remarkable attempt to improve on the construction
          of the doctrine of the person of Christ. The term kenosis is derived
          from Php_2:7, which teaches that Christ "emptied (ekenosen) Himself,
          taking the form of a servant." The Kenoticists take this to mean that
          the Logos literally became, that is, was changed into a man by
          reducing (depotentiating) Himself, either wholly or in part, to the
          dimensions of a man, and then increased in wisdom and power until at
          last He again became God. This theory appeared in various forms, of
          which the most absolute is that of Gess, and for a time enjoyed
          considerable popularity. It aimed at maintaining the reality and
          integrity of the manhood of Christ, and to throw into strong relief
          the greatness of His humiliation in that He, being rich, for our sakes
          became poor. It involves, however, a pantheistic obliteration of the
          line of demarcation between God and man. Dorner, who was the greatest
          representative of the Mediating school, strongly opposed this view,
          and substituted for it the doctrine of a progressive incarnation. He
          saw in the humanity of Christ a new humanity with a special
          receptivity for the divine. The Logos, the principle of self-bestowal
          in God, joined Himself to this humanity; the measure in which He did
          this was determined at every stage by the ever-increasing receptivity
          of the human nature for the divine, and did not reach its final stage
          until the resurrection. But this is merely a new and subtle form of
          the old Nestorian heresy. It yields a Christ consisting of two
          persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the exception of Schleiermacher, no one has exercised greater
          influence on present day theology than Albrecht Ritschl. His
          Christology takes its starting point in the work, rather than in the
          person of Christ. The work of Christ determines the dignity of His
          person. He was a mere man, but in view of the work which He
          accomplished and the service He rendered, we rightly attribute to Him
          the predicate of Godhead. He rules out the pre-existence, the
          incarnation, and the virgin birth of Christ, since this finds no point
          of contact in the believing consciousness of the Christian community.
          Christ was the founder of the kingdom of God, thus making the purpose
          of God His own, and now in some way induces men to enter the Christian
          community and to live a life that is motivated entirely by love. He
          redeems man by His teaching, example, and unique influence, and is
          therefore worthy to be called God. This is virtually a renewal of the
          doctrine of Paul of Samosata.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the basis of the modern pantheistic idea of the immanence of God,
          the doctrine of Christ is to-day often represented in a thoroughly
          naturalistic way. The representations may vary greatly, but the
          fundamental idea is generally the same, that of an essential unity of
          God and man. The doctrine of the two natures of Christ has disappeared
          from modern theology, and instead we have a pantheistic identification
          of God and man. Essentially all men are divine, since they all have a
          divine element in them; and they are all sons of God, differing from
          Christ only in degree. Modern teaching about Christ is all based on
          the doctrine of the continuity of God and man. And it is exactly
          against this doctrine that Barth and those who are like-minded with
          him have raised their voice. There are in some circles to-day signs of
          a return to the two- nature doctrine. Micklem confesses in his What Is
          the Faith? that for many years he confidently asserted that the
          ascription to Christ of two natures in one person had to be abandoned,
          but now sees that this rested on a misunderstanding.3

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. What was the background of the
          Christological controversy in the early centuries? What ancient errors
          were revived by Roscelinus and Abelard? What was the Christological
          Nihilism in vogue among the disciples of Abelard? How did Peter the
          Lombard view Christ? Did the Scholastics bring any new points to the
          fore? Where do we find the official Lutheran Christology? How can we
          account for the seemingly inconsistent representations of the formula
          of Concord? What objections are there to the Lutheran view that divine
          attributes may be predicated of the human nature? How did the
