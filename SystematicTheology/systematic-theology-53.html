          I. Scriptural Names of the Church and the Doctrine of the Church in
          History
        </p>
        <p>A. SCRIPTURAL NAMES FOR THE CHURCH.</p>
        <p>
          I. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. The Old Testament employs two words to
          designate the Church, namely qahal (or kahal), derived from an
          obsolete root qal (or kal), meaning "to call"; and 'edhah, from
          ya'adh, "to appoint" or "to meet or come together at an appointed
          place." These two words are sometimes used indiscriminately, but were
          not, at first, strictly syn of Israel or their representative heads,
          whether assembled or not assembled.Qahal, on the other hand, properly
          denotes the actual meeting together of the people. Consequently we
          find occasionally the expression qehal 'edhah, that is, "the assembly
          of the congregation" Exo_12:6; Num_14:5; Jer_26:17. It seems that the
          actual meeting was sometimes a meeting of the representatives of the
          people, Deu_4:10; Deu_18:16, comp. Deu_5:22-23; 1Ki_8:1-3; 1Ki_8:5;
          2Ch_5:2-6. 'Edhah is by far the more common word in Exodus, Leviticus,
          Numbers, and Joshua, but is wholly absent from Deuteronomy, and is
          found but rarely in the later books. Qahal, abounds in Chronicles,
          Ezra, and Nehemiah. Sunagoge is the usual, almost universal, rendering
          of the former in the Septuagint, and is also the usual rendering of
          the latter in the Pentateuch. In the later books of the Bible,
          however, qahal is generally rendered by ekklesia. Schuerer claims that
          later Judaism already pointed to the distinction between sunagoge as a
          designation of the congregation of Israel as an empirical reality, and
          ekklesia as the name of that same congregation ideally considered. He
          is followed in this by Dr. Bavinck. Cremer-Koegel, however, takes
          exception to this. Hort says that after the exile the word qahal seems
          to have combined the shades of meaning belonging to both it and '
          edhah; and that consequently " ekklesia, as the primary Greek
          representative of qahal would naturally, for Greek-speaking Jews, mean
          the congregation of Israel quite as much as an assembly of the
          congregation."6
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. The New Testament also has two words, derived
          from the Septuagint, namely, ekklesia, from ek and kaleo, "to call
          out," and sunagoge, from sun and ago, meaning "to come or to bring
          together." The latter is used exclusively to denote either the
          religious gatherings of the Jews or the buildings in which they
          assembled for public worship, Mat_4:23; Act_13:43; Rev_2:9; Rev_3:9.
          The term ekklesia, however, generally designates the Church of the New
          Testament, though in a few places it denotes common civil assemblies.
          Act_19:32; Act_19:39; Act_19:41. The preposition ek in ekklesia
          (ekkaleo) is often interpreted to mean "out from among the common mass
          of the people," and to indicate in connection with the Scriptural use
          of ekklesia, that the Church consists of the elect, called out of the
          world of humanity. This interpretation is rather doubtful, however,
          for the preposition originally simply denoted that the Greek citizens
          were called out of their houses. Now it would not have been unnatural
          if that entirely Scriptural idea had been put into the word in God's
          revelation. But, as a matter of fact, we have no proof that this was
          actually done. The compound verb ekkaleo is never so used, and the
          word ekklesia never occurs in a context which suggests the presence of
          that particular thought in the mind of the writer. Deissmann would
          simply render ekklesia as "the (convened) assembly," regarding God as
          the convener. Because the idea of the Church is a many- sided concept,
          it is quite natural that the word ekklesia, as applied to it, does not
          always have exactly the same connotation. Jesus was the first one to
          use the word in the New Testament, and He applied it to the company
          that gathered about Him, Mat_16:18, recognized Him publicly as their
          Lord, and accepted the principles of the Kingdom of God. It was the
          ekklesia of the Messiah, the true Israel. Later on, as a result of the
          extension of the Church, the word acquired various significations.
          Local churches were established everywhere, and were also called
          ekklesiai, since they were manifestations of the one universal Church
          of Christ. The following are the most important uses of the word:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Most frequently the word ekklesia designates a circle of believers
          in some definite locality, a local church, irrespective of the
          question whether these believers are or are not assembled for worship.
          Some passages contain the added idea that they are assembled,
          Act_5:11; Act_11:26; 1Co_11:18; 1Co_14:19; 1Co_14:28; 1Co_14:35, while
          others do not, Rom_16:4; 1Co_16:1; Gal_1:2; 2Th_2:14, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In some cases the word denotes what may be called a domestic
          ekklesia, the church in the house of some individual. It seems that in
          apostolic times wealthy or otherwise important persons often set aside
          a large room in their homes for divine worship. Instances of this use
          of the word are found in Rom_16:23; 1Co_16:19; Col_4:15; Phm_1:2.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. If the reading of Tisschendorf is correct (as is now generally
          taken for granted), then the word is found at least once in the
          singular to denote a group of churches, namely, the churches of Judea,
          Galilee, and Samaria. The passage in which it is so used is Act_9:31.
          Naturally, this does not yet mean that they together constituted an
          organization such as we now call a denomination. It is not impossible
          that the church of Jerusalem and the church of Antioch in Syria also
          comprised several groups that were accustomed to meet in different
          places.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. In a more general sense the word serves to denote the whole body,
          throughout the world, of those who outwardly profess Christ and
          organize for purposes of worship, under the guidance of appointed
          officers. This meaning of the word is somewhat in the foreground in
          the First Epistle to the Corinthians, 1Co_10:32; 1Co_11:22; 1Co_12:28,
          but was, it would seem, present also in the mind of Paul, when he
          wrote the letter to the Ephesians, though in that letter the emphasis
          is on the Church as a spiritual organism, cf. especially Eph_4:11-16.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Finally, the word in its most comprehensive meaning signifies the
          whole body of the faithful, whether in heaven or on earth, who have
          been or shall be spiritually united to Christ as their Saviour. This
          use of the word is found primarily in the Epistles of Paul to the
          Ephesians and the Colossians, most frequently in the former, Eph_1:22;
          Eph_3:10; Eph_3:21; Eph_5:23-25; Eph_5:27; Eph_5:32; Col_1:18;
          Col_1:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should bear in mind that the names "Church," "Kerk" and "Kirche"
          are not derived from the word ekklesia but from the word kuriake,
          which means "belonging to the Lord." They stress the fact that the
          Church is the property of God. The name to kuriakon or he kuriake
          first of all designated the place where the Church assembled. This
          place was conceived of as belonging to the Lord, and was therefore
          called to kuriakon. But the place itself was empty and did not really
          become manifest as to kuriakon until the Church gathered for worship.
          Consequently, the word was transferred to the Church itself, the
          spiritual building of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. OTHER BIBLICAL DESIGNATIONS OF THE CHURCH. The New Testament
          contains several figurative designations of the Church, each one of
          which stresses some particular aspect of the Church. It is called:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The body of Christ. Some in our day seem to regard this appellation
          as a complete definition of the New Testament Church, but it is not so
          intended. The name is applied not only to the Church universal, as in
          Eph_1:23; Col_1:18, but also to a single congregation, 1Co_12:27. It
          stresses the unity of the Church, whether local or universal, and
          particularly the fact that this unity is organic, and that the
          organism of the Church stands in vital relationship to Jesus Christ as
          her glorious head.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The temple of the Holy Spirit or of God. The church of Corinth is
          called "a temple of God," in which the Holy Spirit dwelleth, 1Co_3:16.
          In Eph_2:21-22 Paul speaks of believers as growing into "a holy temple
          in the Lord," and as being built together for "a habitation of God in
          the Spirit." There the name is applied to the ideal Church of the
          future, which is the church universal. And Peter says that believers
          as living stones are built up "a spiritual house," 1Pe_2:5. The
          connection clearly shows that he is thinking of a temple. This figure
          emphasizes the fact that the Church is holy and inviolable. The
          indwelling of the Holy Spirit imparts to her an exalted character.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The Jerusalem that is above, or the new Jerusalem, or the heavenly
          Jerusalem. All three of these forms are found in the Bible, Gal_4:26;
          Heb_12:2; Rev_21:2, cf. the Rev_21:9-10. In the Old Testament
          Jerusalem is represented as the place where God dwelt between the
          cherubim and where He symbolically established contact with His
          people. The New Testament evidently regards the Church as the
          spiritual counterpart of the Old Testament Jerusalem, and therefore
          applies to it the same name. According to this representation the
          Church is the dwelling place of God, in which the people of God are
          brought into communion with Him; and this dwelling place, while still
          in part on earth, belongs to the heavenly sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Pillar and ground of the truth. There is just one place in which
          that name is applied to the Church, namely, 1Ti_3:15. It clearly
          refers to the Church in general, and therefore also applies to every
          part of it. The figure is expressive of the fact that the Church is
          the guardian of the truth, the citadel of the truth, and the defender
          of the truth over against all the enemies of the Kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>1. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH BEFORE THE REFORMATION.</p>
        <p>
          a. In the patristic period. By the Apostolic Fathers and by the
          Apologetes the Church is generally represented as the communio
          sanctorum the people of God which He has chosen for a possession. The
          necessity for making distinctions was not at once apparent. But as
          early as the latter part of the second century there was a perceptible
          change. The rise of heresies made it imperative to name some
          characteristics by which the true catholic Church could be known. This
          tended to fix the attention on the outward manifestation of the
          Church. The Church began to be conceived as an external institution,
          ruled by a bishop as a direct successor of the apostles, and in
          possession of the true tradition. The catholicity of the Church was
          rather strongly emphasized. Local churches were not regarded as so
          many separate units, but simply as parts of the one universal Church.
          The increasing worldliness and corruption of the Church gradually led
          to reaction and gave rise to the tendency of various sects, such as
          Montanism in the middle of the second, Novatianism in the middle of
          the third, and Donatism at the beginning of the fourth century, to
          make the holiness of its members the mark of the true Church. The
          early Church Fathers, in combating these sectaries, emphasized ever
          increasingly the episcopal institution of the Church. Cyprian has the
          distinction of being the first to develop fully the doctrine of the
          episcopal Church. He regarded the bishops as the real successors of
          the apostles and ascribed to them a priestly character in virtue of
          their sacrificial work. They together formed a college, called the
          episcopate, which as such constituted the unity of the Church. The
          unity of the Church was thus based on the unity of the bishops. They
          who do not subject themselves to the bishop forfeit the fellowship of
          the Church and also their salvation, since there is no salvation
          outside of the Church. Augustine was not altogether consistent in his
          conception of the Church. It was his struggle with the Donatists that
          compelled him to reflect more deeply on the nature of the Church. On
          the one hand he shows himself to be the predestinarian, who conceives
          of the Church as the company of the elect, the communio sanctorum, who
          have the Spirit of God and are therefore characterized by true love.
          The important thing is to be a living member of the Church so
          conceived, and not to belong to it in a merely external sense. But on
          the other hand he is the Church-man, who adheres to the Cyprianic idea
          of the Church at least in its general aspects. The true Church is the
          catholic Church, in which the apostolic authority is continued by
          episcopal succession. It is the depositary of divine grace, which it
          distributes through the sacraments. For the present this Church is a
          mixed body, in which good and evil members have a place. In his debate
          with the Donatists he admitted, however, that the two were not in the
          Church in the same sense. He also prepared the way for the Roman
          Catholic identification of the Church and the Kingdom of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the Middle Ages. The Scholastics have very little to say about
          the Church. The system of doctrine developed by Cyprian and Augustine
          was fairly complete and needed but a few finishing touches to bring it
          to its final development. Says Otten (Roman Catholic historian): "This
          system was taken over by the Scholastics of the Middle Ages, and then
          was handed down by them, practically in the same condition in which
          they had received it, to their successors who came after the Council
          of Trent."7 Incidentally a few points were somewhat further developed.
          But if there was very little development in the doctrine of the
          Church, the Church itself actually developed more and more into a
          close-knit, compactly organized, and absolute hierarchy. The seeds of
          this development were already present in the Cyprianic idea of the
          Church and in one aspect of the Church as represented by Augustine.
          The other and more fundamental idea of that great Church Father, that
          of the Church as the communio sanctorum, was generally disregarded and
          thus remained dormant. This is not saying that the Scholastics denied
          the spiritual element altogether, but merely that they did not give it
          due prominence. The emphasis was very definitely on the Church as an
          external organization or institution. Hugo of St. Victor speaks of the
          Church and the State as the two powers instituted by God for the
          government of the people. Both are monarchical in constitution, but
          the Church is the higher power, because she ministers to the salvation
          of men, while the State only provides for their temporal welfare. The
          king or emperor is the head of the state, but the Pope is the head of
          the Church. There are two classes of people in the Church with well
          defined rights and duties: the clerics, dedicated to the service of
          God, who constitute a unit; and the laics consisting of people from
          every domain of life, who constitute a separate class altogether. Step
          by step the doctrine of the papacy came to development, until at last
          the Pope became virtually an absolute monarch. The growth of this
          doctrine was in no small measure aided by the development of the idea
          that the Catholic Church was the Kingdom of God on earth, and that
          therefore the Roman bishopric was an earthly kingdom. This
          identification of the visible and organized Church with the Kingdom of
          God had far-reaching consequences: (1) It required that everything be
          brought under the control of the Church: the home and the school,
          science and art, commerce and industry, and so on. (2) It involved the
          idea that all the blessings of salvation come to man only through the
          ordinances of the Church, particularly through the sacraments. (3) It
          led to the gradual secularization of the Church, since the Church
          began to pay more attention to politics than to the salvation of
          sinners, and the Popes finally claimed dominion also over secular
          rulers.
        </p>
        <p>2. THE DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH DURING AND AFTER THE REFORMATION.</p>
        <p>
          a. During the period of the Reformation. The Reformers broke with the
          Roman Catholic conception of the Church, but differed among themselves
          in some particulars. The idea of an infallible and hierarchical
          Church, and of a special priesthood, which dispenses salvation through
          the sacraments, found no favor with Luther. He regarded the Church as
          the spiritual communion of those who believe in Christ, and restored
          the Scriptural idea of the priesthood of all believers. He maintained
          the unity of the Church, but distinguished two aspects of it, the one
          visible and the other invisible. He was careful to point out that
          these are not two churches, but simply two aspects of the same Church.
          The invisible Church becomes visible, not by the rule of bishops and
          cardinals, nor in the headship of the Pope, but by the pure
          administration of the Word and of the sacraments. He admitted that the
          visible Church will always contain a mixture of pious and wicked
          members. However, in his reaction against the Roman Catholic idea of
          the domination of the Church over the State, he went to another
          extreme, and virtually made the Church subject to the State in
          everything except the preaching of the Word. The Anabaptists were not
          satisfied with his position, and insisted on a Church of believers
          only. They, in many instances, even scorned the visible Church and the
          means of grace. Moreover, they demanded the complete separation of
          Church and State. Calvin and Reformed theologians were at one with
          Luther in the confession that the Church is essentially a communio
          sanctorum a communion of saints. However, they did not, like the
          Lutherans, seek the unity and the holiness of the Church primarily in
          the objective ordinances of the Church, such as the offices, the Word,
          and the sacraments, but most of all in the subjective communion of
          believers. They, too, distinguished between a visible and an invisible
          aspect of the Church, though in a slightly different way. Moreover,
          they found the true marks of the Church, not only in the true
          administration of the Word and of the sacraments, but also in the
          faithful administration of Church discipline. But even Calvin and the
          Reformed theologians of the seventeenth century in a measure fostered
          the idea of the subjection of the Church to the state. However, they
          established a form of government in the Church which made for a
          greater degree of ecclesiastical independence and power than was known
          in the Lutheran Church. But while both Lutheran and Reformed
          theologians sought to maintain the proper connection between the
          visible and the invisible Church, others lost sight of this. The
          Socinians and the Arminians of the seventeenth century, though indeed
          speaking of an invisible Church, forgot all about it in actual life.
          The former conceived of the Christian religion simply as an acceptable
          doctrine, and the latter made the Church primarily a visible society
          and followed the Lutheran Church by yielding the right of discipline
          to the State and retaining for the Church only the right to preach the
          gospel and to admonish the members of the Church. The Labadists and
          Pietists, on the other hand, manifested a tendency to disregard the
          visible Church, seeking a Church of believers only, showing themselves
          indifferent to the institutional Church with its mixture of good and
          evil, and seeking edification in conventicles.

          b. During and after the eighteenth century. During the eighteenth
          century Rationalism made its influence felt also in the doctrine of
          the Church. It was indifferent in matters of faith and lacked
          enthusiasm for the Church, which it placed on a par with other human
          societies. It even denied that Christ intended to found a church in
          the received sense of the word. There was a pietistic reaction to
          Rationalism in Methodism, but Methodism did not contribute anything to
          the development of the doctrine of the Church. In some cases it sought
          strength in casting reflection on the existing Churches, and in others
          it adapted itself to the life of these Churches. For Schleiermacher
          the Church was essentially the Christian community, the body of
          believers who are animated by the same spirit. He had little use for
          the distinction between the visible and the invisible Church, and
          found the essence of the Church in the spirit of Christian fellowship.
          The more the Spirit of God penetrates the mass of Christian believers,
          the fewer divisions there will be, and the more they will lose their
          importance. Ritschl substituted for the distinction between the
          invisible and the visible Church that between the Kingdom and the
          Church. He regarded the Kingdom as the community of God's people
          acting from the motive of love, and the Church as that same community
          met for worship. The name "Church" is therefore restricted to an
          external organization in the one function of worship; and this
          function merely enables believers to become better acquainted with one
          another. This is certainly far from the teaching of the New Testament.
          It leads right on to the modern liberal conception of the Church as a
          mere social center, a human institution rather than a planting of God.

          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: Does the history of the Church begin at
          or before the day of Pentecost? If it existed before, how did the
          Church preceding that day differ from the Church following it? To what
          Church does Jesus refer in Mat_18:17? Did Augustine identify the
          Church as a spiritual organism, or the Church as an external
          institution, with the Kingdom of God? How do you account for the Roman
          Catholic emphasis on the Church as an external organization? Why did
          not the Reformers insist on entire freedom of the Church from the
          State? How did Luther and Calvin differ in this respect? What
          controversies respecting the Church arose in Scotland? What accounts
          for the different conceptions of the Church in England and in
          Scotland? How did Rationalism affect the doctrine of the Church? What
          great dangers are threatening the Church at the present time?
