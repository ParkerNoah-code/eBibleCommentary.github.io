        <p>XI. Perseverance of the Saints</p>
        <p>A. THE DOCTRINE OF THE PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of the perseverance of the saints is to the effect that
          they whom God has regenerated and effectually called to a state of
          grace, can neither totally nor finally fall away from that state, but
          shall certainly persevere therein to the end and be eternally saved.
          This doctrine was first explicitly taught by Augustine, though he was
          not as consistent on this point as might have been expected of him as
          a strict predestinarian. With him the doctrine did not assume the form
          just stated. He held that the elect could not so fall away as to be
          finally lost, but at the same time considered it possible that some
          who were endowed with new life and true faith could fall from grace
          completely and at last suffer eternal damnation. The Church of Rome
          with its Semi- Pelagianism, including the doctrine of free will,
          denied the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints and made their
          perseverance dependent on the uncertain obedience of man. The
          Reformers restored this doctrine to its rightful place. The Lutheran
          Church, however, makes it uncertain again by making it contingent on
          man's continued activity of faith, and by assuming that true believers
          can fall completely from grace. It is only in the Calvinistic Churches
          that the doctrine is maintained in a form in which it affords absolute
          assurance. The Canons of Dort, after calling attention to the many
          weaknesses and failures of the children of God, declare: "But God, who
          is rich in mercy, according to His unchangeable purpose of election,
          does not wholly withdraw the Holy Spirit from His own people even in
          their grievous falls; nor suffers them to proceed so far as to lose
          the grace of adoption and forfeit the state of justification, or to
          commit the sin unto death or against the Holy Spirit; nor does He
          permit them to be totally deserted, and to plunge themselves into
          everlasting destruction."95 The Arminians rejected this view and made
          the perseverance of believers dependent on their will to believe and
          on their good works. Arminius himself avoided that extreme, but his
          followers did did not hesitate to maintain their synergistic position
          with all its consequences. The Wesleyan Arminians followed suit as did
          several of the sects. The Reformed or Calvinistic Churches stand
          practically alone in giving a negative answer to the question, whether
          a Christian can completely fall from the state of grace and be finally
          lost.
        </p>
        <p>B. STATEMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF PERSEVERANCE.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of perseverance requires careful statement, especially in
          view of the fact that the term "perseverance of the saints" is liable
          to misunderstanding. It should be noted first of all that the doctrine
          is not merely to the effect that the elect will certainly be saved in
          the end, though Augustine has given it that form, but teaches very
          specifically that they who have once been regenerated and effectually
          called by God to a state of grace, can never completely fall from that
          state and thus fail to attain to eternal salvation, though they may
          sometimes be overcome by evil and fall in sin. It is maintained that
          the life of regeneration and the habits that develop out of it in the
          way of sanctification can never entirely disappear. Moreover, we
          should guard against the possible misunderstanding that this
          perseverance is regarded as an inherent property of the believer or as
          a continuous activity of man, by means of which he perseveres in the
          way of salvation. When Strong speaks of it as "the voluntary
          continuance, on the part of the Christian, in faith and well-doing,"
          and as "the human side or aspect of that spiritual process which, as
          viewed from the divine side, we call sanctification," â€” this is
          certainly liable to create the impression that perseverance depends on
          man. The Reformed, however, do not consider the perseverance of the
          saints as being, first of all, a disposition or activity of the
          believer, though they certainly believe that man co- operates in it
          just as he does in sanctification. They even stress the fact that the
          believer would fall away, if he were left to himself. It is, strictly
          speaking, not man but God who perseveres. Perseverance may be defined
          as that continuous operation of the Holy Spirit in the believer, by
          which the work of divine grace that is begun in the heart, is
          continued and brought to completion. It is because God never forsakes
          His work that believers continue to stand to the very end.
        </p>
        <p>C. PROOF FOR THE DOCTRINE OF PERSEVERANCE.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of perseverance may be proved by certain statements of
          Scripture and by inference from other doctrines.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. DIRECT STATEMENTS OF SCRIPTURE. There are some important passages
          of Scripture that come into consideration here. In Joh_10:27-29 we
          read: "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;
          and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no
          one shall snatch them out my hand. My Father, who hath given them unto
          me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the
          Father's hand." Paul says in Rom_11:29 : "For the gifts and the
          calling of God are not repented of." This means that the grace of God
          revealed in His calling is never withdrawn, as though He repented of
          it. This is a general statement, though in the connection in which it
          is found it refers to the calling of Israel. The apostle comforts the
          believing Philippians with the words: "Being confident of this very
          thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it unto the
          day of Jesus Christ," Php_1:6. In 2Th_3:3 he says: "But the Lord is
          faithful, who shall establish you, and guard you from the evil one."
          In 2Ti_1:12 he sounds a note of rejoicing: "For I know Him whom I have
          believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard that which I
          have committed unto Him against that day." And in 4:18 of the same
          Epistle he glories in the fact that the Lord will deliver him from
          every evil work and will save him unto His heavenly kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. INFERENTIAL PROOFS. The doctrine of perseverance may also be proved
          in an inferential way.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. From the doctrine of election. Election does not merely mean that
          some will be favored with certain external privileges and may be
          saved, if they do their duty, but that they who belong to the number
          of the elect shall finally be saved and can never fall short of
          perfect salvation. It is an election unto an end, that is, unto
          salvation. In working it out God endows believers with such influences
          of the Holy Spirit as to lead them, not only to accept Christ, but to
          persevere unto the end and to be saved unto the uttermost.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. From the doctrine of the covenant of redemption. In the covenant of
          redemption God gave His people to His Son as the reward for the
          latter's obedience and suffering. This reward was fixed from eternity
          and was not left contingent on any uncertain faithfulness of man. God
          does not go back on His promise, and therefore it is impossible that
          they who are reckoned as being in Christ, and as forming a part of His
          reward, can be separated from Him (Rom_8:38-39), and that they who
          have entered the covenant as a communion of life should fall out.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. From the efficacy of the merits and intercession of Christ. In His
          atoning work Christ paid the price to purchase the sinner's pardon and
          acceptance. His righteousness constitutes the perfect ground for the
          justification of the sinner, and it is impossible that one who is
          justified by the payment of such a perfect and efficacious price
          should again fall under condemnation. Moreover, Christ makes constant
          intercession for those who are given Him of the Father, and His
          intercessory prayer for His people is always efficacious, Joh_11:42;
          Heb_7:25.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. From the mystical union with Christ. They who are united to Christ
          by faith become partakers of His Spirit, and thus become one body with
          Him, pulsating with the life of the Spirit. They share in the life of
          Christ, and because He lives they live also. It is impossible that
          they should again be removed from the body, thus frustrating the
          divine ideal. The union is permanent, since it originates in a
          permanent and unchangeable cause, the free and eternal love of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. From the work of the Holy Spirit in the heart. Dabney correctly
          says: "It is a low and unworthy estimate of the wisdom of the Holy
          Spirit and of His work in the heart, to suppose that He will begin the
          work now, and presently desert it; that the vital spark of heavenly
          birth is an ignis fatuus burning for a short season, and then expiring
          in utter darkness; that the spiritual life communicated in the new
          birth, is a sort of spasmodic or galvanic vitality, giving the outward
          appearance of life in the dead soul, and then dying."96 According to
          Scripture the believer is already in this life in possession of
          salvation and eternal life, Joh_3:36; Joh_5:24; Joh_6:54. Can we
          proceed on the assumption that eternal life will not be everlasting?
        </p>
        <p>
          f. From the assurance of salvation. It is quite evident from Scripture
          that believers can in this life attain to the assurance of salvation,
          Heb_3:14; Heb_6:11; Heb_10:22; 2Pe_1:10. This would seem to be
          entirely out of the question, if it were possible for believers to
          fall from grace at any moment. It can be enjoyed only by those who
          stand in the firm conviction that God will perfect the work which He
          has begun.
        </p>
        <p>D. OBJECTIONS TO THE DOCTRINE OF PERSEVERANCE.</p>
        <p>
          1. IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH HUMAN FREEDOM. It is said that the doctrine
          of perseverance is inconsistent with human freedom. But this objection
          proceeds on the false assumption that real freedom consists in the
          liberty of indifference, or the power of contrary choice in moral and
          spiritual matters. This is erroneous, however. True liberty consists
          exactly in self-determination in the direction of holiness. Man is
          never more free than when he moves consciously in the direction of
          God. And the Christian stands in that liberty through the grace of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IT LEADS TO INDOLENCE AND IMMORALITY. It is confidently asserted
          that the doctrine of perseverance leads to indolence, license, and
          even immorality. A false security is said to result from it. This is a
          mistaken notion, however, for, although the Bible tells us that we are
          kept by the grace of God, it does not encourage the idea that God
          keeps us without constant watchfulness, diligence, and prayer on our
          part. It is hard to see how a doctrine which assures the believer of a
          perseverance in holiness can be an incentive for sin. It would seem
          that the certainty of success in the active striving for
          sanctification would be the best possible stimulus to ever greater
          exertion.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. IT IS CONTRARY TO SCRIPTURE. The doctrine is frequently declared to
          be contrary to Scripture. The passages adduced to prove this
          contention can be reduced to three classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. There are warnings against apostasy which would seem to be quite
          uncalled for, if the believer could not fall away, Mat_24:12;
          Col_1:23; Heb_2:1; Heb_3:14; Heb_6:11; 1Jn_2:6. But these warnings
          regard the whole matter from the side of man and are seriously meant.
          They prompt self-examination, and are instrumental in keeping
          believers in the way of perseverance. They do not prove that any of
          those addressed will apostatize, but simply that the use of means is
          necessary to prevent them from committing this sin. Compare
          Act_27:22-25 with Act_27:31 for an illustration of this principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. There are also exhortations, urging believers to continue in the
          way of sanctification, which would appear to be unnecessary if there
          is no doubt about it that they will continue to the end. But these are
          usually found in connection with such warnings as those referred to
          under (a), and serve exactly the same purpose. They do not prove that
          any of the believers exhorted will not persevere, but only that God
          uses moral means for the accomplishment of moral ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Again, it is said that Scripture records several cases of actual
          apostasy, 1Ti_1:19-20; 2Ti_2:17-18; 2Ti_4:10; 2Pe_2:1-2; cf. also
          Heb_6:4-6. But these instances do not prove the contention that real
          believers, in possession of true saving faith, can fall from grace,
          unless it be shown first that the persons indicated in these passages
          had true faith in Christ, and not a mere temporal faith, which is not
          rooted in regeneration. The Bible teaches us that there are persons
          who profess the true faith, and yet are not of the faith, Rom_9:6;
          1Jn_2:19; Rev_3:1. John says of some of them, "They went out from us,"
          and adds by way of explanation, "but they were not of us; for if they
          had been of us, they would have remained with us," 1Jn_2:19.
        </p>
        <p>
          E. THE DENIAL OF THIS DOCTRINE MAKES SALVATION DEPENDENT ON MAN'S
          WILL.
        </p>
        <p>
          The denial of the doctrine of perseverance virtually makes the
          salvation of man dependent on the human will rather than on the grace
          of God. This consideration will, of course, have no effect on those
          who share the Pelagian conception of salvation as autosoteric â€” and
          their numbers are great â€” but certainly ought to cause those to
          pause who glory in being saved by grace. The idea is that, after man
          is brought to a state of grace by the operation of the Holy Spirit
          alone, or by the joint operation of the Holy Spirit and the will of
          man, it rests solely with man to continue in faith or to forsake the
          faith, just as he sees fit. This renders the cause of man very
          precarious and makes it impossible for him to attain to the blessed
          assurance of faith. Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to
          maintain the doctrine of perseverence. In the words of Hovey, "It may
          be a source of great comfort and power, â€” an incentive to gratitude,
          a motive to self-sacrifice, and a pillar of fire in the hour of
          danger."
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What is the real question concerning
          perseverance: is it whether the elect or whether the regenerate
          persevere? Do Augustine and the Lutherans also teach that the elect
          may finally be lost? How does the analogy of the natural life favor
          the doctrine of perseverance? Do not such passages as Heb_6:4-6;
          Heb_10:29; 2Pe_2:1 prove the possibility of falling away? How about
          Joh_15:1-6? Is the grace of perseverance something innate, necessarily
          given with the new nature, or is it the fruit of a special, gracious,
          and preserving activity of God? Does the doctrine imply that one may
          be living in habitual and intentional sin, and yet be in a justified
          state? Does it preclude the idea of lapses into sin?
