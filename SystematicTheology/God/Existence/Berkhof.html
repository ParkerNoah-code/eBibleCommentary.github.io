        <p>I.The Existence of God</p>
        <p>A.PLACE OF THE DOCTRINE OF GOD IN DOGMATICS</p>
        <p>
          WORKS on dogmatic or systematic theology generally begin with the
          doctrine of God. The prevailing opinion has always recognized this as
          the most logical procedure and still points in the same direction. In
          many instances even they whose fundamental principles would seem to
          require another arrangement, continue the traditional practice. There
          are good reasons for starting with the doctrine of God, if we proceed
          on the assumption that theology is the systematized knowledge of God,
          of whom, through whom, and unto whom, are all things. Instead of being
          surprised that Dogmatics should begin with the doctrine of God, we
          might well expect it to be a study of God throughout what it is
          intended to be, though only the first locus deals with God directly,
          while the succeeding ones treat of Him more indirectly. We start the
          study of theology with two presuppositions, namely (1) that God
          exists, and (2) that He has revealed Himself in His divine Word. And
          for that reason it is not impossible for us to start with the study of
          God. We can turn to His revelation, in order to learn what He has
          revealed concerning Himself and concerning His relation to His
          creatures. Attempts have been made in the course of time to distribute
          the material of Dogmatics in such a way as to exhibit clearly that it
          is, not merely in one locus, but in its entirety, a study of God. This
          was done by the application of the trinitarian method, which arranges
          the subject-matter of Dogmatics under the three headings of (1) the
          Father (2) the Son, and (3) the Holy Spirit. That method was applied
          in some of the earlier systematic works, was restored to favor by
          Hegel, and can still be seen in Martensen's Christian Dogmatics. A
          similar attempt was made by Breckenridge, when he divided the
          subject-matter of Dogmatics into (1) The Knowledge of God Objectively
          Considered, and (2) The Knowledge of God Subjectively Considered.
          Neither one of these can be called very successful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to the beginning of the nineteenth century the practice was all but
          general to begin the study of Dogmatics with the doctrine of God; but
          a change came about under the influence of Schleiermacher, who sought
          to safeguard the scientific character of theology by the introduction
          of a new method. The religious consciousness of man was substituted
          for the Word of God as the source of theology. Faith in Scripture as
          an authoritative revelation of God was discredited, and human insight
          based on man's own emotional or rational apprehension became the
          standard of religious thought. Religion gradually took the place of
          God as the object of theology. Man ceased to recognize the knowledge
          of God as something that wasgiven in Scripture, and began to pride
          himself on being a seeker after God. In course of time it became
          rather common to speak of man's discovering God, as if man ever
          discovered Him; and every discovery that was made in the process was
          dignified with the name of "revelation." God came in at the end of a
          syllogism, or as the last link in a chain of reasoning, or as the
          cap-stone of a structure of human thought. Under such circumstances it
          was but natural that some should regard it as incongruous to begin
          Dogmatics with the study of God. It is rather surprising that so many,
          in spite of their subjectivism, continued the traditional arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some, however, sensed the incongruity and struck out in a different
          way. Schleiermacher's dogmatic work is devoted to a study and analysis
          of the religious consciousness and of the doctrines therein implied.
          He does not deal with the doctrine of God connectedly, but only in
          fragments, and concludes his work with a discussion of the Trinity.
          His starting point is anthropological rather than theological. Some of
          the mediating theologians were influenced to such an extent by
          Schleiermacher that they logically began their dogmatic treatises with
          the study of man. Even in the present day this arrangement is
          occasionally followed. A striking example of it is found in the work
          of O. A. Curtis on The Christian Faith. This begins with the doctrine
          of man and concludes with the doctrine of God. Ritschlian theology
          might seem to call for still another starting point, since it finds
          the objective revelation of God, not in the Bible as the divinely
          inspired Word, but in Christ as the Founder of the Kingdom of God, and
          considers the idea of the Kingdom as the central and all-controlling
          concept of theology. However, Ritschlian dogmaticians, such as
          Herrmann. Haering, and Kaftan follow, at least formally, the usual
          order. At the same time there are several theologians who in their
          works begin the discussion of dogmatics proper with the doctrine of
          Christ or of His redemptive work. T. B. Strong distinguishes
          betweentheology and Christian theology, defines the latter as "the
          expression and analysis of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ," and makes
          the incarnation the dominating concept throughout his Manual of
          Theology.

        <p>B. SCRIPTURE PROOF FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          For us the existence of God is the great presupposition of theology.
          There is no sense in speaking of the knowledge of God, unless it may
          be assumed that God exists. The presupposition of Christian theology
          is of a very definite type. The assumption is not merely that there is
          something, some idea or ideal, some power or purposeful tendency, to
          which the name of God may be applied, but that there is a
          self-existent, selfconscious, personal Being, which is the origin of
          all things, and which transcends the entire creation, but is at the
          same time immanent in every part of it. The question may be raised,
          whether this is a reasonable assumption, and this question may be
          answered in the affirmative. This does not mean, however, that the
          existence of God is capable of a logical demonstration that leaves no
          room whatever for doubt; but it does mean that, while the truth of
          God's existence is accepted by faith, this faith is based on reliable
          information. While Reformed theology regards the existence of God as
          an entirely reasonable assumption, it does not claim the ability to
          demonstrate this by rational argumentation. Dr. Kuyper speaks as
          follows of the attempt to do this: "The attempt to prove God's
          existence is either useless or unsuccessful. It is useless if the
          searcher believes that God is a rewarder of those who seek Him. And it
          is unsuccessful if it is an attempt to force a person who does not
          have this pistis by means of argumentation to an acknowledgment in a
          logical sense."1
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian accepts the truth of the existence of God by faith. But
          this faith is not a blind faith, but a faith that is based on
          evidence, and the evidence is found primarily in Scripture as the
          inspired Word of God, and secondarily in God's revelation in nature.
          Scripture proof on this point does not come to us in the form of an
          explicit declaration, and much less in the form of a logical argument.
          In that sense the Bible does not prove the existence of God. The
          closest it comes to a declaration is perhaps in Heb_11:6... "for he
          that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder
          of them that seek after Him." It presupposes the existence of God in
          its very opening statement, "In the beginning God created the heavens
          and the earth." Not only does it describe God as the Creator of all
          things, but also as the Upholder of all His creatures, and as the
          Ruler of the destinies of individuals and nations. It testifies to the
          fact that God works all things according to the counsel of His will,
          and reveals the gradual realization of His great purpose of
          redemption. The preparation for this work, especially in the choice
          and guidance of the old covenant people of Israel, is clearly seen in
          the Old Testament, and the initial culmination of it in the Person and
          work of Christ stands out with great clarity on the pages of the New
          Testament. God is seen on almost every page of Holy Writ as He reveals
          Himself in words and actions. This revelation of God is the basis of
          our faith in the existence of God, and makes this an entirely
          reasonable faith. It should be remarked, however, that it is only by
          faith that we accept the revelation of God, and that we obtain a real
          insight into its contents. Jesus said, "If any man will do his will,
          he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
          speak of myself," Joh_7:17. It is this intensive knowledge, resulting
          from intimate communion with God, which Hosea has in mind when he
          says, "And let us know, let us follow on to know the Lord," Hos_6:3.
          The unbeliever has no real understanding of the Word of God. The words
          of Paul are very much to the point in this connection: "Where is the
          wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this age (world)?
          Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For, seeing that in
          the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom knew not God, it was
          God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save
          them that believe," 1Co_1:20-21.
        </p>
        <p>C. DENIAL OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS</p>
        <p>
          Students of Comparitive Religion and missionaries often testify to the
          fact that the idea of God is practically universal in the human race.
          It is found even among the most uncivilized nations and tribes of the
          world. This does not mean, however, that there are no individuals who
          deny the existence of God altogether, nor even that there is not a
          goodly number in Christian lands who deny the existence of God as He
          is revealed in Scripture, a self-existent and self-conscious Person of
          infinite perfections, who works all things according to a
          pre-determined plan. It is the latter denial that we have in mind
          particularly here. This may and has assumed various forms in the
          course of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. ABSOLUTE DENIAL OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD. As stated above, there is
          strong evidence for the universal presence of the idea of God in the
          human mind, even amongtribes which are uncivilized and have not felt
          the impact of special revelation. In view of this fact some go so far
          as to deny that there are people who deny the existence of God, real
          atheists; but this denial is contradicted by the facts. It is
          customary to distinguish two kinds, namely, practical and theoretical
          atheists. The former are simply godless persons, who in their
          practical life do not reckon with God, but live as if there were no
          God. The latter are, as a rule, of a more intellectual kind, and base
          their denial on a process of reasoning. They seek to prove by what
          seem to them conclusive rational arguments, that there is no God. In
          view of thesemen religionis implanted in every man by his creation in
          the image of God, it is safe to assume that no one is born an atheist.
          In the last analysis atheism results from the perverted moral state of
          man and from his desire to escape from God. It is deliberately blind
          to and suppresses the most fundamental instinct of man, the deepest
          needs of the soul, the highest aspirations of the human spirit, and
          the longings of a heart that gropes after some higher Being. This
          practical or intellectual suppression of the operation of the semen
          religionis often involves prolonged and painful struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
          There can be no doubt about the existence of practical atheists, since
          both Scripture and experience testify to it. Psa_10:4 b declares of
          the wicked, "All his thoughts are, There is no God." According to
          Psa_14:1 "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." And Paul
          reminds the Ephesians that they were formerly "without God in the
          world," Eph_2:12. Experience also testifies abundantly to their
          presence in the world. They are not necessarily notoriously wicked in
          the eyes of men, but may belong to the so-called "decent men of the
          world," though respectably indifferent to spiritual things. Such
          people are often quite conscious of the fact that they are out of
          harmony with God, dread to think of meeting Him, and try to forget
          about Him. They seem to take a secret delight in parading their-
          atheism when they have smooth sailing, but have been known to get down
          on their knees for prayer when their life was suddenly endangered. At
          the present time thousands of these practical atheists belong to the
          American Association for the Advancement of Atheism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theoretical atheists are of a different kind. They are usually of a
          more intellectual type and attempt to justify the assertion that there
          is no God by rational argumentation. Prof. Flint distinguishes three
          kinds of theoretical atheism, namely, (1) dogmatic atheism, which
          flatly denies that there is a Divine Being; (2) sceptical atheism,
          which doubts the ability of the human mind to determine, whether or
          not there is a God; and (3)critical atheism, which maintains that
          there is no valid proof for the existence of God. These often go hand
          in hand, but even the most modest of them really pronounces all belief
          in God a delusion.2 In this division, it will be noticed, agnosticism
          also appears as a sort of atheism, a classification which many
          agnostics resent. But it should be borne in mind that agnosticism
          respecting the existence of God, while allowing the possibility of His
          reality, leaves us without an object of worship and adoration just as
          much as dogmatic atheism does. However the real atheist is thedogmatic
          atheist,the man who makes the positive assertion that there is no God.
          Such an assertion may mean one of two things: either that he
          recognizes no god of any kind, sets up no idol for himself, or that he
          does not recognize the God of Scripture. Now there are very few
          atheists who do not in practical life fashion some sort of god for
          themselves. There is a far greater number who theoretically set aside
          any and every god; and there is a still greater number that has broken
          with the God of Scripture. Theoretical atheism is generally rooted in
          some scientific or philosophical theory. Materialistic Monism in its
          various forms and atheism usually go hand in hand. Absolute subjective
          Idealism may still leave us the idea of God, but denies that there is
          any corresponding reality. To the modern Humanist "God" simply means
          "the Spirit of humanity," "the Sense of wholeness," "the Racial Goal"
          and other abstractions of that kind. Other theories not only leave
          room for God, but also pretend to maintain His existence, but
          certainly exclude the God of theism, a supreme personal Being,
          Creator, Preserver, and Ruler of the universe, distinct from His
          creation, and yet everywhere present in it. Pantheism merges the
          natural and supernatural, the finite and infinite, into one substance.
          It often speaks of God as the hidden ground of the phenomenal world,
          but does not conceive of Him as personal, and therefore as endowed
          with intelligence and will. It boldly declares that all is God, and
          thus engages in what Brightman calls "the expansion of God," so that
          we get "too much of God," seeing that He also includes all the evil of
          the world. It excludes the God of Scripture, and in so far is clearly
          atheistic. Spinoza may be called "the God-intoxicated man," but his
          God is certainly not the God whom Christians worship and adore.
          Surely, there can be no doubt about the presence of theoretical
          atheists in the world. When David Hume expressed doubt as to the
          existence of a dogmatic atheist, Baron d'Holbach replied, "My dear
          sir, you are at this moment sitting at table with seventeen such
          persons." They who are agnostic respecting the existence of God may
          differ somewhat from the dogmatic atheist, but they, as well as the
          latter, leave us without a God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. PRESENT DAY FALSE CONCEPTIONS OF GOD INVOLVING A DENIAL OF THE TRUE
          GOD. There are several false conceptions of God current in our day,
          which involve a denial of the theistic conception of God. A brief
          indication of the most important of these must suffice in this
          connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. An immanent and impersonal God. Theism has always believed in a God
          who is both transcendent and immanent. Deism removed God from the
          world, and stressed His transcendence at the expense of His immanence.
          Under the influence of Pantheism, however, the pendulum swung in the
          other direction. It identified God and the world, and did not
          recognize a Divine Being, distinct from, and infinitely exalted above,
          His creation. Through Schleiermacher the tendency to make God
          continuous with the world gained a footing in theology. He completely
          ignores the transcendent God, and recognizes only a God that can be
          known by human experience and manifests Himself in Christian
          consciousness as Absolute Causality, to which a feeling of absolute
          dependence corresponds. The attributes we ascribe to God are in this
          view merely symbolical expressions of the various modes of this
          feeling of dependence, subjective ideas without any corresponding
          reality. His earlier and his later representations of God seem to
          differ somewhat, and interpreters of Schleiermacher differ as to the
          way in which his statements must be harmonized. Brunner would seem to
          be quite correct, however, when he says that with him the universe
          takes the place of God, though the latter name is used; and that he
          conceives of God both as identical with the universe and as the unity
          lying behind it. It often seems as if his distinction between God and
          the world is only an ideal one, namely, the distinction between the
          world as a unity and the world in its manifold manifestations. He
          frequently speaks of God as the "Universum" or the "Welt-All," and
          argues against the personality of God; though, inconsistently, also
          speaking as if we could have communion with Him in Christ. These views
          of Schleiermacher, making God continuous with the world, largely
          dominated the theology of the past century, and it is this view that
          Barth is combatting with his strong emphasis on God as "the Wholly
          Other."
        </p>
        <p>
          b.A finite and personal God. The idea of a finite god or gods is not
          new, but as old as Polytheism and Henotheism. The idea fits in with
          Pluralism, but not with philosophical Monism or theological
          Monotheism. Theism has always regarded God as an absolute personal
          Being of infinite perfections. During the nineteenth century, when
          monistic philosophy was in the ascendant, it became rather common to
          identify the God of theology with the Absolute of philosophy. Toward
          the end of the century, however, the term "Absolute," as a designation
          of God, fell into disfavor, partly because of its agnostic and
          pantheistic implications, and partly as the result of the opposition
          to the idea of the "Absolute" in philosophy, and of the desire to
          exclude all metaphysics from theology. Bradley regarded the God of the
          Christian religion as a part of the Absolute, and James pleaded for a
          conception of God that was more in harmony with human experience than
          the idea of an infinite God. He eliminates from God the metaphysical
          attributes of self-existence, infinity, and immutability, and makes
          the moral attributes supreme. God has an environment, exists in time,
          and works out a history just like ourselves. Because of the evil that
          is in the world, He must be thought of as limited in knowledge or
          power, or in both. The condition of the world makes it impossible to
          believe in a good God infinite in knowledge and power. The existence
          of a larger power which is friendly to man and with which he can
          commune meets all the practical needs and experiences of religion.
          James conceived of this power as personal, but was not willing to
          express himself as to whether he believed in one finite God or a
          number of them. Bergson added to this conception of James the idea of
          a struggling and growing God, constantly drawing upon his environment.
          Others who defended the idea of a finite God, though in different
          ways, are Hobhouse, Schiller, James Ward, Rashdall, and H. G. Wells.

          c. God as the personification of a mere abstract idea. It has become
          quite the vogue in modern liberal theology to regard the name "God" as
          a mere symbol, standing for some cosmic process, some universal will
          or power, or some lofty and comprehensive ideal. The statement is
          repeatedly made that, if God once created man in His image, man is now
          returning the compliment by creating God in his (man's) image. It is
          said of Harry Elmer Barnes that he once said in one of his laboratory
          classes: "Gentlemen, we shall now proceed to create God." That was a
          very blunt expression of a rather common idea. Most of those who
          reject the theistic view of God still profess faith in God, but He is
          a God of their own imagination. The form which He assumes at any
          particular time depends, according to Shailer Mathews, on the thought
          patterns of that day. If in pre-war times the controlling pattern was
          that of an autocratic sovereign, demanding absolute obedience, now it
          is that of a democratic ruler eager to serve all his subjects. Since
          the days of Comte there has been a tendency to personify the social
          order of humanity as a whole and to worship this personification. The
          so-called Meliorists or Social Theologians reveal a tendency to
          identify God in some way with the social order. And the New
          Psychologists inform us that the idea of God is a projection of the
          human mind, which in its early stages is inclined to make images of
          its experiences and to clothe them with quasi-personality. Leuba is of
          the opinion that this illusion of God has served a useful purpose, but
          that the time is coming when the idea of God will be no more needed. A
          few definitions will serve to show the present day trend. "God is the
          immanent spirit of the community" (Royce). He is "that quality in
          human society which supports and enriches humanity in its spiritual
          quest" (Gerald Birney Smith). "God is the totality of relations
          constituting the whole social order of growing humanity" (E. S. Ames).
          "The word 'god' is a symbol to designate the universe in its ideal
          forming capacity" (G. B. Foster). "God is our conception, born of
          social experience, of the personality-evolving and personally
          responsive elements of our cosmic environment with which we are
          organically related" (Shailer Mathews). It need hardly be said that
          the God so defined is not a personal God and does not answer to the
          deepest needs of the human heart.

        <p>D. THE SO CALLED PROOFS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.</p>
        <p>
          In course of time certain rational arguments for the existence of God
          were developed, and found a foothold in theology especially through
          the influence of Wolff. Some of these were in essence already
          suggested by Plato and Aristotle, and others were added in modern
          times by students of the Philosophy of Religion. Only the most common
          of these arguments can be mentioned here.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT. This has been presented in various forms
          by Anselm, Descartes, Samuel Clarke, and others. It has been stated in
          its most perfect form by Anselm. He argues that man has the idea of an
          absolutely perfect being; that existence is an attribute of
          perfection; and that therefore an absolutely perfect being must exist.
          But it is quite evident that we cannot conclude from abstract thought
          to real existence. The fact that we have an idea of God does not yet
          prove His objective existence. Moreover, this argument tacitly
          assumes, as already existing in the human mind, the very knowledge of
          God's existence which it would derive from logical demonstration. Kant
          stressed the untenableness of this argument, but Hegel hailed it as
          the one great argument for the existence of God. Some modern Idealists
          suggested that it might better be cast into a somewhat different form,
          which Hocking called "the report of experience." By virtue of it we
          can say, "I have an idea of God, therefore I have an experience of
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE COSMOLIGICAL ARGUMENT. This has also appeared in several forms.
          In general it runs as follows: Every existing thing in the world must
          have an adequate cause; and if this is so, the universe must also have
          an adequate cause, that is a cause which is indefinitely great.
          However, the argument did not carry general conviction. Hume called
          the law of causation itself in question, and Kant pointed out that, if
          every existing thing has an adequate cause, this also applies to God,
          and that we are thus led to an endless chain. Moreover, the argument
          does not necessitate the assumption that the cosmos had a single
          cause, a personal and absolute cause, â€” and therefore falls short of
          proving the existence of God. This difficulty led to a slightly
          different construction of the argument, as, for instance, by B. P.
          Bowne. The material universe appears as an interacting system, and
          therefore as a unit, consisting of several parts. Hence there must be
          a unitary Agent that mediates the interaction of the various parts or
          is the dynamic ground of their being.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE TELEOLIGICAL ARGUMENT. This is also a causal argument, and is
          really but an extension of the preceding one. It may be stated in the
          following form: The world everywhere reveals intelligence, order,
          harmony, and purpose, and thus implies the existence of an intelligent
          and purposeful being, adequate to the production of such a world. Kant
          regards this argument as the best of the three which were named, but
          claims that it does not prove the existence of God, nor of a Creator,
          but only of a great architect who fashioned the world. It is superior
          to the cosmological argument in that it makes explicit what is not
          stated in the latter, namely, that the world contains evidences of
          intelligence and purpose, and thus leads on to the existence of a
          conscious, and intelligent, and purposeful being. That this being was
          the Creator of the world does not necessarily follow. "The
          teleological evidence," says Wright,3 "merely indicates the probable
          existence of a Mind that is, at least in considerable measure, in
          control of the world process, â€” enough to account for the amount of
          teleology apparent in it." Hegel treated this argument as a valid but
          subordinate one. The Social Theologians of our day reject it along
          with all the other arguments as so much rubbish, but the New Theists
          retain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE MORAL ARGUMENT Just as the other arguments, this too assumed
          different forms. Kant took his starting point in the categorical
          imperative, and from it inferred the existence of someone who, as
          lawgiver and judge, has the absolute right to command man. In his
          estimation this argument is far superior to any of the others. It is
          the one on which he mainly relies in his attempt to prove the
          existence of God. This may be one of the reasons why it is more
          generally recognized than any other, though it is not always cast into
          the same form. Some argue from the disparity often observed between
          the moral conduct of men and the prosperity which they enjoy in the
          present life, and feel that this calls for an adjustment in the future
          which, in turn, requires a righteous arbiter. Modern theology also
          uses it extensively, especially in the form that man's recognition of
          a Highest Good and his quest for a moral ideal demand and necessitate
          the existence of a God to give reality to that ideal. While this
          argument does point to the existence of a holy and just being, it does
          not compel belief in a God, a Creator, or a being of infinite
          perfections.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE HISTORICAL OR ETHNOLOGICAL ARGUMENT. In the main this takes the
          following form: Among all the peoples and tribes of the earth there is
          a sense of the divine, which reveals itself in an external cultus.
          Since the phenomenon is universal, it must belong to the very nature
          of man. And if the nature of man naturally leads to religious worship,
          this can only find its explanation in a higher Being who has
          constituted man a religious being. In answer to this argument,
          however, it may be said that this universal phenomenon may have
          originated in an error or misunderstanding of one of the early
          progenitors of the human race, and that the religious cultus referred
          to appears strongest among primitive races, and disappears in the
          measure in which they become civilized.
        </p>
        <p>
          In evaluating these rational arguments it should be pointed out first
          of all that believers do not need them. Their conviction respecting
          the existence of God does not depend on them, but on a believing
          acceptance of God's self-revelation in Scripture. If many in our day
          are willing to stake their faith in the existence of God on such
          rational arguments, it is to a great extent due to the fact that they
          refuse to accept the testimony of the Word of God. Moreover, in using
          these arguments in an attempt to convince unbelievers, it will be well
          to bear in mind that none of them can be said to carry absolute
          conviction. No one did more to discredit them than Kant. Since his day
          many philosophers and theologians have discarded them as utterly
          worthless, but to-day they are once more gaining favor and their
          number is increasing. And the fact that in our day so many find in
          them rather satisfying indications of the existence of God, would seem
          to indicate that they are not entirely devoid of value. They have some
          value for believers themselves, but should be called testimonia rather
          than arguments. They are important as interpretations of God's general
          revelation and as exhibiting the reasonableness of belief in a divine
          Being. Moreover, they can render some service in meeting the
          adversary. While they do not prove the existence of God beyond the
          possibility of doubt, so as to compel assent, they can be so construed
          as to establish a strong probability and thereby silence many
          unbelievers.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY. Why is modern theology inclined to give
          the study of man rather than the study of God precedence in theology?
          Does the Bible prove the existence of God or does it not? If it does,
          how does it prove it? What accounts for the general sensus divinitatis
          in man? Are there nations or tribes that are entirely devoid of it?
          Can the position be maintained that there are no atheists? Should
          present day Humanists be classed as atheists? What objections are
          there to the identification of God with the Absolute of philosophy?
          Does a finite God meet the needs of the Christian life? Is the
          doctrine of a finite God limited to Pragmatists? Why is a personified
          idea of God a poor substitute for the living God? What was Kant's
          criticism on the arguments of speculative reason for the existence of
          God? How should we judge of this criticism?
