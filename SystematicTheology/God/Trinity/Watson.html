        <p><b>12. The Trinity</b></p>
        <p><b>Q. VI: HOW MANY PERSONS ARE THERE IN THE GODHEAD?</b></p>
        <p>A: Three persons, yet but one God.</p>
        <p>
          God is but one, yet are there three distinct persons subsisting in one
          Godhead. This is a sacred mystery, which the light within man could
          never have discovered. As the two natures in Christ, yet but one
          person, is a wonder; so three persons, yet but one Godhead. Here is a
          great deep, the Father God, the Son God, the Holy Ghost God; yet not
          three Gods, but one God. The three persons in the blessed Trinity are
          distinguished, but not divided; three substances, but one essence.
          This is a divine riddle, where one makes three, and three make one.
          Our narrow thoughts can no more comprehend the Trinity in Unity, than
          a nut-shell will hold all the water in the sea. Let me shadow it out
          by a similitude. In the body of the sun, there are the substance of
          the sun, the beams, and the heat; the beams are begotten of the sun,
          the heat proceeds both from the sun and the beams; but these three,
          though different, are not divided; they all three make but one sun: so
          in the blessed Trinity, the Son is begotten of the Father, the Holy
          Ghost proceeds from both; yet though they are three distinct persons,
          they are but one God. First, let me speak of the Unity in Trinity;
          then of the Trinity in Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >I. Of the Unity in Trinity. The Unity of the persons in the Godhead
            consists of two things.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          [1] The identity of essence. In the Trinity there is a oneness in
          essence. The three persons are of the same divine nature and
          substance; so that in <em>Deo nonest magis et minus</em>, ‘there are
          no degrees in the Godhead’; one person is not God more than another.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] Unity of the persons in the Godhead consists in the mutual inbeing
          of them, or their being in one together. The three persons are so
          united that one person is in another, and with another. ‘Thou, Father,
          art in me, and I in thee.’ (Jn 17:21).
        </p>
        <p><b>II. Let me speak of the Trinity in Unity.</b></p>
        <p>
          [1] The first person in the Trinity is God the Father. He is called
          the first person, in respect of order, not dignity: for God the Father
          has no essential perfection which the other persons have not; he is
          not more wise, more holy, more powerful than the other persons are.
          There is a priority, not a superiority.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] The second person in the Trinity is Jesus Christ, who is begotten
          of the Father before all time. ‘I was set up from everlasting, from
          the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths I was
          brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
          Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, was I brought
          forth.’ (Prov 8:23-25). This Scripture declares the eternal generation
          of the Son of God. This second person in the Trinity, who is Jehovah,
          is become our Jesus. The Scripture calls him the branch of David, (Jer
          23:5), and I may call him the flower of our nature. ‘By him all that
          believe are justified.’ (Acts 13:39).
        </p>
        <p>
          [3] The third person in the Trinity is the Holy Ghost, who proceeds
          from the Father and the Son, whose work is to illuminate the mind, and
          enkindle sacred motions. The essence of the Spirit is in heaven, and
          everywhere; but the influence of it is in the hearts of believers.
          This is that blessed Spirit who gives us the holy unction (1 Jn 2:20).
          Though Christ merits grace for us, it is the Holy Ghost that works it
          in us. Though Christ makes the purchase, it is the Holy Ghost that
          makes the assurance, and seals us to the day of redemption. Thus I
          have spoken of all the three persons. The Trinity of persons may be
          proved out of (Mat 3:16). ‘Jesus, when he was baptized, went up
          straightway out of the water, and he saw the Spirit of God descending
          like a dove, and lighting upon him; and lo, a voice from heaven,
          saying, This is my beloved Son.’ Here are three names given to the
          three persons. He who spake with a voice from heaven was God the
          Father; he who was baptized in Jordan was God the Son; he who
          descended in the likeness of a dove was God the Holy Ghost. Thus I
          have shown you the Unity of essence, and the Trinity of persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Use one:</b> For confutation. (I.) This confutes the Jews and
          Turks, who believe only the first person in the Godhead. Take away the
          distinction of the persons in the Trinity, and you overthrow man’s
          redemption; for God the Father being offended with man for sin, how
          shall he be pacified without a mediator? This mediator is Christ, who
          makes our peace. Christ having died, and shed his blood, how shall
          this blood be applied but by the Holy Ghost? Therefore, if there be
          not three persons in the Godhead, man’s salvation cannot be wrought
          out; if there be no second person in the Trinity, there is no
          redeemer; if no third person, there is no comforter. Thus the plank is
          taken away by which we get to heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It confutes the execrable opinion of the Socinians, who deny the
          Divinity of the Lord Jesus, and make him to be a creature only, but of
          a higher rank. As the Papists blot out the second commandment, so the
          Socinians do the second person in the Trinity. If to oppose Christ’s
          members be a sin, what is it to oppose Christ himself? Jesus Christ is
          co-equal with God the Father. He thought it no robbery to be equal
          with God. (Phil 2:6). He is co-eternal with God the Father: ‘I was
          from the beginning,’ (Prov 8:23): if not, there was a time when God
          was without a Son, and so he would be no Father; nay, there was a time
          when God was without his glory, for Christ is ‘the brightness of his
          Father’s glory.’ (Heb 1:3). He is co-essential with God the Father.
          The Godhead subsists in Christ. ‘In whom dwells all the fulness of the
          Godhead bodily.’ (Col 2:9). It is said; not only that Christ was with
          God before the beginning, but that he was God. (Jn 1:1), and (1 Tim
          3:16). ‘God manifest in the flesh.’ The title of Lord, so often given
          to Christ, in the New Testament, answers to the tide of Jehovah in the
          Old. (Deut 6:5; Mat 22:37). Christ has a co-eternity, and
          co-substantiality with his Father. ‘I and my Father are one.’ (Jn
          10:30). It were blasphemy for an angel to speak thus. Yet further to
          prove Christ’s Godhead, consider (i) The glorious incommunicable
          attributes belonging to God the Father are ascribed to Christ. Is God
          the Father omnipotent? So is Jesus Christ. He is the almighty, (Rev
          1:8), and he creates, (Col 1:16). Is God the Father infinitely
          immense, filling all places? (Jer 23:24). So is Jesus Christ. While
          Christ was on the earth by his bodily presence, he was at the same
          time in the bosom of the Father by his divine presence (John 3:13).
          (ii) The same <em>jura regalia</em>, or prerogatives royal, which
          belong to God the Father, belong also to Christ. Does God the Father
          seal pardons? This is a flower of Christ’s crown. ‘Thy sins be
          forgiven thee.’ (Mat 9:2). Nor does Christ remit sin organice only, as
          ministers do, by virtue of a power delegated to them from God; but he
          does it by his own power and authority. Is God the Father the adequate
          object of faith? Is he to be believed in? So is his Son. (John 14:1).
          Does adoration belong to God the Father? So it does to the Son. ‘Let
          all the angels of God worship him.’ (Heb 1:6). How sacrilegious
          therefore is the Socinian, who would rob Christ of his Godhead, the
          best flower of his crown. They that deny Christ to be God, must
          greatly wrest, or else deny the Scripture to be the Word of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It confutes the Arians, who deny the Holy Ghost to be God. The
          eternal Godhead subsists in the Holy Ghost. ‘He shall guide you into
          all truth.’ (Jn 16:13). Christ speaks not there of an attribute, but
          of a person. That the Godhead subsists in the person of the Holy Ghost
          appears in this; that the Spirit, who gives diversity of gifts, is
          said to be the same Lord, and the same God (1 Cor 7:5-6). The black
          and unpardonable sin is said, in a special manner, to be committed
          against the Godhead subsisting in the Holy Ghost. (Mat 7:32). The
          mighty power of God is made manifest by the Holy Ghost; for he changes
          the hearts of men. The devil would have Christ prove himself to be
          God, by turning stones into bread; but the Holy Ghost shows his
          Godhead by turning stones into flesh. ‘I will take away the stony
          heart; and give you a heart of flesh.’ (Ezek 36:26). Yet further, the
          power and Godhead of the Holy Ghost appeared in effecting the glorious
          conception of our Lord Jesus Christ. The very shadow of the Holy Ghost
          made a virgin conceive. (Luke 1:36). The Holy Ghost works miracles,
          which transcend the sphere of nature; as raising the dead. (Rom 8:11).
          To him belongs divine worship; our souls and bodies are the temples of
          the Holy Ghost, (1 Cor 6:19), in which temples he is to be worshipped,
          (1 Cor 6:20). We are baptized in the name of the Holy Ghost; therefore
          we must believe his Godhead, or renounce our baptism in his name.
          Methinks it were better for such men not to have so much as heard
          whether there be any Holy Ghost, (Acts 19:2), than to deny his Deity.
          They who would wittingly and willingly blot out the third person,
          shall have their names blotted out of the book of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Use two:</b> For exhortation. (I.) Believe this doctrine of the
          Trinity of persons in the unity of essence. The Trinity is purely an
          object of faith; the plumbline of reason is too short to fathom this
          mystery; but where reason cannot wade, there faith may swim. There are
          some truths in religion that may be demonstrated by reason; as that
          there is a God: but the Trinity of persons in the Unity of essence is
          wholly supernatural, and must be believed by faith. This sacred
          doctrine is not against reason, but above it. Those illuminated
          philosophers, that could find out the causes of things, and discourse
          of the magnitude and influence of the stars, the nature of minerals,
          could never, by their deepest search, find out the mystery of the
          Trinity. This is of divine revelation, and must be adored with humble
          believing. We can be no good Christians, without the firm belief of
          the Trinity. How can we pray to God the Father but in the name of
          Christ, and through the help of the Spirit? How believe the glorious
          Trinity? How are the Quakers to be abhorred, who go under the name of
          Christians, and yet undervalue and renounce Jesus Christ! I have read
          of some Quakers who speak thus: ‘We deny the person of him whom you
          call Christ, and affirm, That they who expect to be saved by that
          Christ without works, will be damned in that faith!’ Could the devil
          himself speak worse blasphemy? They would pull up all religion by the
          roots, and take away that corner stone, on which the hope of our
          salvation is built.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If there be one God subsisting in three persons, then let us give
          equal reverence to all the persons in the Trinity. There is not more
          or less in the Trinity; the Father is not more God than the Son and
          Holy Ghost. There is an order in the Godhead, but no degrees; one
          person has not a majority or super eminence above another, therefore
          we must give equal worship to all the persons. ‘That all men should
          honour the Son even as they honour the Father’ (Jn 5:23). Adore Unity
          in Trinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Obey all the persons in the blessed Trinity; for all of them are
          God. Obey God the Father. Christ himself as man, obeyed God the
          Father, (John 4:44) much more must we. (Deut 27:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Obey God the Son. ‘Kiss the Son, lest he be angry.’ (Ps 2:12). Kiss
          him with a kiss of obedience. Christ’s commands are not grievous. (1
          Jn 5:3). Whatever he commands is for our interest and benefit. Oh then
          kiss the Son! Why do the elders throw down their crowns at the feet of
          Christ, and fall down before the Lamb? (Rev 4:10-11). To testify their
          subjection, and to profess their readiness to serve and obey him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obey God the Holy Ghost. Our souls are breathed into us by the
          glorious Spirit. ‘The Spirit of God hath made me.’ (Job 33:4). Our
          souls are adorned by the blessed Spirit. Every grace is a divine spark
          lighted in the soul by the Holy Ghost. Nay, more, the Spirit of God
          sanctified Christ’s human nature; he united it with the divine, and
          fitted the man Christ to be our Meditator. Well then does this third
          person in the Trinity, the Holy Ghost, deserve to be obeyed; for he is
          God, and this tribute of homage and obedience is due to him from us.
