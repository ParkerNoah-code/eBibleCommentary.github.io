          TWENTY-NINTH QUESTION: THE ETERNAL GENERATION OF THE SON<br />
          <em
            >Was the Son of God begotten of the Father from eternity? We
            affirm</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The preceding question established the consubstantiality
          (homoousian) and essential identity of the Son with the Father. This
          question will demonstrate his personal distinction from him, his
          ineffable and eternal generation against the blasphemies of
          anti-Trinitarians.
        </p>
        <p><b>Statement of the question.</b></p>
        <p>
          II. The question is not whether Christ can be said to be begotten of
          God by the miraculous conception of the Holy Spirit; or whether he can
          be called the Son of God by a gracious communication of existence,
          power and divine glory (for this the adversaries readily grant and
          acknowledge no other cause of his filiation). But the question is
          whether he was begotten of God from eternity, and whether he may be
          called Son on account of the secret and ineffable generation from the
          Father. The Socinians blasphemously deny this; we affirm it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But in order that the truth of this eternal generation may be
          built up better, something must be premised concerning its nature. Not
          that it can be conceived or explained by us. “For here the voice is
          silent, the mind fails; not only mine, but even that of angels,” as
          Ambrose says (Of the Christian Faith 1.10*.64 [NPNF2, 10:212; PL
          16.566]). Gregory Nazianzus puts a stop to our curiosity when he
          wishes it to be reverenced in silence: “The begetting of God is to be
          honored by silence; the great thing is for you to learn he was
          begotten” (Theou gennésis siopé timastho, mega soi to mathein hoti
          gegennétai, On the Son 8 [NPNF2, 7:303; PG 36.84]). The words of Is.
          53:8, although having another bearing, may be rightly used here—“Who
          shall declare his generation?” But only that it may be distinguished
          from human generation and be explained negatively rather than
          positively.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. As all generation indicates a communication of essence on the part
          of the begetter to the begotten (by which the begotten becomes like
          the begetter and partakes of the same nature with him), so this
          wonderful generation is rightly expressed as a communication of
          essence from the Father (by which the Son possesses indivisibly the
          same essence with him and is made perfectly like him). Whatever may be
          the analogy between natural and human generations, and the
          supernatural and divine, still the latter is not to be measured by the
          former or to be tried by them because they greatly differ (whether we
          consider the principle, the mode or the end). For in physical
          generation, the principle is not only active, but also passive and
          material; but in the divine it is only active. In the former, a
          communication is made not of the whole essence, but only of a part
          which falls and is alienated from the begetter. In the latter, the
          same numerical essence is communicated without decision and
          alienation. In the one, the produced is not only distinct but also
          separate from the begetter because the begetter generates out of
          himself terminatively. In the other, the begetter generates in himself
          and not out of himself. Thus the begotten Son (although distinct)
          still is never divided from him. He is not only of a like
          (homoiousios), but also of the same essence (homoousios).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. This generation was made without time (achronos); not in time, but
          from eternity. Therefore not priority or posteriority of duration can
          be observed here, although there may be priority of order according to
          which the Son is from the Father, although not after the Father. (2)
          Without place (achoristos) because the Father did not beget out of
          himself, but in the same essence. Hence the Word (Logos) is said to
          have been with God, and the Father in the Son, and the Son in the
          Father. (3) Without any passion (apathos) or change, either in the
          Father or in the Son, since that he begat denotes no imperfection, but
          is rather the reception of all perfection. Although, therefore, with
          respect to the Father generation may well be called active, still it
          cannot well be called passive with respect to the Son because
          otherwise the Son could be said to be in the power of the begetter.
          Nor is there a difficulty in his being said to be begotten; for this,
          which is spoken after the manner of men (anthropopathos), must be
          understood worthily of God (theoprepds) by removing all imperfection.
          Hence what has place in transient and physical and material generation
          ought not to be transferred to the hyperphysical, immanent and divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. A person is properly said to generate a person because actions
          belong to self-existence (suppositorum); but not an essence to
          generate an essence because what begets and is begotten is necessarily
          multiplied (and thus the way would be paved to Tritheism). Essence
          indeed is communicated by generating; yet the generation, as it is
          originally made from the person, so it terminates on the person.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. That the Father begets the Son, and the Son is begotten, can both
          be said in a sound sense: the former with respect to generation
          considered in itself because the works of the Trinity inwards (such as
          to beget and to be begotten) are eternal and unceasing. Otherwise, if
          personal acts had an end, they would also have a beginning, and all
          mutation in God could not be denied. As therefore in work they are
          perfect, so in operation they are perpetual. Nor, moreover, can any
          imperfection of generation be inferred because even in nature there
          are things which are while in the act of becoming (as the rays of
          sun). The latter however is said better with respect to us to whom
          that which is in a state of becoming is imperfect, but that which is
          in actual being is perfect. Hence Scripture (in accordance with which
          we must speak) uses the past tense rather than the present (Ps. 2:7;
          Prov. 8:22—31). The generation therefore may well be said to be
          terminated by a termination of perfection, not by a termination of
          duration, as the Scholastics express it. When the Son is said to be
          always begotten, the perfection of termination is not denied, but only
          the end of communication.
        </p>
        <p><b>The generation of the Son may be proved from Ps. 27.</b></p>
        <p>
          VIII. This generation may be proved: (1) from the remarkable oracle,
          “Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee” (Ps. 2:7)—which not
          only the apostles acknowledge to be spoken of the Messiah (Acts 4:25;
          13:33; Heb. 1:5), but the Jews themselves (pressed by the force of
          truth) are compelled to confess. Now he is called the Son of God, not
          generally, but he who is such by way of eminence (kat’ exochén) and to
          the exclusion even of the angels themselves. “For unto which of the
          angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son” (as the apostle argues,
          Heb. 1:5). Consequently he is true and eternal God with the Father.
          For who but God could extend the bounds of his kingdom even to the
          ends of the earth (Ps. 2:8); break and dash in pieces like a potter’s
          vessel kings and people (v. 9); whom the kings of the earth ought to
          kiss (i.e., religiously worship, vv. 11, 12); who has absolute power
          of life and death? Who, even when his wrath is kindled but a little,
          can destroy nations and princes; in whom trust is to be placed; and
          from whom happiness is to be expected, except the true and eternal
          God? To this Son is ascribed a generation, not temporal and physical,
          but hyperphysical and eternal—such as can belong to him who is the
          eternal Son of an eternal Father and so true God with him, by which he
          is exalted not only above men, but even above the angels themselves.
          Now, if he could be so called on account of a gracious communication
          of existence or of glory, this could be attributed not to him alone,
          but also to others (although in a different degree). Nor is the
          passage in Acts 13:33 an obstacle, where Paul seems to refer this
          oracle to the resurrection of Christ. For Ps. 2:7 is adduced by the
          apostle not so much to prove the resurrection of Christ (which he
          does, Acts 13:35 from Ps. 16:10), as to prove the fulfillment of the
          promise given to the fathers concerning the raising up of Christ and
          the sending of him into the world. These things are not to be opposed,
          but composed; not that this generation consists in his resurrection,
          since even from the beginning he was with God (Jn. 1:1), yea even from
          everlasting (Prov. 8:22), and God speaking from heaven at his baptism
          testified that he was his Son; but by reason of manifestation
          (phaneroseos) and declaration a posteriori because he is made known by
          it (as Paul interprets when he says that “Christ was declared
          [horisthenta] to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead,”
          Rom. 1:4) according to Scripture usage by which things are said to
          become or to be born when they are manifested (Prov. 17:17). Because,
          therefore, the resurrection was an irrefragable proof of his divinity
          and eternal filiation, the Holy Spirit, with the psalmist, could join
          both together and refer as much to the eternal generation as to its
          manifestation (which ought to be made in the resurrection). And Paul
          properly says that the oracle was fulfilled when its truth was
          exhibited, since by the resurrection the Father has most fully
          declared that he is really (ontos) and peculiarly (idids) his own Son;
          even as James says that the oracle concerning the justification of
          Abraham by faith (“Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for
          righteousness,” 2:23) was fulfilled when he offered up his son; not
          because the justification just then took place through that
          obligation, but because it was then declared. And so with regard to
          the word “today” (hodie), which is added not to point out a certain
          time in which that generation began; but that we may understand that
          all things are present with God, and that that generation is not
          successive, but permanent in eternity (viz., in it there is nothing
          past or future, nor any succession of time, but an indivisible “now”
          [to nyn] embracing however all the circumstances of time). As,
          therefore, with God there is no yesterday or tomorrow, but always
          today, so this filiation being eternal can properly be designated by
          the today of eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Equally vain is the objection that it is such a generation as is
          the part of a decree (or its effect) and so a merely arbitrary work.
          “I will declare,” says he, “the decree: the Lord hath said unto me,
          Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall
          give thee the heathen for thine inheritance” (Ps. 2:7, 8). This
          generation is not set forth as a part of this decree, but only as its
          foundation upon which the universal kingdom (granted to him) is built.
          For unless Christ had been the true and eternal Son of God, begotten
          by him from eternity, he never could have been appointed Mediator and
          obtain a universal kingdom. Finally, the difficulty is not increased
          by the fact that these things pertain to David who nevertheless cannot
          be said to have been begotten by God from eternity. For although this
          oracle can in some measure pertain to David as the type (by reason of
          the dignity to which he was exalted), yet for a far different reason
          would it apply to Christ in whom alone it could receive its perfect
          fulfillment and to whom especially David in the spirit of prophecy had
          regard. Thus the same thing is said of Melchizedek and of Christ (Heb.
          7:3): that he is without father (apator), without mother (amétor),
          having neither beginning of days nor end of life. Still no one denies
          that it is said in a far different sense concerning Christ and
          Melchizedek. Indeed if the words are carefully weighed, it will
          plainly appear that although many things in this psalm apply to David,
          as the type, yet this oracle peculiarly and by way of eminence
          (exochds) is proper to Christ. For such things are predicated of him
          as cannot fall on mortal man. This is often the case in composite
          oracles. Some things agree both with the type and the antitype and
          some either with the type alone or with the antitype alone. That this
          is the case here is apparent from the circumstances of the text.
        </p>
        <p><b>From Prov. 8:22ff.</b></p>
        <p>
          X. Second, the same thing is gathered from the passage in which Wisdom
          is introduced speaking thus: “Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of
          his way, before his works; before any time, I was set up from
          everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there
          were no depths, I was brought forth ... When he prepared the heavens,
          I was there ... when he appointed the foundations of the earth, I was
          with him as his delight” (Prov. 8:22—30). No words could more clearly
          confirm the mystery of which we treat. The eternal Wisdom of the
          Father says Jehovah possessed him! How? Only by a true generation by
          which he is said to have been begotten and held as a most cherished
          delight by the Father; and this not in time, but from eternity (“in
          the beginning of his way, before his works,” Prov. 8:22). And that no
          scruple may remain, he adds in Prov. 8:24, 25 that this was before the
          beginning and foundations of the earth, before there were any depths
          and mountains (which denotes absolute eternity). Now this wisdom
          cannot be only some quality or virtue, but must necessarily be a
          subsisting person because whatever things are attributed to him are
          personal (as that “he teaches, cries out, calls and constitutes
          kings,” Prov. 8); “builds her house, kills beasts, prepares a feast,
          and sends forth her maidens” to call men, and the like (Prov.
          9:1—3)—which can belong only to a person. Nor can there be a
          personification (prosopopoeia) here by which wisdom in general and in
          the abstract is introduced as speaking; for although prosopopoeia is
          admissible in amplifications and exaggerations (especially in fables),
          yet not in short and collected precepts, where the same thing is so
          often repeated and no intimation of a figurative locution is anywhere
          given. Otherwise there would be no certainty in Scripture if it were
          lawful to recur to prosopopoeia everywhere. Nor can a similar example
          be shown, for that which is adduced from Prov. 9:13 (concerning
          foolishness introduced as speaking under the image of a simple woman)
          is far from the point as mere inspection proves, and can best be
          referred to an adulterous woman and her enticements. That which is
          drawn from 1 Cor. 13:7 concerning charity (which is said to bear and
          to believe all things) makes no more for the adversaries because the
          abstract is put for the concrete—charity for the man possessed of
          charity (to whom such things belong). So here Wisdom is put in the
          abstract, not qualitatively, but personally (for him who is endowed
          with wisdom; who, because he possesses it most perfectly, is called
          not only Wisdom in the singular, but Wisdoms [chkhmvth], in the
          plural, according to the Hebrew idiom).
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Now that this is none other than the Son of God, Christ our Lord,
          is collected not only from the name itself, Wisdom (by which he is
          often distinguished in the New Testament, Lk. 7:35; 1 Cor. 1:24), but
          also from the attributes ascribed to this Wisdom (which most aptly
          square with him and can belong to no other). For who else can deserve
          the name of Wisdom and indeed of Wisdoms? Who else calls men to him,
          teaches the true way of salvation, wishes the law and his precepts to
          obtain in the church, convicts sinners of foolishness, promises life
          to those who regard him and denounces final destruction upon the
          unbelieving? Who else was with God before the world was and was
          perpetually with him while creating the world? If Jehovah is said to
          have possessed Wisdom from the beginning, is not the “Word” said “to
          have been in the beginning” and “to have been with God” (Jn. 1:1)? If
          it is said to have been a delight to the Father, is not Christ “the
          beloved Son” (huios agapétos, Mt. 3:17)? If ordained and anointed by
          the Father, was not Christ foreordained before the foundation of the
          world and anointed for the mediatorial office (1 Pet. 1:20)? If Wisdom
          is said to have been brought forth before the hills, was not Christ
          before all things (Col. 1:17)? If by her kings reign, is not Christ
          the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Rev. 19:16)? If Wisdom teaches
          and cries out, calls and exhorts men to repentance in high and low
          places, both immediately by herself and immediately by her maidens, do
          we not read the same of Christ both immediately by himself preaching
          the gospel and mediately by his servants the apostles whom he sent
          through the whole world to call men to a participation of his grace?
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. The word chvilthy ought not to be translated “I was created,” as
          Vatablus (cf. “Annotata ad libros Hagiographos,” in Critici Sacri
          [1660], 3:4091 on Prov. 8:25) and Pagninus hold, but “I was begotten”
          (as the Chaldee and the Greeks render it). For the Piel of the word
          chvll (from the root chvl) denotes not only “to bring forth” (in
          reference to women), but also “to beget” (with respect to men,
          according to Buxtorf, Lexicon Hebraicum et Chaldaicum [1646], pp.
          198-200). And if elsewhere this verb can be referred to a formation
          (as Ps. 90:2; Dt. 32:18), it does not follow that it must always be
          used in the same sense when the thing spoken of cannot suffer it (as
          here where mention is made of Wisdom begotten before the ages). When
          the Septuagint translates it “created me” (ektise me), it is either an
          error for ektése or ektésato; or it was so given because among the
          Greeks the words “to create” (to ktizein) and “to beget” were
          sometimes used reciprocally for each other (Ps. 90:2; 104:31; Dt.
          32:18); or because they did not sufficiently attend to the mind of the
          Holy Spirit. For the word khnh (used here) is a general term denoting
          acquisition or possession. In particular, this can be obtained either
          by creation (as Gen. 14:19) or by generation (Gen. 4:1). The latter
          signification must be retained here, as is evident: (1) from the other
          phrases here accumulated “in the beginning of his way,” “before his
          works,” “before the ages,” “before the foundations of the earth,”
          which are simply the description of an absolute age; (2) from the word
          chvil, which is added to explain that possession and which means
          generation when the Septuagint translates it genna me.
        </p>
        <p><b>3. From Mic. 5:2.</b></p>
        <p>
          XIII. Third, it may be proved from Mic. 5:2 where “his goings forth”
          are said “to have been from of old, from the days of etemity” (viz.,
          in opposition to his temporal egress from the city of Bethlehem by his
          birth of a virgin in order to distinguish his temporal egress and
          generation from the eternal). For he cannot but have been begotten
          from the essence of the Father whose goings forth are said to have
          been from the beginning, from the days of eternity. And that this
          prophecy refers to the Messiah, Jonathan (ben Uzziel) acknowledges
          (Chaldee Paraphrase) and substitutes in place of mvshl, the word
          mshych’ (“Messiah”) (cf. Walton, Biblia sacra polyglotta, [1657], 3:74
          on Mic. 5:2). The things predicated prove it because he is called
          ruler in Israel by way of eminence (kat’ exochén); to him is ascribed
          the calling of the nations, a pastoral kingdom, the strength of
          Jehovah, the extension of glory and peace unto all the ends of earth
          (Mic. 5:4, 5). The various objections brought forward are easily
          answered. Although the going forth has a broader extension than
          generation, still it cannot be denied that generation is a going
          forth. Just as all the sons and posterity are said to go forth from
          the thigh of the fathers, and often the Son is said to have proceeded
          and gone forth from the Father (Jn. 13:3; 16:27, 28), so he could not
          have proceeded from the Father unless by a substantial generation,
          whose going forth preceded all creation and the production from
          nothing. If mqdm elsewhere does not signify eternity, it does not
          follow that it nowhere does because God is said to be mqdm (Hab. 1:12)
          “from the beginning” (ap’ archés), “from everlasting”; and God is
          called gdm, i.e., the eternal God (Dt. 33:27). So here the going forth
          is said to be from the beginning, i.e., from eternity; and the rather
          because another phrase is added pertaining to the same thing for
          emphasis (epitasin)—mymy ‘vlm (“from the days of eternity”). For
          although ‘vim and qdm (taken separately) refer to some time, yet when
          joined (as here) they signify eternity. That is indeed an audacious
          perversion to refer this to the antiquity of Christ’s family because
          he sprang from David of Bethlehem, who lived long before. It does not
          treat of the antiquity of the family of the Ruler, but of the Ruler
          himself (as not so much in the remote potency for being born, but as
          having actually existed). Nor is it better to say that he was from the
          beginning by reason of predestination because it had been decreed from
          eternity by God that he should some time go forth from the family of
          David. For the prophet does not speak of the decree concerning the
          Messiah to be manifested at some time, but of his actual going forth.
          Otherwise the goings forth of all things might be called eternal,
          because decreed.

        <p><b>4, From the filiation of Christ.</b></p>
        <p>
          XIV. Fourth, it may be proved from the filiation of Christ, which (as
          most peculiar and perfectly singular) ought necessarily to imply a
          communication of essence from the Father in the most perfect manner
          (viz., by generation). Therefore he is not only called “the Son” (ho
          hyios) by way of eminence (kat’ exochén) (Heb. 1:5) and “thou art the
          Christ, the Son of the living God” (Mt. 16:16), but also his own
          Son—“he that spared not his own Son” (Rom. 8:32); who has his own
          Father (Jn. 5:18); who begot the Son even from his essence—“the only
          begotten Son”; and “we beheld the glory of the only begotten” (Jn.
          1:14); and “the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the
          Father” (Jn. 1:18); and “highly beloved” (Mt. 3:17). Now if he were
          called Son only on account of a gracious communication of existence
          and glory (with respect to the human nature, whether in this
          miraculous conception or in this resurrection and exaltation or in
          this vocation), he could not be styled either the one or the only
          begotten Son of God (because such a filiation can belong to others
          also, if not in the same degree, yet in the same kind). For the angels
          also are called sons on account of excellency of nature; and
          magistrates on account of dignity of office; and Adam on account of
          adoption and regeneration, as well as resurrection. Therefore there
          must be some other mode of filiation proper and singular to him (which
          can be no other than by generation), so that by nature he may obtain
          that which is conferred by grace upon others. This the apostle
          contends for when he teaches that Christ is so the Son that with
          respect to him not even the angels are or can be called sons (Heb.
          1:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. When Christ is said to have been seen “as the only begotten (hds
          monogenés) of the Father” (Jn. 1:14), the to hos is not assimilative
          as if he were only like unto the only begotten. Rather it is
          expressive of truth (as often elsewhere, 2 Cor. 3:18; Lk. 22:44; 1
          Cor. 4:1) because he was truly such. This is inferred even from this,
          that he is said to have been in the beginning with God; yea, also to
          be God by whom all things were created. And if Christ has many
          brethren (Rom. 8:29), he does not cease to be the only begotten by way
          of eminence (kat’ exochén) because the generation is evidently
          dissimilar and totally different in kind: not mystical, but natural;
          not by an expression of qualities, but by a communication of the
          essence itself. Isaac is called the only begotten (Heb. 11:17) not
          simply, but relatively (because alone begotten from free Sarah in
          lawful wedlock with Abraham and therefore made sole heir). Now
          although monogenés and agapétos may be enunciated of the same subject
          (Gen. 22:2; Mt. 3:17), it does not follow that they are absolutely
          equivalent. Otherwise whoever are the “well-beloved of God” (agapétoi
          Theou) might also be called “the only begotten from the Father”
          (monogeneis para patros) (which is false). XVI. Christ is said to be
          “the own Son of the Father” not only inasmuch as it is opposed to one
          of another family, for thus he would not be distinguished from
          believers who also (in this sense) can be called the own sons of God
          (since they are not another’s); but inasmuch as it is opposed to an
          adopted and metaphorical son. Thus he may be called the natural son
          who is such by the privilege of his nature and not by the grace and
          benefit of adoption only (in opposition to believers who are adopted
          sons, Eph. 1:5). Just as the Father is called his own Father (Jn.
          5:17), not in a loose way, but in a most proper way (because the Jews,
          when they heard it, wished to stone him as if he had blaphemed—which
          they would not have done if he had merely spoken of an adoptive
          paternity).
        </p>
        <p><b>From Col. 1:5; Heb. 1:3.</b></p>
        <p>
          XVII. Fifth, he is the “image of the invisible God” (Col. 1:15) and
          “the brightness of the Father’s glory and the express image of his
          person” (apaugasma tes doxes, kai charakter tés hypostaseos autou,
          Heb. 1:3). For that ought to be a true generation whose end he is, who
          is the image of the begetter and the character of his person (such as
          Christ is said to be). Not without reason does Paul here join together
          apaugasma and charakteéra to denote the truth and perpetuity of the
          image. It is not only a brightness quickly vanishing, but a mark
          (character) which once impressed always remains. Nor is the objection
          of force here, that man is the image of God and yet not begotten from
          his essence. For an image may be accidental and analogical, consisting
          in a similarity of virtues (as in man with respect to God, who in this
          sense is said to be a partaker of the divine nature, 2 Pet. 1:4); or
          essential and natural (as existing in fathers and their sons, who are
          of the same nature with them). Such is Christ who is therefore said to
          be not only like to, but also equal with the Father. Now although
          Christ is the image of God considered hypostatically (i.e., of the
          Father and of the same essence with him), it does not follow that he
          is the image of himself because he can be the image of another (as to
          the mode of subsisting, who is of the Same essence with him). He
          cannot be the same person with him of whom he is the image, but this
          does not hinder him from being the same in essence. Although he may
          even be called the image of God (as God-man [theanthropos] and in
          relation to his mediatorial office) because he perfectly represents to
          us the Father, so that he who sees him sees also the Father (Jn.
          14:9); still the idea of the essential image is not excluded, but
          supposed. Because inasmuch as he is the Logos, that substantial image
          glitters in Christ incamate, and from him (as a mirror) is reflected
          the most clear image of the divine virtue—hence he is called “God
          manifested in the flesh” (Theos phanerotheis en sarki, 1 Tim. 3:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Christ cannot be called the Son of the living God with respect
          to unction and office (as if the name of Christ and the Son of God
          were coincident because they are expressly distinguished by the Lord).
          Nor is Christ said to be the Son of God because he was the Messiah. On
          the contrary, he is recognized as the Messiah just because he is the
          Son of God (who alone could be equal to this office). Hence it follows
          that because these two things are mutually joined together by an
          indivisible bond, no one can confess Jesus to be the Messiah without
          at the same time acknowledging him to be the Son of God, and vice
          versa. For Christ and the Son of God designate the same person, but
          not the same thing in the same person; for Son expresses the person,
          Christ the office. Nor ought it to be added that believers are often
          called the sons of the living God, who nevertheless, no one would say,
          are coessential with God (Hos. 1:10; Gal. 3:26; Rom. 8:14). For who
          does not know that the filiation of believers, no one of whom can be
          called the only begotten (monogenés) and proper Son of God (to wit, by
          gratuitous adoption in Christ) differs far from that by which Christ
          is by way of eminence (kat’exochén) called the Son of the living God
          (by antithesis to the son of dying man as something far more
          excellent). Even as Peter would intimate that he (with the other
          disciples) regarded him not only as the Son of man (as others
          considered him, supposing him to be either Elijah or one of the
          prophets or John the Baptist), but also the Son of that eternal God
          who always lives and never fails. Therefore as he was of the same
          nature with his mother as the Son of man, so he necessarily must be
          also of the same nature with the Father as the Son of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Although Christ might be called “the brightness of the Father’s
          glory” (apaugasma tés doxés) and the “express image of his person”
          (charaktér tés hypostaseOs) by reason of his mediatorial office and as
          he is God-man (theanthropos) because the Father has most perfectly
          expressed in him his own image and stamped it, as it were, with his
          own seal (Jn. 6:27), yet this does not hinder it from being attributed
          to him as he is the Logos and by reason of the eternal filiation.
          According to this, he is the “light of light, and God of God” (as the
          Nicene Council declares) and bears the most express image of the
          person of the Father in himself (by which he so differs from him
          according to subsistence as to agree with him according to essence).
          Indeed that relation (schesis) cannot have place unless these things
          are supposed because he could not have exhibited to us by incarnation
          the glory of God and the mark of his person unless he had been such
          before by an eternal generation.
        </p>
        <p><b>Sources of explanation.</b></p>
        <p>
          XX. Christ is called the “firstborn” in diverse ways: (1) by reason of
          his temporal nativity when he is called “the firstborn of Mary”
          (because no one was born of her before him and no one after him); (2)
          by reason of his resurrection as “the firstborn from the dead” (Col.
          1:18), both because he first arose, not so much by priority of time as
          of causality (because he arose by his own power [Jn. 2:19], while all
          others rose by the power of Christ) and because he arose to immortal
          life, never again to die; (3) by reason of authority and dominion, in
          which sense he is called the “firstborn of every creature” (Col. 1:15)
          and “among many brethren” (Rom. 8:29) because all the prerogatives of
          primogenitureship—a kingdom, priesthood, a double portion—most
          properly belong to him; (4) by reason of his eternal generation when
          he is called the “first begotten of God” (Heb. 1:6) because begotten
          by the Father from eternity (pro pasés ktiseOos monogenos genétheis,
          as the Greek Scholia have it). Nor ought the first begotten always to
          belong to the number of those of whom he is said to be the first
          begotten, since it often denotes the only begotten, before whom no one
          was and after whom no one will come. Thus Christ is called the
          firstborn of every creature, not because he is the first of creatures,
          but because he was begotten before creatures. Thus we must not
          understand here a ranking (connumeratio) with creatures, but a going
          before and a preexistence. For if he is before every creature, he
          ought not to be reckoned among creatures and so must be eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. The Father begat the Son as neither now existing because he would
          be supposed to have been already before, nor as not yet existing (for
          so he would not be eternal), but coexisting (because he was with the
          Father from eternity). Therefore division applies only to physical
          generation where the begotten passes over from not-being to being. But
          it cannot be accommodated to this hyperphysical generation, which is
          an eternal act of the eternal Father (from whom the Son emanates and
          in whom he remains without any abscission [praecisione] by
          coexisting). Hence the Son was not properly before generation, nor did
          he begin to be through generation, but always emanated from the Father
          by an eternal and internal act (like the rays emanating simultaneously
          with the sun, only in a more eminent, inexplicable manner). (2) In
          fine, by generation the divine essence is communicated to the
          begotten, not that it may exist, but subsist. Thus it is not
          terminated on the absolute existence, but on the mode of subsisting;
          nor by it is he constituted God absolutely, but the Son relatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Necessary and voluntary may in a measure be distinguished in God
          as to our manner of conception, yet they are not really opposed. Hence
          the Father is said to have begotten the Son necessarily and
          voluntarily; necessarily because he begat by nature, as he is God by
          nature, but voluntarily, because he begat not by coaction (coacte),
          but freely; not by an antecedent will, which denotes an act of willing
          (free outwardly), but by a concomitant, which denotes the natural
          faculty of willing in God; not by the liberty of indifference, but of
          spontaneity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. Although the Son may be said to be begotten by the Father, it
          does not follow that the Son is the Son of himself because the essence
          does not generate an essence, but a person (the Father, the Son, who
          is another one, although not another thing).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. That which is most perfect does not generate a thing differing
          from itself essentially, but a person differing from itself
          personally. For the essence of the Father is the essence of the Son
          and of the Holy Spirit, although to be the Father is not to be the
          Son, nor to be the Holy Spirit. Hence one thing remains always the
          most perfect (viz., God), although he is not one person because it is
          communicable to three self-existences (suppositis), not diverse in
          essence, but distinguished by characteristic relation.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. When the Son is said to be one God with the Father and yet to be
          a distinct person from him, there is no contradiction. Although he has
          the same essence (according to which he is said to be one with the
          Father), yet he has not the same mode of subsisting. If in finite and
          created things a diverse essence is required for a diverse person,
          does it not thence follow that this holds good in divine things where
          the same numerical and singular essence can nevertheless be
          communicable to more than one (because infinite)?
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. Although believers may be said “to be begotten” or “to be born
          of God” on account of a similarity of virtues (and not by a
          communication of essence), it does not follow that it can be
          understood in the same sense of Christ (because the discussion
          concerns a proper generation by which he is the proper and only
          begotten Son of God).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVII. The miraculous conception of Christ can be an argument a
          posteriori by which his eternal filiation is known, but is not
          immediately its cause a priori. Thus we must understand the words of
          the angel to the blessed virgin: “Therefore that holy thing which
          shall be born of thee, shall be called the son of God” (Lk. 1:35).
          Here the particle dio is a mark of consequence, not of a consequent;
          of sign why he should be called the Son of God, not of cause. For
          before his conception, he is said to have existed (Jn. 1:1; Phil.
          2:6). Hence he does not say simply “he shall be,” but “he shall be
          called” (kléthésetai, i.e., “manifested”.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVIII. The Son of God is not called Christ because he was sanctified
          by the Father (Jn. 10:36). He adds other reasons for filiation, both
          from unity of essence (Jn. 10:30) and from identity of works (Jn.
          10:38). He was sanctified (i.e., consecrated to the mediatorial
          office) because he was the Son (which otherwise he could not have
          undertaken). Nor is he the Son because beloved (Mt. 3:17), but beloved
          because he is the Son (as the order of the words teaches).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIX. While this hyperphysical generation is altogether different from
          physical and finite generation, the adversaries falsely argue from the
          latter to the former (as if any change, or imperfection, or priority
          of nature, or of time could fall on God). Every substantial generation
          is a change from not- being to being because everyone begotten is
          posterior to the begetter; he who begets communicates a part of his
          substance to another, and the begetter is essentially different from
          the begotten. These and similar things drawn from human generation are
          improperly transferred to the divine by a change to another kind
          (metabasin eis allo genos). And if these generations are mutually
          compared, they are to be considered as coequal. Indeed while whatever
          of perfection occurs in finite generation is attributed to it (as that
          the begetter begets a thing similar to himself by communication of
          essence), whatever denotes any imperfection must be carefully removed
          from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXX. To no purpose do the Scholastics weary themselves in
          investigating and explaining the mode of this generation, since it is
          not only ineffable, but also incomprehensible (akataléptos) to the
          angels themselves. “Tt is undecorous to seek,” says Athanasius against
          Arius, “how the Word is from God, or how he is the brightness of God,
          or how God begets and what is the mode of his generation. For he is
          crazy who would attempt such things, since he would essay to interpret
          in words a thing ineffable and proper to the divine nature and known
          only to himself and his Son” (Four Discourses Against the Arians 2.36
          [NPNF2, 4:367; PG 26.223]). And Hilary: “As the Father is
          inexpressible in that he is unbegotten; so the Son in that he is the
          only begotten cannot be expressed because he who is begotten is the
          image of the unbegotten” (The Trinity 3.18 [FC 25:80; PL 10.86]).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXI. The similitudes usually employed to explain this mystery (drawn
          either from the mind, which by understanding itself, excites the idea
          and image of itself in itself, which always remains in the mind whence
          it may emanate; or from the sun from which rays simultaneously emanate
          as it was neither before nor without them) can in some measure serve
          to illustrate this mystery, and the more because Scripture sometimes
          alludes to them when it calls the Son of God Logon, “Wisdom,” “the
          image of God” and “the brightness of the Father’s glory” (apaugasma
          doxés). But they cannot set forth a full and accurate determination of
          the mode of this generation. Hence here (if anywhere) we must be wise
          with sobriety so that content with the fact (to hoti) (which is clear
          in the Scriptures), we should not anxiously busy our thoughts with
          defining or even searching into the mode (which is altogether
          incomprehensible), but leave it to God who alone most perfectly knows
          himself.
