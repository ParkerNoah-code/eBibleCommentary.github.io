          THIRTY-FIRST QUESTION: THE PROCESSION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
          <em
            >Did the Holy Spirit proceed from the Father and the Son? We
            affirm</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. As generation (gennésis) is ascribed to the Son, so procession
          (ekporeusis) is ascribed to the Holy Spirit—taking the word not only
          widely (as denoting “to have origin from some one”; for thus it can
          also be applied to the Son, to whom exodos and exeleusis is
          attributed, since he is said to have come forth from the Father [Jn.
          16:28] and to have eternal goings- forth [Mic. 5:2]), but strictly
          (inasmuch as it denotes an emanation from the Father and the Son,
          distinct from the generation of the Son).
        </p>
        <p>Statement of the question.</p>
        <p>
          II. The question does not concern the temporal and external procession
          (which is terminated on creatures by which the Holy Spirit is sent to
          sanctify us and make perfect the work of salvation); but the question
          concerns the eternal and internal procession (which is terminated
          inwardly and is nothing else than the mode of communication of the
          divine essence, i.e., that by which the third person of the Trinity
          has from the Father and the Son the same numerical essence which the
          Father and the Son have).
        </p>
        <p>How procession differs from generation.</p>
        <p>
          III. That this procession differs from the generation of the Son
          cannot be denied because they are different persons who stand related
          to each other in origin. But the nature of this distinction cannot be
          explained and may more safely be unknown than inquired into. Hence
          John of Damascus says “that there is a difference between generation
          and procession, we have learned, but what the nature of the
          distinction is we by no means understand” (Hoti men esti diaphora
          geneseos kai ekporeuseOs memathekamen, tis de tropos diaphoras
          médamos, Exposition of the Orthodox Faith 1.8* [NPNF2, 9:9; PG
          94.824]). And Augustine: “There is a difference between generation and
          procession, but I know not how to distinguish them because both are
          inexpressible” (Contra Maximinum 2*.14, PL 42.770). I know that the
          Scholastics wish to derive this difference from the operation of the
          intellect (modum intellectus)—hence he is called the Wisdom of God;
          but procession by way of the will (modum voluntatis)—hence he is
          called Love and Charity. But as this is unsupported by Scripture, so
          it entangles rather than explains the thing. They speak more wisely
          who, stammering in a matter so difficult, place the distinction in
          three things: (1) in the principle, because the Son emanates from the
          Father alone, but the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son
          together. (2) In the mode, because the Son emanates by way of
          generation, which terminates not only on the personality, but also on
          the similarity (on account of which the Son is called the image of the
          Father and according to which the Son receives the property of
          communicating to another person the same essence; but the Spirit by
          way of spiration, which terminates only on the personality and by
          which the proceeding person does not receive the property of
          communicating that essence to another person). (3) In the order,
          because as the Son is the second person and the Spirit the third,
          generation in our mode of conceiving precedes spiration (although they
          are really coeternal).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Greeks and Latins dispute concerning the principle of procession.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. As to the principle of procession, there is a celebrated
          controversy between the Greeks and Latins who, however, are agreed
          about the unity of the Godhead and the Trinity of persons. The
          question is whether he proceeds from the Father only or from the
          Father and the Son. The Greeks held the former; the Latins the latter.
          The Greeks accuse the Latins of adding to the Nicene Creed (explained
          at Constantinople) the words filioque; the Latins, on their part,
          charge the Greeks with inserting the word monou in Article 7 of the
          Athanasian Creed (apo tou monou patros, cf. PG 28.1581, 1585, 1587,
          1589). The Eastern and Western churches frequently disputed violently
          about this thing. At length, at the Council of Florence (a.p. 1439),
          concord was brought about by determining that the Holy Spirit proceeds
          from the Father through the Son. But the orientals who subscribed to
          this receded from the transaction and still vehemently persist in
          their former opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Although the Greeks ought not to have been charged with heresy on
          account of their opinion, nor ought it to have been the occasion of a
          schism arising or continuing, still the opinion of the Latins may be
          properly retained as more agreeable to the words of Scripture and the
          truer. (1) The Holy Spirit is sent from the Son as well as from the
          Father (Jn. 16:7). He therefore ought to proceed from him because he
          cannot be sent by the Son unless he proceeds from him. (2) He is
          called the Spirit of the Son as well as the Father (Gal. 4:6). (3)
          Whatever the Spirit has, he has from the Son no less than from the
          Father (Jn. 16:13-—15), and as the Son is said to be from the Father
          because he does not speak of himself, but of the Father (from whom he
          receives all things), so the Spirit ought to be said to be and to
          proceed from the Son because he hears and speaks from him. (4) He
          breathed the Holy Spirit on his disciples in time (Jn. 20:22).
          Therefore he breathed him from eternity; for temporal procession
          presupposes an eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. The Father and the Son breathe the Holy Spirit not as two diverse
          principles (since the breathing power is the same in both), but as two
          self- existent (supposita) concur in that procession by the same
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Although the Spirit may be said to proceed from the Father (Jn.
          15:26), it is not denied of the Son. Indeed it is implied because the
          mission of the Spirit is ascribed to him and whatever the Father has,
          the Son is said to have equally (Jn. 16:15).
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Since breathing virtue is numerically one in the Father and the
          Son, it is not good to say that in this respect the Spirit proceeds
          from the Father through the Son (as if he was principally from the
          Father, but secondarily and less principally from the Son). If the
          mode of subsisting is considered (according to which the Father is the
          fountain of deity from whom the Son emanates), not improperly in this
          sense is he said to proceed from the Father through the Son (as to the
          order and mode of procession).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. If in certain primitive creeds the expression filioque was omitted
          (proving the procession from the Son), this was because at that time
          there had been no controversy agitated concerning the procession of
          the Holy Spirit. Yet it was prudently added afterwards on account of
          rising errors.
