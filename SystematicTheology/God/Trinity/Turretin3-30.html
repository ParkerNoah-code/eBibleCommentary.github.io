          THIRTIETH QUESTION: THE DEITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
          <em
            >Is the Holy Spirit a divine person, distinct from the Father and
            the Son? We affirm</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. As the anti-Trinitarians do not deny the personality, but the
          eternity of the Son; so they do not detract from the eternity, but the
          personality of the Holy Spirit. Therefore as we have just proved the
          eternity of the Son, the personality of the Spirit must now be
          demonstrated against the same.
        </p>
        <p><b>Statement of the question.</b></p>
        <p>
          II. The question does not concern the Spirit considered essentially
          (ousiddos), in which sense God is called a “Spirit” (Jn. 4:24), and
          the divine nature of Christ often comes under this name (1 Tim. 3:16;
          1 Pet. 3:18, 19), for this equally belongs to the three persons.
          Rather the question concerns the Spirit regarded hypostatically
          (hypostatikos) and designating one of them singularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The question is not whether the Spirit, called Holy by way of
          eminence (kat’ exochén), not only subjectively (because he is most
          holy), but also efficiently (because he sanctifies us), is a thing or
          a creature or some virtue of God (as the other attributes), for this
          the adversaries do not dispute. Rather the question is whether he is a
          divine person, not divided, but distinct from the Father and the Son.
          The fighters against the Spirit (pneumatomachi), the ancient as well
          as the more modern, deny it. We affirm it.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Holy Spirit ts a divine person.</b></p>
        <p>
          IV. The reasons are: (1) Various personal actions are attributed to
          the Holy Spirit (as to teach [Jn. 14:26]; to testify [Jn. 15:26; Rom.
          8:16]; to reveal future things [1 Tim. 4:1]; to search the deep things
          of God [1 Cor. 2:10]; to separate some and send them to minister by an
          express command [Is. 61:1; Acts 13:2; 20:28]; to create [Gen. 1:2]; to
          make pregnant a barren virgin [Lk. 1:35]; to exercise operations of
          every kind and confer upon men ordinary as well as extraordinary
          gifts—“all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit, dividing
          to every man severally as he will” [1 Cor. 12:11], where what he had
          said of God, that “he worketh all things” [ho de autos esti Theos ho
          energon ta panta, 1 Cor. 12:6], is here applied to the Holy Spirit
          [panta de tauta energei to hen kai to auto pneuma]. This could not be
          said if the Holy Spirit was not a divine person of the same order and
          virtue with the Father). Nor is the objection valid that personal
          properties are often ascribed to things, and yet the things themselves
          are not to be considered persons: as to sin, that it deceives and
          kills (Rom. 7:11); to the law, that it speaks (Rom. 3:19); to charity,
          that it believes and hopes all things (1 Cor. 13:7); to the blood of
          Abel, that it cried out (Gen. 4:10). For it is plain that the passages
          adduced do not denote the principal causes of acting, but the means to
          which the action of the principal agent is by a usual interchange
          ascribed. For sin properly can neither deceive (rather the devil
          through sin) nor actively kill (but meritoriously). The law properly
          does not speak, but the legislator speaks in or through the law.
          Charity (i.e., the man imbued with it) believes. Blood cries out, not
          effectively but objectively. Those things however which are ascribed
          to the Holy Spirit, so belong to persons and living beings that in
          Scripture they cannot be transferred to inanimate things.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. No better do they succeed, who refer this to personification
          (prosopopoeia) because the subject of a prosopopoeia is ordinarily
          some corporeal thing lacking life and sense (as when the heavens are
          commanded to hear, and the rivers to clap their hands—which do not
          apply to the Holy Spirit). (2) If Scripture had spoken of the Holy
          Spirit figuratively in one or another place, it would have explained
          this elsewhere in proper words (which it does not do; indeed it
          uniformly speaks of him so). (3) If the opinion of the adversaries is
          correct, the whole gospel history can easily be transformed into
          jejune allegories, and the expressions concerning Christ be
          transferred with the same propriety to the virtue of wisdom. (4)
          Although some figures of speech occur in Scripture with respect to
          other things, it does not follow that whatever we read concerning the
          Holy Spirit should be understood figuratively and by a prosopopoeia. A
          collation of the passages will readily prove the disparity.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Second, because he is set forth not only as distinct from the
          Father and the Son, but also as another one and sent from both (Jn.
          15:26; 16:7); cf. Jn. 14:16—“I will pray the Father, and he shall give
          you another Paraclete.” Now no one will say that one called another
          than the Father and the Son and sent by them is not a person equally
          with them. And the name “Paraclete” ascribed to him (which as it
          implies a personal office in Christ inasmuch as he acts as our
          intercessor and patron by pleading our cause with the Father, 1 Jn.
          2:1) ought to denote the same in the Holy Spirit—that he is personally
          the Paraclete of the Father and the Son for us (i.e., their
          interpreter) by performing towards us the duty of counsellor and
          consoler. Third, the exchange of gender teaches this, joining to
          pneumati (which is of the neuter gender) the masculine pronoun better
          adapted to denote a person: hotan elthé ekeinos to pneuma tes
          alétheias (Jn. 16:13). In Eph. 1:13, 14, we are Said to be sealed with
          “the Holy Spirit of promise” (to pneumati hagio hos estin arrabon).
          For no reason can be given why such a change should be made in
          Scripture except that thus the person of the Holy Spirit may be more
          clearly designated.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. Third, because he concurs with the Father and the Son (who are
          undoubtedly distinct persons) with equal power, authority and virtue
          in sealing believers and conferring benefits upon the church. This is
          evident from the prescribed formula of baptism (Mt. 28:19), the
          apostolic benediction (2 Cor. 13:14) and the testimony concerning
          Christ (1 Jn. 5:7) (which could not be the case unless he were a
          person distinct from them and of the same condition and authority with
          them). The objections of the adversaries have been discussed before
          (in the Question concerning the Trinity).
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Fourth, because he appeared in a visible form (as in the baptism
          of Christ, in the form of a dove [Mt. 3:16] and on the day of
          Pentecost, in the form of tongues which seemed to the apostles cloven
          like fire sitting upon them [Acts 2:3]). It belongs to persons (not to
          attributes or accidents) to assume visible forms and to appear in or
          with or under such forms. Nor without absurdity can anyone say that
          the justice or mercy of God or any other virtue manifested itself by a
          visible form. Nor should it be objected that not everything which
          appears is per se subsistent since accidents appear and yet do not
          subsist per se. For although it is true that accidents immediately
          strike the eye, yet they always suppose a substratum or person. Hence
          under that visible form there must have been some subsistence (which
          the text asserts was the Holy Spirit and expressly distinguishes from
          the persons of the Father and the Son in the baptism of the Savior).
          Nor can it be said that the fiery tongues should be restricted to the
          gifts of the Holy Spirit. The text draws a plain distinction between
          the Spirit and his gifts: “They began to speak with other tongues, as
          the Holy Spirit” with whom they were filled “gave them utterance”
          (Acts 2:4).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Fifth, because there is a sin against the Holy Spirit. Hence
          mention is made of Israelites who grieved the Spirit of holiness (Is.
          63:10); and of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit as an unpardonable
          sin (Mt. 12:31, 32); and of Ananias and Sapphira who are said to have
          lied to the Holy Ghost (Acts 5:3)—whence they immediately paid the
          penalty of their crime. Now he against whom we sin must be a divine
          person. For as God alone is the object of worship and adoration, so he
          alone is properly and ultimately the object of sin. And as the
          blasphemy directed against the Father and the Son supposes them to be
          persons, so also the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Indeed this is
          the more certainly evinced from the fact that the blasphemy against
          the Holy Spirit is reckoned a far more grievous crime, since it is
          unpardonable—capable of being remitted neither in this world nor in
          that which is to come, i.e., never (according to Mark’s
          interpretation). This could not be said if he was not a person. Now
          although in Scripture some things are said to be blasphemed which are
          not persons (as “our good,” Rom. 14:16; “doctrine,” 1 Tim. 6:1; “the
          word of God,” Tit. 2:5; “the way of truth,” 2 Pet. 2:2); it does not
          follow that the same may be said of the Spirit because things are
          always said to be blasphemed relatively to God himself. Thus the
          blasphemy of our good is an offense against God himself from whom we
          receive that good; the blasphemy of doctrine and the word extends to
          God the author of them. But it is different with the blasphemy against
          the Holy Spirit because it is expressly distinguished from that
          against the Father and the Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. It is falsely said that Ananias lied to the Holy Spirit as a gift
          of God (possessed by Peter) and not as a divine person. For no one can
          lie to anyone but to an intelligent and living person. Hence Peter
          says, “Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God” (Acts 5:4), to wit,
          by lying to the Holy Spirit. This is explained in Acts 5:9 by tempting
          (to peirazesthai) the Holy Spirit (which can be said only of a
          person). And although to pseudesthai with the accusative means rather
          “to falsify and deceive” than “to lie” (which cannot be said
          absolutely, since this verb is joined not only with the dative but
          also with the accusative in the same signification, Prov. 14:5; Is.
          57:11), still it comes to the same thing (since he ought to be a
          person whom others desire to deceive equally with him to whom they
          endeavor to lie). XI. Sixth, the distinction between the Holy Spirit
          and his gifts (so often drawn) proves this. For why should Scripture
          so carefully make such a distinction if the Spirit was nothing else
          than a gift of God? It is true indeed that the Spirit is sometimes put
          for his gifts, but it is evident also that he is elsewhere expressly
          distinguished from them as their author and efficient cause: “There
          are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit” (1 Cor. 12:4); “To one
          is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another, the word of
          knowledge” (1 Cor. 12:8); “All these worketh that one and the selfsame
          Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will” (1 Cor. 12:11).
          And that no one may imagine it is some virtue or power of God
          belonging to him as an attribute, the Scripture distingushes power
          (dynamin) from the Spirit: “Jesus returned from the desert in the
          power of the Spirit” (Lk. 4:14); “ye shall receive,” said Christ, “the
          power of the Holy Spirit coming upon you” (Acts 1:8). In the latter,
          power (dynamis) denotes the effect, but the Spirit is cause and source
          (viz., a person endowed with this power, which he pours out upon
          others).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >The divinity of the Holy Spirit may be proved: (1) from the
            names.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Now that the Holy Spirit is not only a person but a divine person
          can be most incontestably evinced from the four arguments by which we
          have proved the names, the attributes, works and worship of God are
          ascribed to him. The names, indeed, because what is said of Jehovah of
          Hosts (Is. 6:9) is applied to the Holy Spirit: “Well spake the Holy
          Ghost by Esaias the prophet, saying, go unto this people” (Acts 28:25,
          26*). He who is called the Spirit of God is immediately afterwards
          said to be God and the Rock of Israel: “The Spirit of Jehovah spake by
          me, and his word was in my tongue. The God of Israel said, the Rock of
          Israel spake to me” (2 S. 23:2, 3*). Here pertains that Ananias is
          said to have lied to God because he lied to the Holy Spirit (as we
          have seen before); also that believers are said to be temples of the
          living God because they are the temples of the Holy Spirit who dwells
          in them: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the
          Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” (1 Cor 3:16; 6:19). And since the
          temple and the divinity are related, he cannot but be God whose temple
          we are said to be. Nor ought this to be understood only of his
          presence or indwelling; for not all things said to be dwelt in are on
          that account temples, and we are never called temple of the divine
          word, which however ought to dwell in us largely. But a temple
          necessarily involves a relation to the religious worship of him to
          whom it is erected. Hence Augustine: “If we commit sacrilege by
          building a temple to any creature, how is not he the true God to whom
          we do not build a temple, but whose temple we ourselves are?”
          (Collatio cum Maximino*, PL 42.722).
        </p>
        <p><b>2. From the attributes.</b></p>
        <p>
          XIII. Second, divine attributes belong to him. Eternity, because he
          was even in the beginning of creation for “he moved upon the face of
          the waters” (Gen 1:2). Now he who preceded the creation of all things
          is not himself created and is therefore eternal. Omnipresence and
          immensity: “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?” (Ps. 139:7, 8). That
          this is to be referred to the presence of his essence and not only of
          his virtue has been proved before in the question concerning the
          immensity of God. “The Holy Spirit dwells in you” (1 Cor. 3:16), not
          assuredly by his efficacy only, but also by his essence because he is
          there as God in his temple. Omniscience, because he searches the deep
          things of God, not effectively because he makes us search. It does not
          belong to us to search the deep things of God (ta bathé tou Theou, 1
          Cor. 3:16) lest we should be overwhelmed by his glory (Prov. 25:27);
          but subjectively and formally because he is said to bear the same
          relation to the things of God as the spirit of man to the things of
          man (properly and formally searching into the interior things of each
          by reflex operations). The design of the apostle leads us to this,
          which is to prove that God’s Spirit (omniscient and searching all
          things) can alone certainly reveal to us those things which God has
          prepared for them that love him (which otherwise neither eye hath
          seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, 1
          Cor. 2:9). Now he is said to search, not by inquiring (which would
          imply some doubt), but by penetrating (just as God is said to search
          the heart and reins). Here pertains that he is said “to announce
          future things” (Jn. 16:13), which belongs to God alone; and that the
          prophets, who predicted future things, spoke by him (2 Pet. 1:21).
          Omnipotence, because he is called the “power of the Highest” (Lk.
          1:35), not simply essential, but personal. Life, because he is a
          vivifying Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) who quickens our mortal bodies (Rom.
          8:11).
        </p>
        <p><b>3. From works.</b></p>
        <p>
          XIV. Third, the works both of nature and of creation (Gen. 1:2; Ps.
          33:6); conservation and government (Ps. 104:30); the working of
          miracles (Mt. 12:28; 1 Cor. 12:4) and of grace; the conception of
          Christ (Lk. 1:35); unction and mission (Is. 61:1); remission of sins
          and regeneration (1 Cor. 6:11; Jn. 3:5); government of the church
          (Acts 13:2; 15:28; 20:28); prediction of future events (Jn. 16:13;
          Acts 11:28); bestowal of gifts (1 Cor. 12:7); illumination (Eph. 1:17,
          18); sanctification (2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Pet. 1:2); the resurrection of
          the dead (Rom. 8:11).
        </p>
        <p><b>4, From worship.</b></p>
        <p>
          XV. Fourth, divine worship is given to him because we are baptized in
          his name as well as in that of the Father and the Son. In the
          Apostles’ Creed, we are commanded to believe in him as well as in the
          Father and the Son. We seek grace and peace and other benefits from
          him no less than from the Father and the Son (2 Cor. 13:14*). In Rev.
          1:4, grace and peace are sought “from the seven spirits which are
          before the throne.” The Holy Spirit is thus represented not with
          respect to personality (which is one only), but with respect to the
          sevenfold (i.e., the multiple) variety of gifts which he bestows upon
          believers. The number seven is used, not only on account of his
          perfection, but in allusion to the seven churches written to (in order
          to intimate that he will pour upon them copious showers of his gifts,
          as if a single spirit were given to each church). Nor can it be said
          that by these seven spirits is not meant a person, but is expressed
          the medium through which the apostle wishes grace and peace to come
          from the Father. For he seeks grace from the spirits in the same way
          as from the Father (from the Spirits [apo pneumaton] as the principle
          and cause). Thus because we are the temple of the Holy Spirit, Paul
          concludes that we must glorify God both in our body and in our soul,
          which are God’s (1 Cor. 6:20). What God? (to wit, that God whose
          temple we are, not to the exclusion of the Father and the Son, but
          economically designating the Holy Spirit, whom to invoke is to
          glorify). Hence the Spirit who speaks by the prophets is invoked by
          the church: “Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven and earth,
          who, by the mouth of thy servant David hast said” (Acts 4:24, 25). By
          this example also the ancient church always invoked him in the hymn of
          the Holy Spirit —‘“Come, Creator Spirit;” and “Glory to the Father, to
          the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. If Scripture less frequently makes mention of the adoration and
          worship of the Holy Spirit, it is not because he is not to be adored
          equally with the Father and the Son (for there are not wanting
          precepts and examples of this adoration); but because in the economy
          of salvation (which answers to the order of the persons) as the Father
          works through the Son and the Son through the Holy Spirit, so the
          glory of the deity arising from adoration is carried from the Holy
          Spirit who excites prayers in the hearts of believers through the Son
          as Mediator to the Father. For this reason he is more often set forth
          as the author and principle of prayers than as the object towards
          which they may be directed (as the one who rather invokes [i.e.,
          causes us to invoke] than the one who may be invoked).

          XVII. A gift of God considered essentially (ousiddos) cannot be God;
          but this does not hinder the gift of God taken personally from being a
          divine person (just as Christ, who is a divine person, is nevertheless
          called the gift of God, Jn. 3:16; 4:10; Is. 9:6). Thus the Holy Spirit
          can be called the gift of God. Nor does it always imply a
          contradiction for one to be both a gift and the giver of himself,
          since Christ gave himself for us and to us for the support of our
          eternal life: “The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will
          give for the life of the world” (Jn. 6:51).

          XVIII. If some things are at times attributed to the Holy Spirit which
          seem to be less proper to a person (as that we are anointed, baptized
          and filled with him; that he is poured out by God and given to us),
          these must be understood of his gifts in us. However the truth of his
          person still remains (just as Christ is said to be put on, received
          and eaten by us, and to be given to us by God without prejudice to his
          personality).

          XIX. The gifts (merismoi) of the Holy Spirit (Heb. 2:4) do not so much
          mean (passively) partitions of the Spirit, as (actively) distributions
          of the gifts mentioned—made by the Spirit who distributes his own
          gifts to whom he will (1 Cor. 12:11). Therefore although we
          acknowledge a distribution of the gifts of the Spirit, yet we deny a
          division or partition of the person of the Spirit (which is undivided
          in itself and divided from any other).

          XX. As the Holy Spirit is often by metonymy put for his gifts, so he
          is said to be increased or diminished not with regard to the principle
          but with regard to the gifts which he scatters among men. Thus God is
          said to have taken of the same Spirit which he had bestowed upon Moses
          (i.e., of the same gifts and grace which were necessary for the
          government of the republic) that he might give to the seventy elders
          in order that they might bear a part of the burden (Num. 11:17).
          Elisha seeks for himself a double spirit (2 K. 2:9, i.e., graces
          twofold more than those commonly seen in other prophets or a double
          portion of the gifts of the Spirit [viz., a great abundance] to enable
          him to perform the great and difficult duty required of him). If this
          is called “the power and spirit of Elijah” (Lk. 1:17), it must not be
          understood originally, but subjectively because it resided in Elijah.

          XXI. The true God cannot be sent by command because he acknowledges no
          superior; but he can be sent by consent (which denotes diversity of
          office indeed, but not of essence). The Son and the Spirit are sent in
          the latter way, not in the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. The Holy Spirit was not before the glorification of Christ (Jn.
          7:39)—not simply and absolutely, as if he just then began to be
          according to his personality (kath’ hypostasin) (the contrary which
          his effects demonstrate), but relatively, by reason of the more
          copious outpouring about to take place afterwards, upon the apostles
          and others.
