          TWENTY-FIFTH QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >In the one divine essence are there three distinct persons: the
            Father, Son and Holy Spirit? We affirm against the Socinians</em
          >
        </p>
        <p><b>Statement of the question.</b></p>
        <p>
          I. To understand this primary question which we agitate with the
          ancient as well as the more modern anti-Trinitarians, take notice that
          the orthodox faith is this: in the one only and most simple essence of
          God there are three distinct persons so distinguished from each other
          by incommunicable properties or modes of subsisting that one cannot be
          the other—although by an inexpressible circum-insession
          (emperichoreésin) they always remain and exist in each other mutually.
          Thus the singular numerical essence is communciated to the three
          persons not as a species to individuals or a second substance to the
          first (because it is singular and undivided), nor as a whole to its
          parts (since it is infinite and impartible); but as a singular nature
          to its own act of being (suppositis) in which it takes on various
          modes of subsisting. Hence it is evident: (1) that the divine essence
          is principally distinguished from the persons in having
          communicability, while the persons are distinguished by an
          incommunicable property; (2) that it differs from other singular
          natures in this—that while they can be communicated to only one
          self-existent being (supposito) and are terminated on only one
          subsistence (because they are finite), the former (because infinite)
          can admit of more than one.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Hence it is that the three divine persons are not three gods (as
          among men) because the divine persons partake of the same numerical
          essence, and that infinite. But three men partake of the same specific
          essence only, not numerical. Thus the three persons of the Trinity are
          not to be called synousioi or homoiousioi, but homoousioi because they
          have between themselves not only a similar, but the same numerical
          essence (nothing like which exists in creatures). Nor do the
          properties by which they are mutually distinguished constitute unequal
          degrees (although they may designate their order as diverse modes of
          subsisting). By this neither is the essence divided in the persons nor
          are the persons separated from the essence, but they are only so
          distinguished that the one cannot be the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The question is not whether God is one numerically; or whether
          these three names (the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit) may be spoken
          of God. This the Sabellians and Socinians readily grant. Rather the
          question is whether these three names designate three distinct persons
          subsisting in but one, undivided essence, which the orthodox maintain
          and the anti- Trinitarians deny. The latter consist of both they who,
          with Sabellius, recognize only one person, who in different respects
          puts on now the name of Father, then of Son and again of Holy Spirit
          (which most pestiferous error in a former age that monster of a man
          Michael Servetus recalled from the pit); and they who, with the
          Tritheists, from three persons make up three essences (essentia)—one
          essentiating (essentiantem), two essentiated (essentiatas) (which the
          impious Valentine Gentilis asserted); and they who, with the wretched
          Socinus, blasphemously dare to traduce this most sacred mystery as a
          figment of the human brain. Against these, the orthodox faith must be
          established.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >The Trinity can be satisfactorily proved, not from the light of
            nature, but from revelation alone.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. But as this mystery far transcends the reach of the human reason,
          so it can be solidly demonstrated from the revealed word alone.
          Whatever proofs of it some are wont to adduce from nature and reason,
          or from the perfection and power of God, or from his understanding, or
          from the communication of good (although on the supposition of a
          revelation, they may with respect to believers serve in some measure
          to illustrate it), yet they cannot convince and obtain the force of
          solid proof. The same is the case with the various similitudes usually
          employed here: from the human soul, the rainbow, a tree, a fountain,
          the sun and light. These seem to afford some resemblance to the
          Trinity, though very obscure as they always labor under a great
          dissimilitude. Thus they ought to be proposed soberly and cautiously,
          not for the purpose of convincing adversaries, but for confirming
          believers and showing them the credibility at least of this great
          mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The things pertaining to this mystery occurring in the monuments of
          the heathen are either adulterated or supposititious (as the things
          drawn from Trismegistus and the Sibylline Books, which have been for a
          long time condemned as spurious by the more acute). If there were no
          other proof, this would suffice—that this mystery is there more
          clearly unfolded than was done by any of the prophets. Or the things
          pertaining to this mystery are of no importance, as the allusions in
          Plato and the Platonists to three principles—“Mind,” Word” and
          “Spirit” (which if they prove anything, favor three essences or
          separate gods). All the truth they contain appears to have been drawn
          from the ancient doctrine of the Hebrews and the reading of Moses and
          the prophets. It must be ascribed to tradition grounded on revelation
          rather than to reason grounded on the light of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Therefore whatever it is permitted to know concerning this mystery
          must be learned from the word of God alone. The only certain and
          invincible proof is to be drawn neither from the obscure and corrupt
          light of reason, nor from the rivulets of the fathers, nor from the
          stagnant pools of the Scholastics (“air-walkers” [aerobatounton] and
          rashly rushing into that deep of deeps) who, while laboriously
          striving to leave nothing undiscussed by their subtle acuteness, at
          length feel that the searchers into majesty are oppressed by it;
          rather it is to be drawn from the perfectly limpid fountains of
          Scripture in which the Holy Spirit has condescended to reveal to us
          the whole of this mystery as far as it is necessary to be known for
          salvation; in the Old Testament, indeed rather obscurely, but in the
          New more clearly. Hence we start with our proofs.
        </p>
        <p><b>1. The Trinity is proved from the baptism of Christ.</b></p>
        <p>
          VII. The first is drawn from the baptism of Christ (Mt. 3:16, 17*) in
          which three persons manifested themselves in distinct personality: the
          Father who spoke from heaven; the Son who ascended from the Jordan;
          and the Spirit who descended from heaven in the form of a dove and
          rested upon the Son. One is heard, but is neither seen nor descends.
          Another is not heard, but descends in a visible form. Another descends
          to and ascends from the river, baptized in the sight of all. Hence the
          saying of the ancients, “Arian, go to Jordan, and there you will see
          the Trinity.” The Son here meant is not a common, but the singular and
          proper, and “beloved in whom the Father was well pleased,” who must
          baptize with the Holy Spirit (Lk. 3:16). This cannot be said of a
          created person, but only of a divine person. The Spirit mentioned
          cannot only designate some will or property of God because the
          properties of God are never in Scripture said to descend from heaven
          upon anyone (which is a personal act) much less to assume any
          corporeal and visible form. Nor ought the particle hdsei (which is
          attached) to be referred to the mode of descent (as the Socinians
          wish, as if it meant descending gradually and lightly in the manner of
          a dove, not impetuously as a hawk eager after its prey); but to the
          mode of appearing (which was made under that visible and bodily form
          to designate better the character of the Spirit of Christ). Hence both
          the descent itself, and the remaining upon Christ sufficiently prove a
          descending person, not a simple quality. Nor is it an objection that
          we are said “to be baptized with him.” We can as properly be said “to
          be baptized with the Spirit” (viz., figuratively and mystically) as to
          “be clothed with and be nourished by Christ” (although he is a
          person).
        </p>
        <p><b>2. From our baptism.</b></p>
        <p>
          VIII. Second, the same thing is proved by our baptism instituted by
          Christ: “Teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
          and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Mt. 28:19). Here also three
          distinct persons are mentioned of the same nature, authority and power
          to whom we equally give our names and promise obedience. We are
          baptized into the name common to them, not into the names (which
          denotes unity of essence). To be “baptized into the name of God”
          signifies particularly three things: (1) the authority of God who
          instituted it and confirmed by this sacrament (as a seal) the covenant
          he made with us; (2) the promise of grace and protection of those whom
          he receives by baptism into his fellowship; (3) the stipulation of
          worship and obedience to which the baptized are bound by the covenant.
          It is also necessary that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
          should be that only one and true God who, as the author of the
          covenant of grace, has the authority to institute sacraments, to seal
          it, who can promise and bestow covenanted grace, and to the worship of
          obedience of whom the covenanted are introduced and obligated (which
          Paul clearly testifies can be said of no mortal [1 Cor. 1:13] when he
          denies that the Corinthians were baptized in the name of Paul). Nor
          can it weaken the force of this argument that the Israelites are said
          to have been baptized into Moses (1 Cor. 10:2) since it is one thing
          to be baptized into the name of God, another to be baptized into
          Moses, i.e., by the ministry of Moses, “by the hand of Moses” (bydh
          msch, as the Syrian and Arabian versions have it); or, what is better,
          “into the doctrine of Moses,” to the confirmation of the doctrine
          delivered by Moses (just as Moses is often used for the law or the
          doctrine delivered by him; cf. Jn. 5:45, 446—“Moses” [i.e., the
          doctrine of Moses] “in whom ye trust and whom ye believe accuses
          you”). “They have Moses and the prophets” (Lk. 16:29) not in their
          persons, but doctrines. So “to be baptized unto the baptism of John”
          is to be baptized unto the confirmation of the doctrine which John
          sealed by his baptism (Acts 19:3).
        </p>
        <p><b>3. From 1 Jn. 5:7.</b></p>
        <p>
          IX. Third, it may be proved from 1 Jn. 5:7 where three are expressly
          mentioned who are said to be one: “for there are three that bear
          record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these
          three are one.” Three witnesses are brought forward not as qualities,
          but persons. For as the Father is a person, so also is the Word and
          the Spirit who are placed in the Same order and degree. Witnesses, not
          human or angelic, who utter a divine testimony (v. 10) are opposed
          thereby to a human and created witness. Still they so distinctly
          testify that they are one not only in consent and will but in essence,
          that they are called “one” (Jn. 10:30). To no purpose do the
          adversaries (in order to avoid this dart) endeavor to weaken
          confidence in this passage, as if it were interpolated because it is
          wanting in various Greek manuscripts, is not found in the Syriac and
          Arabic versions and is omitted by various fathers. For the most
          ancient and approved manuscripts, which retain this text, support our
          opinion. Jerome in his prologue to the Canonical Epistles (Prologus
          Septem Epistolarum Canonicarum [PL 29.870—74]) remarks that it existed
          in the Greek manuscripts, and Erasmus confesses that it was extant in
          the Codex Britannicus. The most approved editions (that of
          Complutensis, Antwerp, Arias Montanus, Robert Stephen’s and Walton),
          which are founded upon the best manuscripts, have it. Hence, if in
          some it is wanting, this must be attributed either to the fraud and
          treachery of the Arians (as Jerome acknowledges) or of the more
          ancient heretics whose sacrilegious hands evidently tampered with the
          Scriptures. In addition, the connection of the text itself and the
          series of the apostle’s discourse demand it. For there would be no
          sense to the following words (“and there are three that bear witness
          in earth”) unless there were supposed to be three preceeding witnesses
          testifying in heaven with whom a comparison could be made of the
          witnesses in earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Falsely also they maintain that it treats only of the unity of
          consent or homoboulia: (1) because perfect unity of consent
          (homoboulia) supposes also sameness of essence (homoousian); hence
          they of our party who refer it to consent do not exclude, but suppose
          an identity of nature; for whatever is not God (since what is mutable
          and fallible can fail), its testimony cannot be called divine and one
          with God; (2) not only are they said to agree in one thing (eis to
          hen, as is said of the earthly witnesses, which is properly referred
          to consent), but that they are one (to hen, which properly implies
          identity of nature). Nor if believers are said “to be one” (Jn. 17:21)
          as “the Father is one with the Son,” does it follow that the unity is
          the same in both cases. Nor does the word kathos always denote
          equality, but some analogy and similitude (as 1 Pet. 1:19; Mt. 5:48).
          It is not said of believers that they are one with God, but that “they
          are one spirit” (1 Cor. 6:17); not referring to an essential, but to a
          mystical and spiritual union, so that to be one spirit (einai hen
          pneuma) is the same as to be “one in spirit” (einai hen to pneumati)
          because the same spirit operates both in the head and in the members.
        </p>
        <p><b>4. From 2 Cor. 13:14.</b></p>
        <p>
          XI. Fourth, the apostolic benediction not obscurely evinces the same
          thing. “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
          the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all” (2 Cor. 13:14). For
          these three blessings, embracing the whole plan of salvation, are
          sought by believers from three distinct persons and distinguished by
          three names. Therefore if the Lord who confers grace, and God who
          bestows love are persons, why should not also the Holy Spirit (who is
          classified with them) be of the same order and dignity? Nor can it be
          objected here that the communion of the Spirit must be understood
          passively, not actively (as if this were a wish that the grace of
          Christ and the love of the Father would communicate the Holy Spirit to
          believers). It is one thing to seek the Spirit from the love of God
          and the grace of Christ; but another to seek that the communion of the
          Spirit may be with believers, no less than the grace of Christ and the
          love of the Father (which is done here). For in this manner the three
          blessings flowing from the three persons in the work of redemption are
          designated according to the mode of operation proper to each one; the
          love of God in the destination; the grace of Christ in the
          acquisition; and the communion of the Spirit in the application (as
          the Spirit is elsewhere set forth as the author of gifts and as the
          object of prayer, not as its matter, when grace and peace are sought
          from him, Rev. 1:4, 5).
        </p>
        <p><b>5. From Jn. 15:26.</b></p>
        <p>
          XII. Fifth, here belong the passages in which express mention is made
          of three, mutually distinct from each other, to whom divine works are
          equally ascribed; as “when the Comforter is come, whom I will send
          unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth
          from the Father, he shall testify of me” (Jn. 15:26); and “I will pray
          the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide
          with you for ever” (Jn. 14:16). Here we see that mention is made of
          the Comforter sent, of the Son sending, and of the Father from whom he
          proceeds, and in whose name he is sent (who as the one from the other
          in turn—the Son from the Father and the Spirit from the Son—yet are
          placed in an equal grade of authority and power for the accomplishment
          of the work of redemption, which belongs to God alone without the
          intervention of creatures). Thus the mission and execution show only
          an order among the persons and a distinction of personal relation, not
          a diversity of essence or of causality. Nor is it an objection that
          Christ says that he prays to the Father and that the Father is greater
          than he (Jn. 14:16, 28) because he says this with respect to office
          and economy, not in relation to essence; or that the Spirit is said to
          be given to many (which belongs not to a person). For the Son also may
          well be said to be given to many, not by destroying or dividing the
          person, but by communicating blessings; or that the Spirit is said to
          speak not of himself (Jn. 16:13). For this must not be understood
          absolutely as if he did not speak anything, but because he did not
          teach anything different from what Christ had taught (to intimate that
          he is the end-accomplishing [telesiourgikon] principle, consummating
          the work begun by the Father and carried on by the Son).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. “Now there are diversities of gifts,” says Paul, “but the same
          Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same
          Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
          which worketh all in all” (1 Cor. 12:4—6). Now since it is evident
          that no one but God alone can be the author of gifts, operations and
          administrations, it is necessary that the Spirit, the Lord and God the
          Father (from whom they proceed) must be that one God. Nor can it be
          said that those are subordinate not principal causes because they are
          placed in the same order, and the Spirit is said to distribute to
          every man severally gifts as he will (just as much as the Father is
          said to be the author of operations). The apostle wishes to reduce to
          unity the Corinthians (quarrelling among themselves about gifts) by
          this argument: whatever you possess—whether gifts, or administrations,
          or miraculous operations—proceed from the one God. Yet these are
          bestowed partly by the Holy Spirit, partly by the Lord Jesus, partly
          by God the Father (who is called God by way of eminence, kat’
          exochén). Therefore the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are that
          one God in whom you ought to cherish unity.
        </p>
        <p><b>Sources of explanation.</b></p>
        <p>
          XIV. It is impossible to be and not to be the same in the same
          respect. But in the Trinity they who are distinguished personally can
          be the same essentially. Therefore, although the Son is of the same
          essence with the Father, he is rightly said not to be the Father; for
          the former is said only with respect to essence and the latter with
          respect to person.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. Three numerical Gods are not one numerical God. Although the
          Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are three numerical persons, still
          they are not three numerical Gods because they partake of the same
          divine essence. The Father is one, the Son is another (but not another
          God). He is another personally, but not essentially.
        </p>

          XVI. The principles which are true concerning finite natures must not
          be transferred to the infinite; otherwise they become false (for
          example, three cannot be one; the begetter and the begotten are not
          one in essence; the singular and individual cannot be communicated to
          more than one). Thus the inference is faulty—three human persons are
          three men, therefore three divine persons are three gods. The reason
          is that these three human persons partake only of the same specific
          and not numerical essence and a similar rather than the same essence
          (for they have each one his own essence and singular existence); but
          the divine persons partake of the same infinite, numerical essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Although there are three divine persons, it does not follow that
          there are three infinites. For as the Trinity of persons does not
          imply a Trinity of gods (on account of the identity of essence), so it
          does not imply a Trinity of infinites because the three persons have
          the same numerical infinity (which is an essential property). Thus
          they are the one infinite God.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Where there are one and three really distinct, there are four.
          But here, the three persons are not really distinguished from the
          essence, but only the mode of subsisting (so that another may be found
          among the persons, but not another thing between them and the divinity
          because these three persons are nothing else than the one God who
          subsists diversely in three persons).
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Although the true God is the Trinity, yet not whatever is true
          God is the Trinity. Rather it is either the Trinity or some one of the
          persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. He who conceives God as one has a complete conception as to the
          complement of essence, but not immediately as to the complement of
          personality. Nor if our conception of God is incomplete, does it
          therefore follow that the divine essence itself is incomplete because
          the essence is inseparable from the persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. One in number substantively as to essential unity cannot be three
          in the same respect; but it can be three adjectively and personally as
          to the personal Trinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. Things which are the same with a third are the same with each
          other (viz., with respect to that third in which they agree). Thus
          because the persons agree in essence, they are also the same among
          themselves as to essence. Thus they may properly be said to be idem,
          but not iidem, the same God, but not the same persons. (2) Things
          which are the same with a singular and incommunicable third are the
          same with each other, but when they are the same with a universal (or
          at least a communicable third), they are not mutually the same (for
          example, Paul and Peter are one in human nature specifically, but they
          are not mutually the same numerically because human nature is
          universal). The Father and the Son are one in the divine nature and
          yet are not mutually the same because the divine nature in which they
          agree (although singular and individual) is nevertheless communicable
          to more than one person.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. Hence appears what must be answered to the sophism of heretics
          who bring forward as an expository syllogism: “The divine essence is
          the Father; the divine essence is the Son; therefore the Son is the
          Father” (viz., that it is of mere particulars and is composed of four
          terms because the middle term [to wit the divine essence] is not
          incommunicable as it ought to be in such syllogisms and is taken
          diversely in the major and minor). For in the major, either it is
          taken universally and completely in this sense—the divine essence is
          the Father (i.e., whatever is the divine essence) and thus it is
          false; or it is taken particularly and incompletely—the someone who is
          the divine essence is the Father; and so it is true, but concludes
          nothing because they are mere particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. Although the divine nature taken precisely may be conceived to
          have singularity and existence, yet it cannot be called a person
          because it does not have incommunicability. Although it extends more
          widely than the single persons taken separately, yet with respect to
          the persons taken together it is adequate to and identified with them.
          So each person partakes indeed of the whole divinity, but not totally
          and adequately (if it is proper so to speak) because it is so in the
          Father as it is also in the Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. In what essence the Father is the only God opposed to the Son and
          Holy Spirit and not only to creatures and the false deities of the
          heathen, in that there are not three distinct persons; but thus we
          deny the Father to be the only one in the divine essence. Nor is this
          proved by Jn. 17:3 because the exclusive particle monon (“only”) does
          not limit the subject “thee,” but the predicate “true God.” It is
          opposed not to the Son or the Holy Spirit, but to creatures and false
          gods in this sense, that “they might know thee, who art the only true
          God” (which the structure evidently teaches). For if it referred to
          the subject “thee,” it would have been written without the article
          (monon ton alethinon theon, “thou alone art the true God”); not as it
          is written here (se ton monon, “thee, who art the only true God”)
          where the article placed before the word monon intimates that it
          belongs to the following predicate and not to the antecedent subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. Besides the essence and relation taken separately, there is the
          person consisting of both; not as of composing parts, but as of a
          thing and its mode. The person begets, or is begotten, or proceeds.
          Essence is communicated by generation or spiration. The relation
          begetting is distinguished from the begotten and the proceeding.

          XXVIII. The thought concerning three to be worshipped with equal
          reverence does not distract the mind of the worshipper lest perchance
          he might divide the worship due to the one God among more than one,
          since he ought to be convinced that, on the ground of the unity and
          consubstantiality (homoousia) of the persons, the Son and the Holy
          Spirit are invoked by the same act of invocation which is addressed to
          the Father. He ought always to recollect that expression of Gregory
          Nazianzus, “I cannot think of one without being instantly surrounded
          with the splendor of three; nor can I discern the three without being
          suddenly attracted to one” (ou phthano to hen noésai kai tois trisi
          terilampomai, ou phthano ta tria dielein, kai eis to hen anapheromai,
          On Holy Baptism 41 [NPNEF2, 7:375; PG 36.417]).
