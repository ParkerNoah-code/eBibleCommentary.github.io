          living and true God;<sup>1</sup> whose subsistence is in and of
          Himself,<sup>2</sup> infinite in being and perfection; whose essence
          cannot be comprehended by any but Himself;<sup>3</sup> a most pure
          spirit,<sup>4</sup> invisible, without body, parts, or passions, who
          only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach
          unto;<sup>5</sup> who is immutable,<sup>6</sup> immense,<sup>7</sup>
          eternal,<sup>8</sup> incomprehensible, almighty,<sup>9</sup> every way
          infinite, most holy,<sup>10</sup> most wise, most free, most absolute;
          working all things according to the counsel of His own immutable and
          most righteous will,<sup>11</sup> for His own glory;<sup>12</sup> most
          loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and
          truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of
          them that diligently seek Him,<sup>13</sup> and withal most just and
          terrible in His judgments,<sup>14</sup> hating all sin,<sup>15</sup>
          and who will by no means clear the guilty.<sup>16</sup>

          glory,<sup>18</sup> goodness,<sup>19</sup> blessedness, in and of
          Himself, is alone in and unto Himself all-sufficient, not standing in
          need of any creature which He hath made, nor deriving any glory from
          them,<sup>20</sup> but only manifesting His own glory in, by, unto,
          and upon them; He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through
          whom, and to whom are all things,<sup>21</sup> and He hath most
          sovereign dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or
          upon them, whatsoever Himself pleases;<sup>22</sup> in His sight all
          things are open and manifest,<sup>23</sup> His knowledge is infinite,
          infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to Him
          contingent or uncertain;<sup>24</sup> He is most holy in all His
          counsels, in all His works,<sup>25</sup> and in all His commands; to
          Him is due from angels and men, whatsoever worship,<sup>26</sup>
          service, or obedience, as creatures they owe unto the Creator, and
          whatever He is further pleased to require of them. (<sup>17</sup>John

          there are three subsistences, the Father, the Word or Son, and Holy
          Spirit,<sup>27</sup> of one substance, power, and eternity, each
          having the whole divine essence, yet the essence undivided:<sup
            >28</sup
          >
          the Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is
          eternally begotten of the Father;<sup>29</sup> the Holy Spirit
          proceeding from the Father and the Son;<sup>30</sup> all infinite,
          without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in
          nature and being, but distinguished by several peculiar relative
          properties and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is
          the foundation of all our communion with God, and comfortable
          dependence on Him. (<sup>27</sup>1 John 5:7; Matthew 28:19; 2
