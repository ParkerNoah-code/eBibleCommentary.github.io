          TWENTY-EIGHTH QUESTION: THE DEITY OF THE SON<br />
          <em
            >Is the Son true and eternal God, coessential and coeternal with the
            Father? We affirm against Socinus</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. That the divine majesty and glory of the Son of God, our Redeemer,
          may be established against those most pestilent heretics (who with
          execrable impiety oppose it), the state of the question must be
          properly laid down so that the things irrelevant (exagonia) and
          uncontroverted may be separated from the controverted. Thus also the
          genuine opinion of those who are wont often to conceal it under
          ambiguous words (in order to impose upon the more simple) may be
          ascertained.
        </p>
        <p>Statement of the question.</p>
        <p>
          II. The question is not whether the Son is a divine person and whether
          he may be called God (for the adversaries profess to believe this).
          Hence Smalcius wrote a treatise De Divinitate Jesu Christi (1608) and
          De Christo vero et Naturali Dei Filio (1616). He also says, “We do not
          deny that the son is a person and divine” (Refutatio Thesium D.
          Wolfgangi Franitzii, Disp. I [1614], p. 5). And Socinus: “We say that
          we acknowledge Christ to be the natural son of God” (“Responsio ad
          libellum Jacobi Wuieki Jesuitae,” chap. 5 in Opera Omnia [1656],
          2:569). Thus they often ascribe to Christ such things as seem to prove
          his true divinity. Still if we search more deeply into their sense, it
          will readily appear that they are only words and expressions devised
          to raise a smoke, so that they may seem to agree with us in this
          primary head of the Christian religion (although in reality they
          differ from us most widely). For whatever they predicate of Christ, it
          is certain that they do not rise beyond his human nature. They ascribe
          to him only a precarious and dependent divinity (with respect to his
          miraculous conception and divinity or with respect to the office
          imposed upon him). But they have no reference to his consubstantiality
          (homoousian) with the Father which is the real hinge of the question.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. In order then to clear away all this smoke, the question ought not
          to be conceived—whether the Son is God; but—whether he is true and
          eternal God, coessential with the Father. The question is not whether
          he can be called the natural son of God in such a sense as to leave
          his divinity precarious and dependent upon him by reason of
          preeminence, authority, dominion and office. Rather the question is
          whether he is the proper Son who received from the Father by ineffable
          generation the same numerical essence with the Father, not in time,
          but from eternity. The Socinians (with the ancient Arians) deny this
          (Ostorodt, Unterrichtung ... hauptpuncten der Christlichen Religion 6,
          7 [1612], pp. 38-56; Volkelius, De vera Religione 5.10 [1630], pp.
          420-56); but we affirm it.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The Remonstrants evidently lean towards the Socinians. For
          although they may wish to appear to differ from them by asserting the
          generation of the Son, yet in explaining it they sufficiently betray
          their agreement denying the consubstantiality (homoousian) of the Son
          with the Father and maintaining that the Son (not only in order, but
          also in dignity and power) differs from the Father and is not
          coordinate and consubstantial with him, but only subordinate (as
          Episcopius has it, “Institutiones theologica,” 4.32 and 4.35 in Opera
          Theologica [1678], pp. 332-34, 340-44).
        </p>
        <p>The deity of the Son may be proved: (1) from the names of God.</p>
        <p>
          V. That the Son is true God, both consubstantial (homoousion) and
          eternal with the Father, these four things ascribed to him (and
          belonging to God alone) invincibly prove: (1) the names of God; (2)
          the attributes of God; (3) the works of God; (4) the worship due to
          God. First, the names; frequently, both in the Old and in the New
          Testament, he is called God (“God, thy God, hath anointed thee,” Ps.
          45:7*) which is proved to be applicable to Christ from Heb. 1:8, 9
          where God the Father is distinguished from God the Son, not
          essentially (ousiddos), but hypostatically (hypostatikos). He is
          called “his God,” not by reason of nature, but by reason of office and
          economy. In Is. 9:6, the child and the Son given to us is called “the
          mighty God.” The thing itself exclaims that this title (with the
          others accompanying it) is not a description of God calling and
          imposing the name (as the Rabbis contend), but of the Messiah called
          in order to designate his majesty and glory. In Jer. 23:5, 6, the
          Branch of David is said to be called “Jehovah our Righteousness.” That
          this must be understood of the Messiah is proved by the connection,
          the appellation of “Branch” and “King,” and the enumeration of his
          benefits. A similar passage occurs in Jer. 33:16. The passage in Is.
          7:14 belongs here; the son whom the virgin shall conceive and bear
          shall be called “Immanuel”; not only because through and in him the
          supreme God is truly with us, i.e., favors and assists us (as Socinus
          holds, for thus it would not be a name of the Messiah and yet that it
          is may be gathered from Is. 8:8; but rather an undetermined
          enunciation [which is foreign to the mind of the Holy Spirit]). He is
          the God who is with us (as Mt. 1:23* interprets it, “God with us”
          [meth’ héemon ho Theos]). In Mal. 3:1, he is called “the Lord” who
          shall come to his temple (which the evangelists indicate is to be
          spoken of the Messiah, Mk. 1:2; Lk. 1:76). Now who is the Lord to whom
          the temple belongs by way of eminence (kat’ exochén), but God? Hence
          the day of his coming is called the great and dreadful day of Jehovah
          (Mal. 4:5).
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. This may be still further confirmed by a comparison of the various
          passages of the Old and New Testaments in which what is said in the
          Old of Jehovah, the God of Israel, the Creator of heaven and earth, is
          applied in the New to Christ, the Son of God (cf. Num. 14:22; 21:5, 6
          and Ps. 95:9 with 1 Cor. 10:9; Ps. 102:26 with Heb. 1:10, 11; Is. 6:9,
          10 with Jn. 12:40, 41; Is. 45:23 with Rom. 14:11; Joel 2:32 with Rom.
          10:13; Ps. 68:18 with Eph. 4:8, 9).
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. In the New Testament, he is still more clearly called God. “The
          Word was God” (Jn. 1:1), which cannot be understood of a secondary and
          factitious God by reason of office (as the adversaries wish), but of
          the true God by reason of nature. He does not say egeneto (as in v. 14
          when speaking of the incarnation, which he had before noticed); but én
          (“he was”) to designate his eternal existence. Again, he must be God
          in the same manner as he must be in the beginning before the creation
          of all things (v. 1), as its author (v. 3). This applies to no one but
          the supreme God. Third, it is not credible that John in the very first
          words of his history would have been willing to use the name of God
          improperly and ambiguously without adding any explanation and thus be
          the means of drawing believers readily into a most dangerous error—to
          believe this Word to be true God, while yet he is not. Now although
          his Word may be said to have been with God (personally considered,
          i.e., the Father, in which sense he could not be the Same person with
          whom he is said to be), this does not militate against his being God,
          essentially the same with the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. He is called “the true God, and eternal life” (1 Jn. 5:20),
          which words must not be referred to the Father, but to Christ (as is
          evident both from the pronoun houtos, which refers to Christ the
          antecedent immediately preceding, and from the scope of the apostle,
          which is to teach that Christ is come to lead us to the knowledge of
          and communion with the true God). We therefore are in that true God
          because we are in his Son Jesus Christ, since Jesus Christ himself is
          also “the true God and eternal life.” A confirmation arises from the
          fact that the expression “eternal life” is never applied by John to
          the Father, but repeatedly to the Son (Jn. 1:4; 11:25; 1 Jn. 1:2;
          5:11, 12).
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. He is called “God blessed for ever” (Rom 9:5). This cannot be
          referred by a doxological (doxologikén) apostrophe to the Father
          because neither the thing demands, nor will the series of words admit
          it. The article with the participle (ho On) is relative; not beginning
          a new sentence, but continuing one already begun. Nor can it be
          referred to the Father, but to Christ, the immediately preceding
          antecedent. Then, the limitation kata sarka (which is opposed to the
          blessed God) shows that the two natures in Christ are designated: the
          human (according to which he descended from the fathers) and the
          divine (according to which he is God, blessed for ever). He is called
          “the great God” (Tit. 2:13)—certainly not the Father, but the Son
          because only one article is prefixed to the words God and Savior
          (which would not be the case if they were two persons). Epiphaneia is
          never attributed to the Father, but always to Christ. He, whose advent
          we look for, is said to have given himself for us (Tit. 2:14), which
          applies to Christ alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. The exclamation of Thomas to which he gives utterance after seeing
          and touching Christ (“My Lord and my God” [ho Kyrios mou, kai ho Theos
          mou, Jn. 20:28]) necessarily refers to Christ; nor can it without
          violence be wrested from this application because it is preceded by
          the words “he said unto him” (eipen auto, viz., to Christ) to approve
          his faith by this notable confession as if he would say, “Thou art
          truly he, my Lord and my God.” Hence we find the prepositive article
          (ho) and not the mark of admiration (0). So he is said to be “God
          manifested in the flesh” (1 Tim. 3:16) and “God, who purchased the
          church with his own blood” (Acts 20:28) which can be said of no other
          than the Son, who assumed our flesh and by his blood acquired eternal
          redemption for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Nor must we omit the celebrated passage Phil. 2:6 where “the form
          of God” is ascribed to Christ—“who, being in the form of God, thought
          it not robbery to be equal with God.” Hence various arguments are
          drawn: (1) because Christ is said to be in “the form of God” (which
          could not apply to him if he were not God by nature). For as the form
          of a servant opposed to it necessarily denotes the human nature in a
          servile condition, so the form of God fitly designates the divine
          essence shining (coruscantem) with glory and majesty. (2) Because he
          is said to be “equal with God” both as to nature (because the same
          with the Father) and as to person (because he is his most perfect
          image) and as to state (because he enjoyed the same glory from
          eternity). (3) Because he was in the form of God before he was in the
          form of a servant, i.e., before he was born and was made a man, which
          the word hyparchein indicates. In vain does Socinus wish “the form of
          God” to be referred to the glory and “the power of miracles” which
          Christ laid aside in his passion. For then others possessed of the
          gift of miracles might be said to be in the form of God (which not
          only is not said, but cannot be said). The antithesis of the form of a
          servant does not prove that the form of God is only some external
          appearance and quality. Indeed it evinces the contrary; for as a
          similar condition could not be except in the human nature, so the form
          of God can be only in the essence of God. Nor does this emptying,
          ascribed to Christ, consist in the absolute deposition of the divine
          form, but only in the concealing (occultatione) of it under the veil
          of the flesh in this state of humility. Although isos sometimes means
          only similar, not equal, it cannot be taken in that sense here. For
          such an isotés is meant as arises from the possession of the form of
          God (which imports not only a certain similitude, but a true equality
          and identity).
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Although the name of God can improperly, restrictedly and in the
          plural be attributed to creatures (as to angels and magistrates who
          are sometimes called “gods”), yet never is it properly, absolutely and
          in the singular given to anyone but the true God. Hence the Son of
          God, to whom it is thus given, must be true and eternal God.
        </p>
        <p>2. From the attributes: eternity.</p>
        <p>
          XIII. The same deity is proved by the divine attributes, which being
          proper to God alone to the exclusion of creatures, he cannot but be
          God of whom they are predicated. Such is eternity, which is often
          attributed to him; as when it is said, “The Lord possessed me [Wisdom]
          in the beginning of his way ... I was set up from everlasting, from
          the beginning, or ever the earth was” (Prov. 8:22, 23*). We will prove
          hereafter that this Wisdom is a person. It is also said in Mic. 5:2
          that “his goings forth have been from the days of eternity.” Here a
          twofold going forth is mentioned: the one future in time at Bethlehem,
          from the fathers as to his human nature—“out of thee shall he come
          forth unto me that is to be ruler”; the other past (or better,
          eternal) by generation from the Father according to the divine nature
          —‘“whose goings forth have been from of old, from the days of
          eternity.” Thus no one might suppose he began to exist just when he
          was born. He is called “the first, and the last, who is, who was, and
          who is to come” (Rev. 1:11* and 4*); “the Father of eternity” (Is.
          9:6); having neither beginning of days, nor end of life (Heb. 7:3).
          For these are such things as cannot fall on a finite and temporal
          duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. Here pertains the passage where the Word is said to have been “in
          the beginning” (Jn. 1:1); not, certainly, in the beginning of the
          gospel or of the new creation (as the adversaries maintain), but in
          the beginning of time. For no other beginning can be meant here than
          that of which Moses speaks (Gen. 1:1)—to which John manifestly alludes
          (as the scope demonstrates, which is to describe the person of Christ
          partly from this, that he was before his incarnation—thence from the
          beginning—partly from this, that he was made through the incarnation,
          where he uses the word egeneto and not én). Then again the thing
          itself evinces this. For who can think it probable that John meant
          only this, that the Word (i.e., Christ the orator of the Father) was
          just in the beginning of the gospel (i.e., when he began to preach the
          gospel)? So absurd a sense is unbecoming the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. “Before Abraham was, I am” (Jn. 8:58), which the adversaries
          falsely apply to predestination, so that he may be said to have been
          before Abraham by reason of predestination. But he was not treating of
          the predestination of Christ, but of his real existence, since indeed
          the question was whether Christ could say that Abraham had seen his
          day (which the Jews of that time denied concerning Christ and Christ
          affirmed, drawing his argument from the fact that he already existed
          before Abraham was). Much less can that other unblushing corruption of
          Socinus be admitted, who interprets these words thus: “Before Abraham
          has become” (to wit, the father of many nations) “I exist.” But it
          does not treat here of the time in which the nations were to be
          called, but of that in which Abraham lived (which they thought Christ,
          who was less than fifty years old, could not have preceded; not
          concerning the future, but the past). In the same sense Christ is said
          to have had glory with the Father before the world was (Jn. 17:5); not
          only because it was predestinated to him by the Father, but also
          because he actually possessed it from eternity (which he could not
          have done unless he had then existed). Grace, indeed, can be said to
          have been given to us by God through predestination before we were (2
          Tim. 1:9), but no one can be said actually to have glory, save he who
          actually exists.
        </p>
        <p>Immensity.</p>
        <p>
          XVI. His deity is proved by immensity and omnipresence since he is
          said to be in the midst of his people wherever they may be gathered
          together (Mt. 18:20): “Lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of
          the world” (Mt. 28:20). Also “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but
          he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven”
          (Jn. 3:13)—where Christ speaking on the earth says that he is in
          heaven. Now no one can be both in heaven and on earth at the same
          time, but he who fills heaven and earth. Nor can Socinus be listened
          to who changes the present into the past so as to make it mean the Son
          of man descended from heaven and was in heaven. This contradicts the
          words of Christ, ho 6n en to ourano (“the one which is in heaven”),
          which the thing itself declares to refer to his present existence in
          heaven even after he had descended from it and not to the past.
          Therefore he is said to have descended from heaven by incarnation, who
          always was in heaven by immensity.
        </p>
        <p>Omnipotence.</p>
        <p>
          XVII. Omnipotence is ascribed to him in Rev. 1:8 and 11:17 where he is
          called the Almighty (pantokrator). In Jn. 5:17 he is said to do all
          things which the Father does; and in Heb. 1:3, to uphold all things by
          the word of his power. Nor, if the Son can do nothing of himself by
          reason of order and origin, does it immediately follow that his power
          is limited and dependent. For a diversity of order does not make a
          diversity of essence and virtue. In Mt. 28:18, all power is said to be
          given him, which necessarily supposes omnipotence; for he could not
          have all power in heaven and earth as Mediator, unless he has
          omnipotence as God.
        </p>
        <p>Omniscience.</p>
        <p>
          XVIII. Omniscience is predicated of him: “Lord, thou knowest all
          things” (Jn. 21:17); “Now are we sure that thou knowest all things”
          (Jn. 16:30). He is called the searcher of hearts (kardiognostés, Rev.
          2:23); knows the very thoughts of the heart (Lk. 6:8; Jn. 2:24, 25).
          Nor can it be said that Christ has this by revelation because God
          keeps this to himself alone (1 K. 8:39). Christ is said to be ignorant
          of the day of judgment (Mk. 13:32), not as the Son of God, but as the
          Son of man (such as he seemed to his interrogators). And if the Father
          alone is said to know this, it does not exclude the knowledge of the
          Son and of the Spirit (who searches the deep things of God) no more
          than the Father can be said to be ignorant of himself, when it is
          said, “No one can know the Father, save the Son” (Mt. 11:27). The word
          “only” therefore does not absolutely exclude all, but those in a
          particular genus for whom it was better that they should not know it
          (viz., men) so that they might always be prepared and watchful; lest
          that day should surprise them sleeping and unprepared.

        <p>Immutability.</p>
        <p>
          XIX. Immutability: “the heavens shall perish; but thou remainest; thou
          art the same, and thy years shall not fail” (Heb. 1:11, 12). These
          words apply to the true God alone, as is evident from Ps. 102:26, 27
          (from which the apostle quotes). So in Heb. 13:8, he is said to be
          “the same yesterday, today, and forever,” with regard not only to
          doctrine and operations, but also to essence and person (because
          effects suppose their cause).
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. Finally, the “fulness of the Godhead” is said to dwell in him
          (i.e., the essence with the attributes, Col. 2:9), and the life of God
          is attributed to him (Jn. 5:26). Nor if it is said to have been given
          him by the Father is his dignity therefore lessened, because this
          marks only order, not inferiority (since he received the same
          numerically with the Father, not from grace, but from nature; not in
          time, but from eternity).
        </p>
        <p>3. From the divine works.</p>
        <p>
          XXI. Third, the same thing may be proved from the divine works
          ascribed to him: as creation, which God ascribed to himself alone (Is.
          40:12; 44:24) and which demands infinite virtue. “When he prepared the
          heavens, I was there” (Prov. 8:27ff.)—-where eternal Wisdom is
          speaking. “All things were made by him, and without him was not
          anything made that was made” (Jn. 1:3). “He made the worlds” (Heb.
          1:2). “Thou, Lord, hast laid the foundation of the earth” (Heb. 1:10).
          “By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in
          earth, visible and invisible, thrones” (Col. 1:16, 17). (2) The
          creation, conservation and government of the universe; because “he
          upholds all things by the word of his power” (Heb. 1:3); “By him all
          things consist” (Col. 1:17); “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work”
          (Jn. 5:17). (3) The working of miracles which he performed either
          himself per se or by the instrumentality of the apostles (as appears
          everywhere in the gospels); and especially the resurrection of the
          dead (Jn. 5:21; 6:40) which prove Christ’s absolute dominion over
          creatures. Hence he appeals to these works as unanswerable proofs of
          his divinity (Jn. 5:36 and elsewhere).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. The second creation cannot be meant in Jn. 1:3, as Socinus
          cavils. (1) John speaks absolutely and without any restriction which
          he is wont to use whenever he treats of the new creation. (2) He
          treats of the universal creation in which all things were made by him
          and without whom nothing was made. (3) He mentions the creation of the
          world which knew not Christ (Jn. 1:10); thus not so much of the
          church. (4) Paul extends that creation absolutely to all creatures,
          visible and invisible, and even to angels, and distinguishes the first
          creation from the second (concerning which he treats only in Col.
          1:16—18*). And if all things are said to have been created by the Son,
          this does not imply an instrumental cause (which cannot be in
          creation), but the principal efficient cause (just as all things are
          said to be by God [Rom. 11:36]; and the particle dia is often so taken
          [Gal. 1:1]). And not only “by him” (di’ autou), as the principle, were
          all things created, but “for him” (eis auton), as the end (Col. 1:16),
          which does not belong to an instrument. Indeed all things are said to
          have been made “in him” (en auto), just as we are said to live, move,
          and have our being in him (en auto) (viz., God—Acts 17:28). And if
          creation is ascribed to the Father appropriatively, is it therefore
          denied to the Son (as the Father is not excluded from the work of
          redemption, although it is ascribed peculiarly to the Son)?
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. The power of working miracles was not adventitious and
          ministerial to him (like that of the apostles and prophets), but
          proper and innate because it is said to have flowed from him (Lk.
          6:19; 8:46). (2) The apostles deny that they wrought miracles by their
          own power, but in the name of Christ (Acts 4:7, 10, i.e., by his power
          and authority). They sought that power from Christ (Acts 9:34). If
          Christ sometimes used prayers in the working of miracles (as Jn.
          11:41), it does not follow that he had no power of his own to perform
          them. For he did this not from a defect of potency, but partly
          according to the voluntary economy by which he submitted himself to
          the Father in his mediatoral office and referred all things to him;
          and partly to accommodate himself to those in whose presence he
          wrought the miracles—to teach them that all things are to be obtained
          by prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. The works of grace and of redemption are also ascribed to
          Christ: such as election (Jn. 13:18); redemption (Acts 20:28); calling
          (Jn. 10:16; Mt. 9:13); sanctification (Eph. 5:26); the mission of the
          Holy Spirit (Jn. 16:7, 14; 15:26); defense against all attacks of
          enemies and the bestowal of eternal life (Jn. 10:10, 28); the
          vivification and resurrection of the dead (Jn. 5:21); and the raising
          of himself, which is adduced as an invincible proof of his divinity
          (Jn. 2:19; 10:18; Rom. 1:4); the universal judgment (Jn. 5:22; Acts
          17:31). For all these belong to the true God alone. Nor ought it to be
          said that these things are ascribed to Christ as the instrumental
          cause by which the Father works. Most of these works require that they
          be done immediately by God without the intervention of any instrument.
          Although Christ may act here as Mediator (who by reason of economy is
          inferior to the Father), he does not cease to be equal to him as to
          power and essence and performs these things as Lord. Speaking of the
          constitution of the church (Heb. 3:3, 4), the apostle says that Christ
          built that house and so proves beyond contradiction that he was
          counted worthy of far more honor than Moses, who was only a faithful
          servant in it. He immediately adds: “for every house is builded by
          someone; but he that built all things is God” (to wit, intimating most
          clearly that Christ, who built the church, is God). Thus he is called
          by way of eminence (kat’ exochén) the Lord and Husband of the church
          (Eph. 4:5; 5:25), which Is. 54:5 teaches pertains to God alone, the
          Holy One of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>4, From worship.</p>
        <p>
          XXV. Fourth, the religious worship due to God alone (on account of his
          infinite power, glory and majesty) is given to him. Faith—‘“Ye believe
          in God, believe also in me” (Jn. 14:1); hope—“Blessed are all they
          that put their trust in him” (Ps. 2:12); and “cursed be the man that
          trusteth in man” (Jer. 17:5); adoration—‘“Let all the angels worship
          him” (Heb. 1:6); “Kiss the Son” (Ps. 2:12); “The Father hath committed
          all judgment unto the Son; that all men should honor the Son, even as
          they honor the Father” (Jn. 5:22, 23*); “There is given him a name
          which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should
          bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord, to the glory of the
          Father” (Phil. 2:9-11*). His deity is proved from invocation, because
          grace and peace and other spiritual blessings (which can be expected
          from God alone) are sought from Christ no less than from the Father in
          the epistles of Paul. Believers are described as “callers upon the
          name of Jesus Christ our Lord” (Acts 7:59; 9:14; 1 Cor. 1:2). Glory
          and honor—every creature is induced to ascribe glory to the Lamb no
          less than to the Father: “Blessing, and honor, and glory and power, be
          unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and
          ever” (Rev. 5:13). XXVI. In vain is it objected here: (1) that faith
          can be terminated on a creature also because the Israelites are said
          to have “believed God and Moses” (Ex. 14:31); this does not refer to
          the person of Moses, but to his doctrine; (2) that Christ is the
          secondary and not the primary object of faith for a subordination is
          not admissible in the object of faith, nor can faith and religious
          worship be divided between the Creator and creatures anymore than
          divinity—“That is my name: and my glory will I not give to another,
          neither my praise to graven images” (Is. 42:8). Nor ought it to be
          said that the honor of God is not alienated when we worship anyone
          according to his command, for this would be done for the sake of God
          alone and the honor would be terminated on God himself. For the
          supposition is always false that such honor can be lawfully exhibited
          to a creature, since faith and adoration demand an object infinite,
          omniscient, omnipotent and possessed of eternal glory (which can fall
          on no creature, even the most perfect). XXVII. But although Christ
          must be adored as Mediator, it does not follow that his divinity
          cannot be satisfactorily inferred from his adoration. For the Mediator
          in his very conception indicates a divine person which the economical
          minority does not destroy. He is not to be adored directly as man
          reduplicatively, i.e., with respect to the human nature (which is not
          an adorable object of itself, but specifically he who is man may be
          adored), but with respect to the divine nature. Thus three things are
          with propriety to be distinguished here: the object of adoration,
          which is the person of Christ; the foundation, which is the divine
          nature; and the adjunct, without which the adoration is not made
          (viz., the human nature).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVIII. To these four classes of arguments we can add others also. (1)
          From the equality of the Son with the Father (Jn. 5:17, 18), since
          Christ says that he continually worked with the Father. The Jews
          interpreted equality of essence and power and therefore endeavored to
          kill him as a blasphemer because he said that God was his Father,
          making himself equal with God. This inference Christ was so far from
          reproving and denying that, on the contrary, he confirmed it still
          further by various arguments both from the equality of life and of
          living essence—‘“as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given
          to the Son to have life in himself” (Jn. 5:26). From equality of
          operation—“for what things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth
          the Son in like manner (homoids)” (Jn. 5:19); and from the equality of
          honor and worship due to God alone—“that all men should honor the Son,
          even as they honor the Father” (Jn. 5:23). These imply absolute
          equality, and not only limited with respect to operation (as the
          adversaries maintain), but on this account the more—that equality of
          operation with God presupposes necessarily equality of essential power
          and therefore of essence itself. Nor is it an objection that it is
          said “he can do nothing of himself” (Jn. 5:19), for this denotes, it
          is true, the order of operating (which follows the order of
          subsisting), but does not prove the inequality of essence or power.
          Otherwise it would not be said that he operates in like manner
          (homoi0s).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIX. (2) From his unity with the Father—“I and my Father are one”
          (Jn. 10:30). To refer this only to unity of consent and not of essence
          is to do violence to the words of Christ: (a) because Christ reasons
          from the unity of power to the unity of essence (Jn. 10:28, 29), which
          two do not differ in God; (b) because the Jews wished to stone Christ,
          not on account of the unity of will, but on account of the unity of
          essence with God (which in their opinion he blasphemously ascribed to
          himself)—“For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and
          because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God” (Jn. 10:33). (c)
          Christ does not recall and correct what he had said, but defends and
          confirms it in the following verses by an argument drawn from
          magistrates, who are called gods in Scripture. Hence he deduces not
          only from comparison, but even from the lesser to the greater (a
          minori ad majus); if political magistrates are called gods on account
          of some temporal office entrusted to them, how much more can I (whom
          the Father sanctified and sent into the world clothed with the office
          of Mediator, demanding divine virtue, and who do the works of the
          Father, so that the Father is in me and I in the Father, which can be
          said of no creature) lawfully call myself God and the Son of God? His
          sanctification and mission into the world is brought forward by
          Christ, not as the antecedent cause of filiation and a priori (as if
          on that account only he was to be called Son), but as an argument and
          sign a prosteriori whence it might be inferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXX. (3) From the mediatorial office of Christ. A mediator ought to be
          a Prophet to illuminate the mind (not only externally, but also
          internally) and incline the heart; a King to defend the church against
          the assaults of Satan and the world, and by his Spirit to govern it
          powerfully; a Priest to satisfy the infinite divine justice by the
          infinite merit of his death and obedience and to purchase eternal
          redemption for us. All these could not be done by a mere man, but
          demanded one possessed of infinite essence and power (as will be
          proved in its place). This very thing also can be invincibly deduced
          from the filiation of Christ, as will be demonstrated in the following
          question.
        </p>
        <p>Sources of explanation.</p>
        <p>
          XXXI. Christ was made Lord after the resurrection (Acts 2:36), not in
          essential dominion (which he had even from the foundation of the world
          as the maker of all things [Heb. 1:2] and inasmuch as he is the Word
          [Logos)}), but in personal and economical dominion. This belongs to
          him because he is the God-man (theanthrdpos) (and indeed not simply,
          for long before, David had called him “Lord” [Ps. 110:1]; nor as to
          its authority and foundation, which he had from the beginning, but
          relatively and by reason of the full manifestation and inauguration).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXII. He who is constituted heir by a gift of grace (not by propriety
          of nature) is not true God. But the Son is not so called heir because
          he is the proper Son of God; not the Son because heir, but heir
          because the Son. Again he is called heir by reason of the dominion he
          obtains over all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXII. He who is distinguished from God considered essentially
          (ousiddos), is not God; but Christ is distinguished from God
          considered only hypostatically (hypostatikos) inasmuch as the name of
          God is by appropriation given to the Father, not to the exclusion of
          the Son and the Holy Spirit, but economically. For Christ holds the
          office of Mediator and the Holy Spirit that of Comforter, while the
          Father as the first person sustains the majesty of the deity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXIV. He who is set forth as a mere man, cannot be God; but not he
          who is set forth as a true man because he can be both—man and God. The
          passages which predicate humanity of Christ assert its truth, but do
          not deny his divinity. When Christ is denominated from the humanity,
          divinity is not therefore excluded (as when the divinity is asserted,
          the humanity is not excluded because the denominations attributed to
          the person can be drawn from either nature).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXvV. A thing can be received either in time, or from eternity, or
          from grace, or from nature. The former method of receiving truly
          argues inferiority and inequality of nature and cannot fall on the
          true God; but the latter can belong to the divine persons without any
          inequality because the order of subsisting of the persons does not
          take away the equality of essence. So the Son can be said to have
          received all things from the Father either as the Word (Logos) (by a
          communication of the same essence from eternity) or as God-man
          (theanthropos) and Mediator in time by the imposition of office (in
          respect to which he confesses that he is less than the Father).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXVI. A principle may be either of communication or of inchoation
          (inchoationis); the Son as a principle of communication (viz., the
          Father), but not of inchoation because the essence was communicated to
          him from eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXVII. Christ is called prototokos, not protoktistos—‘“the firstborn
          of every creature” (Col. 1:15) by reason of dominion (because as all
          things were made by him, so he had authority over all); but not by
          reason of creation (as if he was the first produced among creatures).
          Otherwise it would not be said he was even in the beginning and made
          all things. In this sense, he is called “the beginning of the creation
          of God” (Rev. 3:14); not passive (as if he was the first creature),
          but active because from him all creatures take their origin as Paul
          explains in the place cited.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXVIII. The Father is said to be “one God” (1 Cor. 8:5, 6), not in
          relation to the Son or the Holy Spirit, but to idols. This appears
          from the antithesis “an idol is nothing in the world, and there is
          none other God but one” (1 Cor. 8:4), and 1 Cor. 8:5, 6 which treat of
          those who are called gods in heaven and in earth. (2) As one Lord does
          not exclude the Father from lordship, since he is called the “Lord of
          Lords” (1 Tim. 6:15); therefore neither does one God (the Father)
          exclude from deity the Son who is also said to be true God. The one
          God (the Father) and one Lord Jesus Christ are indeed distinguished
          from each other, but personally and not essentially.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXXIX. When Christ denies that he is good contrasted with God, who
          alone is good (Mt. 19:17), this must not be understood absolutely, but
          relatively to the mind of the young man who looked upon him as a bare
          man (psilon anthropon). It is as if he would say, why do you call me
          good, since you do not esteem me as God, and no one is truly and
          perfectly good except God?
        </p>
        <p>The Son is properly called Autotheos.</p>
        <p>
          XL. Although the Son is from the Father, nevertheless he may be called
          God-of-himself (autotheos), not with respect to his person, but
          essence; not relatively as Son (for thus he is from the Father), but
          absolutely as God inasmuch as he has the divine essence existing from
          itself and not divided or produced from another essence (but not as
          having that essence from himself). So the Son is God from himself
          although not the Son from himself. Hence it is evident how unjustly
          Genebrardus and other papists charged Calvin with heresy here. For in
          order to confute the heresy of Valentinus Gentilis (who attributed
          divine essence to the Father alone [whom therefore he called the
          primary God and autotheon] and said the Son and the Holy Spirit
          received their essence from the Father), he said that the Son no less
          than the Father is autotheon, but with respect to essence alone (which
          is no less self-essence [autousia] in the Son than in the Father), but
          not with respect to the person (which Bellarmine approves, “De
          Christo,” 2.19 in Opera [1856], 1:217-19).

          XLI. That Christ is said to have been born of a virgin, suffered and
          died, not to be everywhere present and to be less than the Father,
          shows indeed that he was a true man like to us in all things, but does
          not deny him to be God. Yea, he is so set forth as born from a virgin
          in time as to be begotten from God from eternity (Prov. 8:22). He is
          so less than the Father by reason of voluntary depression
          (exinanitionis) and assumed flesh as nevertheless to be equal to him
          with respect to eternal deity communicated to him from eternity (Jn.
          5:18). He was so mortified in the flesh as to be quickened by the
          Spirit (1 Pet. 3:18).
