          TWENTY-FOURTH QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Is the mystery of the Trinity a fundamental article of faith? We
            affirm against the Socinians and Remonstrants</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          I. Before discussing the truth of the mystery of the Trinity, we must
          premise some things concerning its necessity, not only against the
          Socinians (who directly deny it to be an article of faith), but also
          on account of the Remonstrants (who, although seeming to profess their
          belief of it, still deny it a place among the fundamental articles, so
          that the ignorance of it does not bring salvation into peril; as they
          not obscurely testify to this in “Apologia pro confessione sive
          declaratione ... Remonstrantes,” 3 in Episcopius, Operum theologicorum
          [1665], Pt. II, pp. 132—36; “Responsio Remonstratium ... per quatuor
          Professores Leydenses,” ibid., Pt. II p. 294); and Episcopius,
          “Institutiones theologicae,” 4.34 in Opera theologica [1678], pp.
          338-40). Thus they who would secretly subvert the truth of Christian
          doctrines oftentimes begin by agitating the question concerning their
          importance and necessity so that men, lulled into the sleep of
          security, may the more easily suffer themselves to be robbed of the
          truth and refuse to contend for the faith once delivered to the
          saints.
        </p>
        <p><b>Statement of the question.</b></p>
        <p>
          II. On the state of the question observe: (1) that the discussion
          concerns not only the negation, but the simple ignorance of this
          article. For certain things revealed in the word are of such a nature
          that without peril of salvation they can be unknown (although they
          cannot be denied without that peril). However not only the denial, but
          also the simple ignorance of the Trinity is damnable.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The question is not whether there ought to be an equal degree of
          this knowledge in all. For we confess it can be various and manifold:
          in some greater and fuller; in others less and more obscure (for
          example, in the Old Testament believers in comparison with those of
          the New; in ignorant and simple persons compared with the teachers).
          Rather the question is whether some knowledge of it at least is
          necessary to all in regard to state, persons and time in which they
          live.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. The question does not concern the full and perfect comprehension
          of this mystery; nor does it concern an intuitive knowlege of it. The
          former belongs to the glorified saints alone; the latter belongs to
          the Trinity alone; in which sense Cyprian says, “The Trinity is known
          to itself alone” (cf. “De Baptismo Christi” [attributed to Cyprian] in
          “Arnold Carnotensis, Opera,” p. 32 in Cyprian, Opera [ed. John
          Oxoniensem, 1682]). Rather the question is only whether the knowledge
          and confession of the three divine persons is required for the
          catholic faith and necessary to all who would be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The question is not whether the knowledge of the Trinity is
          necessary absolutely as to the constructive (kataskeuén) and
          destructive (anaskeuéen) reasoning bearing upon it (either as to all
          the proofs by which theologians confirm it or as to the refutation of
          the sophisms by which heretics attack it). Rather the question
          concerns the positive and simple knowlege and confession of the
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. Thus the question comes to this: whether the mystery of the
          Trinity is a fundamental article, necessary to the faith of all
          believers, so that not only the denial, but even the ignorance of it
          cannot consist with salvation. This the adversaries deny; we affirm
          (influenced principally by the following arguments).
        </p>
        <p><b>The doctrine of the Trinity is a fundamental article.</b></p>
        <p>
          VII. First, eternal life is placed in the knowledge of it. “This is
          life eternal,” says Christ, “that they might know thee the only true
          God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent” (Jn. 17:3). And in answer
          to the objection that Christ is here spoken of not as God, but as the
          Mediator sent by God, parallel passages can be adduced where Scripture
          speaks of him as of the true God, the primary object of faith: “This
          is the true God and eternal life” (1 Jn. 5:20); “Ye believe in God,
          believe also in me” (Jn. 14:1). Furthermore Christ could not be a
          Mediator without being truly God; now he is distinguished here not
          from God, but from the Father by whom he was sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. Second, it contains the primary object of faith and worship, the
          confession of which our baptism necessarily includes (Mt. 28:19). For
          it is not sufficient to know that God is (quod sit) as to existence or
          what he is (quid sit) as to his attributes; but we must know also who
          he is (quis sit) (as to the persons as he presents himself to be known
          by us in his word). Hence “whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath
          not the Father” (1 Jn. 2:23); and “he that honoreth not the Son,
          honoreth not the Father which hath sent him” (Jn. 5:23). Therefore,
          God has revealed himself as one in essence, three in persons (viz.,
          the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit). Thus he who does not
          acknowledge and believe the Trinity has not the true God, but has
          erected for himself an idol in place of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Third, various fundamental doctrines depend upon this article:
          such as the doctrines concerning the sending of the Son, his advent in
          the flesh, his satisfaction, the mission of the Holy Spirit and his
          divine works and the like. Without it, the principal causes of
          salvation would be unknown (i.e., the grace of the Father, the merit
          of the Son and the sanctification of the Holy Spirit). These cannot be
          ascribed to a created being without blasphemy. Therefore since it is
          necessary to salvation that we should distinctly know God (from whom
          all saving benefits flow to us), so the doctrine of the Trinity
          deserves to be reckoned among the principal articles of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          X. Fourth, it is the stay of the whole Christian religion and of our
          salvation. By it, we are distinguished from the Jews of this day,
          Mohammedans and the heathen. Fifth, it was the uniform faith of the
          ancients, as may readily be gathered from the symbols, councils,
          fathers, imperial rescripts and confessions of the churches. Hence
          that of the Athanasian Symbol: “He who wishes to be saved, must before
          all things hold to the catholic faith, which if anyone does not
          preserve entire and inviolate, he will undoubtedly perish forever; now
          the catholic faith is this, that we reverence one God in Trinity, and
          Trinity in unity” (Schaff, 2:66).
        </p>
        <p><b>Sources of explanation.</b></p>
        <p>
          XI. Although the mystery of the Trinity was more obscure under the Old
          than under the New Testament, it does not follow that it was then
          altogether unknown. For otherwise, they could neither have known the
          true God nor have been able to believe in the Messiah. Therefore we
          must distinguish knowledge from its degrees. The same knowledge was
          given as to substance (as will hereafter be proved), but it varied in
          degree. Now the degree does not change the species.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. The Trinity is contained in the Symbol (Apostles’ Creed) if not
          in the signified act, at least in the exercised inasmuch as we seal
          our faith in the three persons. Nor is the faith by which I believe in
          God the Father different from that by which I believe in the Son and
          the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. It is one thing to believe the fact (to hoti) of the Trinity;
          another to know the wherefore (to dioti) and the how (to pds). We do
          not say it is a fundamental article in the latter sense because not
          even the angels themselves comprehend this, much less the most
          sagacious men; but we say this only in the former sense. In this
          latter manner, the ignorant and the simple are bound both to believe
          and to profess the doctrine of the Trinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. A belief in the Trinity cannot but be required from the baptized
          when they are sprinkled in the name of the Father, the Son and the
          Holy Ghost. Yea, the confession of faith required from them and
          contained in the Apostles’ Creed did not (from the beginning) extend
          beyond the doctrine of the Trinity. Hence the most ancient expositions
          of the Creed (extant in Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Justin) extends
          no further; yea, Socrates, Sozomen and Nicephorus teach that the
          Nicene Creed also was contained within these heads. Baptism
          administered in the name of Christ does not exclude, but includes a
          belief in the Trinity because Christ cannot be acknowledged without
          the Father and the Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. For any article to be fundamental, it is not necessary that it
          should always exist literally in Scripture, as to all the words by
          which it is usually set forth. It suffices if it is contained there as
          to the thing (and equivalently) and may be thence deduced by evident
          and necessary consequence. Thus although the word “Trinity” does not
          occur in Scripture in the abstract, it suffices that the thing itself
          is found there in the concrete and as to sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. The dissent of scholars (which occurs in the exposition of this
          mystery) ought not to detract in the least from the truth of the thing
          (especially when the dissent is not in reality, but in the manner of
          conceiving or the mode of explaining or the method of defending
          it—which is allowable among theologians, even the Protestant ones). As
          to the Scholastics, we do not hesitate to say that they have miserably
          darkened the whole doctrine by their curious and presumptuous
          questions. But their contentions, we do not make ours; yea, we wish
          the man of God to be far removed from their fooleries and
          logic-choppings (leptologémasi).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. The fundamental topics are called catholic not so much with
          respect to persons as to doctrine. Not that all Christians (whether
          true or only nominal) thus far agree concerning them, but because they
          are retained by all true Christians who profess the catholic faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. The article of the Trinity is not only theoretical, but also
          practical because it contributes to the gratitude and worship of God.
          Thus we devote our faith and service to the Triune God who has
          revealed himself to us. It also contributes to consolation so that we
          may know that Christ has truly redeemed us and that our salvation is
          securely positioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. Episcopius falsely pretends that the Ante-Nicene Fathers held a
          different belief. Yet it can easily be shown from Justin, Athenagoras,
          Ignatius and others that this doctrine was constantly both believed
          and confessed. Also that very confession of faith which Episcopius
          mentions sufficiently attests this; for how could they believe in the
          Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit unless they believed in the
          Trinity? Nor can it be conceived how when so suddenly and unexpectedly
          Arius opposed it, 318 fathers should so unanimously have condemned
          him, unless this opinion had been certain among the ancients. Socinus
          very candidly confesses that on this subject he differs from the
          fathers and councils.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. Indeed the truth of the matter can be clearly gathered from the
          surviving monuments of the first centuries. We give only a few out of
          the many. Pliny, the younger, in his letter to Trajan speaking of the
          Christians, teaches that they worshipped Christ as God. “They
          affirmed,” says he, “that the whole of their fault, or error, lay in
          this, that they were wont to meet together on a stated day before it
          was light and sing among themselves alternately a hymn to Christ, as
          God, and bind themselves by an oath, not to the commission of any
          wickedness, but not to be guilty of theft, or robbery, or adultery,
          never to falsify their word, nor to deny a pledge committed to them,
          when called upon to return it” (Pliny, 10.96* [Loeb, 2:288—89]). By
          these words Pliny testifies that the Christians esteemed the Lord
          Jesus Christ as God and adored him with divine worship and religious
          hymns of praise. Such testimony, drawn from the enemies themselves,
          does not suffer us to doubt the faith of the primitive Christians.
          Tertullian (referring to it) says that Pliny (the second, i.e., the
          younger) writing to Trajan concerning the Christians discovered
          nothing concerning their sacraments besides their meeting together
          before it was light to “sing to Christ as God”—for so we must read;
          not as it is commonly read “to Christ and God” (Apology 2 [FC 10:11;
          PL 1.321]). The words of Pliny clearly show this (and from him
          Eusebius, “Chronicorum liber Posterior,” in Thesaurus Temporum (ed.
          J.J. Scaliger, 1606/1968], p. 165).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. Clement of Rome in his letter to the Corinthians (a genuine work
          of venerable antiquity) speaks of Christ not only as a man, but as one
          whom he does not fear to join with God together with the Holy Spirit.
          “Have we not one God and one Christ, and one Spirit poured out upon
          us?” (ouchi hena theon echomen, kai hena christon, kai hen pneuma
          charitos to ekchythen eph’ hémas, “First Epistle of Clement to the
          Corinthians,” 46 [ANF 1:17; PG 1.303-4]). In the same place, he calls
          him “the sceptre of divine majesty” (ibid., p. 9; PG 1:239) to remove
          him from the humble position of men. Aristides, who lived a little
          after Clement of Rome in the time of Aelius Hadrianus, confirms the
          same thing in his Apology presented to the Emperor Hadrian (cf.
          Apology of Aristides [ANF 11:263]). Eusebius mentions this (in his
          Chronicorum 2 [PG 19.557—58]), and Jerome (in his list of
          ecclesiastical authors, Letter 70, “To Magnus” [NPNF2, 4:50; PL
          22.667]), and especially the most ancient of the Roman Martyrologies,
          the words of which are these: “[Aristides] presented to the emperor
          Hadrian a treatise on the Christian religion containing the reasons of
          our doctrine. He also, in the presence of the emperor, delivered a
          discourse in which he clearly demonstrated that Jesus Christ was the
          only God” (Roman Martyrology [1869], p. 290). With a similar reason,
          Ignatius confirms the Same mystery. “We have,” says he, “one
          physician, Jesus Christ the Lord our God, from eternity the only
          begotten son, but afterwards also man from the Virgin Mary” (echomen
          iatron ton Kyriou hemon theon lésoun Christon, ton pro aionon hyion
          monogené kai logon, hysteron de kai anthropon ek Marias tés parthenou,
          Pseudo-Ignatius, “Ad Ephesios,” 7.2 in Patres Apostolici [ed. F.X.
          Funk, 1913], 2:188—91). Nothing could be more explicit than this.
          Theodoret alludes to this passage (cf. Dialogues 1 [NPNF2, 3:176; PG
          83.82]). Elsewhere Ignatius calls “Christ his God” (Pseudo- Igantius,
          “Ad Romanos,” 6.3 in Patres Apostolici [ed. F.X. Funk, 1881], 2:211);
          in Pseudo-Ignatius, “Ad Magnesianos,” 8.2 (in Patres Apostolici [ed.
          F.X. Funk, 1881], 2:87), he says that “Christ is the Word of the
          Father, not projected but essential.” Athenagoras, the Athenian
          philosopher, in his apology for the Christians (cf. Embassy for the
          Christians [ACW 23:29— 78]) which he presented to the Emperor Marcus
          Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Verus (a work mentioned by Epiphanius,
          Adversus haereses [Panarion]| 64.20, 21 [PG 41.1102—3] and in Fronto
          Du Duc, Bibliotheca veterum Patrum [1624]) in many places
          perspicuously and solidly lays down the faith of the holy Trinity. “So
          that we assert that God and the Son, his Word, and the Holy Spirit are
          one according to power, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit”
          (Embassy for the Christians 24 [ACW 23:61; PG 6:946]). In various
          passages (which we do not have space to quote), Justin Martyr states
          the same doctrine. Consult his Dialogue with Trypho [FC 6:147—366]),
          where he triumphantly proves against him that Christ is God from the
          prophecies of the Old Testament which refer to him; and his Apology
          (FC 6:119-35) which is commonly considered the second. Irenaeus,
          following in the footsteps of Justin Martyr, says, “Christ himself
          with the Father is the God of the living, who spake with Moses, who
          also was manifested to the fathers” (Against Heresies 4.5* [ANF 1:467;
          PG 7.985]; ibid., 3.6, pp. 418-20 and 2.5, 6, pp. 364-66). Clement of
          Alexandria frequently inculcates the divinity and the worship of the
          Word (Stromata 7 [ANF 2:523—56]); Christ the Educator 1.11 [FC
          23:84—86] and 3.12 [ibid., p. 275]).
