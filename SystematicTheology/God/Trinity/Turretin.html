          TWENTY-THIRD QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >What are the meanings of the words “essence,” “substance,”
            “subsistence,” “person,” “Trinity,” homoousion in this mystery; and
            may the church properly use them?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The absolute consideration of God (as to his nature and attributes)
          begets the relative (as to the persons). Here we are occupied with the
          adorable mystery of the Trinity, which neither reason can comprehend
          nor example prove, but the authority of divine revelation alone
          proposes to be received by faith and adored with love.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. As it can be prudently explained as to the fact (to hoti) from
          Scripture (because clearly delivered in it), not as to the wherefore
          (to dioti) or the how (to pos) (incomprehensible [akatalépton] to the
          angels themselves), the genuine sense and use of the words (usually
          employed to make it more easily understood) must be unfolded.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Essence.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          III. First, here occurs the word ousias or “essence” and “nature”
          which denotes the whatness (quidditatem) of a thing and is often met
          with in Scripture, not only in the concrete when God is called ho on
          (Ex. 3:14; Rev. 1:4), but also in the abstract when deity (theotés,
          Col. 2:9), nature (physis, Gal. 4:8), divine nature (theia physis, 2
          Pet. 1:4) is attributed to God. The Hebrew word tvshyh applies here;
          it designates the real essence (ten ontds ousian, ?Job 12:16).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Substance.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. (2) Substance is attributed to God by the fathers not as it is
          called from standing under the accidents (which do not fall on God),
          but from subsisting (because he subsists through and from himself).
          But we must notice here that the ancients sometimes stand opposed to
          each other and do not use the word substance in the same manner. Some
          take substance from subsistence such as Hilary (of Poitiers) who
          acknowledges “three substances in the deity” (On the Councils 32
          [NPNF2, 9:13; PL 10.504]). Others evidently taking substance for
          nature and essence acknowledge only one and deny that there are three
          (such as Augustine, The Trinity 5.9 [FC 45:187—-88; PL 42.917-18];
          Tertullian, Against Praxeas [ANF 3:597—627] and others).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Subsistence.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          V. (3) Hence the word “subsistence” (called by the Greeks hyparxis)
          marks a mode of subsisting (tropos hyparxeds) or personality. Now to
          subsist differs from to exist. To exist means that a thing actually is
          without its causes in the nature of things, which applies to accidents
          no less than to substances; but to subsist means a mode of existing
          proper to substances. Now subsistence is commonly held to be twofold:
          the one by which it is consituted a substance in the being of a
          substance; the other which is constituted in the being of a
          suppositum. The former is usually explained by independence from the
          subject; it belongs to all substances, incomplete as well as complete;
          the latter is usually explained by incommunication or
          incommunicability, inasmuch as the singular substance is neither a
          part nor an adjunct of another; if it is intellectual, it is called a
          person. The former is the very existence of the substance, but the
          latter is said to superadd some mode to the existence of the singular
          substance (which mode is called entitative, ultimately terminating and
          completing the substantial nature and giving to it incommunicability,
          so that to subsist in this sense belongs to a singular nature
          ultimately completed and incommunicable). Thus the humanity of Christ
          has the former subsistence by which it is constituted in the being of
          a substance because it is a true substance independent of the subject,
          but not the latter (which constitutes a suppositum) because it is not
          a human suppositum, since it is united with and adjoined to the word
          to constitute the God-man (theanthropou). But here the word
          “subsistence” is used in the latter, not in the former sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hypostasis.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VI. (4) To designate this subsistence the Greeks employed the word
          hypostaseos, which formerly gave occasion to great disturbances in the
          church on account of the equivocal sense of the word. For among the
          fathers, it is taken either generically and wisely for the very
          substance of a thing. Thus the ancient Romans and Africans made no
          distinction between essence and hypostasis. Hence the Synod of Sardica
          (cf. “Synodica Concilii Sardicensis,” in Mansi, 6:1215—16) declares it
          to be heretical to assert three hypostases, but orthodox to assert
          only one. Athanasius writes, “Hypostasis is substance and means
          nothing else than that which exists” (hypostasis ousia estin, kai
          ouden allo sémainei, é auto to on, Letter to the Bishops of Africa 4
          [NPNF2, 4:490; PG 26.1035]). This was also the opinion of Jerome who
          would not suffer the mention of three hypostases, lest three divine
          essences, and so three Gods might be implied (Letter 15, “To Pope
          Damasus” [NPNF2, 6:19]). Or it is taken strictly for the subsistence
          of a thing and a suppositum (as the Council of Alexandria [A.p. 362*]
          against the Sabellians determined that one essence [ousian] could be
          held, yet three hypostases [hypostaseis|—see Basil, Letter 38, “To his
          Brother Gregory” [NPNF2, 8:137—41]). Hence the reconciliation is
          easily made between the apparently contradictory passages of the
          fathers, as Athanasius showed in the Council of Alexandria (cf.
          “Epistola Synodica Concilii Alexandrini,” in Mansi, 3:350) of which he
          was president. He prudently and happily put a stop to the sharp
          controversy arising from this cause between Eastern and Western
          parties, the Greeks and Latins (which Gregory Nazianzus notices in his
          Oration 21, “On the Great Athanasius” [NPNF2, 7:269-—80]). According
          to the testimony of Augustine, they were accustomed to say mian
          ousian, treis hypostaseis, viz., “one essence, three subsistences”
          (The Trinity 5.8 [FC 45:187; PL 42.917]). But afterwards, lest the
          ambiguity of the word might give occasion to error (as Aquinas
          remarks, ST, I, Q. 29, Art. 2, p. 157), the opinion of the Greeks (who
          use hypostasin for subsistence) obtained, and this is now the common
          opinion received by all. Further, Scripture appears to precede us
          here, for in comparing the person of the Son with the person of the
          Father (whose image he bears), it calls him “the express image” of the
          subsistence of the Father (Heb. 1:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Person.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          VII. (5) Hence it is evident what must be understood by the word
          “person.” That which among the Greeks is called “hypostasis” is with
          the Latins called persona. It is not as the word is drawn from the
          stage denoting the mask of players (according to Aulus Gellius, Attic
          Nights 5.7 [Loeb, 1:398— 99]), where actors, masked, are called
          personati; or when it is taken from some quality or external
          appearance which adds nothing to the importance of a cause—in which
          sense a judge ought not in a trial to regard the person of the rich
          above that of the poor and respect of persons [prosdpolépsia] is
          denied of God; or for some office and function, as when one is said to
          put off the person of judge and to put on that of an accuser. But
          rather properly and strictly, it denotes an intellectual suppositum,
          as it is used in 2 Cor. 1:11 (and constantly among lawyers, when an
          action is divided into the thing or person).
        </p>
        <p>
          VIII. The word “person” is properly concrete and not abstract. Besides
          the form (which is personality), it also marks the subject with the
          form from which it is denominated. However, sometimes it is taken
          abstractly. Hence it happens that the divine persons come to be
          considered in two ways: either in the concrete, as when the Son is
          said to be hyparchein (“to be in the form of God,” Phil. 2:6); or in
          the abstract when he is called “the express image of the person of the
          Father,” Heb. 1:3). In the latter sense, it is contradistinguished
          from the essence as the mode of a thing. In the former sense, it
          includes the essence with the mode. Hence arose a twofold definition
          of a divine person: one abstractive, employed by our Calvin (ICR
          1.13.6, p. 128) defining a person to be a “subsistence in the essence
          of God by which (related to others) he is distinguished by an
          incommunicable property”—having followed here Justin and John of
          Damascus who called it tropon hyparxeos (“a mode of subsisting”) (cf.
          [Pseudo-] Justin Martyr, Quaestiones et Responsiones ad orthodoxos, Q.
          139 [488C] in Corpus apologetarum Christianorum [ed. J. Otto], 5:224,
          225; John of Damascus, Exposition of the Orthodox Faith 1.8 [NPNF2,
          9:8; PG 94.816, 818], cf. also his Contra Jacobitas 52 [PG 94.1461]);
          the other concretive, given by Melancthon and Ursinus, who define a
          person as “the individual that subsists, is living, intelligent, is
          not sustained by another, nor is a part of another.” The former
          expresses more fully the perfection of the divine persons; the latter
          more clearly sets forth the truth of their subsistence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Trinity.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. (6) The word “Trinity” (proper to this mystery) follows. Although
          not existing in Scripture in the abstract, it is nevertheless found in
          the concrete (1 Jn. 5:7), so that there was no necessity for the
          papists to derive it from tradition to betray the cause of faith to
          heretics, since Bellarmine himself (“De Christo,” 2.5 in Opera [1856],
          1:205—6) confessed that the Trinity can evidently be deduced from
          Scripture. And although the Greek word Trias may seem from the first
          imposition of the name to denote only the number three, yet this word
          (like many others) was consecrated by ecclesiastical custom and
          applied to this mystery alone by way of eminence (kat’ exocheén).
          “Trinity” however is the appropriate word, not “triplicity,” which
          implies a multiplication of essence. God, therefore, is said to be
          triune (trinus), not triple because there are three persons, but only
          one numerical essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Homoousion.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          X. (7) After the word “Trinity,” we must explain to homoousion, the
          subject of so many controversies in the ancient church. The origin of
          the word is to be traced to the Arian heresy. Arius always endeavored
          to escape in various ways by confessing that Christ was God (but
          created before the world; yea, begotten, possessed of the divine
          essence, yet participated and dependent). At length the orthodox, to
          cut off every way of escape for him, declared in the Council of Nicea
          that the Son was homoousion (i.e., of the same nature and essence with
          the Father). No one but a stranger to ecclesiastical history is
          ignorant of the great controversies springing from this word. For
          example, the Arians accused the orthodox of introducing a recent
          invention of the Nicene fathers, altogether unknown to the ancients
          (whom, moreover, they called Homoousians). Nevertheless, Athanasius
          (who often used this word before the rise of the Arian heresy)
          demonstrated this to be false from Dionysius of Rome and Dionysius of
          Alexandria (cf. NPNF2, 4:167, 181, 473). But when the Arians saw that
          they were caught by this word (having recourse to fraud), they
          endeavored by the addition of a letter to destroy the entire force of
          it, acknowledging the Son to be homoiousion, i.e., of a similar
          substance with the Father, but not homoousion (as Theodoret says,
          Ecclesiastical History 2.16*-18 [NPNF2, 3:82-84; PG 82.1049-58] and
          5.21+). Hence it happened that in the Council of Ariminum/Rimini (A.D.
          359) (cf. Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History 4.17 [NPNF2, 2:312]), the
          more simple ones (deceived by the Arians) agreed to put the word
          homoiousion in the place of homoousion. Hence the Arians boasted that
          the Catholics had passed over to their side, but the others constantly
          resisted. Athanasius detected the subterfuge and taught that there was
          not a similar, but the same essence in the Father and Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Curcellaeus, who vigorously attacks the word homoousion, falsely
          maintains that it refers to a “specific” and not “numerical unity” so
          that the essence in the Father and Son may be said to be one in
          species indeed, but not one and the same in number (as Peter and John
          may properly be said to be homoousioi because they are homoeideis,
          partakers of the same specific essence). If the fathers only meant a
          specific unity, they would have introduced Tritheism, holding not only
          to three persons, but to three diverse numerical essences in the three
          persons (as three human persons mean three men). Again, there would be
          nothing strange and incomprehensible (akatalépton) in this mystery
          (which all men confess) because every day we see that very thing among
          men. Third, since human nature is divisible, it can indeed remain the
          same in species when propagated by generation, although it is not the
          same in number because it detaches a certain part of its substance,
          which passes over to the begotten. This is not so with the divine,
          which is indivisible. For either it cannot be communicated or the same
          numerically can be communicated. Therefore either Christ is not the
          Son of God or he ought to have the same numerical essence communicated
          to him. But this will be more fully proved hereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. The word homoousion is used rather than monoousion or
          tautoousion; not that the former demonstrates a specific and the
          latter a numerical unity, but because the last two can be used
          consistently with the only one hypostasis of Sabellius; for monoousios
          rather denotes him who has one singular essence, than him who is of
          the same essence with another or designates him whose nature and
          essence is so the only one, i.e., that there is nothing like him (as
          the sun is monoousios because it is the only one of its species, but
          the other heavenly bodies are called homoousia because they mutually
          possess the same nature, or one not very different). So God is
          monoousios (because the only one and having no partaker of his
          nature), numerically separated from his essence. Now the persons of
          the Trinity cannot be called monoousioi because they are three
          persons, not one only. Tautoousios also is not free from ambiguity for
          it can designate him who has his essence from himself, not by
          communication from another (in which sense the Father alone would be
          tautoousios with respect to person); but homoousion denotes here more
          than one person (partakers of the same numerical essence).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Emperichoreésis.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Here belongs the word emperichoréseos which the fathers
          frequently used and Curcellaeus rails at (as unwritten [agraphon],
          ambiguious and employed to signify a thing nowhere taught in
          Scripture). But that it was not used without reason to describe the
          intimate mutual union of the persons can be inferred not obscurely
          from Scripture itself when “the Son is said to be in the Father, and
          the Father in the Son” (Jn. 10:38; 14:11). They thought this mystery
          could not be better expressed than by the phrase enallélon
          emperichorésin (i.e., a mutual intertwining or inexistence and
          immanence), so as to designate thus that union by which the divine
          persons embrace each other and permeate (if it is right to say so)
          each other. So that although always remaining distinct, yet they are
          never separated from each other, but always coexist; wherever one is,
          there the other also really is. And if believers are said to dwell in
          God and he in them (1 Jn. 3:24; Jn. 14:23) on account of the intimate
          presence of the Spirit (who is the strictest bond of their communion
          with God), does it not follow that such an emperichorésis can be
          attributed to them? There is the widest difference between the
          mystical union of believers with God and the divine union of the
          persons of the Trinity in nature, or of the human and divine natures
          in the person of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIV. The words “property,” “relation” and “notion” (used by the
          Scholastics) can have their use when understood in a sound sense.
          “Property” denotes the peculiar mode of subsisting and diacritical
          (diakritikon) character by which this or that person is constituted in
          his personal being and is distinguished from the others. “Relation,”
          again, intimates the same property inasmuch as it indicates the
          relation (schesin) of one person to another. And “notion” designates
          the same character inasmuch as it signifies that one person is
          distinct from another (so as to be the index and mark of distinction
          between the persons). However some difference can be observed between
          them because notion has a wider extension than relation, and relation
          has a wider extension than property. For there are only three
          properties—paternity, filiation, procession; four relations—paternity,
          filiation, spiration (active and passive); and five
          notions—unbegottenness (agennésia), paternity, filiation, spiration
          (active as well as passive).
        </p>
        <p>
          XV. From a notion arise notional acts (frequently mentioned by
          theologians) properly to be distinguished from essential acts which
          flow ”) (79 from the essential properties and are terminated upon
          something external (which is essentially other than and diverse from
          God); hence they are common to the three persons. But the notional
          proceed from the personal properties, which belong to the persons
          singularly and are terminated upon an internal work such as generation
          and spiration.

          <b>Concerning the use of the words “Trinity,” “person,” etc.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XVI. The meaning of the words commonly used on this subject being
          explained, we must now say a few things conceming their use (i.e.,
          whether it is lawful to use them in explaining this mystery). The
          occasion of the question arose from the importunity of heretics who,
          the more easily to get rid of the thing itself, endeavored to
          eliminate the words themselves from Scripture as new, foreign and
          having no authority. The Arians, Sabellians and other
          anti-Trinitarians pressed this against the orthodox in their day— that
          the names ousias, homoousios, hypostaseos, etc. did not occur in the
          Scriptures and so ought not to be admitted in the church. Arius asks,
          “Why is the word, of which neither the prophets nor the apostles make
          mention, added to the apostolic faith?” (Vigilii Tapsensis Contra
          Arianos 1.10 [PL 62.161]). Treading in their footsteps, the Socinians
          and the Arminians (who agree with them) in their turn oppose this,
          especially Curcellaeus who, in a special dissertation, labors to prove
          that the use of these words is neither useful, nor necessary.
          Therefore it is better “to return to the simplicity of the sacred
          writings, and reject from them all words invented by men, or at least
          compel no one hereafter to swear by them” (“Prima Dissertatio
          Theologica: De Vocibis Trinitatis,” Section 11, Opera Theologica
          [1675], p. 816).
        </p>
        <p>
          XVII. Verily if there was an agreement about the thing itself, we
          think there should be no anxiety about the words because it is not
          becoming for the theologian nosein peri logomachias (“to contend about
          words”). And in this sense must the words of our Calvin be understood
          (which have been so shamefully perverted by the papists and
          Lutherans): “O that the names of the Trinity, of the homoousia, etc.
          were buried, should only this faith be established among all, that the
          Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God, yet that the Son is
          not the Father, nor the Spirit the Son, but that they are distinct
          from each other by some peculiarity” (ICR 1.13.5, p. 126). But it is
          often found that they who litigate more pertinaciously than others
          against the words, cherish a secret virus. It is sufficiently evident
          that those new corruptors of religion condemn the words adopted by the
          ancients for no other reason than that they are unwilling to receive
          the things designed by them. Knowing that with the words they might
          abolish the doctrine also, we therefore did right in retaining them
          and insist on their use being not only lawful, but also beneficial and
          necessary for repressing the pertinacity of heretics and for bringing
          them out of their lurking places.

          <b>Statement of the question.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XVIII. The question is not whether it is lawful to introduce into the
          church rashly and unnecessarily foreign and new words unauthorized by
          the Scriptures. All agree on this point, lest occasion of calumny be
          given to the adversaries, the seeds of dissension be sown in the
          church and the suspicion of singularity arise. Indeed often new things
          and recent doctrines are veiled under new words—applicable to which
          are the various dicta of the fathers which command the avoidance of
          the newness of words and freedom of expressions (cf. Augustine, CG
          10.23 [FC 14:157—58] and Jerome, Letter 15, “To Pope Damasus” [NPNE2,
          6:18—20, esp. p. 19]). But the question is whether it is lawful (under
          the exigency of some weighty reason) to enunciate inwritten (engrapha)
          doctrines by unwritten (agraphois) words for the plainer explication
          of the truth and the more complete refutation of elrors.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIX. The question is not whether the word of man is to be preferred to
          God’s word, but whether it can be admitted for the elucidation of the
          latter in which the adversaries are accustomed to seek for hiding
          places. Indeed the question is whether we are bound to stick so
          tenaciously to the words of Scripture that in the explication of
          doctrines no others but them can be devised and used. This the
          adversaries maintain; we deny.
        </p>
        <p>
          XX. The reasons are drawn: (1) from their utility which is manifold,
          whether for the richer explication of that mystery or for the stronger
          refutation of the heresies opposed to it; (2) from necessity, because
          unless it were lawful to use words not to be found exactly (autolexei)
          in Scripture, we could not interpret it and apply it to uses both
          theoretical and practical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it would be useless for instruction and correction, for the
          conviction and reproof of heretics because there never was anyone who
          did not attempt to confirm his errors by the Scriptures and did not
          think that they had some support in them. Hence whatever was
          sanctioned by the words of Scripture alone could be received by them
          and their error be all the while retained. Thus Sabellius did not deny
          that they were three—the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit—because
          Scripture says this; but he made one person of those three, calling
          them by various names by reason of diverse operation. Arius did not
          deny that Christ was God, but he understood him to be a factitious and
          dependent God. Socinus confesses Christ to be the Son of God, but with
          respect to office and power, not with respect to nature. He does not
          deny that he redeemed us by his blood, but improperly and
          metaphorically, not truly and meritoriously. So invariably heretics
          are accustomed to laud the Scriptures “speaking the same things, but
          thinking differently” (homoia men lalountes, anomoia de phronountes,
          as Irenaeus says in “Preface,” Against Heresies 1 [ANF 1:315; PG
          7.441]). Therefore it was a matter of Christian prudence to employ
          such words as would more clearly confirm the orthodox faith and so
          bind heretical perverseness as to allow no chance of escape anymore by
          an ambiguous and deceitful equivocation. (3) From parity, because in
          other articles, ecclesiastical terms are fitly employed (as “original
          sin” and “sacrament”). Why then can they not be lawfully used in this
          mystery?
        </p>
        <p>
          XXI. (4) This was the mind of the ancients in using these words.
          Athanasius says, “It is always the custom of ecclesiastical
          discipline, if at any time new heretical doctrines arise, against the
          insolent changes of questions, to change the terminology, the things
          remaining immutably” (Disputatio cum Ario coram Probo Judice, libri 1;
          cf. Vigilii Tapsensis, Contra Arianos [PL 62.162]). Gregory Nazianzus
          says, “We must not contend spitefully about terms as long as the
          syllables lead to the same opinion” (Oration 39, “On the Holy Lights”
          [NPNF2, 7:355; PG 36.346]). “We confess that these terms were produced
          by the necessity of speaking, since there would be need of a copious
          disputation against the snares and errors of heretics” (Augustine, The
          Trinity 7.4 [FC 45:233; PL 42.941]). And Augustine again: “Against the
          impiety of the Arian heretics they introduced the new name homoousios,
          but did not signify a new thing by that name” (“Tractate 97,” On the
          Gospel of St. John [NPNF1, 7:376; PL 35.1879]). Hence Thomas Aquinas
          says, “The necessity of disputing with heretics compelled them to
          invent new terms expressing the ancient faith” (ST, I, Q. 29, Art. 3,
          p. 158).

          <b>Sources of explanation.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          XXII. “The form of sound words” spoken of by Paul (hypotyposis
          hygiainonton logon, 2 Tim. 1:13) is not an external form of locution,
          so bound down to the words of Scripture that it would be unlawful to
          use even a syllable or word not found in Scripture. Otherwise sermons
          and comments on Scripture would be all wrong. Rather it denotes that
          method of teaching which does not depart from the intention of
          Scripture and the analogy of faith, and which rejoices not in the
          swelling arrogance of empty eloquence, but in the religious simplicity
          of true wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIII. It is one thing to speak of the mode of enunciating things;
          another to speak of the things themselves. When Paul forbids to teach
          otherwise (heterodidaskalein, 1 Tim. 6:3), he refers to the things
          themselves—that no one should teach other (hetera) things (i.e.,
          doctrines alien from the truth and simplity of the gospel). But he
          does not speak of the mode of delivering, as if he thought it unlawful
          to use other words besides those inwritten (engraphois). For God did
          not give the church the gift of prophecy in vain; for its purpose is
          the interpretation of Scripture which would evidently have been
          useless if it were wrong to express in other words the things
          delivered in Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIV. A newness of words only differs from that which (with the words)
          introduces a newness of things. The one is useful and necessary for
          the elucidation of truth and the confutation of error; but the other
          is deceitful and deadly, smuggling in foreign doctrines under new and
          foreign words. Paul condemns the latter not the former when he orders
          us to avoid “profane and vain babblings” (tas bebélous kainophonias, 1
          Tim. 6:20). Hence Augustine says, “The apostle does not say the
          newness of words must be avoided, but [he adds] profane; for there are
          doctrines of religion agreeing with the newness of words ... the
          things themselves called by new names were before their names”
          (“Tractate 97,” On the Gospel of John [NPNF1, 7:375—76; PL 35.1879]).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXV. It is one thing under the penalty of anathema to obtrude words
          upon the church for her reception, but another to obtrude the things
          signified by the words. The latter can rightly be done, but not the
          former.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVI. Not to be in Scripture expressly and according to the letter
          (kata to gramma) differs from not being there equivalently and as to
          the thing signified (kata to pragma). The words “Trinity,”
          “consubstantiality” (homoousiou), “inhabitation” (perichoréseos),
          “person” are not in Scripture in the former manner, but in the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVII. Those words ought to be avoided which afford matter for strife
          per se in the church, but not those which only accidentally do so on
          account of the pertinacity of heretics (who attack the words in order
          to get rid of the things signified by them).
        </p>
        <p>
          XXVIII. Although the Council of Alexandria (according to Socrates,
          Ecclesiastical History 3.7* [NPNF2, 2:81]) decreed that such terms
          should not be used in addresses to the people, yet it acknowledged
          that they might lawfully be employed in controversies when we have to
          do with skin- changing (versipellibus) heretics, who force us to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXIX. The foundations of faith differ from its defenses: the former
          are built upon Scripture alone and are derived from it; the latter are
          drawn even from beyond Scripture to ward off the attacks of besiegers.
          The latter kind are the various words devised by theologians to guard
          against the fraud and unscrupulousness (panourgian) of heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          XXX. Concerning God, we must not speak except with God (i.e., nothing
          must be asserted except what he himself has asserted in his word as to
          the things themselves, but not therefore as to the words). Otherwise
          we could not speak of them in any other than the Hebrew language (in
          which God spoke).
