          TWENTY-SIXTH QUESTION<br />
          <em
            >Can the mystery of the Trinity be proved from the Old Testament,
            and was it known under it? We affirm against the Socinians</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I. From the arguments adduced by us before to prove the necessity of
          this doctrine as a fundamental article, it might be satisfactorily
          inferred that it was revealed and known under the Old Testament (since
          fundamentals are the same among all believers admitting neither of
          increase nor of diminution). Yet the Socinians (in order by any means
          to destroy the belief of this mystery) are wont to urge peculiarly
          that it is a new doctrine invented after the time of Christ and his
          apostles (whom the Arminians also carry on their shoulders here). It
          therefore becomes necessary to establish against both the truth of
          this mystery not only from the New, but also from the Old Testament.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Trinity was not unknown under the Old Testament.</b></p>
        <p>
          II. Indeed, we confess that it was not revealed under the Old
          Testament with the same clearness as it is now taught in the New. It
          was delivered far more obscurely because the reason of that economy
          and the (as yet) infantile condition of the ancient church required
          it. Yet this is no objection to its having been made known even to the
          patriarchs sufficiently for salvation. The orthodox thus far have
          constantly asserted this against the Socinians, and it can be proved
          by various arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. For the proof we must make a choice of the passages of Scripture
          that we may contend not so much by number as by weight. For it is not
          becoming in us to be so anxious about the number as about the
          solidity, lest the Christian religion be exposed to derision and an
          opportunity of cavilling be afforded to the adversaries. When our
          Calvin labored to do this, he was undeservedly and most unjustly
          traduced by them as a Judaizer or an Arianizer. On the contrary,
          scarcely has anyone more strongly and triumphantly confirmed the
          Christian faith against the impiety of the Arians and the Jews.
        </p>
        <p><b>A plurality of persons is proved from Gen. 1:26, etc.</b></p>
        <p>
          IV. But as God has condescended to reveal himself here “at sundry
          times and in diverse manners” (polymeros kai polytropos), there is a
          double kind of proof. First, we may adduce those passages from which a
          plurality of persons may be gathered; second, those in which the
          Trinity is expressly mentioned. Among the former are a large number
          which introduce God speaking of himself in the plural number. The
          principle ones are these three: at the creation of man, “Let us make
          man in our image” (Gen. 1:26); at the transgression of Adam, “Behold,
          the man is become as one of us” (Gen 3:22); and at the confusion of
          tongues, “Let us go down and there confound their language” (Gen
          11:7). No reason can be assigned why God (who elsewhere so frequently
          speaks of himself in the singular) should use the plural verb, unless
          to intimate a certain (at least) plurality of persons in the unity of
          essence. Hence he does not say “let me make,” but “let us make,” so
          that more than one is intimated. As in creating, there is a common
          operation to them, so there ought to be a common nature. He does not
          say in “images,” but in “our image,” so that the identity of image
          designates the identity of essence common to these more than one. Nor
          ought it to be objected here: (1) that God for the sake of honor
          speaks of himself in the plural by enallage (like kings and princes)
          because the idiom of the language forbids it. For although the second
          or third person can be so addressed for the sake of honor, yet it is
          altogether unusual for the first person to speak thus of himself (as
          Aben Ezra himself on Genesis 29:27 remarks+). Nor can any example to
          the contrary be adduced. Those which are sought from various passages
          of Scripture are synecdochical, where one speaks in the name of more:
          Laban of himself and friends who were present (Gen. 29:27); Bildad of
          himself and companions (Job 18:2, 3); Daniel of himself and companions
          (Dan. 2:36); Christ of himself, John the Baptist and his disciples
          (Jn. 3:11); the church of herself and daughters (i.e., believers,
          Cant. 1:4). The present custom of kings does not imply that this
          practice existed among the Hebrews, since Pharoah, Nebuchadnezzar,
          Belshazzar and the most ambitious kings are introduced speaking of
          themselves in the singular. When kings do thus speak, it is done not
          so much for the purpose of exalting as of depressing themselves, that
          they may seem to speak not only of themselves, but also the opinion of
          the nobles. (2) If God spoke thus of himself for the sake of honor, he
          ought always to have spoken so (which he certainly did not do). Third,
          this enallage would be not only useless but also dangerous because the
          believer would thus be easily induced to believe a plurality of
          persons (which however would be false on that hypothesis).
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Of no force either is the objection that angels are here addressed
          because in no one of the three passages can they be understood. Not in
          the first, because the angels neither assisted in the least in the
          creation of man nor is he anywhere said to have been formed in their
          image. Although men are in various respects similar to the angels, yet
          they cannot be said to have been made in their image because for this
          would be required no kind of similitude, but also a dependence of the
          type upon the prototype and examplar (which does not occur here). Not
          in the second (Gen. 3:22), because those whom God addresses are equal
          to him and their likeness (man) aimed at according to the promise of
          the serpent (which cannot be said of the angels). Not in the third
          (Gen. 11:7), because they are addressed whose work is the confusion of
          tongues (which does not pertain to the angels, but to God alone).
          Besides the deep silence here concerning the angels, Jehovah alone is
          said to descend, to see, to confound (which ought not to have been
          said if he had employed angels as his ministers in this work).
        </p>
        <p><b>2. From Gen. 1:2.</b></p>
        <p>
          VI. Second, a plurality may be proved from those passages where the
          discourse concerns God as about different persons. “The Spirit of God”
          (Gen. 1:2) is said to move upon the face of the waters. By the Spirit
          cannot be understood the “air” or “wind” because neither had as yet
          been created. And no distinction of things had been made, nor any
          angel because it is not known whether angels had as yet been created
          (nor is God said to have used their help in creation). Nor can it be
          understood of any virtue and efficacy of God as the cause of the
          fecundity of things because that is described by incubation and is
          distinguished from the Spirit (as the effect from the cause and
          actions belong to self-existent things [suppositorum]). Therefore by
          the Spirit must necessarily be meant some suppositum or person
          concurring to this work; to wit, the same Spirit who is elsewhere
          termed the author of creation (Ps. 33:6; 104:30; Is. 40:13, 14,
          expressions applying to no created thing). Nor is it an objection that
          he is called the Spirit of God for he is so the Spirit of God
          considered hypostatically as to be also God the Spirit essentially
          (ousiddds) as the Son of Man is also man. Nor if that incubation (as
          an external work) is common to the whole Trinity originally does it
          follow that it cannot belong appropriatively to the Holy Spirit
          because he performs it immediately and by himself (although from the
          Father and the Son); just as redemption (which is ascribed to the
          whole Trinity) yet singularly and terminatively is attributed to the
          Son.
        </p>
        <p><b>From Hos. 1:7.</b></p>
        <p>
          VII. The same thing may be proved from those passages in which God is
          distinguished from himself, not essentially but personally. Jehovah
          says, “I will save them by Jehovah their God” (Hos. 1:7). Where two
          are spoken of —one who saves, another by whom he saves (viz., the
          Messiah)—and both Jehovah. “Jehovah rained fire and brimstone from
          Jehovah” (Gen. 19:24), i.e., the Son from the Father. For if he had
          wished only to denote that this had been done immediately by God, it
          would have sufficed to say Jehovah rained without adding “from
          Jehovah.” Therefore undoubtedly a mystery lies concealed in this
          locution, although an apodictical argument cannot be drawn from this
          passage taken by itself. So “Jehovah said to my Lord” (Ps. 110:1) and
          “God, thy God, hath annointed thee with the oil of gladness” (Ps.
          45:7*), where mention is made of God anointing and anointed (viz.,
          hypostatically not essentially). Here belong the passages in which
          divine names and attributes are ascribed to the Messiah: when he is
          called “Jehovah our righteousness,” “the mighty God,” “the angel of
          his presence.” These manifestly prove a divine person distinct from
          God the Father. Nor can the heretics bring forward anything here to
          weaken the force of this argument, as will be shown in the proper
          place when we come to treat of the deity of the Son.
        </p>
        <p><b>The Trinity may be proved from Gen. 1.</b></p>
        <p>
          VIII. As the passages which connote a plurality of persons are
          various, so those in which that plurality is restricted to a Trinity
          are not a few. First, it is collected with some clearness from the
          history of the creation where Moses distinctly mentions Elohim
          creating, the Spirit of God moving upon the waters, and the Word
          producing all things. That Elohim is God, the adversaries do not deny;
          that the Spirit of God is a person distinct from him has been already
          proved; and that the Word is not a simple command and mandate of God,
          but a personal Word is evinced by a comparison of Moses with John who,
          alluding to Moses, describes the Word spoken of by Moses as a person
          subsisting with God the Father, by whom all things were created (Jn.
          1:1—-3). Nor can it be understood either of “an external word” by
          which God commanded the angels as his ministers because they were not
          yet created—they themselves ought to be produced by that Word who made
          all things without exception; or of an internal word by which he
          enjoined this upon himself—because God is introduced speaking in the
          third person, as if commanding another person not himself (and that
          too repeatedly). This cannot be explained as being done either
          undesignedly or in accommodation to an internal word. It remains
          therefore that we must understand a “personal Word” (i.e., the Son of
          God, who is often set forth in the Chaldee paraphrase by mymr or “the
          Word”). Nor is it an objection that the verb “said” connotes an
          efficacious command of God. For although objectively and terminated on
          the creatures about to be produced, it implies the efficacious command
          of God (to whom they would owe their origin), yet it supposes within
          and originally the personal Word of God as the principle which that
          mandate ought to obey (as by him he works all things and made the
          worlds, Heb. 1:2). In reference to this David says, “By the word of
          the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath
          of his mouth” (Ps. 33:6). Here distinct mention is made of three
          concurring in creation: “Jehovah,” “the Word” and “the Spirit.” For
          the Word can be no other than that by whom John says all things were
          made (1:3). Nor can any other Spirit be meant than him who moved upon
          the waters in the first creation. And if the Spirit of the mouth of
          God is elsewhere usually applied to his efficacious word (cf. 2 Thess.
          2:8), it ought here also to be taken in the same sense, since such
          express mention had been made of him in the first part of the verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. From the liberation of the people from Egyptian bondage. IX.
          Second, the same may be proved from the deliverance of the people out
          of Egyptian bondage, the guidance of them through the wilderness, and
          introduction into Canaan. He is that true God whom the Israelites
          acknowledged and worshipped, who brought them out of Egypt, lead them
          through the wilderness and introduced them into the land of promise.
          For no other besides God could have performed so great a work, as he
          himself testifies in the preface to the law: “I am the Lord thy God
          who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.” Also he often claims this
          as his prerogative (Ex. 3:8; Dt. 33:29). Now this work is ascribed to
          the three persons of the Trinity —the Father, the Son and the Holy
          Spirit. Concerning the Father, the adversaries do not doubt;
          concerning the Son, the following passages prove (Ex. 3:2; 23:20;
          32:34), in which this work is ascribed to the “angel of Jehovah.” That
          this angel is not a created angel, but the uncreated Son of God
          himself, sent by God for this work and often manifesting himself under
          this form to the patriarchs, is evident from the description of him
          and the various attributes given to him (which are such as cannot
          apply to a creature, but belong to God alone). (1) He says he is the
          God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob (Ex. 3:6); calls the Israelites
          his people (Ex. 3:7); sends Moses to Pharaoh (Ex. 3:10); promises
          himself divine worship after their deliverance from Egypt (Ex. 3:12).
          (2) He is said to have gone before the Israelites in a pillar of cloud
          and fire (Ex. 14:19), which is expressly attributed to Jehovah (Ex.
          13:21; Num. 11:25; 14:14). (3) It is said that “the name of God” will
          be in him so that they will not escape unpunished who rebel against
          him (Ex. 23:20, 21*). (4) He is called “the very presence of God” (“My
          presence shall go with thee,” Ex. 33:14) because he is the image of
          the invisible God, the express image of the person of the Father. That
          the Holy Spirit also here concurred as a person with the others is
          evident from the noted passage: “I will mention the lovingkindnesses
          of the Lord” (Is. 63:7-14). He said “surely they are my people, so he
          was their Savior.” “The angel of his presence saved them in his love,
          but they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.” Here three distinct
          persons are enumerated: “Jehovah,” “the angel of his presence,” and
          “the Holy Spirit.” Distinct operations are ascribed to each: to
          Jehovah, lovingkindness towards the people; to the angel of his
          presence, redemption; and to the Holy Spirit, vexation and contention
          with the people, while he was tumed to be their enemy. Since, then, a
          truly divine work is ascribed to these three, it is necessary that
          they should be the one true God essentially (although mutually
          distinguished in mode of subsisting and personally).
        </p>
        <p><b>3. From the descriptions of the Messiah.</b></p>
        <p>
          X. Third, the same thing is evidenced by the descriptions of the
          Messiah. Since he is everywhere proposed not only as the seed of the
          woman and the fruit of the womb (i.e., a true man), but also as the
          true and eternal God, to whom divine names and attributes and works
          are ascribed (as will be demonstrated hereafter), who was to be sent
          from the Father and the Holy Spirit, it is evident that the mystery of
          the Trinity was thus revealed with sufficient clearness. Here belongs
          the passage, “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord
          hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek” (Is. 61:1, 2).
          Christ himself authorizes us to refer these words to the Messiah (Lk.
          4:21); nor can the Jews, although obstinate, deny it. Such things are
          predicated of him as can apply neither to Isaiah nor to any other
          mortal. As therefore the work ascribed to the Messiah proves him to be
          God, so when mention is made of Jehovah and his Spirit sending and
          anointing him, two persons distinct from him are connoted. The passage
          in Haggai 2:4, 5* is pertinent here, which mentions these three: “I am
          with you, saith the Lord of hosts: according to the word that I
          covenanted with you, so my spirit remaineth among you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >4. From the threefold repetition of the name Jehovah, Num.
            6:24—26.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          XI. Fourth, from the threefold repetition of the name Jehovah, as in
          the blessing of the priest: “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the
          Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the
          Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace” (Num.
          6:24—26). For this threefold repetition can be employed for no other
          purpose than to designate those three persons from whom, as from one
          true Jehovah, that blessing is sought. Thus Jacob mentions three times
          the God from whom he seeks a blessing for his sons: “God, before whom
          my fathers did walk; the God which fed me all my life long unto this
          day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads” (Gen.
          48:15, 16). Now the angel who redeemed him from all evil and from whom
          he sought the blessing could not be a creature. Here also must be
          referred the seraphic trisagion: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God of
          Hosts” (Is. 6:3). For although this threefold repetition can denote
          the unwearied assiduity of the heavenly inhabitants in praising God
          and the excellency of the divine holiness, still this does not hinder
          it from being considered as also designating a sacred Triad. The
          latter may be gathered from this—that these are ascriptions to
          Jehovah, the plurality of whose persons is implied even from this—not
          only that he says, “Who will go for us” (Is. 6:8), but also that the
          mandate issued there is to be attributed not only to the Father, but
          also to the Son and Holy Spirit (from a comparison of Jn. 12:41 and
          Acts 28:25, where the things spoken here of Jehovah are attributed to
          the Son and the Holy Spirit, who consequently are understood to be
          designated in this trisagion). To no purpose does Volkelius endeavor
          to destroy the argument from those passages where a threefold
          repetition is found (as Jer. 27:4; 22:9; Ezk. 21:32) because it is not
          founded simply upon the repetition, but upon that in connection with
          other circumstances of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          XII. Fifth, to these must be added those passages from which the
          divinity of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is proved (of which we will
          treat hereafter when we take up their divinity). These would have no
          force, unless a Trinity of persons in unity of essence had been
          connotated.
        </p>
        <p>
          XIII. Sixth, there is not one Old Testament and another New Testament
          God (as the Marcionites and Manicheans formerly pretended), but one
          and the same revealed in both as the sole object of faith and worship.
          Under the New Testament, he has revealed himself as one in essence and
          three in persons. Therefore he must necessarily have been revealed to
          the Jews as such and known and worshipped by them. Otherwise they
          would not have worshipped the true God who is no other than the
          Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (because he who has not the Son
          has not the Father either, 1 Jn. 2:23).
        </p>

          XIV. Finally, if the Trinity was not revealed in the Old Testament,
          the orthodox thus far (the ancient as well as the more modern) have
          labored falsely to prove it from the Old Testament (which cannot
          without grievous injustice be charged upon so many great men and
          faithful servants of God). Nor ought it to be said that we can now
          indeed gather this from the Old Testament assisted by the light of the
          gospel; but that it could not be done equally by the fathers. For
          although we confess that the light of the New Testament serves in a
          great measure to illuminate for us the obscurity of the ancient
          oracles, yet it cannot be denied that God, who condescended to reveal
          them to the fathers for their instruction and consolation, adapted
          them to their comprehension so that they might from them be instructed
          in this mystery (as far as was necessary for their salvation).
          Otherwise to no purpose were these things revealed to them.

          XV. Although the Jews of our day refuse to acknowledge this mystery,
          it does not follow that it was unknown under the Old Testament (no
          more than the various other mysteries which are denied by them now,
          although it is certain that they were formerly revealed). For the
          knowledge of a thing ought not to be measured by the ignorance of this
          or that subject, but by the revelation made in the word. In addition,
          the modern Jews, bearing a veil of unbelief over their hearts and
          bewitched by the nefarious hatred with which they persecute our
          Messiah, voluntarily shut their eyes to that light which the ancient
          believers, not blinded by prejudice, contemplated with great
          consolation, assisted by the Holy Spirit.
