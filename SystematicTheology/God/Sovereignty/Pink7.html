        <h2>7 - God's Sovereignty And The Human Will</h2>
        <p>
          It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good
          pleasure" (Phil. 2: 13).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the nature and the power of fallen man's will, the greatest
          confusion prevails today, and the most erroneous views are held, even
          by many of God's children. The popular idea now prevailing, and which
          is taught from the great majority of pulpits, is that man has a "free
          will," and that salvation comes to the sinner through his will
          co-operating with the Holy Spirit. To deny the "free will" of man,
          i.e., his power to choose that which is good, his native ability to
          accept Christ, is to bring one into disfavor at once, even before most
          of those who profess to be orthodox. And yet Scripture emphatically
          says, "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
          God that showeth mercy" (Rom. 9:16). Which shall we believe: God, or
          the preachers?
        </p>
        <p>
          But some one may reply, Did not Joshua say to Israel, "Choose you this
          day whom ye will serve"? Yes, he did; but why not complete his
          sentence-"whether the gods which your fathers served which were on the
          other side of the flood, o r the gods of the Amorites, in whose land
          ye dwell" (Josh. 24:15)! But why attempt to pit Scripture against
          Scripture? The Word of God never contradicts itself, and the Word
          expressly declares, "There is none that seeketh after God" (Rom.
          3:11). Did not Christ say to the men of His day "Ye will not come to
          Me, that ye might have life" (John 5:40)? Yes, but some did "come" to
          Him, some did receive Him. True and who were they? John 1:12, 13 tells
          us: "But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the
          sons of God, to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of
          blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
          God"!
        </p>
        <p>
          But does not Scripture say, "Whosoever will may come"? It does, but
          does this signify that everybody has the will to come? What of those
          who won't come? "Whosoever will may come" no more implies that fallen
          man has the power (in himself) to come, than "Stretch forth thine
          hand" implied that the man with the withered arm had ability (in
          himself) to comply. In and of himself the natural man has power to
          reject Christ; but in and of himself he has not the power to receive
          Christ. And why? Because he has a mind that is "enmity against" Him
          (Rom. 8:7); because he has a heart that hates Him (John 15:18). Man
          chooses that which is according to his nature, and therefore before he
          will ever choose or prefer that which is Divine and spiritual a new
          nature must be imparted to him; in other words, he must be born again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should it be asked, But does not the Holy Spirit overcome a man's
          enmity and hatred when He convicts the sinner of his sins and his need
          of Christ; and does not the Spirit of God produce such conviction in
          many that perish? Such language betrays confusion of thought: were
          such a man's enmity really "overcome," then he would readily turn to
          Christ; that he does not come to the Saviour demonstrates that his
          enmity is not overcome. But that many are, through the preaching of
          the Word, convicted by the Holy Spirit, who nevertheless die in
          unbelief, is solemnly true. Yet, it is a fact which must not be lost
          sight of that the Holy Spirit does something more in each of God's
          elect than He does in the non-elect: He works in them "both to will
          and to do of His good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13).
        </p>
        <p>
          In reply to what we have said above, Arminians would answer, No; the
          Spirit's work of conviction is the same both in the converted and in
          unconverted, that which distinguishes the one class from the other is
          that the former yielded to His strivings whereas the latter resist
          them. But if this were the case then the Christian would have ground
          for boasting and self-glorying over his cooperation with the Spirit;
          but this would flatly contradict Ephesians 2:8, "For by grace are ye
          saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us appeal to the actual experience of the Christian reader. Was
          there not a time (may the remembrance of it bow each of us into the
          dust) when you were unwilling to come to Christ? There was. Since then
          you have come to Him. Are you now prepared to give Him all the glory
          for that (Psa. 115:1)? Do you not acknowledge you came to Christ
          because the Holy Spirit brought you from unwillingness to willingness?
          You do. Then is it not also a patent fact that the Holy Spirit has not
          done in many others what He has in you! Granting that many others have
          heard the Gospel, been shown their need of Christ, yet, they are still
          unwilling to come to Him. Thus He has wrought more in you than in
          them. Do you answer, Yet I remember well the time when the Great Issue
          was presented to me, and my consciousness testifies that my will acted
          and that I yielded to the claims of Christ upon me. Quite true. But
          before you "yielded" the Holy Spirit overcame the native enmity of
          your mind against God, and this "enmity" He does not overcome in all.
          Should it be said, That is because they are unwilling for their enmity
          to be overcome. Ah! none are thus "'willing" till He has put forth His
          allmighty power and wrought a miracle of grace in the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us now inquire, What is the human Will? Is it a
          self-determining agent, or is it, in turn, determined by something
          else? Is it Sovereign or servant? Is the will superior to every other
          faculty of our being so that it governs them, or is it moved by their
          impulses and subject to their pleasure? Does the will rule the mind,
          or does the mind control the will? Is the will free to do as it
          pleases, or is it under the necessity of rendering obedience to
          something outside of itself? "Does the will stand apart from the other
          great faculties or powers of the soul, a man within a man, who can
          reverse the man and fly against the man and split him into segments,
          as a glass snake breaks in pieces? Or, is the will connected with the
          other faculties, as the tail of the serpent is with his body, and that
          again with his head, so that where the head goes, the whole creature
          goes, and, as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he? First thought,
          then heart (desire or aversion), and then act. Is it this way, the dog
          wags the tail? Or, is it the will, the tail, wags the dog? Is the will
          the first and chief thing in man, or is it the last thing-to be kept
          subordinate, and in its place beneath the other faculties? and, is the
          true philosophy of moral action and its process that of Genesis 3:6:
          'And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food'
          (sense-perception, intelligence), 'and a tree to be desired'
          (affections), 'she took and ate thereof' (the will)." (George S.
          Bishop). These are questions of more than academical interest. They
          are of practical importance. We believe that we do not go too far when
          we affirm that the answer returned to these questions is a fundamental
          test of doctrinal soundness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN WILL.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the Will? We answer, the will is the faculty of choice, the
          immediate cause of all action. Choice necessarily implies the refusal
          of one thing and the acceptance of another. The positive and the
          negative must both be present to the mind before there can be any
          choice. In every act of the will there is a preference-the desiring
          one thing rather than another. Where there is no preference, but
          complete indifference, there is no volition. To will is to choose, and
          to choose is to decide between two or more alternatives. But there is
          something which influences the choice; something which determines the
          decision. Hence the will cannot be Sovereign because it is the servant
          of that something. The will cannot be both Sovereign and servant. It
          cannot be both cause and effect. The will is not causative, because,
          as we have said, something causes it to choose, therefore that
          something must be the causative agent. Choice itself is affected by
          certain considerations, is determined by various influences brought to
          bear upon the individual himself, hence, volition is the effect of
          these considerations and influences, and if the effect, it must be
          their servant; and if the will is their servant then it is not
          Sovereign, and if the will is not Sovereign, we certainly cannot
          predicate absolute "freedom" of it. Acts of the will cannot come to
          pass of themselves-
        </p>
        <p>
          Since writing the above we have read an article by the late J. N.
          Darby entitled, "Man's So-Called Freewill," that opens with these
          words: "This re-appearance of the doctrine of freewill serves to
          support that of the pretensions of the natural man to be not
          irremediably fallen, for this is what such doctrine tends to. All who
          have never been deeply convicted of sin, all persons in whom this
          conviction is based on gross external sins, believe more or less in
          freewill."
        </p>
        <p>
          To say they can, is to postulate an uncaused effect. Ex nihilo nihil
          fit-nothing cannot produce something.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all ages, however, there have been those who contended for the
          absolute freedom or Sovereignty of the human will. Men will argue that
          the will possesses a self-determining power. They say, for example, I
          can turn my eyes up or down, the mind is quite indifferent which I do,
          the will must decide. But this is a contradiction in terms. This case
          supposes that I choose one thing in preference to another while I am
          in a state of complete indifference. Manifestly, both cannot be true.
          But it may be replied, The mind was quite indifferent until it came to
          have a preference. Exactly; and at that time the will was quiescent
          too! But the moment indifference vanished, choice was made, and the
          fact that indifference gave place to preference, overthrows the
          argument that the will is capable of choosing between two equal
          things. As we have said, choice implies the acceptance of one
          alternative and the rejection of the other or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          That which determines the will is that which causes it to choose. If
          the will is determined then there must be a determiner. What is it
          that determines the will? We reply, The strongest motive power which
          is brought to bear upon it. What this motive power is varies in
          different cases. With one it may be the logic of reason, with another
          the voice of conscience, with another the impulse of the emotions,
          with another the whisper of the Tempter, with another the power of the
          Holy Spirit; whichever of these presents the strongest motive power
          and exerts the greatest influence upon the individual himself is that
          which impels the will to act. In other words, the action of the will
          is determined by that condition of mind (which in turn is influenced
          by the world, the flesh, and the Devil, as well as by God) which has
          the greatest degree of tendency to excite volition. To illustrate what
          we have just said let us analyze a simple example-On a certain Lord's
          day afternoon a friend of ours was suffering from a severe headache.
          He was anxious to visit the sick but feared that if he did so his own
          condition would grow worse, and as a consequence, be unable to attend
          the preaching of the Gospel that evening. Two alternatives confronted
          him: to visit the sick that afternoon and risk being sick himself, or,
          to take a rest that afternoon (and visit the sick the next day) and
          probably arise refreshed and fit for the evening service. Now what was
          it that decided our friend in choosing between these two alternatives?
          The will? Not at all. True, that in the end, the will made a choice,
          but the will itself was moved to make the choice. In the above case
          certain considerations presented strong motives for selecting either
          alternative; these motives were balanced the one against the other by
          the individual himself, i.e., his heart and mind, and the one
          alternative being supported by stronger motives than the other,
          decision was formed accordingly, and then the will acted. On the one
          side, our friend felt impelled by a sense of duty to visit the sick;
          he was moved with compassion to do so, and thus a strong motive was
          presented to his mind. On the other hand, his judgment reminded him
          that he was feeling far from well himself, that he badly needed a
          rest, that if he visited the sick his own condition would probably be
          made worse, and in such case he would be prevented from attending the
          preaching of the Gospel that night; furthermore, he knew that on the
          morrow, the Lord willing, he could visit the sick, and this being so,
          he concluded he ought to rest that afternoon. Here then were two sets
          of alternatives presented to our Christian brother: on the one side
          was a sense of duty plus his own sympathy, on the other side was a
          sense of his own need plus a real concern for God's glory, for he felt
          that he ought to attend the preaching of the Gospel that night. The
          latter prevailed. Spiritual considerations outweighed his sense of
          duty. Having formed his decision the will acted accordingly and he
          retired to rest. An analysis of the above case shows that the mind or
          reasoning faculty was directed by spiritual considerations, and the
          mind regulated and controlled the will. Hence we say that, if the will
          is controlled, it is neither Sovereign nor free, but is the servant of
          the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is only as we see the real nature of freedom and mark that the will
          is subject to the motives brought to bear upon it that we are able to
          discern there is no conflict between two statements of Holy Writ which
          concern our blessed Lord. In Matthew 4:1 we read, "Then was Jesus led
          up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil"; but
          in Mark 1:12, 13 we are told, "And immediately the Spirit drift Him
          into the wilderness. And He was there in the wilderness forty days,
          tempted of Satan." It is utterly impossible to harmonize these two
          statements by the Armenian conception of the will. But really there is
          no difficulty. That Christ was "driven" implies it was by a forcible
          motive or powerful impulse, such as was not to be resisted or refused;
          that He was "led" denotes His freedom in going. Putting the two
          together we learn that He was driven, with a voluntary condescension
          thereto. So, there is the liberty of man's will and the victorious
          efficacy of God's grace united together: a sinner may be "drawn" and
          yet "come" to Christ-the "drawing" presenting to him the irresistible
          motive, the "coming" signifying the response of his will-as Christ was
          "driven" and "led" by the Spirit into the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human philosophy insists that it is the will which governs the man,
          but the Word of God teaches that it is the heart which is the
          dominating center of our being. Many Scriptures might be quoted in
          substantiation of this. "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of
          it are the issues of life" (Prov. 4:23). "For from within, out of the
          heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications,
          murders," etc. (Mark 7:21). Here our Lord traces these sinful acts
          back to their source and declares that their fountain is the "heart"
          and not the will! Again: "This people draweth nigh unto Me with their
          mouth, but their heart is far from Me" (Matt. 15:8). If further proof
          were required we might call attention to the fact that the word
          "heart" is found in the Bible more than three times oftener than is
          the word "will," even though nearly half of the references to the
          latter refer to God's will!
        </p>
        <p>
          When we affirm that it is the heart and not the will which governs the
          man, we are not merely striving about words, but insisting on a
          distinction that is of vital importance. Here is an individual before
          whom two alternatives are placed; which will he choose? We answer, the
          one which is most agreeable to himself, i.e., his "heart"-the
          innermost core of his being? Before the sinner is set a life of virtue
          and piety, and a life of sinful indulgence; which will he follow? The
          latter. Why? Because that is his choice. But does that prove the will
          is Sovereign? Not at all. Go back from effect to cause. Why does the
          sinner choose a life of sinful indulgence? Because he prefers it-and
          he does prefer it, all arguments to the contrary notwithstanding,
          though of course he does not enjoy the effects of such a course. And
          why does he prefer it? Because his heart is sinful. The same
          alternatives, in like manner, confront the Christian, and he chooses
          and strives after a life of piety and virtue. Why? Because God has
          given him a new heart or nature. Hence we say it is not the will which
          makes the sinner impervious to all appeals to "forsake his way," but
          his corrupt and evil heart. He will not come to Christ because he does
          not want to, and he does not want to because his heart hates Him and
          loves sin: see Jeremiah 17:9!
        </p>
        <p>
          In defining the will we have said above, that "the will is the faculty
          of choice, the immediate cause of all action." We say the immediate
          cause, for the will is not "the primary cause of any action." We say
          the immediate cause, for the will is not the primary cause of any
          action any more than the hand is. Just as the hand is controlled by
          the muscles and nerves of the arm, and the arm by the brain; so the
          will is the servant of the mind, and the mind, in turn, is affected by
          various influences and motives which are brought to bear upon it. But,
          it may be asked, Does not Scripture make its appeal to man's will? Is
          it not written, "And whosoever will, let him take the water of life
          freely" (Rev. 22:17)? And did not our Lord say, "ye will not come to
          Me that ye might have life" (John 5:40)? We answer; the appeal of
          Scripture is not always made to man's "will"; other of his faculties
          are also addressed. For example: "He that hath ears to hear, let him
          hear." "Hear and your soul shall live." "Look unto Me and be ye
          saved." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved."
          "Come now and let us reason together," "with the heart man believeth
          unto righteousness," etc., etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. THE BONDAGE OF THE HUMAN WILL.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In any treatise that proposes to deal with the human will, its nature
          and functions, respect should be had to the will in three different
          men, namely, unfallen Adam, the sinner, and the Lord Jesus Christ. In
          unfallen Adam the will was free, free in both directions, free toward
          good and free toward evil. Adam was created in a state of innocency
          but not in a state of holiness, as is so often assumed and asserted.
          Adam's will was therefore in a condition of moral equipoise: that is
          to say, in Adam there was no constraining bias in him toward good or
          evil, and as such Adam differed radically from all his descendants, as
          well as from "the Man Christ Jesus." But with the sinner it is far
          otherwise. The sinner is born with a will that is not in a condition
          of moral equipoise, because in him there is a heart that is "deceitful
          above all things and desperately wicked," and this gives him a bias
          toward evil. So, too, with the Lord Jesus it was far otherwise: He
          also differed radically from unfallen Adam. The Lord Jesus Christ
          could not sin because He was the "Holy One of God." Before He was born
          into this world it was said to Mary, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon
          thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
          also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the
          Son of God" (Luke 1:35). Speaking reverently then we say, that the
          will of the Son of Man was not in a condition of moral equipoise, that
          is, capable of turning toward either good or evil. The will of the
          Lord Jesus was biased toward that which is good because, side by side
          with His sinless, holy, perfect humanity, was His eternal Deity. Now
          in contradistinction from the will of the Lord Jesus which was biased
          toward good, and Adam's will which, before his fall, was in a
          condition of moral equipoise-capable of turning toward either good or
          evil-the sinner's will is biased toward evil, and therefore is free in
          one direction only, namely, in the direction of evil. The sinner's
          will is enslaved because it is in bondage to and is the servant of a
          depraved heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          In what does the sinner's freedom consist? This question is naturally
          suggested by what we have just said above. The sinner is "free" in the
          sense of being unforced from without. God never forces the sinner to
          sin. But the sinner is not free to do either good or evil because an
          evil heart within is ever inclining him toward sin. Let us illustrate
          what we have in mind. I hold in my hand a book. I release it; what
          happens? It falls. In which direction? Downwards; always downwards.
          Why? Because, answering the law of gravity, its own weight sinks it.
          Suppose I desire that book to occupy a position three feet higher;
          then what? I must lift it; a power outside of that book must raise it.
          Such is the relationship which fallen man sustains toward God. Whilst
          Divine power up-holds him he is preserved from plunging still deeper
          into sin; let that power be withdrawn and he falls-his own weight (of
          sin) drags him down. God does not push him down anymore than I did
          that book. Let all Divine restraint be removed and every man is
          capable of becoming, would become, a Cain, a Pharaoh, a Judas. How
          then is the sinner to move heavenward? By an act of his own will? Not
          so. A power outside of himself must grasp hold of him and lift him
          every inch of the way. The sinner is free, but free in one direction
          only-free to fall, free to sin. As the Word expresses it: "For when ye
          were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness" (Rom.
          6:20). The sinner is free to do as he pleases, always as he pleases
          (except as he is restrained by God), but his pleasure is to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the opening paragraph of this chapter we insisted that a proper
          conception of the nature and function of the will is of practical
          importance, nay, that it constitutes a fundamental test of theological
          orthodoxy or doctrinal soundness. We wish to amplify this statement
          and attempt to demonstrate its accuracy. The freedom or bondage of the
          will was the dividing line between Augustinianism and Pelagianism, and
          in more recent times between Calvinism and Arminianism. Reduced to
          simple terms this means that the difference involved was the
          affirmation or denial of the total depravity of man. In taking the
          affirmative we shall now consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. THE IMPOTENCY OF THE HUMAN WILL.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Does it lie within the province of man's will to accept or reject the
          Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour? Granted that the Gospel is preached to
          the sinner, that the Holy Spirit convicts him of his lost condition,
          does it, in the final analysis, He within the power of his own will to
          resist or to yield himself up to God? The answer to this question
          defines our conception of human depravity. That man is a fallen
          creature all professing Christians will allow, but what many of them
          mean by "fallen" is often difficult to determine. The general
          impression seems to be that man is now mortal, that he is no longer in
          the condition in which he left the hands of his Creator, that he is
          liable to disease, that he inherits evil tendencies; but, that if he
          employs his powers to the best of his ability somehow he will be happy
          at last. O, how far short of the sad truth! Infirmities, sickness,
          even corporeal death, are but trifles in comparison with the moral and
          spiritual effects of the Fall! It is only by consulting the Holy
          Scriptures that we are able to obtain some conception of the extent of
          that terrible calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we say that man is totally depraved we mean that the entrance of
          sin into the human constitution has affected every part and faculty of
          man's being. Total depravity means that man is, in spirit and soul and
          body, the slave of sin and the captive of the Devil-walking "according
          to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in
          the children of disobedience" (Eph. 2:2). This statement ought not to
          need arguing: it is a common fact of human experience. Man is unable
          to realize his own aspirations and materialize his own ideals. He
          cannot do the things that he would. There is a moral inability which
          paralyzes him. This is proof positive that he is no free man, but
          instead, the slave of sin and Satan. "Ye are of your father the Devil,
          and the lusts (desires) of your father ye will do" (John 8:44). Sin is
          more than an act or a series of acts; it is a state or condition. It
          is that which lies behind and produces the acts. Sin has penetrated
          and permeated the whole of man's make-up. It has blinded the
          understanding, corrupted the heart, and alienated the mind from God.
          And the will has not escaped. The will is under the dominion of sin
          and Satan. Therefore, the will is not free. In short, the affections
          love as they do and the will chooses as it does because of the state
          of the heart, and because the heart is deceitful above all things and
          desperately wicked "There is none that seeketh after God" (Rom. 3:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          We repeat our question: Does it lie within the power of the sinner's
          will to yield himself up to God? Let us attempt an answer by asking
          several others: Can water (of itself) rise above its own level? Can a
          clean thing come out of an unclean? Can the will reverse the whole
          tendency and strain of human nature? Can that which is under the
          dominion of sin originate that which is pure and holy? Manifestly not.
          If ever the will of a fallen and depraved creature is to move Godward
          a Divine power must be brought to bear upon it which will overcome the
          influences of sin that pull in a counter direction. This is only
          another way of saying, "No man can come to Me, except the Father which
          hath sent Me, draw him (John 6:44). In other words, God's people must
          be made willing in the day of His power (Psa. 110:3). As said Mr.
          Darby, "If Christ came to save that which is lost, free will has no
          place. Not that God prevents men from receiving Christ-far from it.
          But even when God uses all possible inducements, all that is capable
          of exerting influence in the heart of man, it only serves to show that
          man will have none of it, that so corrupt is his heart, and so decided
          his will not to submit to God (however much it may be the devil who
          encourages him to sin) that nothing can induce him to receive the
          Lord, and to give up sin. If by the words, 'freedom of man,' they mean
          that no one forces him to reject the Lord, this liberty fully exists.
          But if it is said that, on account of the dominion of sin, of which he
          is the slave, and that voluntarily, he cannot escape from his
          condition, and make choice of the good-even while acknowledging it to
          be good, and approving of it-then he has no liberty whatever (italics
          ours). He is not subject to the law, neither indeed can be; hence,
          they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The will is not Sovereign; it is a servant because influenced and
          controlled by the other faculties of man's being. The sinner is not a
          free agent because he is a slave of sin-this was clearly implied in
          our Lord's words, "If the Son shall therefore make you free, ye shall
          be free indeed" (John 8:36). Man is a rational being and as such
          responsible and accountable to God, but to affirm that he is a free
          moral agent is to deny that he is totally depraved-i.e., depraved in
          will as in everything else. Because man's will is governed by his mind
          and heart, and because these have been vitiated and corrupted by sin,
          then it follows that if ever man is to turn or move in a Godward
          direction God Himself must work in him "both to will and to do of His
          good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13). Man's boasted freedom is in truth "the
          bondage of corruption"; he "serves divers lusts and pleasures." Said a
          deeply taught servant of God, "Man is impotent as to his will. He has
          no will favorable to God. I believe in free will; but then it is a
          will only free to act according to nature (italics ours). A dove has
          no will to eat carrion; a raven no will to eat the clean food of the
          dove. Put the nature of the dove into the raven and it will eat the
          food of the dove. Satan could have no will for holiness. We speak it
          with reverence, God could have no will for evil. The sinner in his
          sinful nature could never have a will according to God. For this he
          must be born again" (J. Denham Smith). This is just what we have
          contended for throughout this chapter-the will is regulated by the
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the "decrees" of the Council of Trent (1563), which is the
          avowed standard of Popery, we find the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          "If any one shall affirm, that man's free-will, moved and excited by
          God, does not, by consenting, cooperate with God, the mover and
          exciter, so as to prepare and dispose itself for the attainment of
          justification; if moreover, anyone shall say that the human will
          cannot refuse complying, if it pleases; but that it is unactive, and
          merely passive; let such an one be accursed"!
        </p>
        <p>
          "If any one shall affirm, that since the fall of Adam, man's freewill
          is lost and extinguished; or, that it is a thing titular, yea a name,
          without a thing, and a fiction introduced by Satan into the Church;
          let such an one be accursed"!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, those who today insist on the free-will of the natural man
          believe precisely what Rome teaches on the subject! That Roman
          Catholics and Arminians walk hand in hand may be seen from others of
          the decrees issued by the Council of Trent: "If any one shall affirm
          that a regenerate and justified man is bound to believe that he is
          certainly in the number of the elect (which 1 Thess. 1:4, 5 plainly
          teaches.--A.W.P.) let such an one be accursed"! "If any one shall
          affirm with positive and absolute certainty, that he shall surely have
          the gift of perseverance to the end (which John 10:28-30 assuredly
          guarantees, A. W. P.); let him be accursed"!
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for any sinner to be saved three things were indispensable:
          God the Father had to purpose his salvation, God the Son had to
          purchase it, God the Spirit has to apply it. God does more than
          "propose" to us: were He only to "invite," every last one of us would
          be lost. This is strikingly illustrated in the Old Testament. In Ezra
          1:1-3 we read, "Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that
          the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
          LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a
          proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing
          saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, the LORD God of Heaven hath
          given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He hath charged me to
          build Him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among
          you of all His people? his God be with him, and let him go up to
          Jerusalem which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of
          Israel." Here was an "offer" made, made to a people in captivity,
          affording them opportunity to leave and return to Jerusalem-God's
          dwelling-place. Did all Israel eagerly respond to this offer? No
          indeed. The vast majority were content to remain in the enemy's land.
          Only an insignificant "remnant" availed themselves of this overture of
          mercy! And why did they? Hear the answer of Scripture: "Then rose up
          the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and
          the Levites, with all whose spirit God had stirred up, to go up to
          build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem" (Ezra 1:5)! In like
          manner, God "stirs up" the spirits of His elect when the effectual
          call comes to them, and not till then do they have any willingness to
          respond to the Divine proclamation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The superficial work of many of the professional evangelists of the
          last fifty years is largely responsible for the erroneous views now
          current upon the bondage of the natural man, encouraged by the
          laziness of those in the pew in their failure to "prove all things" (1
          Thess. 5:21). The average evangelical pulpit conveys the impression
          that it lies wholly in the power of the sinner whether or not he shall
          be saved. It is said that "God has done His part, now man must do
          his." Alas, what can a lifeless man do, and man by nature is "dead in
          trespasses and sins" (Eph. 2:1)! If this were really believed there
          would be more dependence upon the Holy Spirit to come in with His
          miracle-working power and less confidence in our attempts to "win men
          for Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          When addressing the unsaved, preachers often draw an analogy between
          God's sending of the Gospel to the sinner, and a sick man in bed with
          some healing medicine on a table by his side: all he needs to do is
          reach forth his hand and take it. But in order for this illustration
          to be in any wise true to the picture which Scripture gives us of the
          fallen and depraved sinner, the sick man in bed must be described as
          one who is blind (Eph. 4:18) so that he cannot see the medicine, his
          hand paralyzed (Rom. 5:6) so that he is unable to reach forth for it,
          and his heart not only devoid of all confidence in the medicine but
          filled with hatred against the physician himself (John 15:18). O what
          superficial views of man's desperate plight are now entertained!
          Christ came here not to help those who were willing to help
          themselves, but to do for His people what they were incapable of doing
          for themselves: "To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners
          from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison
          house" (Isa. 42:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in conclusion let us anticipate and dispose of the usual and
          inevitable objection-Why preach the Gospel if man is powerless to
          respond? why did the sinner come to Christ if sin has so enslaved him
          that he has no power in himself to come? Reply: We do not preach the
          Gospel because we believe that men are free moral agents and therefore
          capable of receiving Christ, but we preach it because we are commanded
          to do so (Mark 16:15); and though to them that perish it is
          foolishness yet, "unto us which are saved it is the power of God" (1
          Cor. 1:18). "The foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
          weakness of God is stronger than men" (1 Cor. 1:25). The sinner is
          dead in trespasses and sins (Eph. 2:1), and a dead man is utterly
          incapable of willing anything, hence it is that "they that are in the
          flesh (the unregenerate) cannot please God" (Rom. 8:8).
        </p>
        <p>
          To fleshly wisdom it appears the height of folly to preach the Gospel
          to those that are dead, and therefore beyond the reach of doing
          anything themselves. Yes, but God's ways are different from ours. It
          pleases God "by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
          believe" (1 Cor. 1:21). Man may deem it folly to prophesy to "dead
          bones" and to say unto them, "O ye dry bones, hear the Word of the
          Lord" (Ezek. 37:4). Ah! but then it is the Word of the Lord, and the
          words He speaks "they are spirit, and they are life" (John 6:63). Wise
          men standing by the grave of Lazarus might pronounce it an evidence of
          insanity when the Lord addressed a dead man with the words, "Lazarus,
          Come forth." Ah! but He who thus spake was and is Himself the
          Resurrection and the Life, and at His word even the dead live! We go
          forth to preach the Gospel, then, not because we believe that sinners
          have within themselves the power to receive the Saviour it proclaims
          but because the Gospel itself is the power of God unto salvation to
          everyone that believeth, and because we know that "as many as were
          ordained to eternal life" (Acts 13:48) shall believe (John 6:37;
          10:16-note the "shall's"!) in God's appointed time, for it is written
          "Thy people shall be willing in the day of Thy power" (Psa. 110:3)!
        </p>
        <p>
          What we have set forth in this chapter is not a product of "modern
          thought"; no indeed, it is at direct variance with it. It is those of
          the past few generations who have departed so far from the teachings
          of their scripturally-instructed fathers. In the thirty-nine Articles
          of the Church of England we read, "The condition of man after the fall
          of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself by his own
          natural strength and good works to faith, and calling upon God:
          Wherefore we have no power to do good works, pleasant and acceptable
          to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us (being
          before-hand with us), that we may have a good will, and working with
          us, when we have that good will" (Article 10). In the Westminster
          Catechism of Faith (adopted by the Presbyterians) we read, "The
          sinfulness of that state whereinto man fell, consisteth in the guilt
          of Adam's first sin, the wont of that righteousness wherein he was
          created, and the corruption of his nature, whereby he is utterly
          indisposed, disabled, and made opposite unto all that is spiritually
          good, and wholly inclined to all evil, and that continually" (Answer
          to question 25). So in the Baptists' Philadelphian Confession of
          Faith, 1742, we read, "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath
          wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying
          salvation; so as a natural man, being altogether averse from good, and
          dead in sin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to
          prepare himself thereunto" (Chapter 9).
