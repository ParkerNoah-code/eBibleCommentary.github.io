        <h2>11 - Difficulties And Objections</h2>
        <p>
          "Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of
          Israel; Is not My way equal? are not your ways unequal?" (Ezek.
          18:25).
        </p>
        <p>
          A convenient point has been reached when we may now examine, more
          definitely, some of the difficulties encountered and the objections
          which might be advanced against what we have written in previous
          pages. The author deemed it better to reserve these for a separate
          consideration rather than deal with them as he went along, requiring
          as that would have done the breaking of the course of thought and
          destroying the strict unity of each chapter, or else cumbering our
          pages with numerous and lengthy footnotes.
        </p>
        <p>
          That there are difficulties involved in an attempt to set forth the
          truth of God's Sovereignty is readily acknowledged. The hardest thing
          of all, perhaps, is to maintain the balance of truth. It is largely a
          matter of perspective. That God is Sovereign is explicitly declared in
          Scripture: that man is a responsible creature is also expressly
          affirmed in Holy Writ. To define the relationship of these two truths,
          to fix the dividing line betwixt them, to show exactly where they
          meet, to exhibit the perfect consistency of the one with the other, is
          the weightiest task of all. Many have openly declared that it is
          impossible for the finite mind to harmonize them. Others tell us it is
          not necessary or even wise to attempt it. But, as we have remarked in
          an earlier chapter, it seems to us more honoring to God to seek in His
          Word the solution to every problem. What is impossible to man is
          possible with God, and while we grant that the finite mind is limited
          in its reach, yet, we remember that the Scriptures are given to us
          that the man of God may be "thoroughly furnished," and if we approach
          their study in the spirit of humility and of expectancy, then,
          according unto our faith will it be unto us.
        </p>
        <p>
          As remarked above, the hardest task in this connection is to preserve
          the balance of truth while insisting on both the Sovereignty of God
          and the responsibility of the creature. To some of our readers it may
          appear that in pressing the Sovereignty of God to the lengths we have
          man is reduced to a mere puppet. Hence, to guard against this, they
          would modify their definitions and statements relating to God's
          Sovereignty, and thus seek to blunt the keen edge of what is so
          offensive to the carnal mind. Others, while refusing to weigh the
          evidence that we have adduced in support of our assertions, may raise
          objections which to their minds are sufficient to dispose of the whole
          subject. We would not waste time in the effort to refute objections
          made in a carping and contentious spirit but we are desirous of
          meeting fairly the difficulties experienced by those who are anxious
          to obtain a fuller knowledge of the truth. Not that we deem ourselves
          able to give a satisfactory and final answer to every question that
          might be asked. Like the reader, the writer knows but in part and sees
          through a glass "darkly." All that we can do is to examine these
          difficulties in the light we now have, in dependence upon the Spirit
          of God that we may follow on to know the Lord better.
        </p>
        <p>
          We propose now to retrace our steps and pursue the same order of
          thought as that followed up to this point. As a part of our
          "definition" of God's Sovereignty we affirmed: "To say that God is
          Sovereign is to declare that He is the Almighty, the Possessor of all
          power in Heaven and earth, so that none can defeat His counsels,
          thwart His purpose, or resist His will... The Sovereignty of the God
          of Scripture is absolute, irresistible, infinite." To put it now in
          its strongest form, we insist that God does as He pleases, only as He
          pleases, always as He pleases; that whatever takes place in time is
          but the outworking of that which He decreed in eternity. In proof of
          this assertion we appeal to the following Scripture: "But our God is
          in the heavens: He hath done whatsoever He hath pleased" (Psa. 115:3).
          "For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and
          His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?" (Isa. 14:27).
          "And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and He
          doeth according to His will in the army of Heaven, and among the
          inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay His hand or say unto Him,
          What doest thou?" (Dan. 4:35). "For of Him, and through Him, and to
          Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen" (Rom. 11:36).
        </p>
        <p>
          The above declarations are so plain and positive that any comments of
          ours upon them would simply be darkening counsel by words without
          knowledge. Such express statements as those just quoted are so
          sweeping and so dogmatic that all controversy concerning the subject
          of which they treat ought for ever to be at an end. Yet, rather than
          receive them at their face value, every device of carnal ingenuity is
          resorted to so as to neutralize their force. For example, it has been
          asked, If what we see in the world today is but the outworking of
          God's eternal purpose, if God's counsel is NOW being accomplished,
          then why did our Lord teach His disciples to pray, "Thy will be done
          on earth as it is in Heaven"? Is it not a clear implication from these
          words that God's will is not now being done on earth? The answer is
          very simple. The emphatic word in the above clause is "as." God's will
          is being done on earth today, if it is not, then our earth is not
          subject to God's rule, and if it is not subject to His rule then He is
          not, as Scripture proclaims Him to be, "The Lord of all the earth"
          (Josh. 3:13). But God's will is not being done on earth as it is in
          Heaven. How is God's will "done in Heaven"?-consciously and joyfully.
          How is it "done on earth"? for the most part, unconsciously and
          sullenly. In Heaven the angels perform the bidding of their Creator
          intelligently and gladly, but on earth the unsaved among men
          accomplish His will blindly and in ignorance. As we have said in
          earlier pages, when Judas betrayed the Lord Jesus and when Pilate
          sentenced Him to be crucified they had no conscious intentions of
          fulfilling God's decrees yet, nevertheless, unknown to themselves they
          did do so!
        </p>
        <p>
          But again. It has been objected: If everything that happens on earth
          is the fulfilling of the Almighty's pleasure, if God has
          foreordained-before the foundation of the world-everything which comes
          to pass in human history, then why do we read in Genesis 6:6 "It
          repented the LORD that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved
          Him at His heart"? Does not this language intimate that the
          antediluvians had followed a course which their Maker had not marked
          out for them, and that in view of the fact they had "corrupted" their
          way upon the earth the Lord regretted that He had ever brought such a
          creature into existence? Ere drawing such a conclusion let us note
          what is involved in such an inference. If the words "It repented the
          Lord that He had made man" are regarded in an absolute sense, then
          God's omniscience would be denied, for in such a case the course
          followed by man must have been unforeseen by God in the day that He
          created him. Therefore it must be evident to every reverent soul that
          this language bears some other meaning. We submit that the words "It
          repented the Lord" is an accommodation to our finite intelligence, and
          in saying this we are not seeking to escape a difficulty or cut a
          knot, but are advancing an interpretation which we shall seek to show
          is in perfect accord with the general trend of Scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Word of God is addressed to men, and therefore it speaks the
          language of men. Because we cannot rise to God's level He, in grace,
          comes down to ours and converses with us in our own speech. The
          Apostle Paul tells us of how he was "caught up into Paradise and heard
          unspeakable words which it is not possible (margin) to utter" (2 Cor.
          12:4). Those on earth could not understand the vernacular of Heaven.
          The finite cannot comprehend the Infinite, hence the Almighty deigns
          to couch His revelation in terms we may understand. It is for this
          reason the Bible contains many anthropomorphisms-i.e, representations
          of God in the form of man. God is Spirit, yet the Scriptures speak of
          Him as having eyes, ears, nostrils, breath, hands, etc., which is
          surely an accommodation of terms brought down to the level of human
          comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; we read in Genesis 18:20, 21 "And the LORD said, Because the
          cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very
          grievous, I will go down now, and see whether they have done
          altogether according to the cry of it, which is come up unto Me; and
          if not, I will know." Now, manifestly, this is an anthropologism-God
          speaking in human language. God knew the conditions which prevailed in
          Sodom, and His eyes had witnessed its fearful sins, yet He is pleased
          to use terms here that are taken from our own vocabulary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; in Genesis 22:12 we read "And He (God) said, Lay not thine hand
          upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him: for now I know that
          thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
          son, from Me." Here again, God is speaking in the language of men for
          He "knew" before He tested Abram exactly how the patriarch would act.
          So too the expression of God so often in Jeremiah (7:13 etc.) of Him
          "rising up early" is manifestly an accommodation of terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more: in the parable of the vineyard Christ Himself represents
          its Owner as saying, "Then said the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I
          do? I will send My beloved Son: it may be they will reverence Him when
          they see Him" (Luke 20:13); and yet, it is certain that God knew
          perfectly well that the "husbandman" of the vineyard (the Jews) would
          not "reverence His Son" but, instead, would "despise and reject" Him
          as His own Word had declared!
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same way we understand the words of Genesis 6:6-"It repented
          the LORD that He had made man on the earth"-as an accommodation of
          terms to human comprehension. This verse does not teach that God was
          confronted with an unforeseen contingency and therefore regretted that
          He had made man, but it expresses the abhorrence of a holy God at the
          awful wickedness and corruption into which man had fallen. Should
          there be any doubt remaining in the minds of our readers as to the
          legitimacy and soundness of our interpretation, a direct appeal to
          Scripture should instantly and entirely remove it-"The Strength of
          Israel (a Divine title) will not He nor repent: for He is not a man,
          that He should repent" (1 Sam. 15:29)! "Every good and perfect gift is
          from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with Whom is no
          variableness, neither shadow of turning" (James 1:17)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Careful attention to what we have said above will throw light on
          numerous other passages which, if we ignore their figurative character
          and fail to note that God applies to Himself human modes of
          expression, will be obscure and perplexing. Having commented at such
          length upon Genesis 6:6 there will be no need to give such a detailed
          exposition of other passages which belong to the same class, yet, for
          the benefit of those of our readers who may be anxious for us to
          examine several other Scriptures, we turn to one or two more.
        </p>
        <p>
          One Scripture which we often find cited in order to overthrow the
          teaching advanced in this book is our Lord's lament over Jerusalem: "O
          Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them
          which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
          together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye
          would not!" (Matt. 23:37). The question is asked, Do not these words
          show that the Saviour acknowledged the defeat of His mission, that as
          a people the Jews resisted all His gracious overtures toward them? In
          replying to this question, it should first be pointed out that our
          Lord is here referring not so much to His own mission as He is
          upbraiding the Jews for having in all ages rejected His grace-this is
          clear from His reference to the "prophets." The Old Testament bears
          full witness of how graciously and patiently Jehovah dealt with His
          people, and with what extreme obstinancy, from first to last, they
          refused to be "gathered" unto Him, and how in the end He abandoned
          them to follow their own devices, yet, as the same Scriptures declare,
          the counsel of God was not frustrated by their wickedness, for it had
          been foretold (and therefore, decreed) by Him: see, for example, 1
          Kings 8:33.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthew 23:37 may well be compared with Isaiah 65:2 where the Lord
          says, "I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious
          people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own
          thoughts." But, it may be asked, Did God seek to do that which was in
          opposition to His own eternal purpose? In words borrowed from Calvin
          we reply, "Though to our apprehension the will of God is manifold and
          various, yet He does not in Himself will things at variance with each
          other, but astonishes our faculties with His various and 'manifold'
          wisdom, according to the expression of Paul, till we shall be enabled
          to understand that He mysteriously wills what now seems contrary to
          His will." As a further illustration of the same principle we would
          refer the reader to Isaiah 5:1-4: "Now will I sing to my wellBeloved a
          song of my Beloved touching His vineyard. My wellBeloved hath a
          vineyard in a very fruitful hill: And He fenced it, and gathered out
          the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine and built a
          tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and He
          looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild
          grapes. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
          I pray you, betwixt Me and My vineyard. What could have been done more
          to My vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked
          that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?" Is
          it not plain from this language that God reckoned Himself to have done
          enough for Israel to warrant an expectation-speaking after the manner
          of men-of better returns? Yet, is it not equally evident when Jehovah
          says here "He looked that it should bring forth grapes" that He is
          accommodating Himself to a form of finite expression? And, so also
          when He says "What could have been done more to My vineyard, that I
          have not done in it?" we need to take note that in the previous
          enumeration of what He had done-the "fencing" etc.- He refers only to
          external privileges, means, and opportunities, which had been bestowed
          upon Israel, for, of course, He could even then have taken away from
          them their stony heart and given them a new heart, even a heart of
          flesh, had He so pleased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps we should link up with Christ's lament over Jerusalem in
          Matthew 23:37, His tears over the City, recorded in Luke 19:41: "He
          beheld the city, and wept over it." In the verses which immediately
          follow we learn what it was that occasioned His tears: "Saying, if
          thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
          which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. For
          the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench
          about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side."
          It was the prospect of the fearful judgment which Christ knew was
          impending. But did those tears make manifest a disappointed God? Nay,
          verily. Instead, they displayed a perfect Man. The Man Christ Jesus
          was no emotionless stoic, but One "filled with compassion." Those
          tears expressed the sinless sympathies of His real and pure humanity.
          Had He not "wept" He had been less than human. Those "tears" were one
          of many proofs that "in all things it behooved Him to be made like
          unto His brethren" (Heb. 2:17).
        </p>
        <p>
          In Chapter One we have affirmed that God is Sovereign in the exercise
          of His love, and in saying this we are fully aware that many will
          strongly resent the statement and that, furthermore, what we have now
          to say will probably meet with more criticism than anything else
          advanced in this book. Nevertheless, we must be true to our
          convictions of what we believe to be the teaching of Holy Scripture,
          and we can only ask our readers to examine diligently in the light of
          God's Word what we here submit to their attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most popular beliefs of the day is that God loves
          everybody, and the very fact that it is so popular with all classes
          ought to be enough to arouse the suspicions of those who are subject
          to the Word of Truth. God's Love toward all His creatures is the
          fundamental and favorite tenet of Universalists, Unitarians,
          Theosophists, Christian Scientists, Spiritualists, Russellites, etc.
          No matter how a man may live-in open defiance of Heaven, with no
          concern whatever for his soul's eternal interests, still less for
          God's glory, dying, perhaps with an oath on his lips-notwithstanding,
          God loves him, we are told. So widely has this dogma been proclaimed,
          and so comforting is it to the heart which is at enmity with God we
          have little hope of convincing many of their error. That God loves
          everybody, is, we may say, quite a modern belief. The writings of the
          church fathers, the Reformers or the Puritans will (we believe) be
          searched in vain for any such concept. Perhaps the late D. L.
          Moody-captivated by Drummond's "The Greatest Thing in the World"-did
          more than anyone else in the last century to popularize this concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been customary to say God loves the sinner though He hates his
          sin.* But that is a meaningless distinction. What is there in a sinner
          but sin? Is it not true that his "whole head is sick" and his "whole
          heart faint," and that "from the sole of the foot even unto the head
          there is no soundness" in him? (Isa. 1:5, 6). Is it true that God
          loves the one who is despising and rejecting His blessed Son? God is
          Light as well as Love, and therefore His love must be a holy love. To
          tell the Christ-rejecter that God loves him is to cauterize his
          conscience as well as to afford him a sense of security in his sins.
          The fact is, the love of God is a truth for the saints only, and to
          present it to the enemies of God is to take the children's bread and
          cast it to the dogs. With the exception of John 3:16, not once in the
          four Gospels do we read of the Lord Jesus, the perfect Teacher,
          telling sinners that God loved them! In the book of Acts, which
          records the evangelistic labors and messages of the Apostles, God's
          love is never referred to at all! But when we come to the Epistles,
          which are addressed to the saints, we have a full presentation of this
          precious truth-God's love for His own. Let us seek to rightly divide
          the Word of God and then we shall not be found taking truths which are
          addressed to believers and mis-applying them to unbelievers. That
          which sinners need to have brought before them is the ineffable
          holiness, the exacting righteousness, the inflexible justice and the
          terrible wrath of God. Risking the danger of being misunderstood let
          us say-and we wish we could say it to every evangelist and preacher in
          the country-there is far too much presenting of Christ to sinners
          today (by those sound in the faith), and far too little showing
          sinners their need of Christ, i.e., their absolutely ruined and lost
          condition, their imminent and awful danger of suffering the wrath to
          come, the fearful guilt resting upon them in the sight of God: to
          present Christ to those who have never been shown their need of Him,
          seems to us to be guilty of casting pearls before swine.*

        <p>
          *Romans 5:8 is addressed to saints, and the "we" are the same ones as
          those spoken of in 8:29, 30.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Concerning the rich young ruler of whom it is said Christ "loved him"
          (Mark 10:21), we fully believe that he was one of God's elect, and was
          "saved" sometime after his interview with our Lord. Should it be said
          this is an arbitrary assumption and assertion which lacks anything in
          the Gospel record to substantiate it, we reply, It is written, "Him
          that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out," and this man certainly
          did "come" to Him. Compare the case of Nicodemus. He, too, came to
          Christ, yet there is nothing in John 3 which intimates he was a saved
          man when the interview closed; nevertheless, we know from his later
          life that he was not "cast out."
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be true that God loves every member of the human family then why
          did our Lord tell His disciples "He that hath My commandments, and
          keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be
          loved of My Father... If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My
          Father will love him" (John 14:21, 23)? Why say "he that loveth Me
          shall be loved of My Father" if the Father loves everybody? The same
          limitation is found in Proverbs 8:17: "I love them that love Me."
          Again; we read, "Thou hatest all workers of iniquity"-not merely the
          works of iniquity. Here then is a flat repudiation of present teaching
          that, God hates sin but loves the sinner; Scripture says, "Thou hatest
          all workers of iniquity" (Psa. 5:5)! "God is angry with the wicked
          every day" (Psa. 7:11). "He that believeth not on the Son shall not
          see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him"-not "shall abide," but
          even now-"abideth on him" (John 3:36). Can God "love" the one on whom
          His "wrath" abides? Again; is it not evident that the words "The love
          of God which is in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:39) marks a limitation, both
          in the sphere and objects of His love? Again; is it not plain from the
          words "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" (Rom. 9:13) that God
          does not love everybody? Again; it is written, "For whom the Lord
          loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth" (Heb.
          12:6). Does not this verse teach that God's love is restricted to the
          members of His own family? If He loves all men without exception then
          the distinction and limitation here mentioned is quite meaningless.
          Finally, we would ask, Is it conceivable that God will love the damned
          in the Lake of Fire? Yet, if He loves them now He will do so then,
          seeing that His love knows no change-He is "without variableness or
          shadow of turning"!
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning now to John 3:16, it should be evident from the passages just
          quoted that this verse will not bear the construction usually put upon
          it. "God so loved the world." Many suppose that this means, The entire
          human race. But "the entire human race" includes all mankind from Adam
          till the close of earth's history: it reaches backward as well as
          forward! Consider, then, the history of mankind before Christ was
          born. Unnumbered millions lived and died before the Saviour came to
          the earth, lived here "having no hope and without God in the world,"
          and therefore passed out into an eternity of woe. If God "loved" them,
          where is the slightest proof thereof? Scripture declares "Who (God) in
          times past (from the tower of Babel till after Pentecost) suffered all
          nations to walk in their own ways" (Acts 14:16). Scripture declares
          that "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
          God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are
          not convenient" (Rom. 1:28). To Israel God said, "You only have I
          known of all the families of the earth" (Amos 3:2). In view of these
          plain passages who will be so foolish as to insist that God in the
          past loved all mankind! The same applies with equal force to the
          future. Read through the book of Revelation, noting especially
          chapters 8 to 19, where we have described the judgments which will be
          poured out from Heaven on this earth. Read of the fearful woes, the
          frightful plagues, the vials of God's wrath, which shall be emptied on
          the wicked. Finally, read the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, the
          great white throne judgment, and see if you can discover there the
          slightest trace of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the objector comes back to John 3:16 and says, "World means
          world." True, but we have shown that "the world" does not mean the
          whole human family. The fact is that "the world" is used in a general
          way. When the brethren of Christ said "Show Thyself to the world"
          (John 7:4), did they mean "shew Thyself to all mankind"? When the
          Pharisees said "Behold, the world is gone after Him" (John 12:19) did
          they mean that "all the human family" were flocking after Him? When
          the Apostle wrote "Your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world"
          (Rom. 1:8), did he mean that the faith of the saints at Rome was the
          subject of conversation by every man, woman, and child on earth? When
          Revelation 13:3 informs us that "all the world wondered after the
          beast," are we to understand that there will be no exceptions? These,
          and other passages which might be quoted, show that the term "the
          world" often has a relative rather than an absolute force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the first thing to note in connection with John 3:16 is that our
          Lord was there speaking to Nicodemus, a man who believed that God's
          mercies were confined to his own nation. Christ there announced that
          God's love in giving His Son had a larger object in view, that it
          flowed beyond the boundary of Palestine, reaching out to "regions
          beyond." In other words, this was Christ's announcement that God had a
          purpose of grace toward Gentiles as well as Jews. "God so loved the
          world," then, signifies, God's love is international in its scope. But
          does this mean that God loves every individual among the Gentiles? Not
          necessarily, for as we have seen, the term "world" is general rather
          than specific, relative rather than absolute. The term "world" in
          itself is not conclusive. To ascertain who are the objects of God's
          love other passages where His love is mentioned must be consulted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2 Peter 2:5 we read of "the world of the ungodly." If then, there
          is a world of the ungodly there must also be a world of the godly. It
          is the latter who are in view in the passages we shall now briefly
          consider. "For the bread of God is He which cometh down from Heaven,
          and giveth life unto the world" (John 6:33). Now mark it well, Christ
          did not say, "offereth life unto the world," but "giveth." What is the
          difference between the two terms? This: a thing which is "offered" may
          be refused, but a thing "given," necessarily implies its acceptance.
          If it is not accepted it is not "given," it is simply proffered. Here,
          then, is a Scripture that positively states Christ giveth life
          (spiritual, eternal life) "unto the world." Now He does not give
          eternal life to the "world of the ungodly" for they will not have it,
          they do not want it. Hence, we are obliged to understand the reference
          in John 6:33 as being to "the world of the godly," i.e., God's own
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more: in 2 Corinthians 5:19 we read "To wit that God was in
          Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself." What is meant by this is
          clearly defined in the words immediately following, "not imputing
          their trespasses unto them." Here again "the world" cannot mean "the
          world of the ungodly," for their "trespasses are imputed" to them, as
          the judgment of the Great White Throne will yet show. But 2
          Corinthians 5:19 plainly teaches there is a "world" which are
          "reconciled," reconciled unto God because their trespasses are not
          reckoned to their account, having been borne by their Substitute. Who
          then are they? Only one answer is fairly possible-the world of God's
          people!
        </p>
        <p>
          In like manner, the "world" in John 3:16 must, in the final analysis,
          refer to the world of God's people. Must we say, for there is no other
          alternative solution. It cannot mean the whole human race, for one
          half of the race was already in hell when Christ came to earth. It is
          unfair to insist that it means every human being now living, for every
          other passage in the New Testament where God's love is mentioned
          limits it to His own people-search and see! The objects of God's love
          in John 3:16 are precisely the same as the objects of Christ's love in
          John 13:1: "Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that
          His hour was come, that He should depart out of this world unto the
          Father, having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them
          unto the end." We may admit that our interpretation of John 3:16 is no
          novel one invented by us, but one almost uniformly given by the
          Reformers and Puritans, and many others since then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming now to Chapter Three, The Sovereignty of God in Salvation,
          innumerable are the questions which might be raised here. It is
          strange, yet it is true, that many who acknowledge the Sovereign rule
          of God over material things will cavil and quibble when we insist that
          God is also Sovereign in the spiritual realm. But their quarrel is
          with God and not with us. We have given Scripture in support of
          everything advanced in these pages, and if that will not satisfy our
          readers it is idle for us to seek to convince them. What we write now
          is designed for those who do bow to the authority of Holy Writ, and
          for their benefit we propose to examine several other Scriptures which
          have purposely been held for this chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the one passage which has presented the greatest difficulty to
          those who have seen that passage after passage in Holy Writ plainly
          teaches the election of a limited number unto salvation is 2 Peter
          3:9: "not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
          repentance."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to be said upon the above passage is that, like all
          other Scripture, it must be understood and interpreted in the light of
          its context. What we have quoted in the preceding paragraph is only
          part of the verse, and the last part if it at that! Surely it must be
          allowed by all that the first half of the verse needs to be taken into
          consideration. In order to establish what these words are supposed by
          many to mean, viz., that the words "any" and "all" are to be received
          without any qualification, it must be shown that the context is
          referring to the whole human race! If this cannot be shown, if there
          is no premise to justify this, then the conclusion also must be
          unwarranted. Let us then ponder the first part of the verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise." Note "promise" in the
          singular number, not "promises." What promise is in view? The promise
          of salvation? Where, in all Scripture, has God ever promised to save
          the whole human race! Where indeed? No, the "promise" here referred to
          is not about salvation. What then is it? The context tells us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,
          walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His
          coming?" (vv. 3, 4). The context then refers to God's promise to send
          back His beloved Son. But many long centuries have passed and this
          promise has not yet been fulfilled. True, but long as the delay may
          seem to us, the interval is short in the reckoning of God. As the
          proof of this we are reminded "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this
          one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
          thousand years as one day" (v. 8). In God's reckoning of time less
          than two days have yet passed since He promised to send back Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But more, the delay in the Father sending back His beloved Son is not
          only due to no "slackness" on His part, but it is also occasioned by
          His "longsuffering." His longsuffering to whom? The verse we are now
          considering tells us: "but His longsuffering to usward." And whom are
          the "us-ward"?-the human race, or God's own people? In the light of
          the context this is not an open question upon which each of us is free
          to form an opinion. The Holy Spirit has defined it. The opening verse
          of the chapter says, "This second Epistle, beloved, I now write unto
          you." And again, the verse immediately preceding declares, "But,
          beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing etc.," (v. 8). The
          "us-ward" then are the "beloved" of God. They to whom this Epistle is
          addressed are "them that have obtained (not "exercised," but
          "obtained" as God's Sovereign gift) like precious faith with us
          through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" (2
          Peter 1:1). Therefore we say there is no room for a doubt, a quibble
          or an argument-the "us-ward" are the elect of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now quote the verse as a whole: "The Lord is not slack
          concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is
          longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
          all should come to repentance." Could anything be clearer? The "any"
          that God is not willing should perish are the "us-ward" to whom God is
          "longsuffering," the "beloved" of the previous verses. 2 Peter 3:9
          means, then, that God will not send back His Son until "the fullness
          of the Gentiles be come in" (Rom. 11:25). God will not send hack
          Christ till that "people" whom He is now "taking out of the Gentiles"
          (Acts 15:14) are gathered in. God will not send back His Son till the
          Body of Christ is complete, and that will not be till the ones whom He
          has elected to be saved in this dispensation shall have been brought
          to Him. Thank God for His "longsuffering to us-ward." Had Christ come
          back twenty years ago the writer had been left behind to perish in His
          sins. But that could not be so God graciously delayed the Second
          Coming. For the same reason He is still delaying His Advent. His
          decreed purpose is that all His elect will come to repentance, and
          repent they shall. The present interval of grace will not end until
          the last of the "other sheep" of John 10:16 are safely folded-then
          will Christ return.
        </p>
        <p>
          In expounding the Sovereignty of God the Spirit in Salvation we have
          shown that His power is irresistible, that, by His gracious operations
          upon and within them He "compels" God's elect to come to Christ. The
          Sovereignty of the Holy Spirit is set forth not only in John 3:8 where
          we are told "The wind bloweth where it pleaseth... so is every one
          that is born of the Spirit," but is affirmed in other passages as
          well. In 1 Corinthians 12:11 we read "But all these worketh that one
          and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will."
          And again; we read in Acts 16:6, 7 "Now when they had gone throughout
          Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy
          Spirit to preach the Word in Asia. After they were come to Mysia, they
          assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suf ered them not." Thus
          we see how the Holy Spirit interposed His imperial will in opposition
          to the determination of the Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, it is objected against the assertion that the will and power of
          the Holy Spirit are irresistible that here are two passages, one in
          the Old Testament and the other in the New, which appear to militate
          against such a conclusion. God said of old "My Spirit shall not always
          strive with man" (Gen. 6:3), and to the Jews Stephen declared "Ye
          stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist
          the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets
          have not your fathers persecuted?" (Acts 7:51, 52). If then the Jews
          "resisted" the Holy Spirit how can we say His power is irresistible?
          The answer is found in Nehemiah 9:30 "Many years didst Thou forbear
          them, and testifiedest against them by Thy Spirit in Thy prophets: yet
          would they not give ear." It was the external operations of the Spirit
          which Israel "resisted." It was the Spirit speaking by and through the
          prophets to which they "would not give ear." It was not anything which
          the Holy Spirit wrought in them that they "resisted" but the motives
          presented to them by the inspired messages of the prophets. Perhaps it
          will help the reader to catch our thought better if we compare Matthew
          11:20-24 "Then began He to upbraid the cities wherein most of His
          mighty works were done, because they repented not. Woe unto thee
          Chorazin," etc. Our Lord here pronounces woe upon these cities for
          their failure to repent because of the "mighty works" (miracles) which
          He had done in their sight, and not because of any internal operations
          of His grace! The same is true of Genesis 6:3. By comparing 1 Peter
          3:18-20 it will be seen that it was by and through Noah that God's
          Spirit "strove" with the antediluvians. The distinction noted above
          was ably summarized by Andrew Fuller (another writer long deceased
          from whom our moderns might learn much) thus: "There are two kinds of
          influences by which God works on the minds of men. First, That which
          is common, and which is effected by the ordinary use of motives
          presented to the mind for consideration: Secondly, That which is
          special and supernatural. The one contains nothing mysterious, anymore
          than the influence of our words and actions on each other; the other
          is such a mystery that we know nothing of it but by its effects-The
          former ought to be effectual; the latter is so." The work of the Holy
          Spirit upon or towards men is always "resisted" by them; His work
          within is always successful. What saith the Scriptures? This: "He
          which hath begun a good work IN you," will finish it (Phil. 1:6).
        </p>
        <p>
          The next question to be considered is: Why preach the Gospel to every
          creature? If God the Father has predestined only a limited number to
          be saved, if God the Son died to effect the salvation of only those
          given to Him by the Father, and if God the Spirit is seeking to
          quicken none save God's elect, then what is the use of giving the
          Gospel to the world at large, and where is the propriety of telling
          sinners that "Whosoever believeth in Christ shall not perish but have
          everlasting life"?
        </p>
        <p>
          First; it is of great importance that we should be clear upon the
          nature of the Gospel itself. The Gospel is God's good news concerning
          Christ and not concerning sinners: "Paul a servant of Jesus Christ,
          called to be an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God...
          concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 1:1, 3).
        </p>

          God would have proclaimed far and wide the amazing fact that His own
          blessed Son "became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross"
          (Phil. 2:8). A universal testimony must be borne to the matchless
          worth of the Person and work of Christ. Note the word witness in
          Matthew 24:14. The Gospel is God's "witness" unto the perfections of
          His Son. Mark the words of the Apostle: "For we are unto God a sweet
          savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish" (2
          Cor. 2:15)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the character and contents of the Gospel the utmost
          confusion prevails today. The Gospel is not an "offer" to be bandied
          around by evangelical peddlers. The Gospel is no mere invitation but a
          proclamation, a proclamation concerning Christ; true whether men
          believe it or not. No man is asked to believe that Christ died for him
          in particular. The Gospel, in brief, is this: Christ died for sinners,
          you are a sinner, believe in Christ, and you shall be saved. In the
          Gospel God simply announces the terms upon which men may be saved
          (namely, repentance and faith) and, indiscriminately, all are
          commanded to fulfill them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, repentance and remission of sins are to be preached in the
          name of the Lord Jesus "among all the nations" (Luke 24:47), because
          God's elect are "scattered abroad" (John 11:52) among all nations, and
          it is by the preaching and hearing of the Gospel that they are called
          out of the world. The Gospel is the means which God uses in the saving
          of His own chosen ones. By nature God's elect are children of wrath
          "even as others"; they are lost sinners needing a Saviour, and apart
          from Christ there is no salvation for them. Hence, the Gospel must be
          believed by them before they can rejoice in the knowledge of sins
          forgiven. The Gospel is God's winnowing fan: it separates the chaff
          from the wheat, and gathers the latter into His garner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third; it is to be noted that God has other purposes in the preaching
          of the Gospel than the salvation of His own elect. The world exists
          for the elect's sake yet others have the benefit of it. So the Word is
          preached for the elect's sake yet others have the benefit of an
          external call. The sun shines though blind men see it not. The rain
          falls upon rocky mountains and waste deserts as well as on the
          fruitful valleys; so also, God suffers the Gospel to fall on the ears
          of the non-elect. The power of the Gospel is one of God's agencies for
          holding in check the wickedness of the world. Many who are never saved
          by it are reformed, their lusts are bridled, and they are restrained
          from becoming worse. Moreover, the preaching of the Gospel to the
          non-elect is made an admirable test of their characters. It exhibits
          the inveteracy of their sin: it demonstrates that their hearts are at
          enmity against God: it justifies the declaration of Christ that "men
          loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil" (John
          3:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally; it is sufficient for us to know that we are bidden to preach
          the Gospel to every creature. It is not for us to reason about the
          consistency between this and the fact that "few are chosen." It is for
          us to obey. It is a simple matter to ask questions relating to the
          ways of God which no finite mind can fully fathom. We, too, might turn
          and remind the objector that our Lord declared "Verily I say unto you,
          All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies
          wherewith soever they shall blaspheme. But he that shall blaspheme
          against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness" (Mark 3:28, 29), and
          there can be no doubt whatever but that certain of the Jews were
          guilty of this very sin (see Matt. 12:24, etc.) and hence their
          destruction was inevitable. Yet, notwithstanding, scarcely two months
          later, He commanded His disciples to preach the Gospel to every
          creature. When the objector can show us the consistency of these two
          things-the fact that certain of the Jews had committed the sin for
          which there is never forgiveness, and the fact that to them the Gospel
          was to be preached-we will undertake to furnish a more satisfactory
          solution than the one given above to the harmony between an universal
          proclamation of the Gospel and a limitation of its saving power to
          those only that God has predestined to be conformed to the image of
          His Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, we say, it is not for us to reason about the Gospel; it is
          our business to preach it. When God ordered Abraham to offer up his
          son as a burnt-offering he might have objected that this command was
          inconsistent with His promise "In Isaac shall thy seed be called." But
          instead of arguing he obeyed, and left God to harmonize His promise
          and His precept. Jeremiah might have argued that God had bade him to
          do that which was altogether unreasonable when He said "Therefore thou
          shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to
          thee; thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee"
          (Jer. 7:27), but instead, the prophet obeyed. Ezekiel, too, might have
          complained that the Lord was asking of him a hard thing when He said
          "Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with My
          words unto them. For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech
          and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; Not to many
          people of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou
          canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have
          hearkened unto thee. But the house of Israel will not hearken unto
          thee; for they will not hearken unto Me; for all the house of Israel
          are impudent and hard hearted" (Ezek. 3:4-7).

          "But, O my soul, if truth so bright<br />
          Should dazzle and confound thy sight,<br />
          Yet still His written Word obey,<br />
          And wait the great decisive day."-Watts.

          It has been well said, "The Gospel has lost none of its ancient power.
          It is, as much today as when it was first preached, 'the power of God
          unto salvation.' It needs no pity, no help, and no handmaid. It can
          overcome all obstacles, and break down all barriers. No human device
          need be tried to prepare the sinner to receive it, for if God has sent
          it no power can hinder it; and if He has not sent it, no power can
          make it effectual" (Dr. Bullinger).

          This chapter might be extended indefinitely, but it is already too
          long so a word or two more must suffice. A number of other questions
          will be dealt with in the pages yet to follow, and those that we fail
          to touch upon the reader must take to the Lord Himself who has said
          "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
          liberally, and upbraideth not" (James 1:5).
