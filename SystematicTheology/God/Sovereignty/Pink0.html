        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God, or the Devil? That
          God reigns supreme in Heaven is generally conceded; that He does so
          over this world, is almost universally denied-if not directly, then
          indirectly. More and more are men in their philosophizing and
          theorizing relegating God to the background. Take the material realm.
          Not only is it denied that God created everything by personal and
          direct action, but few believe that He has any immediate concern in
          regulating the works of His own hands. Everything is supposed to be
          ordered according to the (impersonal and abstract) "laws of Nature."
          Thus is the Creator banished from His own creation. Therefore we need
          not be surprised that men, in their degrading conceptions, exclude Him
          from the realm of human affairs. Throughout Christendom, with an
          almost negligible exception, the theory is held that man is "a free
          agent," and therefore, lord of his fortunes and the determiner of his
          destiny. That Satan is to be blamed for much of the evil which is in
          the world is freely affirmed by those who, though having so much to
          say about "the responsibility of man," often deny their own
          responsibility, by attributing to the Devil what, in fact, proceeds
          from their own evil hearts (Mark 7:21-23).
        </p>
        <p>
          But who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God, or the Devil?
          Attempt to take a serious and comprehensive view of the world. What a
          scene of confusion and chaos confronts us on every side! Sin is
          rampant; lawlessness abounds; evil men and seducers are waxing "worse
          and worse" (2 Tim. 3:13). Today, everything appears to be out of
          joint. Thrones are creaking and tottering, ancient dynasties are being
          overturned, democracies are revolting, civilization is a demonstrated
          failure; half of Christendom was but recently locked-together in a
          death grapple; and now that the titantic conflict is over, instead of
          the world having been made "safe for democracy," we have discovered
          that democracy is very unsafe for the world. Unrest, discontent, and
          lawlessness are rife everywhere, and none can say how soon another
          great war will be set in motion. Statesmen are perplexed and
          staggered. Men's hearts are "failing them for fear, and for looking
          after those things which are coming on the earth" (Luke 21:26). Do
          these things look as though God had full control?
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us confine our attention to the religious realm. After
          nineteen centuries of Gospel preaching, Christ is still "despised and
          rejected of men." Worse still, He (the Christ of Scripture) is
          proclaimed and magnified by very few. In the majority of modern
          pulpits He is dishonored and disowned. Despite frantic efforts to
          attract the crowds, the majority of the churches are being emptied
          rather than filled. And what of the great masses of non-church goers?
          In the light of Scripture we are compelled to believe that the "many"
          are on the Broad Road that leadeth to destruction, and that only "few"
          are on the Narrow Way that leadeth unto life. Many are declaring that
          Christianity is a failure, and despair is settling on many faces. Not
          a few of the Lord's own people are bewildered, and their faith is
          being severely tried. And what of God? Does He see and hear? Is He
          impotent or indifferent? A number of those who are regarded as leaders
          of Christian-thought told us that God could not help the coming of the
          late awful War, and that He was unable to bring about its termination.
          It was said, and said openly, that conditions were beyond God's
          control. Do these things look as though God were ruling the world?
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God, or the Devil? What
          impression is made upon the minds of those men of the world who,
          occasionally, attend a Gospel service? What are the conceptions formed
          by those who hear even those preachers who are counted as "orthodox?"
          Is it not that a disappointed God is the One whom Christians believe
          in? From what is heard from the average evangelist today, is not any
          serious hearer obliged to conclude that he professes to represent a
          God who is filled with benevolent intentions, yet unable to carry them
          out; that He is earnestly desirous of blessing men, but that they will
          not let Him? Then, must not the average hearer draw the inference that
          the Devil has gained the upper hand, and that God is to be pitied
          rather than blamed?
        </p>
        <p>
          But does not everything seem to show that the Devil has far more to do
          with the affairs of earth than God has? Ah, it all depends upon
          whether we are walking by faith, or walking by sight. Are your
          thoughts, my reader, concerning this world and God's relation to it,
          based upon what you see? Face this question seriously and honestly.
          And if you are a Christian you will, most probably, have cause to bow
          your head with shame and sorrow, and to acknowledge that it is so.
          Alas, in reality, we walk very little "by faith." But what does
          "walking by faith" signify? It means that our thoughts are formed, our
          actions regulated, our lives molded by the Holy Scriptures, for,
          "faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God" (Rom.
          10:17). It is from the Word of Truth, and that alone, that we can
          learn what is God's relation to this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God or the Devil? What
          saith the Scriptures? Ere we consider the direct reply to this query,
          let it be said that the Scriptures predicted just what we now see and
          hear. The prophecy of Jude is in course of fulfillment. It would lead
          us too far astray from our present inquiry to fully amplify this
          assertion, but what we have particularly in mind is a sentence in
          verse 8-"Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
          dominion and speak evil of dignities." Yes, they "speak evil" of the
          Supreme Dignity, the "Only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of
          lords." Ours is peculiarly an age of irreverence, and as the
          consequence, the spirit of lawlessness, which brooks no restraint and
          which is desirous of casting off everything which interferes with the
          free course of self-will, is rapidly engulfing the earth like some
          giant tidal wave. The members of the rising generation are the most
          flagrant offenders, and in the decay and disappearing of parental
          authority we have the certain precursor of the abolition of civic
          authority. Therefore, in view of the growing disrespect for human law
          and the refusal to "render honor to whom honor is due," we need not be
          surprised that the recognition of the majesty, the authority, the
          Sovereignty of the Almighty law-giver should recede more and more into
          the background, and the masses have less and less patience with those
          who insist upon them. And conditions will not improve; instead, the
          more sure Word of Prophecy makes known to us that they will grow worse
          and worse. Nor do we expect to be able to stem the tide-it has already
          risen much too high for that. All we can now hope to do is warn our
          fellow-saints against the spirit of the age, and thus seek to
          counteract its baneful influence upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is regulating affairs on this earth today-God, or the Devil? What
          saith the Scriptures? If we believe their plain and positive
          declarations, no room is left for uncertainty. They affirm, again and
          again, that God is on the throne of the universe; that the sceptre is
          in His hands; that He is directing all things "after the counsel of
          His own will." They affirm, not only that God created all things, but
          also that God is ruling and reigning over all the works of His hands.
          They affirm that God is the "Almighty," that His will is irreversible,
          that He is absolute Sovereign in every realm of all His vast
          dominions. And surely it must be so. Only two alternatives are
          possible: God must either rule, or be ruled; sway, or be swayed;
          accomplish His own will, or be thwarted by His creatures. Accepting
          the fact that He is the "Most High," the only Potentate and King of
          kings, vested with perfect wisdom and illimitable power, and the
          conclusion is irresistible that He must be God in fact as well as in
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in view of what we have briefly referred to above that we say,
          Present-day conditions call loudly for a new examination and new
          presentation of God's omnipotency, God's sufficiency, God's
          Sovereignty. From every pulpit in the land it needs to be thundered
          forth that God still lives, that God still observes, that God still
          reigns. Faith is now in the crucible, it is being tested by fire, and
          there is no fixed and sufficient resting-place for the heart and mind
          but in the Throne of God. What is needed now, as never before, is a
          full, positive, constructive setting forth of the Godhood of God.
          Drastic diseases call for drastic remedies. People are weary of
          platitudes and mere generalizations-the call is for something definite
          and specific. Soothing-syrup may serve for peevish children, but an
          iron tonic is better suited for adults, and we know of nothing which
          is more calculated to infuse spiritual vigor into our frames than a
          scriptural apprehension of the full character of God. It is written,
          "The people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits"
          (Dan. 11:32).
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a doubt a world-crisis is at hand, and everywhere men are
          alarmed. But God is not! He is never taken by surprise. It is no
          unexpected emergency which now confronts Him, for He is the One who
          "worketh all things after the counsel of His own will" (Eph. 1:11).
          Hence, though the world is panic-stricken, the word to the believer
          is, "Fear not!" "All things" are subject to His immediate control:
          "all things" are moving in accord with His eternal purpose, and
          therefore "all things" are "working together for good to them that
          love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose." It
          must be so, for "of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things"
          (Rom. 11:36). Yet how little is this realized today even by the people
          of God! Many suppose that He is little more than a fardistant
          Spectator, taking no immediate hand in the affairs of earth. It is
          true that man is endowed with power, but God is allpowerful. It is
          true that, speaking generally, the material world is regulated by law,
          but behind that law is the law-Giver and law-Administrator. Man is but
          the creature. God is the Creator, and endless ages before man first
          saw the light "the mighty God" (Isa. 9:6) existed, and ere the world
          was founded, made His plans; and being infinite in power and man only
          finite, His purpose and plan cannot be withstood or thwarted by the
          creatures of His own hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          We readily acknowledge that life is a profound problem, and that we
          are surrounded by mystery on every side; but we are not like the
          beasts of the field-ignorant of their origin, and unconscious of what
          is before them. No: "We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy," of
          which it is said ye do well that ye "take heed, as unto a light that
          shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in
          your hearts" (2 Peter 1:19). And it is to this Word of Prophecy we
          indeed do well to "take heed," to that Word which had not its origin
          in the mind of man but in the Mind of God, for, "the prophecy came not
          at any time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake moved by the
          Holy Spirit." We say again, it is to this "Word" we do well to take
          heed. As we turn to this Word and are instructed thereout, we discover
          a fundamental principle which must be applied to every problem:
          Instead of beginning with man and his world and working back to God,
          we must begin with God and work down to man-"In the beginning God!"
          Apply this principle to the present situation. Begin with the world as
          it is today and try and work back to God, and everything will seem to
          show that God has no connection with the world at all. But begin with
          God and work down to the world, and light, much light, is cast on the
          problem. Because God is holy His anger burns against sin; because God
          is righteous His judgments fall upon those who rebel against Him;
          because God is faithful the solemn threatenings of His Word are
          fulfilled; because God is omnipotent none can successfully resist Him,
          still less overthrow His counsel; and because God is omniscient no
          problem can master Him and no difficulty baffle His wisdom. It is just
          because God is who He is and what He is that we are now beholding on
          earth what we do-the beginning of His outpoured judgments: in view of
          His inflexible justice and immaculate holiness we could not expect
          anything other than what is now spread before our eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let it be said very emphatically that the heart can only rest upon
          and enjoy the blessed truth of the absolute Sovereignty of God as
          faith is in exercise. Faith is ever occupied with God. That is the
          character of it; that is what differentiates it from intellectual
          theology. Faith endures "as seeing Him who is invisible" (Heb. 11:27):
          endures the disappointments, the hardships, and the heartaches of life
          by recognizing that all comes from the hand of Him who is too wise to
          err and too loving to be unkind. But so long as we are occupied with
          any other object than God Himself there will be neither rest for the
          heart nor peace for the mind. But when we receive all that enters our
          lives as from His hand, then, no matter what may be our circumstances
          or surroundings-whether in a hovel, a prison-dungeon, or a martyr's
          stake-we shall be enabled to say, "The lines are fallen unto me in
          pleasant places" (Psa. 16:6). But that is the language of faith, not
          of sight or of sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if instead of bowing to the testimony of Holy Writ, if instead of
          walking by faith, we follow the evidence of our eyes, and reason
          therefrom, we shall fall into a quagmire of virtual atheism. Or, if we
          are regulated by the opinions and views of others, peace will be at an
          end. Granted that there is much in this world of sin and suffering
          which appalls and saddens us; granted that there is much in the
          providential dealings of God which startle and stagger us; that is no
          reason why we should unite with the unbelieving worldling who says,
          "If I were God, I would not allow this or tolerate that," etc. Better
          far, in the presence of bewildering mystery, to say with one of old,
          "I was dumb, I opened not my mouth: because Thou didst it" (Psa.
          39:9). Scripture tells us that God's judgments are "unsearchable," and
          His ways "past finding out" (Rom. 11:33). It must be so if faith is to
          be tested, confidence in His wisdom and righteousness strengthened,
          and submission to His holy will fostered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the fundamental difference between the man of faith and the
          man of unbelief. The unbeliever is "of the world," judges everything
          by worldly standards, views life from the standpoint of time and
          sense, and weighs everything in the balances of his own carnal making.
          But the man of faith brings in God, looks at everything from His
          standpoint, estimates values by spiritual standards, and views life in
          the light of eternity. Doing this, he receives whatever comes as from
          the hand of God. Doing this, his heart is calm in the midst of the
          storm. Doing this, he "rejoices in hope of the glory of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          In these opening paragraphs we have indicated the lines of thought
          followed out in this book. Our first postulate is, that because God is
          God He does as He pleases, only as He pleases, always as He pleases;
          that His great concern is the accomplishment of His own pleasure and
          the promotion of His own glory; that He is the Supreme Being, and
          therefore Sovereign of the universe. Starting with this postulate we
          have contemplated the exercise of God's Sovereignty, first in
          Creation, second in Governmental Administration over the works of His
          hands, third in the Salvation of His own elect, fourth in the
          Reprobation of the wicked, and fifth in Operation upon and within men.
          Next we have viewed the Sovereignty of God as it relates to the human
          Will in particular and human Responsibility in general, and have
          sought to show what is the only becoming attitude for the creature to
          take in view of the majesty of the Creator. A separate chapter has
          been set apart for a consideration of some of the difficulties which
          are involved, and to answering the questions which are likely to be
          raised in the minds of our readers; while one chapter has been devoted
          to a more careful yet brief examination of God's Sovereignty in
          relation to prayer. Finally, we have sought to show that the
          Sovereignty of God is a truth revealed to us in Scripture for the
          comfort of our hearts, the strengthening of our souls, and the
          blessing of our lives. A due apprehension of God's Sovereignty
          promotes the spirit of worship, provides an incentive to practical
          godliness, and inspires zeal in service. It is deeply humbling to the
          human heart, but in proportion to the degree that it brings man into
          the dust before his Maker, to that extent is God glorified.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are well aware that what we have written is in open opposition to
          much of the teaching that is current both in religious literature and
          in the representative pulpits of the land. We freely grant that the
          postulate of God's Sovereignty with all its corollaries is at direct
          variance with the opinions and thoughts of the natural man, but the
          truth is, we are quite unable to think upon these matters: we are
          incompetent for forming a proper estimate of God's character and ways,
          and it is because of this that God has given us a revelation of His
          mind, and in that revelation He plainly declares, "My thoughts are not
          your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the LORD. For as
          the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your
          ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts" (Isa. 55:8, 9). In view of
          this Scripture, it is only to be expected that much of the contents of
          the Bible conflicts with the sentiments of the carnal mind, which is
          enmity against God. Our appeal then is not to the popular beliefs of
          the day, nor to the creeds of the churches, but to the Law and
          Testimony of Jehovah. All that we ask for is an impartial and
          attentive examination of what we have written, and that made
          prayerfully in the light of the Lamp of Truth. May the reader heed the
          Divine admonition to "prove all things; hold fast that which is good"
          (1 Thess. 5:21).
