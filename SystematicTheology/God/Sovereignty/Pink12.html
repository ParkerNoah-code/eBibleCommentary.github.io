        <h2>12 - The Value Of This Doctrine</h2>
        <p>
          "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, And is profitable for
          doctrine, For reproof, for correction, for instruction in
          righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, Thoroughly
          furnished unto all good works" (2 Tim. 3:16, 17).
        </p>
        <p>
          "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
          doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
          righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
          furnished unto all good works" (2 Tim. 3:16, 17). "Doctrine" means
          "teaching," and it is by doctrine or teaching that the great realities
          of God and of our relation to Him-of Christ, the Spirit, salvation,
          grace, glory-are made known to us. It is by doctrine (through the
          power of the Spirit) that believers are nourished and edified, and
          where doctrine is neglected growth in grace and effective witnessing
          for Christ necessarily cease. How sad then that doctrine is now
          decried as "unpractical" when, in fact, doctrine is the very base of
          the practical life. There is an inseparable connection between belief
          and practice: "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Prov. 23:7).
          The relation between Divine truth and Christian character is that of
          cause to effect: "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
          make you free" (John 8:32)-free from ignorance, free from prejudice,
          free from error, free from the wiles of Satan, free from the power of
          evil; and if the truth is not "known" then such freedom will not be
          enjoyed. Observe the order of mention in the passage with which we
          have opened. All Scripture is profitable first for "doctrine"! The
          same order is observed throughout the Epistles, particularly in the
          great doctrinal treatises of the Apostle Paul. Read the Epistle of
          "Romans" and it will be found that there is not a single admonition in
          the first five chapters. In the Epistle of "Ephesians" there are no
          exhortations till the fourth chapter is reached. The order is first
          doctrinal exposition and then admonition or exhortation for the
          regulation of the daily walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          The substitution of so-called "practical" preaching for the doctrinal
          exposition which it has supplanted is the root cause of many of the
          evil maladies which now afflict the Church of God. The reason why
          there is so little depth, so little intelligence, so little grasp of
          the fundamental verities of Christianity is because so few believers
          have been established in the faith through hearing expounded and
          through their own personal study of the doctrines of grace. While
          their soul is unestablished in the doctrine of the Divine Inspiration
          of the Scripture, their full and verbal inspiration, there can be no
          firm foundation for faith to rest upon. While the soul is ignorant of
          the doctrine of Justification there can be no real and intelligent
          assurance of its acceptance in the Beloved. While the soul is
          unacquainted with the teaching of the Word upon Sanctification it is
          open to receive all the crudities and errors of the Perfectionists or
          "Holiness" people. While the soul knows not what Scripture has to say
          upon the doctrine of the New Birth there can be no proper grasp of the
          two natures in the believer, and ignorance here inevitably results in
          the loss of peace and joy. And so we might go on right through the
          list of Christian doctrine. It is ignorance of doctrine that has
          rendered the professing church helpless to cope with the rising tide
          of infidelity. It is ignorance of doctrine which is mainly responsible
          for thousands of professing Christians being captivated by the
          numerous false isms of the day. It is because the time has now arrived
          when the bulk of our churches "will not endure sound doctrine" (2 Tim.
          4:3) that they so readily receive false doctrines. Of course it is
          true that doctrine, like anything else in Scripture, may be studied
          from a merely cold intellectual viewpoint, and thus approached,
          doctrinal teaching and doctrinal study will leave the heart untouched,
          and will naturally be "dry" and profitless. But, doctrine properly
          received, doctrine studied with an exercised heart, will ever lead
          into a deeper knowledge of God and of the unsearchable riches of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of God's Sovereignty then is no mere metaphysical dogma
          which is devoid of practical value, but is one that is calculated to
          produce a powerful effect upon Christian character and the daily walk.
          The doctrine of God's Sovereignty lies at the foundation of Christian
          theology, and in importance is perhaps second only to the Divine
          Inspiration of the Scriptures. It is the center of gravity in the
          system of Christian truth: the sun around which all the lesser orbs
          are grouped. It is the golden milestone to which every highway of
          knowledge leads and from which they all radiate. It is the cord upon
          which all other doctrines are strung like so many pearls, holding them
          in place and giving them unity. It is the plumbline by which every
          creed needs to be measured, the balance in which every human dogma
          must be weighed. It is designed as the sheet-anchor for our souls amid
          the storms of life. The doctrine of God's Sovereignty is a Divine
          cordial to refresh our spirits. It is designed and adapted to mold the
          affections of the heart and to give a right direction to conduct. It
          produces gratitude in prosperity and patience in adversity. It affords
          comfort for the present and a sense of security respecting the unknown
          future. It is, and it does all, and much more than we have just said
          because it ascribes to God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the glory
          which is His due, and places the creature in his proper place before
          Him-in the dust.
        </p>
        <p>We shall now consider the Value of the doctrine in detail.</p>
        <p>
          <b>1. IT DEEPENS OUR VENERATION OF THE DIVINE CHARACTER.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of God's Sovereignty as it is unfolded in the Scriptures
          affords an exalted view of the Divine perfections. It maintains His
          creatorial rights. It insists that "to us there is but one God, the
          Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus
          Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him" (1 Cor. 8:6). It
          declares that His rights are those of the "potter" who forms and
          fashions the clay into vessels of whatever type and for whatever use
          He may please. Its testimony is "Thou hast created all things, and for
          Thy pleasure they are and were created" (Rev. 4:11). It argues that
          none has any right to "reply" against God, and that the only becoming
          attitude for the creature to take is one of reverent submission before
          Him. Thus the apprehension of the absolute supremacy of God is of
          great practical importance, for unless we have a proper regard to His
          high Sovereignty He will never be honored in our thoughts of Him, nor
          will He have His proper place in our hearts and lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          It exhibits the inscrutableness of His wisdom. It shows that while God
          is immaculate in His holiness He has permitted evil to enter His fair
          creation; that while He is the Possessor of all power He has allowed
          the Devil to wage war against Him for six thousand years at least;
          that while He is the perfect embodiment of love He spared not His own
          Son; that while He is the God of all grace multitudes will be
          tormented for ever and ever in the Lake of Fire. High mysteries are
          these. Scripture does not deny them, but acknowledges their existence:
          "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
          how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"
          (Rom. 11:33).
        </p>
        <p>
          It makes known the irreversibleness of His will. "Known unto God are
          all His works from the beginning of the world" (Acts 15:18). From the
          beginning God purposed to glorify Himself "in the Church by Christ
          Jesus throughout all ages, world without end" (Eph. 3:21). To this end
          He created the world and formed man. His all-wise plan was not
          defeated when man fell, for in the Lamb "slain from the foundation of
          the world" (Rev. 13:8) we behold the Fall anticipated. Nor will God's
          purpose be thwarted b y the wickedness of men since the Fall, as is
          clear from the words of the Psalmist "Surely the wrath of man shall
          praise Thee: the remainder of wrath shalt Thou restrain" (Psa. 76:10).
          Because God is the Almighty His will cannot be withstood. "His
          purposes originated in eternity, and are carried forward without
          change to eternity. They extend to all His works, and control all
          events. He 'worketh all things after the counsel of His own will'"
          (Dr. Rice). Neither man nor Devil can successfully resist Him,
          therefore is it written, "The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble"
          (Psa. 99:1).
        </p>
        <p>
          It magnifies His grace. Grace is unmerited favor, and because grace is
          shown to the undeserving and Hell-deserving, to those who have no
          claim upon God, therefore is grace free and can be manifested toward
          the chief of sinners. But because grace is exercised toward those who
          are destitute of worthiness or merit grace is Sovereign; that is to
          say, God bestows grace upon whom He pleases. Divine Sovereignty has
          ordained that some shall be cast into the Lake of Fire to show that
          all deserved such a doom. But grace comes in like a dragnet and draws
          out from a lost humanity a people for God's name, to be throughout all
          eternity the monuments of His inscrutable favor. Sovereign grace
          reveals God breaking down the opposition of the human heart, subduing
          the enmity of the carnal mind, and bringing us to love Him because He
          first loved us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. IT IS THE SOLID FOUNDATION OF ALL TRUE RELIGION.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This naturally follows from what we have said above under the first
          head. If the doctrine of Divine Sovereignty alone gives God His
          rightful place, then it is also true that it alone can supply a firm
          base for practical religion to build upon. There can be no progress in
          Divine things until there is the personal recognition that God is
          Supreme, that He is to be feared and revered and He is to be owned and
          served as Lord. We read the Scriptures in vain unless we come to them
          earnestly desiring a better knowledge of God's will for us: any other
          motive is selfish and utterly inadequate and unworthy. Every prayer we
          send up to God is but carnal presumption unless it be offered
          "according to His will": anything short of this is to ask 'amiss' that
          we might consume upon our own lusts the thing requested! Every service
          we engage in is but a "dead work" unless it be done for the glory of
          God. Experimental religion consists mainly in the perception and
          performance of the Divine will, performance both active and passive.
          We are predestinated to be "conformed to the image of God's Son" whose
          meat it ever was to do the will of the One that sent Him, and the
          measure in which each saint is becoming "conformed" practically, in
          his daily life, is largely determined by his response to our Lord's
          word "Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly
          in heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. IT REPUDIATES THE HERESY OF SALVATION BY WORKS.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof
          are the ways of death" (Prov. 14:12). The way which "seemeth right"
          and which ends in "death," death eternal, is salvation by human effort
          and merit. The belief in salvation by works is one that is common to
          human nature. It may not always assume the grosser form of Popish
          penances, or even of Protestant "repentance," i.e., sorrowing for sin,
          which is never the meaning of repentance in Scripture; anything which
          gives man a place at all is but a variety of the same evil genus. To
          say, as alas! many preachers, are saying, God is willing to do His
          part if you will do yours, is a wretched and excuseless denial of the
          Gospel of His grace. To declare that God helps those who help
          themselves is to repudiate one of the most precious truths taught in
          the Bible, and in the Bible alone; namely, that God helps those who
          are unable to help themselves, who have tried again and again only to
          fail. To say that the sinner's salvation turns upon the action of his
          own will is another form of the God-dishonoring dogma of salvation by
          human efforts. In the final analysis, any movement of the will is a
          work: it is something from me, something which I do. But the doctrine
          of God's Sovereignty lays the axe at the root of this evil by
          declaring "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but
          of God that sheweth mercy" (Rom. 9:16). Does some one say, Such a
          doctrine will drive sinners to despair. The reply is, Be it so; it is
          just such despair the writer longs to see prevail. It is not until the
          sinner despairs of any help from himself that he will ever fall into
          the arms of Sovereign mercy; but if once the Holy Spirit convicts him
          that there is no help in himself then he will recognize that he is
          lost, and will cry, "God be merciful to me a sinner," and such a cry
          will be heard. If the author may be allowed to bear personal witness,
          he has found during the course of his ministry that the sermons he has
          preached on human depravity, the sinner's helplessness to do anything
          himself, and the salvation of the soul turning upon the Sovereign
          mercy of God, have been those most owned and blessed in the salvation
          of the lost. We repeat, then, a sense of utter helplessness is the
          first prerequisite to any sound conversion. There is no salvation for
          any soul until it looks away from itself, looks to something, yea, to
          Someone, outside of itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4. IT IS DEEPLY HUMBLING TO THE CREATURE.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine of the absolute Sovereignty of God is a great
          battering-ram against human pride, and in this it is in sharp contrast
          from the "doctrines of men." The spirit of our age is essentially that
          of boasting and glorying in the flesh. The achievements of man, his
          development and progress, his greatness and self-sufficiency, are the
          shrine at which the world worships today. But the truth of God's
          Sovereignty, with all its corollaries, removes every ground for human
          boasting and instills the spirit of humility in its stead. It declares
          that salvation is of the Lord-of the Lord in its origination, in its
          operation, and in its consummation. It insists that the Lord has to
          apply as well as supply, that He has to complete as well as begin His
          saving work in our souls, that He has not only to reclaim but to
          maintain and sustain us to the end. It teaches that salvation is by
          grace through faith, and that all our works (before conversion), good
          as well as evil, count for nothing toward salvation. It tells us we
          are "born, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
          of God" (John 1:13). And all this is most humbling to the heart of man
          who wants to contribute something to the price of his redemption and
          do that which will afford ground for boasting and self-satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if this doctrine humbles us it results in praise to God. If, in
          the light of God's Sovereignty, we have seen our own worthlessness and
          helplessness we shall indeed cry with the Psalmist "All my springs are
          in Thee" (Psa. 87:7). If by nature we were "children of wrath," and by
          practice rebels against the Divine government and justly exposed to
          the "curse" of the Law, and if God was under no obligation to rescue
          us from the fiery indignation and yet, notwithstanding, He delivered
          up His well-beloved Son for us all; then how such grace and love will
          melt our hearts, how the apprehension of it will cause us to say in
          adoring gratitude "Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto Thy name
          give glory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's sake" (Psa. 115:1). How
          readily shall each of us acknowledge "By the grace of God I am what I
          am! With what wondering praise shall we exclaim-
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why was I made to hear His voice,<br />
          And enter while there's room,<br />
          When thousands make a wretched choice,<br />
          And rather starve than come?<br />
          'Twas the same love that spread the feast,<br />
          That sweetly forced us in;<br />
          Else we had still refused to taste<br />
          And perished in our sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>5. IT AFFORDS A SENSE OF ABSOLUTE SECURITY.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          God is infinite in power and therefore it is impossible to withstand
          His will or resist the outworking of His decrees. Such a statement as
          that is well calculated to fill the sinner with alarm, but from the
          saint it evokes naught but praise. Let us add a word and see what a
          difference it makes: My God is infinite in power! then "I will not
          fear what man can do unto me." My God is infinite in power, then "what
          time I am afraid I will trust in Him." My God is infinite in power,
          then I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: "for Thou, LORD,
          only makest me dwell in safety" (Psa. 4:8). Right down the ages this
          has been the source of the saints' confidence. Was not this the
          assurance of Moses when, in his parting words to Israel, he said
          "There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun (Israel), who rideth upon
          the Heaven in Thy help, and in His excellency on the sky. The eternal
          God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms" (Deut.
          33:26, 27)? Was it not this sense of security that caused the
          Psalmist, moved by the Holy Spirit to write "He that dwelleth in the
          secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the
          Almighty. I will say to the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress, my
          God: in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare
          of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee
          with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth
          shall be thy shield and buckler: Thou shalt not be afraid for the
          terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the
          pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that
          wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten
          thousand at thy right band, but it shall not come nigh thee. Because
          thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High thy
          Habitation; There shall no evil befall thee (instead, all things will
          work together for good), neither shall any plague come nigh thy
          dwelling" (Psa. 91:1-7, 9-10)?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Death and plagues around me fly,<br />
          Till He bid, I cannot die;<br />
          Not a single shaft can hit,<br />
          Till the God of love sees fit."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh the preciousness of this truth! Here am I, a poor, helpless,
          senseless "sheep," yet am I secure in the hand of Christ. And why am I
          secure there? None can pluck me thence because the hand that holds me
          is that of the Son of God, and all power in Heaven and earth is His!
          Again; I have no strength of my own: the world, the flesh, and the
          Devil, are arrayed against me so I commit myself into the care and
          keeping of the Lord and say with the Apostle "I know Whom I have
          believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have
          committed unto Him against that day" (2 Tim. 1:12). And what is the
          ground of my confidence? How do I know that He is able to keep that
          which I have committed unto Him? I know it because God is almighty,
          the King of kings and Lord of lords.

          <b>6. IT SUPPLIES COMFORT IN SORROW.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of God's Sovereignty is one that is full of consolation
          and imparts great peace to the Christian. The Sovereignty of God is a
          foundation that nothing can shake and is more firm than the heavens
          and earth. How blessed to know there is no corner of the universe that
          is out of His reach! as said the Psalmist, "Whither shall I go from
          Thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence? If I ascend up
          into Heaven, Thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou
          art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the
          uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me, and Thy
          right hand shall hold me. If I say surely the darkness shall cover me;
          even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the darkness hideth not
          from Thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the
          light are both alike to Thee" (Psa. 139:7-12). How blessed it is to
          know that God's strong hand is upon every one and every thing! How
          blessed to know that not a sparrow falleth to the ground without His
          notice!
        </p>
        <p>
          How blessed to know that our very afflictions come not by chance, nor
          from the Devil, but are ordained and ordered by God: "That no man
          should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are
          appointed thereunto" (1 Thess. 3:3)!
        </p>
        <p>
          But our God is not only infinite in power. He is infinite in wisdom
          and goodness too. And herein is the preciousness of this truth. God
          wills only that which is good and His will is irreversible and
          irresistible! God is too wise to err and too loving to cause His child
          a needless tear. Therefore if God be perfect wisdom and perfect
          goodness how blessed is the assurance that everything is in His hand
          and molded by His will according to His eternal purpose! "Behold, He
          taketh away, who can hinder Him? who will say unto Him what doest
          Thou?" (Job 9:12). Yet, how comforting to learn that it is "He," and
          not the Devil, who "taketh away" our loved ones! Ah! what peace for
          our poor frail hearts to be told that the number of our days is with
          Him (Job 7:1; 14:5); that disease and death are His messengers and
          always march under His orders; that it is the Lord who gives and the
          Lord who takes away!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>7. IT BEGETS A SPIRIT OF SWEET RESIGNATION.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          To bow before the Sovereign will of God is one of the great secrets of
          peace and happiness. There can be no real submission with contentment
          until we are broken in spirit, that is, until we are willing and glad
          for the Lord to have His way with us. Not that we are insisting upon a
          spirit of fatalistic acquiescence: far from it. The saints are
          exhorted to "prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will
          of God" (Rom. 12:2).
        </p>
        <p>
          We touched upon this subject of resignation to God's will in the
          chapter upon our Attitude toward God's Sovereignty, and there, in
          addition to the supreme Pattern, we cited the examples of Eli and Job:
          we would now supplement their cases with further examples. What a word
          is that in Leviticus 10:3 "And Aaron held his peace." Look at the
          circumstances: "And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of
          them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
          offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not. And
          there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died
          before the Lord... And Aaron held his peace." Two of the high priests'
          sons were slain, slain by a visitation of Divine judgment, and they
          were probably intoxicated at the time; moreover, this trial came upon
          Aaron suddenly, without anything to prepare him for it; yet he "held
          his peace." Precious exemplification of the power of God's
          all-sufficient grace!
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider now an utterance which fell from the lips of David: "And the
          king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I
          shall find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me again, and
          shew me both it, and His habitation. But if He thus say, I have no
          delight in thee; behold, here am I, let Him do to me as seemeth good
          unto Him" (2 Sam. 15:25, 26). Here, to, the circumstances which
          confronted the speaker were exceedingly trying to the human heart.
          David was sore pressed with sorrow. His own son was driving him from
          the throne and seeking his very life. Whether he would ever see
          Jerusalem and the Tabernacle again he knew not. But he was so yielded
          up to God, he was so fully assured that His will was best, that even
          though it meant the loss of the throne and the loss of his life he was
          content for Him to have His way-"let Him do to me as seemeth Him
          good."
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no need to multiply examples, but a reflection upon the last
          case will be in place. If amid the shadows of the Old Testament
          dispensation David was content for the Lord to have His way, now that
          the heart of God has been fully revealed at the Cross how much more
          ought we to delight in the execution of His will! Surely we shall have
          no hesitation in saying-
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ill that He blesses is our good,<br />
          And unblest good is ill,<br />
          And all is right that seems most wrong,<br />
          If it be His sweet will."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>8. IT EVOKES A SONG OF PRAISE.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It could not be otherwise. Why should I, who am by nature no different
          from the careless and godless throngs all around, have been chosen in
          Christ before the foundation of the world and now blest with all
          spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Him! Why was I, that once was
          an alien and a rebel, singled out for such wondrous favors! Ah! that
          is something I cannot fathom. Such grace, such love, "passeth
          knowledge." But if my mind is unable to discern a reason my heart can
          express its gratitude in praise and adoration. But not only should I
          be grateful to God for His grace toward me in the past, His present
          dealings will fill me with thanksgiving. What is the force of that
          word "Rejoice in the Lord alway" (Phil. 4:4)? Mark it is not "Rejoice
          in the Saviour," but we are to "Rejoice in the Lord" as "Lord," as the
          Master of every circumstance. Need we remind the reader that when the
          Apostle penned these words he was himself a prisoner in the hands of
          the Roman government. A long course of affliction and suffering lay
          behind him. Perils on land and perils on sea, hunger and thirst,
          scourging and stoning, had all been experienced. He had been
          persecuted by those within the church as well as by those without: the
          very ones who ought to have stood by him had forsaken him. And still
          he writes, "Rejoice in the Lord alway"! What was the secret of his
          peace and happiness? Ah! had not this same Apostle written "And we
          know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
          them who are the called according to His purpose" (Rom. 8:28)? But how
          did he, and how do we, "know" that all things work together for good?
          The answer is, Because all things are under the control of and are
          being regulated by the Supreme Sovereign, and because He has naught
          but thoughts of love toward His own, then "all things" are so ordered
          by Him that they are made to minister to our ultimate good. It is for
          this cause we are to give "thanks always for all things unto God and
          the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Eph. 5:20). Yes,
          give thanks for "all things" for, as it has been well said "Our
          disappointments are but His appointments." To the one who delights in
          the Sovereignty of God the clouds not only have a 'silver lining' but
          they are silver all through, the darkness only serving to offset the
          light-
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ye fearful saints fresh courage take<br />
          The clouds ye so much dread,<br />
          Are big with mercy and shall break<br />
          In blessings o'er your head."

          <b>9. IT GUARANTEES THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER EVIL.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the day that Cain slew Abel, the conflict on earth between
          good and evil has been a sore problem to the saints. In every age the
          righteous have appeared to defy God with impugnity. The Lord's people,
          for the most part, have been poor in this world's good whereas the
          wicked in their temporal prosperity have flourished like the green bay
          tree. As one looks around and beholds the oppression of believers and
          the earthly success of unbelievers, and notes how few are the former
          and how numerous the latter; as he sees the apparent defeat of the
          right and the triumphing of might and the wrong; as he hears the roar
          of battle, the cries of the wounded, and the lamentations of the
          bereaved; as he discovers that almost everything down here is in
          confusion, chaos, and ruins, it seems as though Satan were getting the
          better of the conflict. But as one looks above, instead of around,
          there is plainly visible to the eye of faith a Throne, a Throne
          unaffected by the storms of earth, a Throne that is "set," stable and
          secure; and upon it is seated One whose name is the Almighty, and who
          "worketh all things after the counsel of His own will" (Eph. 1:11).
          This then is our confidenceGod is on the Throne. The helm is in His
          hand, and being Almighty His purpose cannot fail for "He is in one
          mind, and who can turn Him? and what His soul desireth, even that He
          doeth" (Job. 23:13). Though God's governing hand is invisible to the
          eye of sense it is real to faith, that faith which rests with sure
          confidence upon His Word, and therefore is assured He cannot fail.
          What follows below is from the pen of our brother, Mr. A. C.
          Gaebelein.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There can be no failure with God. 'God is not a man, that He should
          lie; neither the Son of man, that He should repent: hath He said and
          shall He not do it? or hath He spoken, and shall He not make it good?"
          (Num. 23:19). All will be accomplished. The promise made to His own
          beloved people to come for them and take them from hence to glory will
          not fail. He will surely come and gather them in His own presence. The
          solemn words spoken to the nations of the earth by the different
          prophets will also not fail. 'Come near, ye nations, to hear; and
          hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the
          world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of
          the LORD is upon all nations, and His fury upon all their armies: He
          hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the slaughter'
          (Isa. 34:1, 2). Nor will that day fail in which 'the lofty looks of
          man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down,
          and the LORD alone shall be exalted' (Isa. 2:11). The day in which He
          is manifested, when His glory shall cover the heavens and His feet
          will stand again upon this earth, will surely come. His kingdom will
          not fail, nor all the promised events connected with the end of the
          age and the consummation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In these dark and trying times how well it is to remember that He is
          on the throne, the throne which cannot be shaken, and that He will not
          fail in doing all He has spoken and promised. 'Seek ye out of the book
          of the LORD, and read: No one of these shall fail' (Isa. 34:16). In
          believing, blessed anticipation, we can look on to the glory-time when
          His Word and His Will is accomplished, when through the coming of the
          Prince of Peace, righteousness and peace comes at last. And while we
          wait for the supreme and blessed moment when His promise to us is
          accomplished, we trust Him, walking in His fellowship and daily find
          afresh, that He does not fail to sustain and keep us in all our ways."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>10. IT PROVIDES A RESTING-PLACE FOR THE HEART.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Much that might have been said here has already been anticipated under
          previous heads. The One seated upon the Throne of Heaven, the One who
          is Governor over the nations and who has ordained and now regulates
          all events, is infinite not only in power but in wisdom and goodness
          as well. He who is Lord over all creation is the One that was
          "manifest in the flesh" (1 Tim. 3:16). Ah! here is a theme no human
          pen can do justice to. The glory of God consists not merely in that He
          is Highest, but in that being high He stooped in lowly love to bear
          the burden of His own sinful creatures, for it is written "God was in
          Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself" (2 Cor. 5:19). The Church
          of God was purchased "with His own Blood" (Acts 20:28). It is upon the
          gracious self-humiliation of the King Himself that His kingdom is
          established. O wondrous Cross! By it He who suffered upon it has
          become not the Lord of our destinies (He was that before), but the
          Lord of our hearts. Therefore, it is not in abject terror that we bow
          before the Supreme Sovereign, but in adoring worship we cry "Worthy is
          the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and
          strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing" (Rev. 5:12).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then is the refutation of the wicked charge that this doctrine is
          a horrible calumny upon God and dangerous to expound to His people.
          Can a doctrine be "horrible" and "dangerous" that gives God His true
          place, that maintains His rights, that magnifies His grace, that
          ascribes all glory to Him and removes every ground of boasting from
          the creature? Can a doctrine be "horrible" and "dangerous" which
          affords the saints a sense of security in danger, that supplies them
          comfort in sorrow, that begets patience within them in adversity, that
          evokes from them praise at all times? Can a doctrine be "horrible" and
          "dangerous" which assures us of the certain triumph of good over evil,
          and which provides a sure resting-place for our hearts, and that
          place, the perfections of the Sovereign Himself? No; a thousand times,
          no! Instead of being "horrible and dangerous" this doctrine of the
          Sovereignty of God is glorious and edifying, and a due apprehension of
          it will but serve to make us exclaim with Moses, "Who is like unto
          thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like Thee, glorious in holiness,
          fearful in praises, doing wonders?" (Exo. 15:11).
