        <h2>8 - Sovereignty And Human Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God" (Rom.
          14:12).
        </p>
        <p>
          In our last chapter we considered at some length the much debated and
          difficult question of the human will. We have shown that the will of
          the natural man is neither Sovereign nor free but, instead, a servant
          and slave. We have argued that a right conception of the sinner's
          will-its servitude-is essential to a just estimate of his depravity
          and ruin. The utter corruption and degradation of human nature is
          something which man hates to acknowledge, and which he will hotly and
          insistently deny until he is "taught of God." Much, very much, of the
          unsound doctrine which we now hear on every hand is the direct and
          logical outcome of man's repudiation of God's expressed estimate of
          human depravity. Men are claiming that they are "increased with goods,
          and have need of nothing," and know not that they are "wretched and
          miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (Rev. 3:17). They prate
          about the 'Ascent of Man,' and deny his Fall. They put darkness for
          light and light for darkness. They boast of the 'free moral agency' of
          man when, in fact, he is in bondage to sin and enslaved by
          Satan-"taken captive by him at his will" (2 Tim. 2:26). But if the
          natural man is not a 'free moral agent,' does it also follow that he
          is not accountable?
        </p>
        <p>
          'Free moral agency' is an expression of human invention and, as we
          have said before, to talk of the freedom of the natural man is flatly
          to repudiate his spiritual ruin. Nowhere does Scripture speak of the
          freedom or moral ability of the sinner, on the contrary, it insists on
          his moral and spiritual inability.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is, admittedly, the most difficult branch of our subject. Those
          who have ever devoted much study to this theme have uniformly
          recognized that the harmonizing of God's Sovereignty with Man's
          Responsibility is the gordian knot of theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main difficulty encountered is to define the relationship between
          God's Sovereignty and man's responsibility. Many have summarily
          disposed of the difficulty by denying its existence. A certain class
          of theologians, in their anxiety to maintain man's responsibility,
          have magnified it beyond all due proportions until God's Sovereignty
          has been lost sight of, and in not a few instances flatly denied.
          Others have acknowledged that the Scriptures present both the
          Sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man but affirm that in
          our present finite condition and with our limited knowledge it is
          impossible to reconcile the two truths, though it is the bounden duty
          of the believer to receive both. The present writer believes that it
          has been too readily assumed that the Scriptures themselves do not
          reveal the several points which show the conciliation of God's
          Sovereignty and man's responsibility. While perhaps the Word of God
          does not clear up all the mystery (and this is said with reserve), it
          does throw much light upon the problem, and it seems to us more
          honoring to God and His Word to prayerfully search the Scriptures for
          the completer solution of the difficulty, and even though others have
          thus far searched in vain that ought only to drive us more and more to
          our knees. God has been pleased to reveal many things out of His Word
          during the last century which were hidden from earlier students. Who
          then dare affirm that there is not much to be learned yet respecting
          our inquiry!
        </p>
        <p>
          As we have said above, our chief difficulty is to determine the
          meeting-point of God's Sovereignty and man's responsibility. To many
          it has seemed that for God to assert His Sovereignty, for Him to put
          forth His power and exert a direct influence upon man, for Him to do
          anything more than warn or invite, would be to interfere with man's
          freedom, destroy his responsibility, and reduce him to a machine. It
          is sad indeed to find one like the late Dr. Pierson-whose writings are
          generally so scriptural and helpful-saying, "It is a tremendous
          thought that even God Himself cannot control my moral frame, or
          constrain my moral choice. He cannot prevent me defying and denying
          Him, and would not exercise His power in such directions if He could,
          and could not if He would" ("A Spiritual Clinique"). It is sadder
          still to discover that many other respected and loved brethren are
          giving expression to the same sentiments. Sad, because directly at
          variance with the Holy Scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is our desire to face honestly the difficulties involved, and to
          examine them carefully in what light God has been pleased to grant us.
          The chief difficulties might be expressed thus: first, How is it
          possible for God to so bring His power to bear upon men that they are
          prevented from doing what they desire to do, and impelled to do other
          things they do not desire to do, and yet to preserve their
          responsibility? Second, How can the sinner be held responsible for the
          doing of what he is unable to do? And how can he be justly condemned
          for not doing what he could not do? Third, How is it possible for God
          to decree that men shall commit certain sins, hold them responsible in
          the committal of them, and adjudge them guilty because they committed
          them? Fourth, How can the sinner be held responsible to receive
          Christ, and be damned for rejecting Him, when God had foreordained him
          to condemnation? We shall now deal with these several problems in the
          above order. May the Holy Spirit Himself be our Teacher so that in His
          light we may see light.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How is it possible for God to so bring His power to bear upon men
          that they are PREVENTED from doing what they desire to do, and
          IMPELLED to do other things they do not desire to do, and yet to
          preserve their responsibility?
        </p>
        <p>
          It would seem that if God put forth His power and exerted a direct
          influence upon men their freedom would be interfered with. It would
          appear that if God did anything more than warn and invite men their
          responsibility would be infringed upon. We are told that God must not
          coerce man, still less compel him, or otherwise he would be reduced to
          a machine. This sounds very plausible; it appears to be good
          philosophy and based upon sound reasoning; it has been almost
          universally accepted as an axiom in ethics; nevertheless, it is
          refuted by Scripture!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us turn first to Genesis 20:6: "And God said unto him in a dream,
          Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I
          also withheld thee from sinning against Me: therefore suffered I thee
          not to touch her." It is argued, almost universally, that God must not
          interfere with man's liberty, that he must not coerce or compel him,
          lest he be reduced to a machine. But the above Scripture proves,
          unmistakably proves, that it is not impossible for God to exert His
          power upon man without destroying his responsibility. Here is a case
          where God did exert His power, restrict man's freedom, and prevent him
          from doing that which he otherwise would have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ere turning from this Scripture let us note how it throws light upon
          the case of the first man. Would-be philosophers who sought to be wise
          above that which was written have argued that God could not have
          prevented Adam's fall without reducing him to a mere automaton. They
          tell us, constantly, that God must not coerce or compel His creatures
          otherwise He would destroy their accountability. But the answer to all
          such philosophisings is, that Scripture records a number of instances
          where we are expressly told G od did prevent certain of His creatures
          from sinning both against Himself and against His people, in view of
          which all men's reasonings are utterly worthless. If God could
          "withhold" Abimelech from sinning against Him then why was He unable
          to do the same with Adam? Should someone ask, Then why did not God do
          so? we might return the question by asking, Why did not God "withhold"
          Satan from falling? or, Why did not God "withhold" the Kaiser from
          starting the War? The usual reply is, as we have said, G od could not
          without interfering with man's "freedom" and reducing him to a
          machine. But the case of Abimelech proves conclusively that such a
          reply is untenable and erroneous-we might add wicked and blasphemous,
          for who are we to limit the Most High! How dare any finite creature
          take it upon him to say what the Almighty can and cannot do? Should we
          be pressed further as to why God refused to exercise His power and
          prevent Adam's fall, we should say, Because Adam's fall better served
          His own wise and blessed purpose-among other things, it provided an
          opportunity to demonstrate that where sin had abounded grace could
          much more abound. But we might ask further: Why did God place in the
          garden the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when He foresaw that
          man would disobey His prohibition and eat of it; for mark, it was God
          and not Satan who made that tree. Should someone respond, Then is God
          the Author of Sin? We would have to ask, in turn, What is meant by
          "Author"? Plainly it was God's will that sin should enter this world
          otherwise it would not have entered, for nothing happens save as God
          has eternally decreed. Moreover, there was more than a bare permission
          for God only permits that which He has purposed. But we leave now the
          origin of sin, insisting once more, however, that God could have
          "withheld" Adam from sinning without destroying his responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case of Abimelech does not stand alone. Another illustration of
          the same principle is seen in the history of Balaam, already noticed
          in the last chapter, but concerning which a further word is in place.
          Balak the Moabite sent for this heathen prophet to "curse" Israel. A
          handsome reward was offered for his services, and a careful reading of
          Numbers 22-24 will show that Balaam was willing, yea, anxious, to
          accept Balak's offer and thus sin against God and His people. But
          Divine power "withheld" him. Mark his own admission, "And Balaam said
          unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to
          say anything? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I
          speak" (Num. 22:38). Again, after Balak had remonstrated with Balaam,
          we read "He answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
          which the LORD hath put in my mouth?...Behold, I have received
          commandment to bless: and He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it"
          (23:12, 20). Surely these verses show us God's power, and Balaam's
          powerlessness: man's will frustrated and God's will performed. But was
          Balaam's "freedom" or responsibility destroyed? Certainly not, as we
          shall yet seek to show.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more illustration: "And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the
          kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made
          no war against Jehoshaphat" (2 Chron. 17:10). The implication here is
          clear. Had not the "fear of the LORD" fallen upon these kingdoms they
          would have made war upon Judah. God's restraining power alone
          prevented them. Had their own will been allowed to act "war" would
          have been the consequence. Thus we see, that Scripture teaches that
          God "withholds" nations as well as individuals, and that when it
          pleaseth Him to do so He interposes and prevents war. Compare further
          Genesis 35:5.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question which now demands our consideration is, How is it
          possible for God to "withhold" men from sinning and yet not to
          interfere with their liberty and responsibility-a question which so
          many say is incapable of solution in our present finite condition.
          This question causes us to ask, In what does moral "freedom," real
          moral freedom, consist? We answer, it is the being delivered from the
          BONDAGE of sin. The more any soul is emancipated from the thralldom of
          sin the more does he enter into a state of freedom-"If the Son
          therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed" (John 8:36).
          In the above instances God "withheld" Abimelech, Balaam, and the
          heathen kingdoms from sinning, and therefore we affirm that He did not
          in any wise interfere with their real freedom. The nearer a soul
          approximates to sinlessness the nearer does he approach to God's
          holiness. Scripture tells us that God "cannot lie," and that He
          "cannot be tempted," but is He any the less free because He cannot do
          that which is evil? Surely not. Then is it not evident that the more
          man is raised up to God, and the more he be "withheld" from sinning,
          the greater is his real freedom!
        </p>
        <p>
          A pertinent example setting forth the meeting-place of God's
          Sovereignty and man's responsibility, as it relates to the question of
          moral freedom, is found in connection with the giving to us of the
          Holy Scriptures. In the communication of His Word God was pleased to
          employ human instruments, and in the using of them He did not reduce
          them to mere mechanical amanuenses: "Knowing this first, that no
          prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation (Greek: of
          its own origination). For the prophecy came not at any time by the
          will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
          Spirit" (2 Peter 1:20, 21). Here we have man's responsibility and
          God's Sovereignty placed in juxtaposition. These holy men were "moved"
          (Greek: "borne along") by the Holy Spirit, yet was not their moral
          responsibility disturbed nor their "freedom" impaired. God enlightened
          their minds, enkindled their hearts, revealed to them His truth, and
          so controlled them that error on their part was, by Him, made
          impossible, as they communicated His mind and will to men. But what
          was it that might have, would have, caused error, had not God
          controlled as He did the instruments which He employed? The answer is
          SIN, the sin which was in them. But as we have seen, the holding in
          check of sin, the preventing of the exercise of the carnal mind in
          these "holy men" was not a destroying of their "freedom," rather was
          it the inducting of them into real freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          A final word should be added here concerning the nature of true
          liberty. There are three chief things concerning which men in general
          greatly err: misery and happiness, folly and wisdom, bondage and
          liberty. The world counts none miserable but the afflicted, and none
          happy but the prosperous, because they judge by the present ease of
          the flesh. Again; the world is pleased with a false show of wisdom
          (which is "foolishness" with God), neglecting that which makes wise
          unto salvation. As to liberty, men would be at their own disposal and
          live as they please. They suppose the only true liberty is to be at
          the command and under the control of none above themselves, and live
          according to their heart's desire. But this is a thralldom and bondage
          of the worst kind. True liberty is not the power to live as we please,
          but to live as we ought! Hence, the only One Who has ever trod this
          earth since Adam's fall that has enjoyed perfect freedom was the Man
          Christ Jesus, the Holy Servant of God, Whose meat it ever was to do
          the will of the Father.
        </p>
        <p>We now turn to consider the question.</p>
        <p>
          2. How can the sinner be held responsible FOR the doing of what he is
          UNABLE to do? And how can he be justly condemned for NOT DOING what he
          COULD NOT do?
        </p>
        <p>
          As a creature the natural man is responsible to love, obey, and serve
          God; as a sinner he is responsible to repent and believe the Gospel.
          But at the outset we are confronted with the fact that natural man is
          unable to love and serve God, and that the sinner, of himself, cannot
          repent and believe. First, let us prove what we have just said. We
          begin by quoting and considering John 6:44, "No man can come to Me,
          except the Father which hath sent Me draw him." The heart of the
          natural man (every man) is so "desperately wicked" that if he is left
          to himself he will never 'come to Christ.' This statement would not be
          questioned if the full force of the words "coming to Christ" were
          properly apprehended. We shall therefore digress a little at this
          point to define and consider what is implied and involved in the words
          "No man can come to Me"-cf. John 5:40, "Ye will not come to Me, that
          ye might have life."
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sinner to come to Christ that he might have life is for him to
          realize the awful danger of his situation; is for him to see that the
          sword of Divine justice is suspended over his head; is to awaken to
          the fact that there is but a step betwixt him and death, and that
          after death is the "judgment"; and in consequence of this discovery,
          is for him to be in real earnest to escape, and in such earnestness
          that he shall flee from the wrath to come, cry unto God for mercy, and
          agonize to enter in at the "strait gate."
        </p>
        <p>
          To come to Christ for life, is for the sinner to feel and acknowledge
          that he is utterly destitute of any claim upon God's favor; is to see
          himself as "without strength," lost and undone; is to admit that he is
          deserving of nothing but eternal death, thus taking side with God
          against himself; it is for him to cast himself into the dust before
          God, and humbly sue for Divine mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          To come to Christ for life is for the sinner to abandon his own
          righteousness and be ready to be made the righteousness of God in
          Christ; it is to disown his own wisdom and be guided by His; it is to
          repudiate his own will and be ruled by His; it is to unreservedly
          receive the Lord Jesus as his Lord and Saviour, as his All in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such, in part and in brief, is what is implied and involved in "coming
          to Christ." But is the sinner willing to take such an attitude before
          God? No; for in the first place he does not realize the danger of his
          situation, and in consequence is not in real earnest after his escape;
          instead, men are for the most part at ease, and apart from the
          operations of the Holy Spirit whenever they are disturbed by the
          alarms of conscience or the dispensations of providence they flee to
          any other refuge but Christ. In the second place, they will not
          acknowledge that all their righteousnesses are as filthy rags but,
          like the Pharisee, will thank God they are not as the Publican. And in
          the third place, they are not ready to receive Christ as their Lord
          and Saviour for they are unwilling to part with their idols; they had
          rather hazard their soul's eternal welfare than give them up. Hence we
          say that, left to himself, the natural man is so depraved at heart
          that he cannot come to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words of our Lord quoted above by no means stand alone. Quite a
          number of Scriptures set forth the moral and spiritual inability of
          the natural man. In Joshua 24:19 we read, "And Joshua said unto the
          people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for He is an holy God." To the
          Pharisees Christ said, "Why do ye not understand My speech? even
          because ye cannot hear My word" (John 8:43). And again: "The carnal
          mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God,
          neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot
          please God" (Rom. 8:7, 8).
        </p>
        <p>
          But now the question returns, How can God hold the sinner responsible
          for failing to do what he is unable to do? This necessitates a careful
          definition of terms. Just what is meant by "unable" and "cannot"?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now let it be clearly understood that when we speak of the sinner's
          inability, we do not mean that if men desired to come to Christ they
          lack the necessary power to carry out their desire. No; the fact is
          that the sinner's inability or absence of power is itself due to lack
          of willingness to come to Christ, and this lack of willingness is the
          fruit of a depraved heart. It is of first importance that we
          distinguish between natural inability and moral and spiritual
          inability. For example, we read, "But Ahijah could not see; for his
          eyes were set by reason of his age" (1 Kings 14:4); and again, "The
          men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the
          sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them" (Jonah 1:13). In both
          of these passages the words "could not" refer to natural inability.
          But when we read, "And when his brethren saw that their father loved
          him (Joseph) more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not
          speak peaceably unto him" (Gen. 37:4), it is clearly moral inability
          that is in view. They did not lack the natural ability to "speak
          peaceably unto him" for they were not dumb. Why then was it that they
          "could not speak peaceably unto him"? The answer is given in the same
          verse: it was because "they hated him." Again; in 2 Peter 2:14 we read
          of a certain class of wicked men "having eyes full of adultery, and
          that cannot cease from sin." Here again it is moral inability that is
          in view. Why is it that these men "cannot cease from sin"? The answer
          is, Because their eyes were full of adultery. So of Romans 8:8-"They
          that are in the flesh cannot please God": here is spiritual inability.
          Why is it that the natural man "cannot please God"? Because he is
          "alienated from the life of God" (Eph. 4:18). No man can choose that
          from which his heart is averse-"O generation of vipers, how can ye,
          being evil, speak good things?" (Matt. 12:34). "No man can come to Me,
          except the Father which hath sent Me draw him" (John 6:44). Here again
          it is moral and spiritual inability which is before us. Why is it the
          sinner cannot come to Christ unless he is "drawn"? The answer is,
          Because his wicked heart loves sin and hates Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          We trust we have made it clear that the Scriptures distinguish sharply
          between natural ability and moral and spiritual inability. Surely all
          can see the difference between the blindness of Bartimaeus, who was
          ardently desirous of receiving his sight, and the Pharisees, whose
          eyes were closed "lest at any time they should see with their eyes,
          and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and
          should be converted" (Matt. 13:15). But should it be said, "The
          natural man could come to Christ if he wished to do so," we answer,
          Ah! but in that IF lies the hinge of the whole matter. The inability
          of the sinner consists of the want of moral power to wish and will so
          as to actually perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we have contended for above is of first importance. Upon the
          distinction between the sinner's natural Ability, and his moral and
          spiritual Inability rests his Responsibility. The depravity of the
          human heart does not destroy man's accountability to God; so far from
          this being the case the very moral inability of the sinner only serves
          to increase his guilt. This is easily proven by a reference to the
          Scriptures cited above. We read that Joseph's brethren "could not
          speak peaceably unto him," and why? It was because they "hated" him.
          But was this moral inability of theirs any excuse? Surely not: in this
          very moral inability consisted the greatness of their sin. So of those
          concerning whom it is said, "They cannot cease from sin" (2 Peter
          2:14), and why? Because "their eyes were full of adultery," but that
          only made their case worse. It was a real fact that they could not
          cease from sin, yet this did not excuse them-it only made their sin
          the greater.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should some sinner here object, I cannot help being born into this
          world with a depraved heart and therefore I am not responsible for my
          moral and spiritual inability which accrue from it, the reply would
          be, Responsibility and Culpability He in the indulgence of the
          depraved propensities, the free indulgence, for God does not force any
          to sin. Men might pity me but they certainly would not excuse me if I
          gave vent to a fiery temper and then sought to extenuate myself on the
          ground of having inherited that temper from my parents. Their own
          common sense is sufficient to guide their judgment in such a case as
          this. They would argue I was responsible to restrain my temper. Why
          then cavil against this same principle in the case supposed above?
          "Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee thou wicked servant" surely
          applies here! What would the reader say to a man who had robbed him
          and who later argued in defense, "I cannot help being a thief, that is
          my nature"? Surely the reply would be, Then the penitentiary is the
          proper place for that man. What then shall be said to the one who
          argues that he cannot help following the bent of his sinful heart?
          Surely, that the Lake of Fire is where such an one must go. Did ever a
          murderer plead that he hated his victim so much that he could not go
          near him without slaying him. Would not that only magnify the enormity
          of his crime! Then what of the one who loves sin so much that he is at
          "enmity against God"!
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact of man's responsibility is almost universally acknowledged.
          It is inherent in man's moral nature. It is not only taught in
          Scripture but witnessed to by the natural conscience. The basis or
          ground of human responsibility is human ability. What is implied by
          this general term "ability" must now be defined. Perhaps a concrete
          example will be more easily grasped by the average reader than an
          abstract argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose a man owed me $100 and could find plenty of money for his own
          pleasures but none for me, yet pleaded that he was unable to pay me.
          What would I say? I would say that the only ability that was lacking
          was an honest heart. But would it not be an unfair construction of my
          words if a friend of my dishonest debtor should say I had stated that
          an honest heart was that which constituted the ability to pay the
          debt? No; I would reply: the ability of my debtor lies in the power of
          his hand to write me a check, and this he has, but what is lacking is
          an honest principle. It is his power to write me a check which makes
          him responsible to do so, and the fact that he lacks an honest heart
          does not destroy his accountability.* Now, in like manner, the sinner
          while altogether lacking in moral and spiritual ability does,
          nevertheless, possess natural ability, and this it is which renders
          him accountable unto God. Men have the same natural faculties to love
          God with as they have to hate Him with, the same hearts to believe
          with as to disbelieve, and it is their failure to love and believe
          which constitutes their guilt. An idiot or an infant is not personally
          responsible to God, because lacking in natural ability. But the normal
          man who is endowed with rationality, who is gifted with a conscience
          that is capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, who is able
          to weigh eternal issues IS a responsible being, and it is because he
          does possess these very faculties that he will yet have to "give an
          account of himself to God" (Rom. 14:12). We say again that the above
          distinction between the natural ability and the moral and spiritual
          inability of the sinner is of prime importance. By nature he possesses
          natural ability but lacks moral and spiritual ability. The fact that
          he does not possess the latter does not destroy his responsibility,
          because his responsibility rests upon the fact that he does possess
          the former. Let me illustrate again. Here are two men guilty of theft:
          the first is an idiot, the second perfectly sane but the offspring of
          criminal parents. No just judge would sentence the former; but every
          right-minded judge would the latter. Even though the second of these
          thieves possessed a vitiated moral nature inherited from criminal
          parents that would not excuse him, providing he was a normal rational
          being. Here then is the ground of human accountability-the possession
          of rationality plus the gift of conscience. It is because the sinner
          is endowed with these natural faculties that he is a responsible
          creature; because he does not use his natural powers for God's glory,
          constitutes his guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can it remain consistent with His mercy that God should require
          the debt of obedience from him that is not able to pay? In addition to
          what has been said above it should be pointed out that God has not
          lost His right, even though man has lost his power. The creature's
          impotence does not cancel his obligation. A drunken servant is a
          servant still, and it is contrary to all sound reasoning to argue that
          his master loses his rights through his servant's default. Moreover,
          it is of first importance that we should ever bear in mind that God
          contracted with us in Adam, who was our federal head and
          representative, and in him God gave us a power which we lost through
          our first parent's fall; but though our power is gone, nevertheless,
          God may justly demand His due of obedience and of service.
        </p>
        <p>We turn now to ponder,</p>
        <p>
          3. How is it possible for God to DECREE that men SHOULD commit certain
          sins, hold them RESPONSIBLE in the committal of them, and adjudge them
          GUILTY because they committed them?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now consider the extreme case of Judas. We hold that it is
          clear from Scripture that God decreed from all eternity that Judas
          should betray the Lord Jesus. If anyone should challenge this
          statement we refer him to the prophecy of Zechariah through whom God
          declared that His Son should be sold for "thirty pieces of silver"
          (Zech. 11:12). As we have said in earlier pages, in prophecy God makes
          known what will be, and in making known what will be He is but
          revealing to us what He has ordained shall be. That Judas was the one
          through whom the prophecy of Zechariah was fulfilled needs not to be
          argued. But now the question we have to face is, Was Judas a
          responsible agent in fulfilling this decree of God? We reply that he
          was. Responsibility attaches mainly to the motive and intention of the
          one committing the act. This is recognized on every hand. Human law
          distinguishes between a blow inflicted by accident (without evil
          design) and a blow delivered with 'malice aforethought.' Apply then
          this same principle to the case of Judas. What was the design of his
          heart when he bargained with the priests? Manifestly he had no
          conscious desire to fulfill any decree of God, though unknown to
          himself he was actually doing so. On the contrary, his intention was
          evil only, and therefore, though God had decreed and directed his act,
          nevertheless his own evil intention rendered him justly guilty as he
          afterwards acknowledged himself-"I have betrayed innocent blood." It
          was the same with the Crucifixion of Christ. Scripture plainly
          declares that He was "delivered by the determinate counsel and
          foreknowledge of God" (Acts 2:23), and that though "the kings of the
          earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the
          Lord, and against His Christ" yet, notwithstanding it was but "for to
          do whatsoever Thy hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done"
          (Acts 4:26, 28); which verses teach very much more than a bare
          permission by God, declaring, as they do, that the Crucifixion and all
          its details had been decreed by God. Yet, nevertheless, it was by
          "wicked hands," not merely "human hands" that our Lord was "crucified
          and slain" (Acts 2:23). "Wicked" because the intention of His
          crucifiers was only evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it might be objected that if God decreed that Judas should betray
          Christ, and that the Jews and Gentiles should crucify Him they could
          not do otherwise, and therefore, they were not responsible for their
          intentions. The answer is, God had decreed that they should perform
          the acts they did, but in the actual perpetration of these deeds they
          were justly guilty because their own purposes in the doing of them was
          evil only. Let it be emphatically said that God does not produce the
          sinful dispositions of any of His creatures, though He does restrain
          and direct them to the accomplishing of His own purposes. Hence He is
          neither the Author nor the Approver of sin. This distinction was
          expressed thus by Augustine: "That men sin proceeds from themselves;
          that in sinning they perform this or that action, is from the power of
          God who divideth the darkness according to His pleasure." Thus it is
          written, "A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his
          steps" (Prov. 16:9). What we would here insist upon is, that God's
          decrees are not the necessitating cause of the sins of men but the
          fore-determined and prescribed boundings and directings of men's
          sinful acts. In connection with the betrayal of Christ God did not
          decree that He should be sold by one of His creatures and then take up
          a good man, instill an evil desire into his heart and thus force him
          to perform the terrible deed in order to execute His decree. No; not
          so do the Scriptures represent it. Instead, God decreed the act and
          selected the one who was to perform the act, but He did not make him
          evil in order that he should perform the deed; on the contrary, the
          betrayer was a "devil" at the time the Lord Jesus chose him as one of
          the twelve (John 6:70), and in the exercise and manifestation of his
          own deviltry God simply directed his actions, actions which were
          perfectly agreeable to his own vile heart, and performed with the most
          wicked intentions. Thus it was with the Crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. How can the sinner be held responsible to receive Christ, and be
          damned for rejecting Him, when God FOREORDAINED him TO condemnation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Really, this question has been covered in what has been said under the
          other queries, but for the benefit of those who are exercised upon
          this point we give it a separate, though brief, examination. In
          considering the above difficulty the following points should be
          carefully weighed:
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, no sinner, while he is in this world, knows for
          certain, nor can he know, that he is a "vessel of wrath fitted to
          destruction." This belongs to the hidden counsels of God to which he
          has not access. God's secret will is no business of his; God's
          revealed will (in the Word) is the standard of human responsibility. *
          And God's revealed will is plain. Each sinner is among those whom God
          now "commandeth to repent" (Acts 17:30). Each sinner who hears the
          Gospel is "commanded" to believe (1 John 3:23). And all who do truly
          repent and believe are saved. Therefore, is every sinner responsible
          to repent and believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second place, it is the duty of every sinner to search the
          Scriptures which "are able to make thee wise unto salvation" (2 Tim.
          3:15). It is the sinner's "duty" because the Son of God has commanded
          him to search the Scriptures (John 5:39). If he searches them with a
          heart that is seeking after God then does he put himself in the way
          where God is accustomed to meet with sinners. Upon this point the
          Puritan Manton has written very helpfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I cannot say to every one that ploweth, infallibly, that he shall
          have a good crop; but this I can say to him, It is God's use to bless
          the diligent and provident. I cannot say to every one that desireth
          posterity, Marry, and you shall have children; I cannot say infallibly
          to him that goeth forth to battle for his country's good that he shall
          have victory and success; but I can say, as Joab (1 Chron. 19:13) 'Be
          of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people
          and the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in
          His sight.' I cannot say infallibly you shall have grace; but I can
          say to every one, Let him use the means, and leave the success of his
          labor and his own salvation to the will and good pleasure of God. I
          cannot say this infallibly, for there is no obligation upon God. And
          still this work is made the fruit of God's will and mere arbitrary
          dispensation-'Of His own will begat He us by the Word of Truth' (James
          1:18). Let us do what God hath commanded, and let God do what He will.
          And I need not say so; for the whole world in all their actings are
          and should be guided by this principle. Let us do our duty, and refer
          the success to God, Whose ordinary practice is to meet with the
          creature that seeketh after Him; yea, He is with us already; this
          earnest importunity in the use of means proceeding from the earnest
          impression of His grace. And therefore, since He is beforehand with
          us, and hath not showed any backwardness to our good, we have no
          reason to despair of His goodness and mercy, but rather to hope for
          the best" (Vol. XXI, page 312).
        </p>
        <p>
          God has been pleased to give to men the Holy Scriptures which
          "testify" of the Saviour, and make known the way of salvation. Every
          sinner has the same natural faculties for the reading of the Bible as
          he has for the reading of the newspaper; and if he is illiterate or
          blind so that he is unable to read he has the same mouth with which to
          ask a friend to read the Bible to him, as he has to enquire concerning
          other matters. If, then, God has given to men His Word, and in that
          Word has made known the way of salvation, and if men are commanded to
          search those Scriptures which are able to make them wise unto
          salvation, and they refuse to do so, then it is plain that they are
          justly censureable, that their blood lies on their own heads, and that
          God can righteously cast them into the Lake of Fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third place, should it be objected, Admitting all you have said
          above, Is it not still a fact that each of the non-elect is unable to
          repent and believe? The reply is, Yes. Of every sinner it is a fact
          that, of himself, he cannot come to Christ. And from God's side the
          "cannot" is absolute. But we are now dealing with the responsibility
          of the sinner (the sinner foreordained to condemnation, though he
          knows it not), and from the human side the inability of the sinner is
          a moral one, as previously pointed out. Moreover, it needs to be borne
          in mind that in addition to the moral inability of the sinner there is
          a voluntary inability, too. The sinner must be regarded not only as
          impotent to do good but as delighting in evil. From the human side,
          then, the "cannot" is a will not; it is a voluntary impotence. Man's
          impotence lies in his obstinacy. Hence, is everyone left "without
          excuse," and hence, is God "clear" when He judgeth (Psa. 51:4), and
          righteous in damning all who "love darkness rather than light."
        </p>
        <p>
          That God does require what is beyond our own power to render is clear
          from many Scriptures. God gave the Law to Israel at Sinai and demanded
          a full compliance with it, and solemnly pointed out what would be the
          consequences of their disobedience (see Deut. 28). But will any
          readers be so foolish as to affirm that Israel were capable of fully
          obeying the Law! If they do, we would refer them to Romans 8:3 where
          we are expressly told, "For what the law could not do, in that it was
          weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of
          sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
        </p>
        <p>
          Come now to the New Testament. Take such passages as Matthew 5:48, "Be
          ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is
          perfect." 1 Corinthians 15:34. "Awake to righteousness, and sin not."
          1 John 2:1, "My little children, these things write I unto you, that
          ye sin not." Will any reader say he is capable in himself of complying
          with these demands of God? If so, it is useless for us to argue with
          him.

          But now the question arises, Why has God demanded of man that which he
          is incapable of performing? The first answer is, Because God refuses
          to lower His standard to the level of our sinful infirmities. Being
          perfect, God must set a perfect standard before us. Still we must ask,
          If man is incapable of measuring up to God's standard, wherein lies
          his responsibility? Difficult as it seems the problem is nevertheless
          capable of simple and satisfactory solution.

          Man is responsible to (first) acknowledge before God his inability,
          and (second) to cry unto Him for enabling grace. Surely this will be
          admitted by every Christian reader. It is my bounden duty to own
          before God my ignorance, my weakness, my sinfulness, my impotence to
          comply with His holy and just requirements. It is also my bounden
          duty, as well as blessed privilege, to earnestly beseech God to give
          me the wisdom, strength, grace, which will enable me to do that which
          is pleasing in His sight; to ask Him to work in me "both to will and
          to do of His good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13).
        </p>
        <p>
          In like manner, the sinner, every sinner, is responsible to call upon
          the Lord. Of himself he can neither repent nor believe. He can neither
          come to Christ nor turn from his sins. God tells him so; and his first
          duty is to "set to his seal that God is true." His second duty is to
          cry unto God for His enabling power; to ask God in mercy to overcome
          his enmity and "draw" him to Christ; to bestow upon him the gifts of
          repentance and faith. If he will do so, sincerely from the heart, then
          most surely God will respond to his appeal, for it is written, "For
          whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Rom.
          10:13).

          Suppose I had slipped on the icy pavement late at night, and had
          broken my hip. I am unable to arise; if I remain on the ground I must
          freeze to death. What, then, ought I to do? If I am determined to
          perish I shall He there silent; but I shall be to blame for such a
          course. If I am anxious to be rescued I shall lift up my voice and cry
          for help. So the sinner, though unable of himself to rise and take the
          first step toward Christ, is responsible to cry to God, and if he does
          (from the heart) there is a Deliverer to hand. God is "not far from
          every one of us" (Acts 17:27); yea, He is "a very present help in
          trouble" (Psa. 46:1). But if the sinner refuses to cry unto the Lord,
          if he is determined to perish, then his blood is on his own head, and
          his "damnation is just" (Rom. 3:8).
        </p>
        <p>A brief word now concerning the extent of human responsibility.</p>
        <p>
          It is obvious that the measure of human responsibility varies in
          different cases, and is greater or less with particular individuals.
          The standard of measurement was given in the Saviour's words, "For
          unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required" (Luke
          12:48). Surely God did not require as much from those living in Old
          Testament times as He does from those who have been born during the
          Christian dispensation. Surely God will not require as much from those
          who lived during the 'dark ages,' when the Scriptures were accessible
          to but a few, as He will from those of this generation when
          practically every family in the land owns a copy of His Word for
          themselves. In the same way, God will not demand from the heathen what
          He will from those in Christendom. The heathen will not perish because
          they have not believed in Christ, but because they failed to live up
          to the light which they did have-the testimony of God in nature and
          conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sum up. The fact of man's responsibility rests upon his natural
          ability, is witnessed to by conscience, and is insisted on throughout
          the Scriptures. The ground of man's responsibility is that he is a
          rational creature capable of weighing eternal issues, and that he
          possesses a written Revelation from God in which his relationship with
          and duty toward his Creator is plainly defined. The measure of
          responsibility varies in different individuals, being determined by
          the degree of light each has enjoyed from God. The problem of human
          responsibility receives at least a partial solution in the Holy
          Scriptures, and it is our solemn obligation as well as privilege to
          search them prayerfully and carefully for further light, looking to
          the Holy Spirit to guide us "into all truth." It is written, "The meek
          will He guide in judgment: and the meek will He teach His way" (Psa.
          25:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion it remains to point out that it is the responsibility of
          every man to use the means which God has placed to his hand. An
          attitude of fatalistic inertia, because I know that God has
          irrevocably decreed whatsoever comes to pass, is to make a sinful and
          hurtful use of what God has revealed for the comfort of my heart. The
          same God who has decreed that a certain end shall be accomplished has
          also decreed that that end shall be attained through and as the result
          of His own appointed means. God does not disdain the use of means, nor
          must I. For example: God has decreed that "while the earth remaineth,
          seedtime and harvest... shall not cease" (Gen. 8:22); but that does
          not mean man's ploughing of the ground and sowing of the seed are
          needless. No; God moves men to do those very things, blesses their
          labours, and so fulfills His own ordination. In like manner, God has,
          from the beginning, chosen a people unto salvation; but that does not
          mean there is no need for evangelists to preach the Gospel, or for
          sinners to believe it; it is by such means that His eternal counsels
          are effectuated.
        </p>
        <p>
          To argue that because God has irrevocably determined the eternal
          destiny of every man, relieves us of all responsibility for any
          concern about our souls, or any diligent use of the means to
          salvation, would be on a par with refusing to perform my temporal
          duties because God has fixed my earthly lot. And that He has is clear
          from Acts 17:26; Job 7:1; 14:15, etc. If then the foreordination of
          God may consist with the respective activities of man in present
          concerns, why not in the future? What God has joined together we must
          not cut asunder. Whether we can or cannot see the link which unites
          the one to the other our duty is plain: "The secret things belong unto
          the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us
          and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law"
          (Deut. 29:29).
        </p>
        <p>
          In Acts 27:22 God made known that He had ordained the temporal
          preservation of all who accompanied Paul in the ship; yet the Apostle
          did not hesitate to say, "Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be
          saved" (v. 31). God appointed that means for the execution of what He
          had decreed. From 2 Kings 20 we learn that God was absolutely resolved
          to add fifteen years to Hezekiah's life, yet he must take a lump of
          figs and lay it on his boil! Paul knew that he was eternally secure in
          the hand of Christ (John 10:28), yet he "kept under his body" (1 Cor.
          9:27). The Apostle John assured those to whom he wrote, "Ye shall
          abide in Him," yet in the very next verse he exhorted them, "And now,
          little children, abide in Him" (1 John 2:27, 28). It is only by taking
          heed to this vital principle, that we are responsible to use the means
          of God's appointing, that we shall be enabled to preserve the balance
          of Truth and be saved from a paralyzing fatalism.
