        <h2>10 - Our Attitude Toward His Sovereignty</h2>
        <p>
          "Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in Thy sight" (Matt. 11:26).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the present chapter we shall consider, somewhat briefly, the
          practical application to ourselves of the great truth which we have
          pondered in its various ramifications in earlier pages. In chapter
          twelve we shall deal more in detail with the value of this doctrine
          but here we would confine ourselves to a definition of what ought to
          be our attitude toward the Sovereignty of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every truth that is revealed to us in God's Word is there not only for
          our information but also for our inspiration. The Bible has been given
          to us not to gratify an idle curiosity but to edify the souls of its
          readers. The Sovereignty of God is something more than an abstract
          principle which explains the rationale of the Divine government: it is
          designed as a motive for godly fear, it is made known to us for the
          promotion of righteous living, it is revealed in order to bring into
          subjection our rebellious hearts. A true recognition of God's
          Sovereignty humbles as nothing else does or can humble, and brings the
          heart into lowly submission before God, causing us to relinquish our
          own self-will and making us delight in the perception and performance
          of the Divine will.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we speak of the Sovereignty of God we mean very much more than
          the exercise of God's governmental power, though, of course, that is
          included in the expression. As we have remarked in an earlier chapter,
          the Sovereignty of God means the Godhood of God. In its fullest and
          deepest meaning the title of this book signifies the Character and
          Being of the One whose pleasure is performed and whose will is
          executed. To truly recognize the Sovereignty of God is, therefore, to
          gaze upon the Sovereign Himself. It is to come into the presence of
          the august "Majesty on high." It is to have a sight of the thrice holy
          God in His excellent glory. The ef ects of such a sight may be learned
          from those Scriptures which describe the experience of different ones
          who obtained a view of the Lord God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark the experience of Job-the one of whom the Lord Himself said
          "There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
          one that feareth God, and escheweth evil" (Job 1:8). At the close of
          the book which bears his name we are shown Job in the Divine presence,
          and how does he carry himself when brought face to face with Jehovah?
          Hear what he says: "I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear;
          but now mine eye seeth Thee: Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in
          dust and ashes" (Job 42:5, 6). Thus, a sight of God, God revealed in
          awesome majesty, caused Job to abhor himself, and not only so, but to
          abase himself before the Almighty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take note of Isaiah. In the sixth chapter of his prophecy a scene is
          brought before us which has few equals even in Scripture. The prophet
          beholds the Lord upon the Throne, a Throne "high and lifted up." Above
          this Throne stood the seraphims with veiled faces, crying, "Holy,
          holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts." What is the ef ect of this sight
          upon the prophet? We read "Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone;
          because I am a man of unclean lips:... for mine eyes have seen the
          King, the LORD of hosts" (Isa. 6:5). A sight of the Divine King
          humbled Isaiah into the dust, bringing him, as it did, to a
          realization of his own nothingness.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more. Look at the prophet Daniel. Toward the close of his life
          this man of God beheld the Lord in theophanic manifestation. He
          appeared to His servant in human form "clothed in linen" and with
          loins "girded with fine gold," symbolic of holiness and Divine glory.
          We read that "His body also was like the beryl, and His face as the
          appearance of lightning, and His eyes as lamps of fire, and His arms
          and His feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of His
          words like the voice of a multitude." Daniel then tells the effect
          this vision had upon him and those who were with him: "And I Daniel
          alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the
          vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide
          themselves. Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and
          there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me
          into corruption, and I retained no strength. Yet heard I the voice of
          His words: and when I heard the voice of His words, then was I in a
          deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground" (Dan. 10:6-9).
          Once more, then, we are shown that to obtain a sight of the Sovereign
          God is for creature strength to wither up, and results in man being
          humbled into the dust before his Maker. What then ought to be our
          attitude toward the Supreme Sovereign? We reply,
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. ONE OF GODLY FEAR.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is it that, today, the masses are so utterly unconcerned about
          spiritual and eternal things, and that they are lovers of pleasure
          more than lovers of God? Why is it that even on the battlefields
          multitudes were so indifferent to their soul's welfare? Why is it that
          defiance of Heaven is becoming more open, more blatant, more daring?
          The answer is, Because "There is no fear of God before their eyes"
          (Rom. 3:18). Again; why is it that the authority of the Scriptures has
          been lowered so sadly of late? Why is it that even among those who
          profess to be the Lord's people there is so little real subjection to
          His Word, and that its precepts are so lightly esteemed and so readily
          set aside? Ah! what needs to be stressed today is that God is a God to
          be feared.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge" (Prov. 1:7).
          Happy the soul that has been awed by a view of God's majesty, that has
          had a vision of God's awful greatness, His ineffable holiness, His
          perfect righteousness, His irresistible power, His Sovereign grace.
          Does someone say, "But it is only the unsaved, those outside of
          Christ, who need to fear God"? Then the sufficient answer is that the
          saved, those who are in Christ, are admonished to work out their own
          salvation with "fear and trembling." Time was when it was the general
          custom to speak of a believer as a "God-fearing man"-that such an
          appellation has become nearly extinct only serves to show whither we
          have drifted. Nevertheless, it still stands written "Like as a father
          pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear Him" (Psa.
          103:13)!
        </p>
        <p>
          When we speak of godly fear, of course, we do not mean a servile fear,
          such as prevails among the heathen in connection with their gods. No;
          we mean that spirit which Jehovah is pledged to bless, that spirit to
          which the prophet referred when he said "To this man will I (the Lord)
          look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth
          at My Word" (Isa. 66:2). It was this the Apostle had in view when he
          wrote, "Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king"
          (1 Peter 2:17). And nothing will foster this godly fear like a
          recognition of the Sovereign Majesty of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          What ought to be our attitude toward the Sovereignty of God? We answer
          again,
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. ONE OF IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A sight of God leads to a realization of our littleness and
          nothingness and issues in a sense of dependency and of casting
          ourselves upon God. Or, again; a view of the Divine Majesty promotes
          the spirit of godly fear and this, in turn, begets an obedient walk.
          Here then is the Divine antidote for the native evil of our hearts.
          Naturally, man is filled with a sense of his own importance, with his
          greatness and self-sufficiency; in a word, with pride and rebellion.
          But, as we remarked, the great corrective is to behold the Mighty God,
          for this alone will really humble him. Man will glory either in
          himself or in God. Man will live either to serve and please himself,
          or he will seek to serve and please the Lord. None can serve two
          masters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Irreverence begets disobedience. Said the haughty monarch of Egypt
          "Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I know
          not the LORD; neither will I let Israel go" (Exo. 5:2). To Pharaoh,
          the God of the Hebrews was merely a god, one among many, a powerless
          entity who needed not to be feared or served. How sadly mistaken he
          was, and how bitterly he had to pay for his mistake he soon
          discovered; but what we are here seeking to emphasize is that
          Pharaoh's defiant spirit was the fruit of irreverence, and this
          irreverence was the consequence of his ignorance of the majesty and
          authority of the Divine Being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if irreverence begets disobedience, true reverence will produce
          and promote obedience. To realize that the Holy Scriptures are a
          revelation from the Most High, communicating to us His mind and
          defining for us His will, is the first step toward practical
          godliness. To recognize that the Bible is God's Word, and that its
          precepts are the precepts of the Almighty, will lead us to see what an
          awful thing it is to despise and ignore them. To receive the Bible as
          addressed to our own souls, given to us by the Creator Himself, will
          cause us to cry with the Psalmist, "Incline my heart unto Thy
          testimonies...Order my steps in Thy Word" (Psa. 119: 36, 133). Once
          the Sovereignty of the Author of the Word is apprehended it will not
          longer be a matter of picking and choosing from the precepts and
          statutes of that Word, selecting those which meet with our approval;
          but it will be seen that nothing less than an unqualified and
          whole-hearted submission becomes the creature.
        </p>
        <p>What ought to be our attitude toward the Sovereignty of God?</p>
        <p>
          <b>3. ONE OF ENTIRE RESIGNATION.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A true recognition of God's Sovereignty will exclude all murmuring.
          This is self-evident, yet the thought deserves to be dwelt upon. It is
          natural to murmur against afflictions and losses. It is natural to
          complain when we are deprived of those thing upon which we had set our
          hearts. We are apt to regard our possessions as ours unconditionally.
          We feel that when we have prosecuted our plans with prudence and
          diligence that we are entitled to success; that when by dint of hard
          work we have accumulated a 'competence' we deserve to keep and enjoy
          it; that when we are surrounded by a happy family no power may
          lawfully enter the charmed circle and strike down a loved one; and if
          in any of these cases disappointment, bankruptcy, death, actually
          comes, the perverted instinct of the human heart is to cry out against
          God. But in the one who, by grace, has recognized God's Sovereignty,
          such murmuring is silenced, and instead, there is a bowing to the
          Divine will and an acknowledgment that He has not afflicted us as
          sorely as we deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
          A true recognition of God's Sovereignty will avow God's perfect right
          to do with us as He wills. The one who bows to the pleasure of the
          Almighty will acknowledge His absolute right to do with us as seemeth
          Him good. If He chooses to send poverty, sickness, domestic
          bereavements, even while the heart is bleeding at every pore, it will
          say, Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right! Often there will
          be a struggle, for the carnal mind remains in the believer to the end
          of his earthly pilgrimage. But though there may be a conflict within
          his breast, nevertheless, to the one who has really yielded himself to
          this blessed truth there will presently be heard that Voice saying, as
          of old it said to the turbulent Gennesareth, "Peace be still"; and the
          tempestuous flood within will be quieted and the subdued soul will
          lift a tearful but confident eye to Heaven and say, "Thy will be
          done."
        </p>
        <p>
          A striking illustration of a soul bowing to the Sovereign will of God
          is furnished by the history of Eli the high priest of Israel. In 1
          Samuel 3 we learn how God revealed to the young child Samuel that He
          was about to slay Eli's two sons for their wickedness, and on the
          morrow Samuel communicates this message to the aged priest. It is
          difficult to conceive of more appalling intelligence for the heart of
          a pious parent. The announcement that his child is going to be
          stricken down by sudden death is, under any circumstances, a great
          trial to any father, but to learn that his two sons-in the prime of
          their manhood, and utterly unprepared to die-were to be cut off by a
          Divine judgment must have been overwhelming. Yet, what was the effect
          upon Eli when he learned from Samuel the tragic tidings? What reply
          did he make when he heard the awful news? "And he said, It is the
          LORD: let Him do what seemeth Him good" (1 Sam. 3:18). And not another
          word escaped him. Wonderful submission! Sublime resignation! Lovely
          exemplification of the power of Divine grace to control the strongest
          affections of the human heart and subdue the rebellious will, bringing
          it into unrepining acquiescence to the Sovereign pleasure of Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example, equally striking, is seen in the life of Job. As is
          well known, Job was one that feared God and eschewed evil. If ever
          there was one who might reasonably expect Divine providence to smile
          upon him-we speak as a man-it was Job. Yet, how fared it with him? For
          a time the lines fell unto him in pleasant places. The Lord filled his
          quiver by giving him seven sons and three daughters. He prospered him
          in his temporal affairs until he owned great possessions. But of a
          sudden the sun of life was hidden behind dark clouds. In a single day
          Job lost not only his flocks and herds but his sons and daughters as
          well. News arrived that his cattle had been carried off by robbers,
          and his children slain by a cyclone. And how did he receive this
          intelligence? Hearken to his sublime words: "The LORD gave, and the
          LORD hath taken away." He bowed to the Sovereign will of Jehovah. He
          traced his afflictions back to their First Cause. He looked behind the
          Sabeans who had stolen his cattle, and beyond the winds that had
          destroyed his children, and saw the hand of God. But not only did Job
          recognize God's Sovereignty, he rejoiced in it, too. To the words,
          "The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away," he added, "blessed be
          the name of the LORD" (Job 1:21). Again we say, Sweet submission!
          Sublime resignation!
        </p>
        <p>
          A true recognition of God's Sovereignty causes us to hold our every
          plan in abeyance to God's will. The writer well recalls an incident
          which occurred in England over twenty years ago. Queen Victoria was
          dead, and the date for the coronation of her eldest son, Edward, had
          been set for April 1902. In all the announcements which were sent out,
          two little letters were omitted, D. V.-Deo Volente: God willing. Plans
          were made and all arrangements completed for the most imposing
          celebrations that England had ever witnessed. Kings and emperors from
          all parts of the earth had received invitations to attend the royal
          ceremony. The Prince's proclamations were printed and displayed, but,
          so far as the writer is aware, the letters D. V. were not found on a
          single one of them. A most imposing program had been arranged, and the
          late Queen's eldest son was to be crowned Edward the Seventh at
          Westminster Abbey at a certain hour on a fixed day. And then God
          intervened and all man's plans were frustrated. A still small voice
          was heard to say, "You have reckoned without Me," and Prince Edward
          was stricken down with appendicitis, and his coronation postponed for
          months!
        </p>
        <p>
          As remarked, a true recognition of God's Sovereignty causes us to hold
          our plan in abeyance to God's will. It makes us recognize that the
          Divine Potter has absolute power over the clay and molds it according
          to his own imperial pleasure. It causes us to heed that
          admonition-now, alas! so generally disregarded-"Go to now, ye that
          say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there
          a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: Whereas ye know not what shall
          be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that
          appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. For that ye
          ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that"
          (James 4:13-15). Yes, it is to the Lord's will we must bow. It is for
          Him to say where I shall live, whether in America or Africa. It is for
          Him to determine under what circumstances I shall live, whether amid
          wealth or poverty, whether in health or sickness. It is for Him to say
          how long I shall live, whether I shall be cut down in youth like the
          flower of the field, or whether I shall continue for three score and
          ten years. To really learn this lesson is, by grace, to attain unto a
          high form in the school of God, and even when we think we have learned
          it we discover, again and again, that we have to relearn it.
        </p>
        <p>What ought to be our attitude toward the Sovereignty of God?</p>
        <p>
          <b>4. ONE OF DEEP THANKFULNESS AND JOY.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The heart's apprehension of this most blessed truth of the Sovereignty
          of God produces something far different than a sullen bowing to the
          inevitable. The philosophy of this perishing world knows nothing
          better than to "make the best of a bad job." But with the Christian it
          should be far otherwise. Not only should the recognition of God's
          supremacy beget within us godly fear, implicit obedience, and entire
          resignation, but it should cause us to say with the Psalmist, "Bless
          the Lord, Omy soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name."
          Does not the Apostle say, "Giving thanks always for all things unto
          God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Eph. 5:20)?
          Ah! it is at this point the state of our souls is so often put to the
          test. Alas, there is so much self-will in each of us. When things go
          as we wish them we appear to be very grateful to God; but what of
          those occasions when things go contrary to our plans and desires?
        </p>
        <p>
          We take it for granted when the real Christian takes a train-journey
          that, upon reaching his destination, he devoutly returns thanks unto
          God-which, of course, argues that He controls everything; otherwise,
          we ought to thank the engine-driver, the stoker, the signalmen, etc.
          Or, if in business, at the close of a good week, gratitude is
          expressed unto the Giver of every good (temporal) and every perfect
          (spiritual) gift-which again, argues that He directs all customers to
          your shop. So far, so good. Such examples occasion no difficulty. But
          imagine the opposites. Suppose my train was delayed for hours, did I
          fret and fume; suppose another train ran into it and I am injured! Or,
          suppose I have had a poor week in business, or that lightning struck
          my shop and set it on fire, or that burglars broke in and rifled it,
          then what: do I see the hand of God in these things?
        </p>

          Take the case of Job once more. When loss after loss came his way what
          did he do? Bemoan his "bad luck"? Curse the robbers? Murmur against
          God? No; he bowed before Him in worship. Ah! dear reader, there is no
          real rest for your poor heart until you learn to see the hand of God
          in everything. But for that, faith must be in constant exercise. And
          what is faith? A blind credulity? A fatalistic acquiescence? No, far
          from it. Faith is a resting on the sure Word of the living God, and
          therefore says "We know that all things work together for good to them
          that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose"
          (Rom. 8:28); and therefore faith will give thanks "always for all
          things." Operative faith will "Rejoice in the Lord alway" (Phil. 4:4).

          We turn now to mark how this recognition of God's Sovereignty which is
          expressed in godly fear, implicit obedience, entire resignation, and
          deep thankfulness and joy was supremely and perfectly exemplified by
          the Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>

          In all things the Lord Jesus has left us an example that we should
          follow His steps. But is this true in connection with the first point
          made above? Are the words "godly fear" ever linked with His peerless
          name? Remembering that "godly fear" signifies not a servile terror,
          but rather a filial subjection and reverence, and remembering too that
          "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," would it not rather
          be strange if no mention at all were made of "godly fear" in
          connection with the One who was wisdom incarnate! What a wonderful and
          precious word is that of Hebrews 5:7-"Who in the days of His flesh,
          having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and
          tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death, and having been
          heard for His godly fear" (R. V.). What was it but "godly fear" which
          caused the Lord Jesus to be "subject" unto Mary and Joseph in the days
          of His childhood? Was it "godly fear"-a filial subjection to and
          reverence for God-that we see displayed when we read "And He came to
          Nazareth where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went
          into the synagogue on the Sabbath day" (Luke 4:16)? Was it not "godly
          fear" which caused the incarnate Son to say, when tempted by Satan to
          fall down and worship him, "It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord
          thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve"? Was it not "godly fear" which
          moved Him to say to the cleansed leper, "Go thy way, show thyself to
          the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded" (Matt. 8:4)? But
          why multiply illustrations?
        </p>
        <p>
          How perfect was the obedience that the Lord Jesus offered to God the
          Father! And in reflecting upon this let us not lose sight of that
          wondrous grace which caused Him, who was in the very form of God, to
          stoop so low as to take upon Him the form of a Servant and thus be
          brought into the place where obedience was becoming. As the perfect
          Servant He yielded complete obedience to His Father. How absolute and
          entire that obedience was we may learn from the words He "became
          obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross" (Phil. 2:8). That
          this was a conscious and intelligent obedience is clear from His own
          language: "Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down My
          life, that I might take it again. No man taketh if from Me, but I lay
          it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to
          take it again. This commandment have I received from My Father" (John
          10:17, 18).
        </p>
        <p>
          And what shall we say of the absolute resignation of the Son to the
          Father's will? what, but, between Them there was entire oneness of
          accord. Said He, "For I came down from Heaven, not to do Mine own
          will, but the will of Him that sent Me" (John 6:38), and how fully He
          substantiated that claim all know who have attentively followed His
          path as marked out in the Scriptures. Behold Him in Gethsemane! The
          bitter 'cup,' held in the Father's hand, is presented to His view.
          Mark well His attitude. Learn of Him who was meek and lowly in heart.
          Remember that there in the Garden we see the Word become flesh, a
          perfect Man. His body is quivering at every nerve in contemplation of
          the physical sufferings which await Him; His holy and sensitive nature
          is shrinking from the horrible indignities which shall be heaped upon
          Him; His heart is breaking at the awful "reproach" which is before
          Him; His spirit is greatly troubled as He foresees the terrible
          conflict with the Power of Darkness; and above all, and supremely, His
          soul is filled with horror at the thought of being separated from God
          Himself-thus and there He pours out His soul to the Father, and with
          strong crying and tears He sheds, as it were, great drops of blood.
          And now observe and listen. Still the beating of thy heart and hearken
          to the words which fall from His blessed lips-"Father, if Thou be
          willing, remove this cup from Me: nevertheless, not My will, but Thine
          be done" (Luke 22:42). Here is submission personified. Here is
          resignation to the pleasure of a Sovereign God superlatively
          exemplified. And He has left us an example that we should follow His
          steps. He who was God became man, and was tempted in all points like
          as we are, sin apart, to show us how to wear our creature nature!
        </p>
        <p>
          Above we asked, What shall we say of Christ's absolute resignation to
          the Father's will? We answer further, This, that here, as everywhere,
          He was unique, peerless. In all things He has the preeminence. In the
          Lord Jesus there was no rebellious will to be broken. In His heart
          there was nothing to be subdued. Was not this one reason why, in the
          language of prophecy, He said, "I am a worm, and no man" (Psa. 22:6)-a
          worm has no power of resistance! It was because in Him there was no
          resistance that He could say, "My meat is to do the will of Him that
          sent Me" (John 4:34). Yea, it was because He was in perfect accord
          with the Father in all things that He said, "I delight to do Thy will,
          O God; yea, Thy law is within My heart" (Psa. 40:8). Note the last
          clause here and behold His matchless excellency. God has to put His
          laws into our minds, and write them in our hearts (see Heb. 8:10), but
          His law was already in Christ's heart!
        </p>
        <p>
          What a beautiful and striking illustration of Christ's thankfulness
          and joy is found in Matthew 11. There we behold, first, the failure of
          the faith of His forerunner (vv. 22, 23). Next, we learn of the
          discontent of the people: satisfied neither with Christ's joyous
          message, nor with John's solemn one (vv. 16-20). Third, we have the
          non-repentance of those favoured cities in which our Lord's mightiest
          works were done (vv. 21-24). And then we read, "At that time Jesus
          answered and said, I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth,
          because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
          revealed them unto babes" (v. 25)! Note the parallel passage in Luke
          10:21 opens by saying, "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and
          said, I thank Thee," etc. Ah! here was submission in its purest form.
          Here was One by whom the worlds were made, yet, in the days of His
          humiliation and in the face of His rejection, thankfully and joyously
          bowing to the will of the "Lord of Heaven and earth."
        </p>
        <p>What ought to be our attitude toward God's Sovereignty? Finally,</p>
        <p>
          <b>5. ONE OF ADORING WORSHIP.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been well said that "true worship is based upon recognized
          GREATNESS, and greatness is superlatively seen in Sovereignty, and at
          no other footstool will men really worship" (J. B. Moody). In the
          presence of the Divine King upon His throne even the seraphims 'veil
          their faces.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Divine Sovereignty is not the Sovereignty of a tyrannical Despot, but
          the exercised pleasure of One who is infinitely wise and good! Because
          God is infinitely wise He cannot err, and because He is infinitely
          righteous He will not do wrong. Here then is the preciousness of this
          truth. The mere fact itself that God's will is irresistible and
          irreversible fills me with fear, but once I realize that God wills
          only that which is good my heart is made to rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then is the final answer to the question of this chapter, What
          ought to be our attitude toward the Sovereignty of God? The becoming
          attitude for us to take is that of godly fear, implicit obedience, and
          unreserved resignation and submission. But not only so: the
          recognition of the Sovereignty of God, and the realization that the
          Sovereign Himself is my Father, ought to overwhelm the heart and cause
          me to bow before Him in adoring worship. At all times I must say "Even
          so, Father, for so it seemeth good in Thy sight." We conclude with an
          example which well illustrates our meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some two hundred years ago the saintly Madam Cuyon, after ten years
          spent in a dungeon lying far below the surface of the ground, lit only
          by a candle at meal-times, wrote these words:
        </p>
        <p>
          "A little bird I am,<br />
          Shut from the fields of air;<br />
          Yet in my cage I sit and sing<br />
          To Him who placed me there;<br />
          Well pleased a prisoner to be,<br />
          Because, my God, it pleases Thee.<br />
          Nought have I else to do<br />
          I sing the whole day long;<br />
          And He whom most I love to please,<br />
          Doth listen to my song;<br />
          He caught and bound my wandering wing<br />
          But still He bends to hear me sing.<br />
          My cage confines me round;<br />
          Abroad I cannot fly;<br />
          But though my wing is closely bound,<br />
          My heart's at liberty,<br />
          My prison walls cannot control<br />
          The flight, the freedom of the soul.<br />
          Ah! it is good to soar<br />
          These bolts and bar above,<br />
          To Him whose purpose I adore,<br />
          Whose Providence I love;<br />
          And in Thy mighty will to find<br />
          The joy, the freedom of the mind."
