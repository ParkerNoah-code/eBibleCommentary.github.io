        <h2>God's Sovereignty And Prayer</h2>
        <p>
          If we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us" (1 John
          5:14).
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this book it has been our chief aim to exalt the Creator
          and abase the creature. The well-nigh universal tendency now, is to
          magnify man and dishonor and degrade God. On every hand it will be
          found that, when spiritual things are under discussion, the human side
          and element is pressed and stressed, and the Divine side, if not
          altogether ignored, is relegated to the background. This holds true of
          very much of the modern teaching about prayer. In the great majority
          of the books written and in the sermons preached upon prayer the human
          element fills the scene almost entirely: it is the conditions which w
          e must meet, the promises we must "claim," the things we must do in
          order to get our requests granted; and God's claims, God's rights,
          God's glory are disregarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a fair example of what is being given out today we subjoin a brief
          editorial which appeared recently in one of the leading religious
          weeklies entitled "Prayer, or Fate?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "God in His Sovereignty has ordained that human destinies may be
          changed and molded by the will of man. This is at the heart of the
          truth that prayer changes things, meaning that God changes things when
          men pray. Someone has strikingly expressed it this way: 'There are
          certain things that will happen in a man's life whether he prays or
          not. There are other things that will happen if he prays; and will not
          happen if he does not pray.' A Christian worker was impressed by these
          sentences as he entered a business office and he prayed that the Lord
          would open the way to speak to some one about Christ, reflecting that
          things would be changed because he prayed. Then his mind turned to
          other things and the prayer was forgotten. The opportunity came to
          speak to the business man upon whom he was calling, but he did not
          grasp it, and was on his way out when he remembered his prayer of a
          half hour before, and God's answer. He promptly returned and had a
          talk with the business man, who, though a church-member, had never in
          his life been asked whether he was saved. Let us give ourselves to
          prayer, and open the way for God to change things. Let us beware lest
          we become virtual fatalists by failing to exercise our God-given wills
          in praying."
        </p>
        <p>
          The above illustrates what is being taught on the subject of prayer,
          and the deplorable thing is that scarcely a voice is lifted in
          protest. To say that "human destinies may be changed and molded by the
          will of man" is rank infidelity-that is the only proper term for it.
          Should any one challenge this classification, we would ask them
          whether they can find an infidel anywhere who would dissent from such
          a statement, and we are confident that such an one could not be found.
          To say that "God has ordained that human destinies may be changed and
          molded by the will of man" is absolutely untrue. "Human destiny" is
          settled not by the will of man, but by the will of God. That which
          determines human destiny is whether or not a man has been born again,
          for it is written, "Except a man be born again he cannot see the
          kingdom of God." And as to whose will, whether God's or man's, is
          responsible for the new birth is settled, unequivocally, by John
          1:13-"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
          of the will of man, but OF GOD." To say that "human destiny" may be
          changed by the will of man is to make the creature's will supreme, and
          that is, virtually, to dethrone God. But what saith the Scriptures?
          Let the Book answer: "The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: He bringeth
          down to the grave, and bringeth up. The Lord maketh poor, and maketh
          rich: He bringeth low, and lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of
          the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them
          among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory" (1 Sam.
          2:6-8).
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning back to the Editorial here under review, we are next told,
          "This is at the heart of the truth that prayer changes things, meaning
          that God changes things when men pray." Almost everywhere we go today
          one comes across a motto-card bearing the inscription "Prayer Changes
          Things." As to what these words are designed to signify is evident
          from the current literature on prayerwe are to persuade God to change
          His purpose. Concerning this we shall have more to say below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the Editor tells us, "Some one has strikingly expressed it this
          way: 'There are certain things that will happen in a man's life
          whether he prays or not. There are other things that will happen if he
          prays, and will not happen if he does not pray.'" That things happen
          whether a man prays or not is exemplified daily in the lives of the
          unregenerate, most of whom never pray at all. That 'other things will
          happen if he prays' is in need of qualification. If a believer prays
          in faith and asks for those things which are according to God's will
          he will most certainly obtain that for which he has asked. Again, that
          other things will happen if he prays is also true in respect to the
          subjective benefits derived from prayer: God will become more real to
          him and His promises more precious. That other things 'will not happen
          if he does not pray' is true so far as his own life is concerned-a
          prayerless life means a life lived out of communion with God and all
          that is involved by this. But to affirm that God will not and cannot
          bring to pass His eternal purpose unless we pray is utterly erroneous,
          for the same God who has decreed the end has also decreed that His end
          shall be reached through His appointed means, and One of these is
          prayer. The God who has determined to grant a blessing also gives a
          spirit of supplication which first seeks the blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example cited in the above Editorial of the Christian worker and
          the business man is a very unhappy one to say the least, for according
          to the terms of the illustration the Christian worker's prayer was not
          answered by God at all, inasmuch as, apparently, the way was not
          opened to speak to the business man about his soul. But on leaving the
          office and recalling his prayer the Christian worker (perhaps in the
          energy of the flesh) determined to answer the prayer for himself, and
          instead of leaving the Lord to "open the way" for him, took matters
          into his own hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          We quote next from one of the latest books issued on Prayer. In it the
          author says, "The possibilities and necessity of prayer, its power and
          results, are manifested in arresting and changing the purposes of God
          and in relieving the stroke of His power." Such an assertion as this
          is a horrible reflection upon the character of the Most High God, who
          "doeth according to His will in the army of Heaven, and among the
          inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay His hand, or say unto Him,
          What doest Thou?" (Dan. 4: 35). There is no need whatever for God to
          change His designs or alter His purpose for the all-sufficient reason
          that these were framed under the influence of perfect goodness and
          unerring wisdom. Men may have occasion to alter their purposes, for in
          their shortsightedness they are frequently unable to anticipate what
          may arise after their plans are formed. But not so with God, for He
          knows the end from the beginning. To affirm God changes His purpose is
          either to impugn His goodness or to deny His eternal wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same book we are told, "The prayers of God's saints are the
          capital stock in Heaven by which Christ carries on His great work upon
          earth. The great throes and mighty convulsions on earth are the
          results of these prayers. Earth is changed, revolutionized, angels
          move on more powerful, more rapid wing, and God's policy is shaped as
          the prayers are more numerous, more efficient." If possible, this is
          even worse, and we have no hesitation in denominating it as blasphemy.
          In the first place, it flatly denies Ephesians 3:11 which speaks of
          God's having an "eternal purpose." If God's purpose is an eternal one
          then His "policy" is not being "shaped" today. In the second place, it
          contradicts Ephesians 1:11 which expressly declares that God "worketh
          all things after the counsel of His own will," therefore it follows
          that, "God's policy" is not being "shaped" by man's prayers. In the
          third place, such a statement as the above makes the will of the
          creature supreme, for if our prayers shape God's policy then is the
          Most High subordinate to worms of the earth. Well might the Holy
          Spirit ask through the Apostle, "For who hath known the mind of the
          Lord? or who hath been His counsellor?" (Rom. 11:34).
        </p>
        <p>
          Such thoughts on prayer as we have been citing are due to low and
          inadequate conceptions of God Himself. It ought to be apparent that
          there could be little or no comfort in praying to a God that was like
          the chameleon, which changes its color every day. What encouragement
          is there to lift up our hearts to One who is in one mind yesterday and
          another today? What would be the use of petitioning an earthly monarch
          if we knew he was so mutable as to grant a petition one day and deny
          it another? Is it not the very unchangeableness of God which is our
          greatest encouragement to pray? It is because He is "without
          variableness or shadow of turning" we are assured that if we ask
          anything according to His will we are most certain of being heard.
          Well did Luther remark, "Prayer is not overcoming God's reluctance,
          but laying hold of His willingness."
        </p>
        <p>
          And this leads us to offer a few remarks concerning the design of
          prayer. Why has God appointed that we should pray? The vast majority
          of people would reply, In order that we may obtain from God the things
          which we need. While this is one of the purposes of prayer it is by no
          means the chief one. Moreover, it considers prayer only from the human
          side, and prayer sadly needs to be viewed from the Divine side. Let us
          look, then, at some of the reasons why God has bidden us to pray.
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, prayer has been appointed that the Lord God
          Himself should be honored. God requires we should recognize that He
          is, indeed, "the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity" (Isa.
          57:15). God requires that we shall own His universal dominion: in
          petitioning God for rain Elijah did but confess His control over the
          elements; in praying to God to deliver a poor sinner from the wrath to
          come we acknowledge that "salvation is of the LORD" (Jonah 2:9); in
          supplicating His blessing on the Gospel unto the uttermost parts of
          the earth we declare His rulership over the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; God requires that we shall worship Him, and prayer, real
          prayer, is an act of worship. Prayer is an act of worship inasmuch as
          it is the prostrating of the soul before Him; inasmuch as it is a
          calling upon His great and holy name; inasmuch as it is the owning of
          His goodness, His power, His immutability, His grace, and inasmuch as
          it is the recognition of His Sovereignty, owned by a submission to His
          will. It is highly significant to notice in this connection that the
          Temple wasn't termed by Christ the House of Sacrifice, but instead,
          the House of Prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again; prayer redounds to God's glory, for in prayer we do but
          acknowledge dependency upon Him. When we humbly supplicate the Divine
          Being we cast ourselves upon His power and mercy. In seeking blessings
          from God we own that He is the Author and Fountain of every good and
          perfect gift. That prayer brings glory to God is further seen from the
          fact that prayer calls faith into exercise, and nothing from us is so
          honoring and pleasing to Him as the confidence of our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second place, prayer is appointed by God for our spiritual
          blessing, as a means for our growth in grace. When seeking to learn
          the design of prayer, this should ever occupy us before we regard
          prayer as a means for obtaining the supply of our need. Prayer is
          designed by God for our humbling. Prayer, real prayer, is a coming
          into the Presence of God, and a sense of His awful majesty produces a
          realization of our nothingness and unworthiness. Again; prayer is
          designed by God for the exercise of our faith. Faith is begotten in
          the Word (Rom. 10:8), but it is exercised in prayer; hence, we read of
          "the prayer of faith." Again; prayer calls love into action.
          Concerning the hypocrite the question is asked, "Will he delight
          himself in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?" (Job 27:10).
          But they that love the Lord cannot be long away from Him, for they
          delight in unburdening themselves to Him. Not only does prayer call
          love into action but through the direct answers vouchsafed to our
          prayers our love to God is increased-"I love the LORD, because He hath
          heard my voice and my supplications" (Psa. 116:1). Again; prayer is
          designed by God to teach us the value of the blessings we have sought
          from Him, and it causes us to rejoice the more when He has bestowed
          upon us that for which we supplicate Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, prayer is appointed by God for our seeking from Him the things
          which we are in need of. But here a difficulty may present itself to
          those who have read carefully the previous chapters of this book. If
          God has foreordained, before the foundation of the world, everything
          which happens in time, what is the use of prayer? If it is true that
          "of Him and through Him and to Him are all things" (Rom. 11:30), then
          why pray? Ere replying directly to these queries it should be pointed
          out how that there is just as much reason to ask, What is the use of
          me coming to God and telling Him what He already knows? Wherein is the
          use of me spreading before Him my need, seeing He is already
          acquainted with it? as there is to object, What is the use of praying
          for anything when everything has been ordained beforehand by God?
          Prayer is not for the purpose of informing God, as if He were ignorant
          (the Saviour expressly declared "for your Father knoweth what things
          ye have need of, before ye ask Him"-Matt. 6:8), but it is to
          acknowledge He does know what we are in need of. Prayer is not
          appointed for the furnishing of God with the knowledge of what we
          need, but is designed as a confession to Him of our sense of need. In
          this, as in everything, God's thoughts are not as ours. God requires
          that His gifts should be sought for. He designs to be honored by our
          asking, just as He is to be thanked by us after He has bestowed His
          blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the question still returns on us, If God be the Predestinator
          of everything that comes to pass, and the Regulator of all events,
          then is not prayer a profitless exercise? A sufficient answer to these
          questions is that God bids us to pray, "Pray without ceasing" (1
          Thess. 5:17). And again, "men ought always to pray" (Luke 18:1). And
          further: Scripture declares that "the prayer of faith shall save the
          sick," and "the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
          much" (James 5:15, 16); while the Lord Jesus Christ, our perfect
          Example in all things, was preeminently a Man of Prayer. Thus, it is
          evident, that prayer is neither meaningless nor valueless. But still
          this does not remove the difficulty nor answer the question with which
          we started out. What then is the relationship between God's
          Sovereignty and Christian prayer?
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, we would say with emphasis, that prayer is not intended
          to change God's purpose, nor is it to move Him to form fresh purposes.
          God has decreed that certain events shall come to pass through the
          means He has appointed for their accomplishment. God has elected
          certain ones to be saved, but He has also decreed that these shall be
          saved through the preaching the Gospel. The Gospel, then, is one of
          the appointed means for the working out of the eternal counsel of the
          Lord; and prayer is another. God has decreed the means as well as the
          end, and among the means is prayer. Even the prayers of His people are
          included in His eternal decrees. Therefore, instead of prayers being
          in vain they are among the means through which God exercises His
          decrees. "If indeed all things happen by a blind chance, or a fatal
          necessity prayers in that case could be of no moral efficacy, and of
          no use; but since they are regulated by the direction of Divine
          wisdom, prayers have a place in the order of events" (Haldane).
        </p>
        <p>
          That prayers for the execution of the very things decreed by God are
          not meaningless is clearly taught in the Scriptures. Elijah knew that
          God was about to give rain, but that did not prevent him from at once
          betaking himself to prayer (James 5:17, 18). Daniel "understood" by
          the writings of the prophets that the captivity was to last but
          seventy years, yet when these seventy years were almost ended we are
          told that he set his face "unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
          supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes" (Dan. 9:2, 3).
          God told the prophet Jeremiah "For I know the thoughts that I think
          toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to
          give you an expected end"; but instead of adding, there is, therefore,
          no need for you to supplicate Me for these things, He said, "Then
          shall ye call upon Me, and ye shall go and pray unto Me, and I will
          hearken unto you" (Jer. 29:11, 12).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then is the design of prayer: not that God's will may be altered,
          but that it may be accomplished in His own good time and way. It is
          because God has promised certain things that we can ask for them with
          the full assurance of faith. It is God's purpose that His will shall
          be brought about by His own appointed means, and that He may do His
          people good upon His own terms, and that is, by the 'means' and
          'terms' of entreaty and supplication. Did not the Son of God know for
          certain that after His death and resurrection He would be exalted by
          the Father. Assuredly He did. Yet we find Him asking for this very
          thing: "O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine Own Self with the glory
          which I had with Thee before the world was" (John 17:5)! Did not He
          know that none of His people could perish? yet He besought the Father
          to "keep" them (John 17:11)!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, it should be said that God's will is immutable, and cannot be
          altered by our cryings. When the mind of God is not toward a people to
          do them good, it cannot be turned to them by the most fervent and
          importunate prayer of those who have the greatest interest in Him:
          "Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me,
          yet My mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of My
          sight, and let them go forth" (Jer. 15:1). The prayers of Moses to
          enter the promised land is a parallel case.
        </p>

          Our views respecting prayer need to be revised and brought into
          harmony with the teaching of Scripture on the subject. The prevailing
          idea seems to be that I come to God and ask Him for something that I
          want, and that I expect Him to give me that which I have asked. But
          this is a most dishonoring and degrading conception. The popular
          belief reduces God to a servant, our servant: doing our bidding,
          performing our pleasure, granting our desires. No; prayer is a coming
          to God, telling Him my need, committing my way unto the Lord, and
          leaving Him to deal with it as seemeth Him best. This makes my will
          subject to His, instead of, as in the former case, seeking to bring
          His will into subjection to mine. No prayer is pleasing to God unless
          the spirit actuating it is "not my will, but Thine be done." "When God
          bestows blessings on a praying people, it is not for the sake of their
          prayers, as if He was inclined and turned by them; but it is for His
          own sake, and of His own Sovereign will and pleasure. Should it be
          said, to what purpose then is prayer? it is answered, This is the way
          and means God has appointed for the communication of the blessing of
          His goodness to His people. For though He has purposed, provided, and
          promised them, yet He will be sought unto, to give them, and it is a
          duty and privilege to ask. When they are blessed with a spirit of
          prayer it forebodes well, and looks as if God intended to bestow the
          good things asked, which should be asked always with submission to the
          will of God, saying, Not my will but Thine be done" (John Gill).

          The distinction just noted above is of great practical importance for
          our peace of heart. Perhaps the one thing that exercises Christians as
          much as anything else is that of unanswered prayers. They have asked
          God for something: so far as they are able to judge they have asked in
          faith believing they would receive that for which they had supplicated
          the Lord: and they have asked earnestly and repeatedly, but the answer
          has not come. The result is that, in many cases, faith in the efficacy
          of prayer becomes weakened, until hope gives way to despair and the
          closet is altogether neglected. Is it not so?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now will it surprise our readers when we say that every real prayer of
          faith that has ever been offered to God has been answered? Yet we
          unhesitatingly affirm it. But in saying this we must refer back to our
          definition of prayer. Let us repeat it. Prayer is a coming to God,
          telling Him my need (or the need of others), committing my way unto
          the Lord, and then leaving Him to deal with the case as seemeth Him
          best. This leaves God to answer the prayer in whatever way He sees
          fit, and often, His answer may be the very opposite of what would be
          most acceptable to the flesh; yet, if we have really LEFT our need in
          His hands it will be His answer, nevertheless. Let us look at two
          examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          In John 11 we read of the sickness of Lazarus. The Lord "loved" him,
          but He was absent from Bethany. The sisters sent a messenger unto the
          Lord acquainting Him of their brother's condition. And note
          particularly how their appeal was worded-"Lord, behold, he whom Thou
          lovest is sick." That was all. They did not ask Him to heal Lazarus.
          They did not request Him to hasten at once to Bethany. They simply
          spread their need before Him, committed the case into His hands, and
          left Him to act as He deemed best! And what was our Lord's reply? Did
          He respond to their appeal and answer their mute request? Certainly He
          did, though not, perhaps, in the way they had hoped. He answered by
          abiding "two days still in the same place where He was" (John 11:6),
          and allowing Lazarus to die! But in this instance that was not all.
          Later, He journeyed to Bethany and raised Lazarus from the dead. Our
          purpose in referring here to this case is to illustrate the proper
          attitude for the believer to take before God in the hour of need. The
          next example will emphasize rather, God's method of responding to His
          needy child.

          Turn to 2 Corinthians 12. The Apostle Paul had been accorded an
          unheard-of privilege. He had been transported into Paradise. His ears
          had listened to and his eyes had gazed upon that which no other mortal
          had heard or seen this side of death. The wondrous revelation was more
          than the Apostle could endure. He was in danger of becoming "puffed
          up" by his extraordinary experience. Therefore, a thorn in the flesh,
          the messenger of Satan, was sent to buffet him lest he be exalted
          above measure. And the Apostle spreads his need before the Lord; he
          thrice beseeches Him that this thorn in the flesh should be removed.
          Was his prayer answered? Assuredly, though not in the manner he had
          desired. The "thorn" was not removed but grace was given to bear it.
          The burden was not lifted but strength was vouchsafed to carry it.

          Does someone object that it is our privilege to do more than spread
          our need before God? Are we reminded that God has, as it were, given
          us a blank check and invited us to fill it in? Is it said that the
          promises of God are all-inclusive, and that we may ask God for what we
          will? If so, we must call attention to the fact that it is necessary
          to compare Scripture with Scripture if we are to learn the full mind
          of God on any subject, and that as this is done we discover God has
          qualified the promises given to praying souls by saying "If ye ask
          anything according to His will He heareth us" (1 John 5:14). Real
          prayer is communion with God so that there will be common thoughts
          between His mind and ours. What is needed is for Him to fill our
          hearts with His thoughts and then His desires will become our desires
          flowing back to Him. Here then is the meeting-place between God's
          Sovereignty and Christian prayer: If we ask anything according to His
          will He heareth us, and if we do not so ask He does not hear us; as
          saith the Apostle James, "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask
          amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts" or desires (4:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          But did not the Lord Jesus tell His disciples, "Verily, verily, I say
          unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give
          it you" (John 16:23)? He did; but this promise does not give praying
          souls carte blanche. These words of our Lord are in perfect accord
          with those of the Apostle John: "If ye ask anything according to His
          will He heareth us." What is it to ask "in the name of Christ"? Surely
          it is very much more than a prayer formula, the mere concluding of our
          supplications with the words "in the name of Christ." To apply to God
          for anything in the name of Christ, it must needs be in keeping with
          what Christ is! To ask God in the name of Christ is as though Christ
          Himself were the suppliant. We can only ask God for what Christ would
          ask. To ask in the name of Christ is therefore to set aside our own
          wills, accepting God's!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now amplify our definition of prayer. What is prayer? Prayer is
          not so much an act as it is an attitude-an attitude of dependency,
          dependency upon God. Prayer is a confession of creature weakness, yea,
          of helplessness. Prayer is the acknowledgment of our need and the
          spreading of it before God. We do not say that this is all there is in
          prayer, it is not: but it is the essential, the primary element in
          prayer. We freely admit that we are quite unable to give a complete
          definition of prayer within the compass of a brief sentence, or in any
          number of words. Prayer is both an attitude and an act, an human act,
          and yet there is the Divine element in it too, and it is this which
          makes an exhaustive analysis impossible as well as impious to attempt.
          But admitting this, we do insist again that prayer is fundamentally an
          attitude of dependency upon God. Therefore, prayer is the very
          opposite of dictating to God. Because prayer is an attitude of
          dependency, the one who really prays is submissive, submissive to the
          Divine will; and submission to the Divine will means that we are
          content for the Lord to supply our need according to the dictates of
          His own Sovereign pleasure. And hence it is that we say every prayer
          that is offered to God in this spirit is sure of meeting with an
          answer or response from Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then is the reply to our opening question, and the scriptural
          solution to the seeming difficulty. Prayer is not the requesting of
          God to alter His purpose or for Him to form a new one. Prayer is the
          taking of an attitude of dependency upon God, the spreading of our
          need before Him, the asking for those things which are in accordance
          with His will, and therefore there is nothing whatever inconsistent
          between Divine Sovereignty and Christian prayer.

          In closing this chapter we would utter a word of caution to safeguard
          the reader against drawing a false conclusion from what has been said.
          We have not here sought to epitomize the whole teaching of Scripture
          on the subject of prayer, nor have we even attempted to discuss in
          general the problem of prayer; instead, we have confined ourselves,
          more or less, to a consideration of the relationship between God's
          Sovereignty and Christian prayer. What we have written is intended
          chiefly as a protest against much of the modern teaching, which so
          stresses the human element in prayer that the Divine side is almost
          entirely lost sight of.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Jeremiah 10:23 we are told "It is not in man that walketh to direct
          his steps" (cf. Prov. 16:9); and yet in many of his prayers man
          impulse presumes to direct the Lord as to His way, and as to what He
          ought to do: even implying that if only he had the direction of the
          affairs of the world and of the church he would soon have things very
          different from what they are. This cannot be denied: for anyone with
          any spiritual discernment at all could not fail to detect this spirit
          in many of our modern prayer-meetings where the flesh holds sway. How
          slow we all are to learn the lesson that the haughty creature needs to
          be brought down to his knees and humbled into the dust. And this is
          where the very act of prayer is intended to put us. But man (in his
          usual perversity) turns the footstool into a throne from whence he
          would fain direct the Almighty as to what He ought to do! giving the
          onlooker the impression that if God had half the compassion that those
          who pray (?) have, all would quickly be right! Such is the arrogance
          of the old nature even in a child of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our main purpose in this chapter has been to emphasize the need for
          submitting, in prayer, our wills to God's. But it must also be added
          that prayer is much more than a pious exercise, and far otherwise than
          a mechanical performance. Prayer is, indeed, a Divinely appointed
          means whereby we may obtain from God the things we ask, providing we
          ask for those things which are in accord with His will. These pages
          will have been penned in vain unless they lead both writer and reader
          to cry with a deeper earnestness than heretofore, "Lord, teach us to
          pray" (Luke 11:1).
