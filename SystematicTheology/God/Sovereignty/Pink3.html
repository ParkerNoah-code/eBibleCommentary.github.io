        <h2>3 - Sovereignty Of God In Administration</h2>
        <p>
          "The LORD hath prepared His Throne In the heavens; and His Kingdom
          ruleth over all" (Psa. 103:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          First, a word concerning the need for God to govern the material
          world. Suppose the opposite for a moment. For the sake of argument,
          let us say that God created the world, designed and fixed certain laws
          (which men term "the laws of Nature"), and that He then withdrew,
          leaving the world to its fortune and the out-working of these laws. In
          such a case, we should have a world over which there was no
          intelligent, presiding Governor, a world controlled by nothing more
          than impersonal laws-a concept worthy of gross Materialism and blank
          Atheism. But, I say, suppose it for a moment; and in the light of such
          a supposition weigh well the following question: What guaranty have we
          that some day ere long the world will not be destroyed? A very
          superficial observation of 'the laws of Nature' reveals the fact that
          they are not uniform in their working. The proof of this is seen in
          the fact that no two seasons are alike. If then Nature's laws are
          irregular in their operations, what guaranty have we against some
          dreadful catastrophe striking our earth? "The wind bloweth where it
          listeth" (pleaseth), which means that man can neither harness nor
          hinder it. Sometimes the wind blows with great fury, and it might be
          that it should suddenly gather in volume and velocity until it became
          a hurricane earth-wide in its range. If there is nothing more than the
          laws of Nature regulating the wind, then, perhaps tomorrow, there may
          come a terrific tornado and sweep everything from the surface of the
          earth! What assurance have we against such a calamity? Again; of late
          years we have heard and read much about clouds bursting and flooding
          whole districts, working fearful havoc in the destruction of both
          property and life. Man is helpless before them, for science can devise
          no means to prevent clouds bursting. Then how do we know that these
          bursting clouds will not be multiplied indefinitely and the whole
          earth be deluged by their downpour? This would be nothing new: why
          should not the Flood of Noah's day be repeated? And what of
          earthquakes? Every few years some island or some great city is swept
          out of existence by one of them-and what can man do? Where is the
          guaranty that ere long a mammoth earthquake will not destroy the whole
          world. Science tells us of great subterranean fires burning beneath
          the comparatively thin crust of our earth. How do we know but what
          these fires will not suddenly burst forth and consume our entire
          globe? Surely every reader now sees the point we are seeking to make:
          Deny that God is governing matter, deny that He is "upholding all
          things by the word of His power" (Heb. 1:3), and all sense of security
          is gone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us pursue a similar course of reasoning in connection with the
          human race. Is God governing this world of ours? Is He shaping the
          destinies of nations, controlling the course of empires, determining
          the limits of dynasties? Has He prescribed the limits of evil-doers,
          saying, Thus far shalt thou go and no further? Let us suppose the
          opposite for a moment. Let us assume that God has delivered over the
          helm into the hand of His creatures and see where such a supposition
          leads us. For the sake of argument we will say that every man enters
          this world endowed with a will that is absolutely free, and that it is
          impossible to compel or even coerce him without destroying his
          freedom. Let us say that every man possesses a knowledge of right and
          wrong, that he has the power to choose between them, and that he is
          left entirely free to make his own choice and go his own way. Then
          what? Then it follows that man is Sovereign, for he does as he pleases
          and is the architect of his own fortune. But in such a case we can
          have no assurance that ere long every man will reject the good and
          choose the evil. In such a case we have no guaranty against the entire
          human race committing moral suicide. Let all Divine restraints be
          removed and man be left absolutely free, and all ethical distinctions
          would immediately disappear, the spirit of barbarism would prevail
          universally, and pandemonium would reign supreme. Why not? If one
          nation deposes its rulers and repudiates its constitution, what is
          there to prevent all nations from doing the same?
        </p>
        <p>
          If little more than a century ago the streets of Paris ran with the
          blood of rioters, what assurance have we that before the present
          century closes every city throughout the world will not witness a
          similar sight? What is there to hinder earth-wide lawlessness and
          universal anarchy? Thus we have sought to show the need, the
          imperative need, for God to occupy the Throne, take the government
          upon His shoulder, and control the activities and destinies of His
          creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          But has the man of faith any difficulty in perceiving the government
          of God over this world? Does not the anointed eye discern, even amid
          much seeming confusion and chaos, the hand of the Most High
          controlling and shaping the affairs of men, even in the common
          concerns of every day life? Take for example farmers and their crops.
          Suppose God left them to themselves: what would prevent them, one and
          all, from grassing their arable lands and devoting themselves
          exclusively to rearing of cattle and dairying? In such a case there
          would be a world-famine of wheat and corn! Take the work of the post
          office. Suppose that everybody decided to write letters on Mondays
          only, could the authorities cope with the mail on Tuesdays? and how
          would they occupy their time the balance of the week? So again with
          storekeepers. What would happen if every housewife did her shopping on
          Wednesday, and stayed at home the rest of the week? But instead of
          such things happening, farmers in different countries both raise
          sufficient cattle and grow enough grain of various kinds to supply the
          almost incalculable needs of the human race; the mails are almost
          evenly distributed over the six days of the week; and some women shop
          on Monday, some on Tuesday, and so on. Do not these things clearly
          evidence the overruling and controlling hand of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          Having shown, in brief, the imperative need for God to reign over our
          world, let us now observe still further the fact that God does rule,
          actually rule, and that His government extends to and is exercised
          over all things and all creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. GOD GOVERNS INANIMATE MATTER.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          That God governs inanimate matter, that inanimate matter performs His
          bidding and fulfills His decrees, is clearly shown on the very
          frontispiece of Divine revelation. God said, "Let there be light," and
          we read, "There was light." God said, "Let the waters under the
          heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land
          appear," and "it was so." And again, "God said, Let the earth bring
          forth grass the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit
          after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was
          so." And the Psalmist declares, "He spake and it was done; He
          commanded, and it stood fast."
        </p>
        <p>
          What is stated in Genesis One is afterwards illustrated all through
          the Bible. After the creation of Adam, sixteen centuries went by
          before ever a shower of rain fell upon the earth, for before Noah
          "there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of
          the ground" (Gen. 2:6). But, when the iniquities of the antediluvians
          had come to the full, then God said, "And, behold, I even I, do bring
          a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the
          breath of life, from under Heaven; and everything that is in the earth
          shall die"; and in fulfillment of this we read, "In the six hundredth
          year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the
          month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken
          up, and the windows of Heaven were opened. And the rain was upon the
          earth forty days and forty nights" (Gen. 6:17 and 7:11, 12).
        </p>
        <p>
          Witness God's absolute (and Sovereign) control of inanimate matter in
          connection with the plagues of Egypt. At His bidding the light was
          turned into darkness and rivers into blood; hail fell, and death came
          down upon the godless land of the Nile, until even its haughty monarch
          was compelled to cry out for deliverance. Note particularly how the
          inspired record here emphasizes God's absolute control over the
          elements-"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward Heaven: and the
          LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
          and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail,
          and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none
          like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. And the
          hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field,
          both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and
          brake every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen, where the
          children of Israel were, was there no hail" (Exo. 9:23-26). The same
          distinction was observed in connection with the ninth plague: "And the
          LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward Heaven, that there
          may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be
          felt. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward Heaven; and there was
          a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: They saw not one
          another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the
          children of Israel had light in their dwellings" (Exo. 10:21-23).
        </p>
        <p>
          The above examples are by no means isolated cases. At God's decree
          fire and brimstone descended from Heaven and the cities of the Plain
          were destroyed, and a fertile valley was converted into a loathsome
          sea of death. At His bidding the waters of the Red Sea parted asunder
          so that the Israelites passed over dry shod, and at His word they
          rolled back again and destroyed the Egyptians who were pursuing them.
          A word from Him, and the earth opened her mouth and Korah and his
          rebellious company were swallowed up. The furnace of Nebuchadnezzar
          was heated seven times beyond its normal temperature, and into it
          three of God's children were cast, but the fire did not so much as
          scorch their clothes, though it slew the men who cast them into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a demonstration of the Creator's governmental control over the
          elements was furnished when He became flesh and tabernacled among men!
          Behold Him asleep in the boat. A storm arises. The winds roar and the
          waves are lashed into fury. The disciples who are with Him, fearful
          lest their little craft should founder, awake their Master, saying,
          "Carest Thou not that we perish?" And then we read, "And He arose, and
          rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind
          ceased, and there was a great calm" (Mark 4:39). Mark again, the sea,
          at the will of its Creator, bore Him up upon its waves. At a word from
          Him, the fig-tree withered; at His touch disease fled instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heavenly bodies are also ruled by their Maker and perform His
          Sovereign pleasure. Take two illustrations. At God's bidding the sun
          went back ten degrees on the dial of Ahaz to help the weak faith of
          Hezekiah. In New Testament times, God caused a star to herald the
          incarnation of His Son-the star which appeared unto the wise men of
          the East. This star, we are told, "went before them till it came and
          stood over where the young Child was" (Matt. 2:9).
        </p>
        <p>
          What a declaration is this: "He sendeth forth His commandment upon
          earth: His word runneth very swiftly. He giveth snow like wool: He
          scattereth the hoar frost like ashes. He casteth forth His ice like
          morsels: who can stand before His cold? He sendeth out His word, and
          melteth them: He causeth His wind to blow, and the waters flow" (Psa.
          147:15-18). The mutations of the elements are beneath God's Sovereign
          control. It is God who withholds the rain, and it is God who gives the
          rain when He wills, where He wills, as He wills, and on whom He wills.
          Weather Bureaus may attempt to give forecasts of the weather, but how
          frequently God mocks their calculations! Sun 'spots,' the varying
          activities of the planets, the appearing and disappearing of comets
          (to which abnormal weather is sometimes attributed), atmospheric
          disturbances, are merely secondary causes, for behind them all is God
          Himself. Let His Word speak once more: "And also I have withholden the
          rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I
          caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon
          another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereon it rain
          not withered. So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink
          water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto Me,
          saith the LORD. I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your
          gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees
          increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto
          Me, saith the LORD. I have sent among you the pestilence after the
          manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have
          taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to
          come up into your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith
          the LORD" (Amos 4:7-10).
        </p>
        <p>
          Truly, then, God governs inanimate matter. Earth and air, fire and
          water, hail and snow, stormy winds and angry seas, all perform the
          word of His power and fulfill His Sovereign pleasure. Therefore, when
          we complain about the weather we are, in reality, murmuring against
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. GOD GOVERNS IRRATIONAL CREATURES.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          What a striking illustration of God's government over the animal
          kingdom is found in Genesis 2:19! "And out of the ground the LORD God
          formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air: and
          brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever
          Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof." Should
          it be said that this occurred in Eden, and took place before the fall
          of Adam and the consequent curse which was inflicted on every
          creature, then our next reference fully meets the objection: God's
          control of the beasts was again openly displayed at the Flood. Mark
          how God caused to "come unto" Noah every specie of living creature "of
          every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring
          into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and
          female. Of fowls after their kind, of every creeping thing after his
          kind: two of every sort shall come unto thee" (Gen. 6:19, 20)-all were
          beneath God's Sovereign control. The lion of the jungle, the elephant
          of the forest, the bear of the polar regions; the ferocious panther,
          the untameable wolf, the fierce tiger; the high-soaring eagle and the
          creeping crocodile-see them all in their native fierceness, and yet,
          quietly submitting to the will of their Creator, and coming two by two
          into the ark!
        </p>
        <p>
          We referred to the plagues sent upon Egypt as illustrating God's
          control of inanimate matter, let us now turn to them again to see how
          they demonstrate His perfect rulership over irrational creatures. At
          His Word the river brought forth frogs abundantly, and these frogs
          entered the palace of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and,
          contrary to their natural instincts, they entered the beds, the ovens
          and the kneadingtroughs (Exo. 8:13). Swarms of flies invaded the land
          of Egypt, but there were no flies in the land of Goshen! (Exo. 8:22).
          Next, the cattle were stricken, and we read, "Behold, the hand of the
          LORD is upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the
          sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. And the LORD shall
          sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there
          shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel. And the
          LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow the LORD shall do this
          thing in the land. And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all
          the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
          died not one" (Exo. 9:3-6). In like manner God sent clouds of locusts
          to plague Pharaoh and his land, appointing the time of their
          visitation, determining the course and assigning the limits of their
          depredations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Angels are not the only ones who do God's bidding. The brute beasts
          equally perform His pleasure. The sacred ark, the ark of the covenant,
          is in the country of the Philistines. How is it to be brought back to
          its home land? Mark the servants of God's choice, and how completely
          they were beneath His control: "And the Philistines called for the
          priests and the diviners saying, What shall we do to the ark of the
          Lord? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. And they
          said... Now therefore make a new cart, and take two mileb kine, on
          which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring
          their calves home from them: And take the ark of the Lord, and lay it
          upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return Him for a
          trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof, and send it away
          that it may go. And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
          Bethshemesh, then He hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we
          shall know that it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that
          happened to us." And what happened? How striking the sequel! "And the
          kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along
          the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right
          hand or to the left" (1 Sam. 6:12). Equally striking is the case of
          Elijah: "And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Get thee
          hence, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
          And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
          commanded the ravens to feed thee there" (1 Kings 17:2-4). The natural
          instinct of these birds of prey was held in subjection, and instead of
          consuming the food themselves, they carried it to Jehovah's servant in
          his solitary retreat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is further proof required? then it is ready at hand. God makes a dumb
          ass to rebuke the prophet's madness. He sends forth two she-bears from
          the woods to devour forty and two of Elijah's tormentors. In
          fulfillment of His word, He causes the dogs to lick up the blood of
          the wicked Jezebel. He seals the mouths of Babylon's lions when Daniel
          is cast into the den, though, later, He causes them to devour the
          prophet's accusers. He prepares a great fish to swallow the
          disobedient Jonah and then, when His ordained hour struck, compelled
          it to vomit him forth on dry land. At His biding a fish carries a coin
          to Peter for tribute money, and in order to fulfill His word He makes
          the cock crow twice after Peter's denial. Thus we see that God reigns
          over irrational creatures: beasts of the field, birds of the air,
          fishes of the sea, all perform His Sovereign bidding.

          <b>3. GOD GOVERNS THE CHILDREN OF MEN.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We fully appreciate the fact that this is the most difficult part of
          our subject, and, accordingly, it will be dealt with at greater length
          in the pages that follow; but at present we consider the fact of God's
          government over men in general, before we attempt to deal with the
          problem in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two alternatives confront us, and between them we are obliged to
          choose: either God governs, or He is governed; either God rules, or He
          is ruled; either God has His way, or men have theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And is our choice between these alternatives hard to make? Shall we
          say that in man we behold a creature so unruly that he is beyond God's
          control? Shall we say that sin has alienated the sinner so far from
          the thrice Holy One that he is outside the pale of His jurisdiction?
          Or, shall we say that man has been endowed with moral responsibility,
          and therefore God must leave him entirely free, at least during the
          period of his probation? Does it necessarily follow because the
          natural man is an outlaw against Heaven, a rebel against the Divine
          government, that God is unable to fulfill His purpose through him? We
          mean, not merely that He may overrule the effects of the actions of
          evil-doers, nor that He will yet bring the wicked to stand before His
          judgment-bar so that sentence of punishment may be passed upon
          them-multitudes of non-Christians believe these things-but, we mean,
          that every action of the most lawless of His subjects is entirely
          beneath His control, yea that the actor is, though unknown to himself,
          carrying out the secret decrees of the Most High. Was it not thus with
          Judas? and is it possible to select a more extreme case? If then the
          arch-rebel was performing the counsel of God is it any greater tax
          upon our faith to believe the same of all rebels?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our present object is no philosophic inquiry nor metaphysical
          causistry, but to ascertain the teaching of Scripture upon this
          profound theme. To the Law and the Testimony, for there only can we
          learn of the Divine government-its character, its design, its modus
          operandi, its scope. What then has it pleased God to reveal to us in
          His blessed Word concerning His rule over the works of His hands, and
          particularly, over the one who originally was made in His own image
          and likeness?
        </p>
        <p>
          "In Him we live, and move, and have our being" (Acts 17:28). What a
          sweeping assertion is this! These words, be it noted, were addressed,
          not to one of the churches of God, not to a company of saints who had
          reached an exalted plane of spirituality, but to a heathen audience,
          to those who worshipped "the unknown God" and who "mocked" when they
          heard of the resurrection of the dead. And yet, to the Athenian
          philosophers, to the Epicureans and Stoics, the Apostle Paul did not
          hesitate to affirm that they lived and moved and had their being in
          God, which signified not only that they owed their existence and
          preservation to the One who made the world and all things therein, but
          also that their very actions were encompassed and therefore controlled
          by the Lord of Heaven and earth. Compare Daniel 5:23, last clause!
        </p>
        <p>
          "The disposings (margin) of the heart, and the answer of the tongue is
          from the LORD" (Prov. 16:1). Mark that the above declaration is of
          general application-it is of "man," not simply of believers, that this
          is predicated. "A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth
          his steps" (Prov. 16:9). If the Lord directs the steps of a man, is it
          not proof that he is being controlled or governed by God? Again:
          "There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of
          the LORD, that shall stand" (Prov. 19:21). Can this mean anything less
          than, that no matter what man may desire and plan, it is the will of
          his Maker which is executed? As an illustration take the "Rich Fool."
          The "devices" of his heart are made known to us-"And he thought within
          himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to
          bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my
          barns, and build greater; and there I will bestow all my fruits and my
          goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
          for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry." Such were
          the "devices" of his heart, nevertheless it was "the counsel of the
          Lord" that stood. The "I will's" of the rich man came to nought, for
          "God said unto him, Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required
          of thee" (Luke 12:17-20).
        </p>
        <p>
          "The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water:
          He turneth it whithersoever He will (Prov. 21:1). What could be more
          explicit? Out of the heart are "the issues of life" (Prov. 4:23), for
          as a man "thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Prov. 23:7). If then the
          heart is in the hand of the Lord, and if "He turneth it whithersoever
          He will," then is it not clear that men, yea, governors and rulers,
          and so all men, are completely beneath the governmental control of the
          Almighty!
        </p>
        <p>
          No limitations must be placed upon the above declarations. To insist
          that some men, at least, do thwart God's will and overturn His
          counsels, is to repudiate other Scriptures equally explicit. Weigh
          well the following: "But He is one mind, and who can turn Him? and
          what His soul desireth, even that He doeth" (Job 23:13). "The counsel
          of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of His heart to all
          generations" (Psa. 33:11). "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor
          counsel against the LORD" (Prov. 21:30). "For the LORD of hosts hath
          purposed, and who shall disannul it? And His hand is stretched out,
          and who shall turn it back?" (Isa. 14:27). "Remember the former things
          of old: for I am God, and there is none else! I am God, and there is
          none like Me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient
          times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
          stand, and I will do all My pleasure" (Isa. 46:9, 10). There is no
          ambiguity in these passages. They affirm in the most unequivocal and
          unqualified terms that it is impossible to bring to naught the purpose
          of Jehovah.
        </p>
        <p>
          We read the Scriptures in vain if we fail to discover that the actions
          of men, evil men as well as good, are governed by the Lord God. Nimrod
          and his fellows determined to erect the tower of Babel, but ere their
          task was accomplished God frustrated their plans. God called Abraham
          "alone" (Isa. 51:2), but his kinsfolk accompanied him as he left Ur of
          the Chaldees. Was then the will of the Lord defeated? Nay, verily.
          Mark the sequel. Terah died before Canaan was reached (Gen. 11:32),
          and though Lot accompanied his uncle into the land of promise, he soon
          separated from him and settled down in Sodom. Jacob was the child to
          whom the inheritance was promised, and though Isaac sought to reverse
          Jehovah's decree and bestow the blessing upon Esau, his efforts came
          to naught. Esau again swore vengeance upon Jacob, but when next they
          met they wept for joy instead of fighting in hate. The brethren of
          Joseph determined his destruction but their evil counsels were
          overthrown. Pharaoh refused to let Israel carry out the instructions
          of Jehovah and perished in the Red Sea for his pains. Balak hired
          Balaam to curse the Israelites but God compelled him to bless them.
          Haman erected a gallows for Mordecai but was hanged upon it himself.
          Jonah resisted the revealed will of God but what became of his
          efforts?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah, the heathen may "rage" and the people imagine a "vain thing"; the
          kings of earth may "set themselves," and the rulers take counsel
          together against the Lord and against His Christ, saying, "Let us
          break Their bands asunder, and cast away Their cords from us (Psa.
          2:1-3). But is the great God perturbed or disturbed by the rebellion
          of his puny creatures? No, indeed: "He that sitteth in the heavens
          shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision" (v. 4). He is
          infinitely exalted above all, and the greatest confederacies or
          earth's pawns, and their most extensive and vigorous preparations to
          defeat His purpose are, in His sight, altogether purile. He looks upon
          their puny efforts, not only without any alarm, but He "laughs" at
          their folly; He treats their impotency with "derision." He knows that
          He can crush them like moths when He pleases, or consume them in a
          moment with the breath of His mouth. Ah, it is but "a vain thing" for
          the potsherds of the earth to strive with the glorious Majesty of
          Heaven. Such is our God; worship ye Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark, too, the Sovereignty which God displayed in His dealings with
          men! Moses who was slow of speech, and not Aaron his elder brother who
          was not slow of speech, was the one chosen to be His ambassador in
          demanding from Egypt's monarch the release of His oppressed people.
          Moses again, though greatly beloved, utters one hasty word and was
          excluded from Canaan; whereas Elijah, passionately murmurs and suffers
          but a mild rebuke, and was afterwards taken to Heaven without seeing
          death! Uzzah merely touched the ark and was instantly slain, whereas
          the Philistines carried it off in insulting triumph and suffered no
          immediate harm. Displays of grace which would have brought a doomed
          Sodom to repentance failed to move an highly privileged Capernaum.
          Mighty works which would have subdued Tyre and Sidon left the
          upbraided cities of Galilee under the curse of a rejected Gospel. If
          they would have prevailed over the former, why were they not wrought
          there? If they proved ineffectual to deliver the latter then why
          perform them? What exhibitions are these of the Sovereign will of the
          Most High!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>4. GOD GOVERNS ANGELS: BOTH GOOD AND EVIL ANGELS.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The angels are God's servants, His messengers, His chariots. They ever
          hearken to the word of His mouth and do His commands. "And God sent an
          angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD
          beheld, and He repented Him of the evil, and said to the angel that
          destroyed. It is enough, stay now thine hand... And the LORD commanded
          the angel; and he put his sword again into the sheath thereof" (1
          Chron. 21:15, 27). Many other Scriptures might be cited to show that
          the angels are in subjection to the will of their Creator and perform
          His bidding -"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know
          of a surety, that the Lord hath sent His angel, and hath delivered me
          out of the hand of Herod" (Acts 12:11). "And the Lord God of the holy
          prophets sent His angel to shew unto His servants the things which
          must shortly be done" (Rev. 22:6). So it will be when our Lord
          returns: "The Son of Man shall send forth His angels and they shall
          gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do
          iniquity" (Matt. 13:41). Again, we read, "He shall send His angels
          with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His
          elect from the four winds, from one end of Heaven to the other" (Matt.
          24:31).
        </p>
        <p>
          The same is true of evil spirits: they, too, fulfill God's Sovereign
          decrees. An evil spirit is sent by God to stir up rebellion in the
          camp of Abimelech: "Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and
          the men of Shechem," which aided him in the killing of his brethren
          (Judges 9:23). Another evil spirit He sent to be a lying spirit in the
          mouth of Ahab's prophets-"Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a
          lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath
          spoken evil concerning thee" (1 Kings 22:23). And yet another was sent
          by the Lord to trouble Saul-"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from
          Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him" (1 Sam. 16:14).
          So, too, in the New Testament: a whole legion of the demons go not out
          of their victim until the Lord gave them permission to enter the herd
          of swine.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is clear from Scripture, then, that the angels, good and evil, are
          under God's control, and willingly or unwillingly carry out God's
          purpose. Yea, SATAN himself is absolutely subject to God's control.
          When arraigned in Eden, he listened to the awful sentence but answered
          not a word. He was unable to touch Job until God granted him leave.
          So, too, he had to gain our Lord's consent before he could "sift"
          Peter. When Christ commanded him to depart-"Get thee hence, Satan"-we
          read, "Then the Devil leaveth Him" (Matt. 4:11). And, in the end, he
          will be cast into the Lake of Fire which has been prepared for him and
          his angels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. His government is exercised over
          inanimate matter, over the brute beasts, over the children of men,
          over angels good and evil, and over Satan himself. No revolving world,
          no shining of star, no storm, no creature moves, no actions of men, no
          errands of angels, no deeds of Devil-nothing in all the vast universe
          can come to pass otherwise than God has eternally purposed. Here is a
          foundation of faith. Here is a resting place for the intellect. Here
          is an anchor for the soul, both sure and steadfast. It is not blind
          fate, unbridled evil, man or Devil, but the Lord Almighty who is
          ruling the world, ruling it according to His own good pleasure and for
          His own eternal glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ten thousand ages ere the skies Were into motion brought;<br />
