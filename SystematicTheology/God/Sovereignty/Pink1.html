        <h2>1 - God's Sovereignty Defined</h2>
        <p>
          "Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and
          the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the
          earth is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and Thou art exalted as
          Head above all" (1 Chron. 29:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sovereignty of God is an expression that once was generally
          understood. It was a phrase commonly used in religious literature. It
          was a theme frequently expounded in the pulpit. It was a truth which
          brought comfort to many hearts, and gave virility and stability to
          Christian character. But, today, to make mention of God's Sovereignty
          is, in many quarters, to speak in an unknown tongue. Were we to
          announce from the average pulpit that the subject of our discourse
          would be the Sovereignty of God, it would sound very much as though we
          had borrowed a phrase from one of the dead languages. Alas! that it
          should be so. Alas! that the doctrine which is the key to history, the
          interpreter of Providence, the warp and woof of Scripture, and the
          foundation of Christian theology should be so sadly neglected and so
          little understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sovereignty of God. What do we mean by this expression? We mean
          the supremacy of God, the kingship of God, the godhood of God. To say
          that God is Sovereign is to declare that God is God. To say that God
          is Sovereign is to declare that He is the Most High, doing according
          to His will in the army of Heaven, and among the inhabitants of the
          earth, so that none can stay His hand or say unto Him what doest Thou?
          (Dan. 4:35). To say that God is Sovereign is to declare that He is the
          Almighty, the Possessor of all power in Heaven and earth, so that none
          can defeat His counsels, thwart His purpose, or resist His will (Psa.
          115:3). To say that God is Sovereign is to declare that He is "The
          Governor among the nations" (Psa. 22:28), setting up kingdoms,
          overthrowing empires, and determining the course of dynasties as
          pleaseth Him best. To say that God is Sovereign is to declare that He
          is the "Only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords" (1 Tim.
          6:15). Such is the God of the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          How different is the God of the Bible from the God of modern
          Christendom! The conception of Deity which prevails most widely today,
          even among those who profess to give heed to the Scriptures, is a
          miserable caricature, a blasphemous travesty of the Truth. The God of
          the twentieth century is a helpless, effeminate being who commands the
          respect of no really thoughtful man. The God of the popular mind is
          the creation of maudlin sentimentality. The God of many a present-day
          pulpit is an object of pity rather than of awe-inspiring reverence. To
          say that God the Father has purposed the salvation of all mankind,
          that God the Son died with the express intention of saving the whole
          human race, and that God the Holy Spirit is now seeking to win the
          world to Christ; when, as a matter of common observation, it is
          apparent that the great majority of our fellowmen are dying in sin,
          and passing into a hopeless eternity; is to say that God the Father is
          disappointed, that God the Son is dissatisfied, and that God the Holy
          Spirit is defeated. We have stated the issue baldly, but there is no
          escaping the conclusion. To argue that God is "trying His best" to
          save all mankind, but that the majority of men will not let Him save
          them, is to insist that the will of the Creator is impotent, and that
          the will of the creature is omnipotent. To throw the blame, as many
          do, upon the Devil, does not remove the difficulty, for if Satan is
          defeating the purpose of God, then, Satan is Almighty and God is no
          longer the Supreme Being.
        </p>
        <p>
          To declare that the Creator's original plan has been frustrated by
          sin, is to dethrone God. To suggest that God was taken by surprise in
          Eden and that He is now attempting to remedy an unforeseen calamity,
          is to degrade the Most High to the level of a finite, erring mortal.
          To argue that man is a free moral agent and the determiner of his own
          destiny, and that therefore he has the power to checkmate his Maker,
          is to strip God of the attribute of Omnipotence. To say that the
          creature has burst the bounds assigned by his Creator, and that God is
          now practically a helpless Spectator before the sin and suffering
          entailed by Adam's fall, is to repudiate the express declaration of
          Holy Writ, namely, "Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee: the
          remainder of wrath shalt Thou restrain" (Psa. 76:10). In a word, to
          deny the Sovereignty of God is to enter upon a path which, if followed
          to its logical terminus, is to arrive at blank atheism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sovereignty of the God of Scripture is absolute, irresistible,
          infinite. When we say that God is Sovereign we affirm His right to
          govern the universe which He has made for His own glory, just as He
          pleases. We affirm that His right is the right of the Potter over the
          clay, i. e., that He may mold that clay into whatsoever form He
          chooses, fashioning out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and
          another unto dishonor. We affirm that He is under no rule or law
          outside of His own will and nature, that God is a law unto Himself,
          and that He is under no obligation to give an account of His matters
          to any.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sovereignty characterizes the whole Being of God. He is Sovereign in
          all His attributes. He is Sovereign in the exercise of His power. His
          power is exercised as He wills, when He wills, where He wills. This
          fact is evidenced on every page of Scripture. For a long season that
          power appears to be dormant, and then it is put forth in irresistible
          might. Pharaoh dared to hinder Israel from going forth to worship
          Jehovah in the wilderness-what happened? God exercised His power, His
          people were delivered and their cruel taskmasters slain. But a little
          later, the Amalekites dared to attack these same Israelites in the
          wilderness, and what happened? Did God put forth His power on this
          occasion and display His hand as He did at the Red Sea? Were these
          enemies of His people promptly overthrown and destroyed? No, on the
          contrary, the Lord swore that He would "have war with Amalek from
          generation to generation" (Exo. 17:16). Again, when Israel entered the
          land of Canaan, God's power was signally displayed. The city of
          Jericho barred their progress-what happened? Israel did not draw a bow
          nor strike a blow: the Lord stretched forth His hand and the walls
          fell down flat. But the miracle was never repeated! No other city fell
          after this manner. Every other city had to be captured by the sword!
        </p>
        <p>
          Many other instances might be adduced illustrating the Sovereign
          exercise of God's power. Take one other example. God put forth His
          power and David was delivered from Goliath, the giant; the mouths of
          the lions were closed and Daniel escaped unhurt; the three Hebrew
          children were cast into the burning fiery furnace and came forth
          unharmed and unscorched. But God's power did not always interpose for
          the deliverance of His people, for we read: "And others had trial of
          cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and
          imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted,
          were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and
          goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented" (Heb. 11:36, 37).
          But why? Why were not these men of faith delivered like the others?
          Or, why were not the others suffered to be killed like these? Why
          should God's power interpose and rescue some and not the others? Why
          allow Stephen to be stoned to death, and then deliver Peter from
          prison?
        </p>
        <p>
          God is Sovereign in the delegation of His power to others. Why did God
          endow Methuselah with a vitality which enabled him to outlive all his
          contemporaries? Why did God impart to Samson a physical strength which
          no other human has ever possessed? Again; it is written, "But thou
          shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is He that giveth thee power
          to get wealth" (Deut. 8:18), but God does not bestow this power on all
          alike. Why not? Why has He given such power to men like Morgan,
          Carnegie, Rockefeller? The answer to all of these questions is,
          Because God is Sovereign, and being Sovereign He does as He pleases.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is Sovereign in the exercise of His mercy. Necessarily so, for
          mercy is directed by the will of Him that showeth mercy. Mercy is not
          a right to which man is entitled. Mercy is that adorable attribute of
          God by which He pities and relieves the wretched. But under the
          righteous government of God no one is wretched who does not deserve to
          be so. The objects of mercy, then, are those who are miserable, and
          all misery is the result of sin, hence the miserable are deserving of
          punishment not mercy. To speak of deserving mercy is a contradiction
          of terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          God bestows His mercies on whom He pleases and withholds them as
          seemeth good unto Himself. A remarkable illustration of this fact is
          seen in the manner that God responded to the prayers of two men
          offered under very similar circumstances. Sentence of death was passed
          upon Moses for one act of disobedience, and he besought the Lord for a
          reprieve. But was his desire gratified? No; he told Israel, "The LORD
          was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD
          said unto me, Let it suffice thee" (Deut. 3:26). Now mark the second
          case: "In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
          Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the
          LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. Then
          he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, I
          beseech Thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before Thee in
          truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in
          Thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. And it came to pass, afore Isaiah
          was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to
          him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people,
          Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
          prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third
          day thou shalt go unto the house of the LORD. And I will add unto thy
          days fifteen years" (2 Kings 20:1-6). Both of these men had the
          sentence of death in themselves, and both prayed earnestly unto the
          Lord for a reprieve: the one wrote: "The Lord would not hear me," and
          died; but to the other it was said, "I have heard thy prayer," and his
          life was spared. What an illustration and exemplification of the truth
          expressed in Romans 9:15!-"For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on
          whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
          compassion."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sovereign exercise of God's mercy-pity shown to the wretched-was
          displayed when Jehovah became flesh and tabernacled among men. Take
          one illustration. During one of the Feasts of the Jews, the Lord Jesus
          went up to Jerusalem. He came to the Pool of Bethesda where lay "a
          great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting
          for the moving of the water." Among this "great multitude" there was
          "a certain man which had an infirmity thirty and eight years." What
          happened? "When Jesus saw him He, and knew that he had been now a long
          time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? The
          impotent man answer Him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is
          troubled, to put me into the pool: but when I am coming, another
          steppeth down before me. Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed,
          and walk. And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
          and walked" (John 5:3-9). Why was this one man singled out from all
          the others? We are not told that he cried "Lord, have mercy on me."
          There is not a word in the narrative which intimates that this man
          possessed any qualifications which entitled him to receive special
          favor. Here then was a case of the Sovereign exercise of Divine mercy,
          for it was just as easy for Christ to heal the whole of that "great
          multitude" as this one "certain man." But He did not. He put forth His
          power and relieved the wretchedness of this one particular sufferer,
          and for some reason known only to Himself, He declined to do the same
          for the others. Again, we say, what an illustration and
          exemplification of Romans 9:15!-"I will have mercy on whom I will have
          mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
        </p>
        <p>
          God is Sovereign in the exercise of His love. Ah! that is a hard
          saying, who then can receive it? It is written, "A man can receive
          nothing, except it be given him from Heaven" (John 3:27). When we say
          that God is Sovereign in the exercise of His love, we mean that He
          loves whom He chooses. God does not love everybody*; if He did, He
          would love the Devil. Why does not God love the Devil? Because there
          is nothing in him to love; because there is nothing in him to attract
          the heart of God. Nor is there anything to attract God's love in any
          of the fallen sons of Adam, for all of them are, by nature, "children
          of wrath" (Eph. 2:3). If then there is nothing in any member of the
          human race to attract God's love,[1] and if, notwithstanding, He does
          love some, then it necessarily follows that the cause of His love must
          be found in Himself, which is only another way of saying that the
          exercise of God's love towards the fallen sons of men is according to
          His own good pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final analysis, the exercise of God's love must he traced back
          to His Sovereignty or, otherwise, He would love by rule; and if He
          loved by rule, then is He under a law of love, and if He is under a
          law of love then is He not supreme, but is Himself ruled by law.
          "But," it may be asked, "Surely you do not deny that God loves the
          entire human family?" We reply, it is written, "Jacob have I loved,
          but Esau have I hated" (Rom. 9:13). If then God loved Jacob and hated
          Esau, and that before they were born or had done either good or evil,
          then the reason for His love was not in them, but in Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the exercise of God's love is according to His own Sovereign
          pleasure is also clear from the language of Ephesians 1:3-5, where we
          read, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
          hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
          Christ: According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of
          the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in
          love. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to Himself according to the good pleasure of His will." It was
          "in love" that God the Father predestined His chosen ones unto the
          adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself, "according"-according
          to what? According to some excellency He discovered in them? No. What
          then? According to what He foresaw they would become? No; mark
          carefully the inspired answer-"According to the good pleasure of His
          will."
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not unmindful of the fact that men have invented the
          distinction between God's love of complacency and His love of
          compassion, but this is an invention pure and simple. Scripture terms
          the latter God's "pity" (see Matt. 18:33), and "He is kind unto the
          unthankful and the evil" (Luke 6:35)!
        </p>
        <p>
          God is Sovereign in the exercise of His grace. This of necessity, for
          grace is favor shown to the undeserving, yea, to the Helldeserving.
          Grace is the antithesis of justice. Justice demands the impartial
          enforcement of law. Justice requires that each shall receive his
          legitimate due, neither more nor less. Justice bestows no favors and
          is no respecter of persons. Justice, as such, shows no pity and knows
          no mercy. But after justice has been fully satisfied, grace flows
          forth. Divine grace is not exercised at the expense of justice, but
          "grace reigns through righteousness" (Rom. 5:21), and if grace
          "reigns," then is grace Sovereign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grace has been defined as the unmerited favor of God[2]; and if
          unmerited, then none can claim it as their inalienable right. If grace
          is unearned and undeserved, then none are entitled to it. If grace is
          a gift, then none can demand it. Therefore, as salvation is by grace,
          the free gift of God, then He bestows it on whom He pleases. Because
          salvation is by grace, the very chief of sinners is not beyond the
          reach of Divine mercy. Because salvation is by grace, boasting is
          excluded and God gets all the glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sovereign exercise of grace is illustrated on nearly every page of
          Scripture. The Gentiles are left to walk in their own ways while
          Israel becomes the covenant people of Jehovah. Ishmael the firstborn
          is cast out comparatively unblest, while Isaac the son of his parents'
          old age is made the child of promise. Esau the generous-hearted and
          forgiving-spirited is denied the blessing, though he sought it
          carefully with tears, while the worm Jacob receives the inheritance
          and is fashioned into a vessel of honor. So in the New Testament.
          Divine Truth is hidden from the wise and prudent, but is revealed to
          babes. The Pharisees and Sadducees are left to go their own way, while
          publicans and harlots are drawn by the cords of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a remarkable manner Divine grace was exercised at the time of the
          Saviour's birth. The incarnation of God's Son was one of the greatest
          events in the history of the universe, and yet its actual occurrence
          was not made known to all mankind; instead, it was specially revealed
          to the Bethlehem shepherds and wise men of the East. And this was
          prophetic and indicative of the entire course of this dispensation,
          for even today Christ is not made known to all. It would have been an
          easy matter for God to have sent a company of angels to every nation
          and to have announced the birth of His Son. But He did not. God could
          have readily attracted the attention of all mankind to the "star"; but
          He did not. Why? Because God is Sovereign and dispenses His favors as
          He pleases. Note particularly the two classes to whom the birth of the
          Saviour was made known, namely, the most unlikely classes-illiterate
          shepherds and heathen from a far country. No angel stood before the
          Sanhedrin and announced the advent of Israel's Messiah! No "star"
          appeared unto the scribes and lawyers as they, in their pride and
          self-righteousness, searched the Scriptures! They searched diligently
          to find out where He should be born, and yet it was not made known to
          them when He was actually come. What a display of Divine
          Sovereignty-the illiterate shepherds singled out for peculiar honor,
          and the learned and eminent passed by! And why was the birth of the
          Saviour revealed to these foreigners, and not to those in whose midst
          He was born? See in this a wonderful foreshadowing of God's dealings
          with our race throughout the entire Christian dispensation-Sovereign
          in the exercise of His grace, bestowing His favors on whom He pleases,
          often on the most unlikely and unworthy.

          It has been pointed out to us that God's Sovereignty was signally
          displayed in His choice of the place where His Son was born. Not to
          Greece or Italy did the Lord of Glory come, but to the insignificant
          land of Palestine! Not in Jerusalem-the royal city-was Immanuel born,
          but in Bethlehem, which was "little among the thousands (of towns and
          villages) in Judah" (Micah 5:2)! And it was in despised Nazareth that
          He grew up!! Truly, God's ways are not ours
