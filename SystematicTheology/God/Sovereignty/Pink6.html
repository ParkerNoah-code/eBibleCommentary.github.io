        <h2>6 - The Sovereignty Of God In Operation</h2>
        <p>
          For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be
          the glory for ever. Amen" (Romans 11:36).
        </p>
        <p>
          Has God foredained everything that comes to pass? Has He decreed that
          what is, was to have been? In the final analysis this is only another
          way of asking, Is God now governing the world and everyone and
          everything in it? If God is governing the world then is He governing
          it according to a definite purpose, or aimlessly and at random? If He
          is governing it according to some purpose, then when was that purpose
          made? Is God continually changing His purpose and making a new one
          every day, or was His purpose formed from the beginning? Are God's
          actions, like ours, regulated by the change of circumstances, or are
          they the outcome of His eternal purpose? If God formed a purpose
          before man was created then is that purpose going to be executed
          according to His original designs and is He now working toward that
          end? What saith the Scriptures? They declare God is One "who worketh
          all things after the counsel of His own will" (Eph. 1:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          Few who read this book are likely to call into question the statement
          that God knows and foreknows all things, but perhaps many would
          hesitate to go further than this. Yet is it not self-evident that if
          God foreknows all things, He has also foredained all things? Is it not
          clear that God foreknows what will be because He has decreed what
          shall be? God's foreknowledge is not the cause of events, rather are
          events the effects of His eternal purpose. when God has decreed a
          thing shall be He knows it will! be. In the nature of things there
          cannot be anything known as what shall be unless it is certain to be,
          and there is nothing certain to be unless God has ordained it shall
          be. Take the Crucifixion as an illustration. On this point the
          teaching of Scripture is as clear as a sunbeam. Christ as the Lamb
          whose blood was to be shed was "foreordained before the foundation of
          the world" (1 Peter 1:20). Having then "ordained" the slaying of the
          Lamb, God knew He would be "led to the slaughter," and therefore made
          it known accordingly through Isaiah the prophet. The Lord Jesus was
          not "delivered" up by God foreknowing it before it took place, but by
          His fixed counsel and fore-ordination (Acts 2:23). Foreknowledge of
          future events then is founded upon God's decrees, hence if God
          foreknows everything that is to be, it is because He has determined in
          Himself from all eternity everything which will be-"Known unto God are
          all His works from the beginning of the world" (Acts 15:18), which
          shows that God has a plan, that God did not begin His work at random
          or without a knowledge of how His plan would succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          God created all things. This truth no one, who bows to the testimony
          of Holy Writ, will question; nor would any such be prepared to argue
          that the work of creation was an accidental work. God first formed the
          purpose to create, and then put forth the creative act in fulfillment
          of that purpose. All real Christians will readily adopt the words of
          the Psalmist and say, "O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! in wisdom
          hast Thou made them all." Will any who endorse what we have just said,
          deny that God purposed to govern the world which He created? Surely
          the creation of the world was not the end of God's purpose concerning
          it. Surely He did not determine simply to create the world and place
          man in it, and then leave both to their fortunes. It must be apparent
          that God has some great end or ends in view worthy of His infinite
          perfections, and that He is now governing the world so as to
          accomplish these ends-"The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the
          thoughts of His heart to all generations" (Psa. 33:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none
          else; I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end from the
          beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done,
          saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure" (Isa.
          46:9, 10). Many other passages might be adduced to show that God has
          many counsels concerning this world and concerning man, and that all
          these counsels will most surely be realized. It is only when they are
          thus regarded that we can intelligently appreciate the prophecies of
          Scripture. In prophecy the mighty God has condescended to take us into
          the secret chamber of His eternal counsels and make known to us what
          He has purposed to do in the future. The hundreds of prophecies which
          are found in the Old and New Testaments are not so much predictions of
          what will come to pass, as they are revelations to us of what God has
          purposed SHALL come to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          What then was the great purpose for which this world and the human
          race were created? The answer of Scripture is, "The LORD hath made all
          things for Himself" (Prov. 16:4). And again, "Thou hast created all
          things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created" (Rev. 4:11).
          The great end of creation was the manifestation of God's glory. "The
          heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament sheweth His
          handiwork" (Psa. 19:1); but it was by man, originally made in His own
          image and likeness, that God designed chiefly to manifest His glory.
          But how was the great Creator to be glorified by man? Before his
          creation, God foresaw the fall of Adam and the consequent ruin of his
          race, therefore He could not have designed that man should glorify Him
          by continuing in a state of innocency. Accordingly we are taught that
          Christ was "foreordained before the foundation of the world" to be the
          Saviour of fallen men. The redemption of sinners by Christ was no mere
          after-thought of God: it was no expediency to meet an un-looked-for
          calamity. No; it was a Divine provision, and therefore when man fell
          he found mercy walking hand in hand with justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          From all eternity God designed that our world should be the stage on
          which He would display His manifold grace and wisdom in the redemption
          of lost sinners: "To the intent that now unto the principalities and
          powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold
          wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which He purposed in
          Christ Jesus our Lord" (Eph. 3:10-11.) For the accomplishment of this
          glorious design God has governed the world from the beginning, and
          will continue it to the end. It has been well said, "We can never
          understand the providence of God over our world, unless we regard it
          as a complicated machine having ten thousand parts, directed in all
          its operations to one glorious end-the display of the manifold wisdom
          of God in the salvation of the Church," i.e., the "called out" ones.
          Everything else down here is subordinated to this central purpose. It
          was the apprehension of this basic truth that the Apostle, moved by
          the Holy Spirit, was led to write, "Therefore I endure all things for
          the elect's sake, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in
          Christ Jesus with eternal glory" (2 Tim. 2:10). What we would now
          contemplate is the operation of God's Sovereignty in the government of
          this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the operation of God's government over the material world
          little needs now be said. In previous chapters we have shown that
          inanimate matter and all irrational creatures are absolutely subject
          to their Creator's pleasure. While we freely admit that the material
          world appears to be governed by laws that are stable and more or less
          uniform in their operations, yet Scripture, history, and observation,
          compel us to recognize the fact that God suspends these laws and acts
          apart from them whenever it pleaseth Him to do so. In sending His
          blessings or judgments upon His creatures He may cause the sun itself
          to stand still, and the stars in their courses to fight for His people
          (Judges 5:20); He may send or withhold "the early and the latter
          rains" according to the dictates of His own infinite wisdom; He may
          smite with plague or bless with health; in short, being God, being
          absolute Sovereign, He is bound and tied by no laws of Nature, but
          governs the material world as seemeth Him best.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          But what of God's government of the human family? What does Scripture
          reveal in regard to the modus operandi of the operations of His
          governmental administration over mankind? To what extent and by what
          influence does God control the sons of men? We shall divide our answer
          to this question into two parts and consider first God's method of
          dealing with the righteous, His elect; and then His method of dealing
          with the wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>GOD'S METHOD OF DEALING WITH THE RIGHTEOUS:</b>
        </p>
        <p>1. God exerts upon His own elect a quickening influence or power.</p>
        <p>
          By nature they are spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins, and
          their first need is spiritual life, for "Except a man be born again,
          he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). In the new birth God
          brings us from death unto life (John 5:24). He imparts to us His own
          nature (2 Peter 1:4). He delivers us from the power of darkness and
          translates us into the kingdom of His dear Son (Col. 1:13). Now,
          manifestly, we could not do this ourselves for we were "without
          strength" (Rom. 5:6), hence it is written, "we are His workmanship
          created in Christ Jesus" (Eph. 2:10).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the new birth we are made partakers of the Divine nature: a
          principle, a "seed," a life, is communicated to us which is "'born of
          the Spirit," and therefore "is spirit"; is born of the Holy Spirit and
          therefore is holy. Apart from this Divine and holy nature which is
          imparted to us at the new birth it is utterly impossible for any man
          to generate a spiritual impulse, form a spiritual concept, think a
          spiritual thought, understand spiritual things, still less engage in
          spiritual works. "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord," but the
          natural man has no desire for holiness, and the provision that God has
          made he does not want. Will then a man pray for, seek for, strive
          after, that which he dislikes? Surely not. If then a man does "follow
          after" that which by nature he cordially dislikes, if he does now love
          the One he once hated, it is because a miraculous change has taken
          place within him; a power outside of himself has operated upon him, a
          nature entirely different from his old one has been imparted to him,
          and hence it is written, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a
          new creation: old things are passed away; behold all things are become
          new" (2 Cor. 5:17). Such an one as we have just described has passed
          from death unto life, has been turned from darkness to light, and from
          the power of Satan unto God (Acts 26:18). In no other way can the
          great change be accounted for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new birth is very, very much more than simply shedding a few tears
          due to a temporary remorse over sin. It is far more than changing our
          course of life, the leaving off of bad habits and the substituting of
          good ones. It is something different from the mere cherishing and
          practising of noble ideals. It goes infinitely deeper than coming
          forward to take some popular evangelist by the hand, signing a
          pledge-card, or "joining the church." The new birth is no mere turning
          over a new leaf but is the inception and reception of a new life. It
          is no mere reformation but a complete transformation. In short, the
          new birth is a miracle, the result of the supernatural operation of
          God. It is radical, revolutionary, lasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here then is the first thing, in time, which God does in His own
          elect. He lays hold of those who are spiritually dead and quickens
          them into newness of life. He takes up one who was shapen in iniquity
          and conceived in sin, and conforms him to the image of His Son. He
          seizes a captive of the Devil and makes him a member of the household
          of faith. He picks up a beggar and makes him jointheir with Christ. He
          comes to one who is full of enmity against Him and gives him a new
          heart that is full of love for Him. He stoops to one who by nature is
          a rebel and works in him both to will and to do of His own good
          pleasure. By His irresistible power He transforms a sinner into a
          saint, an enemy into a friend, a slave of the Devil into a child of
          God. Surely then we are moved to say,
        </p>
        <p>
          "When all Thy mercies O my God<br />
          My wondering soul surveys,<br />
          Transported with the view I'm lost<br />
          In wonder, love and praise."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God exerts upon His own elect an energizing influence or power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Apostle prayed to God for the Ephesian saints that the eyes of
          their understanding might be enlightened in order that, among other
          things, they might know "what is the exceeding greatness of His power
          to us-ward who believe" (Eph. 1:19), and that they might be
          "strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man" (3:16). It is
          thus that the children of God are enabled to fight the good fight of
          faith and battle with the adverse forces which constantly war against
          them. In themselves they have no strength: they are but "sheep," and
          sheep are one of the most defenseless animals there is; but the
          promise is sure-"He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have
          no might He increaseth strength" (Isa. 40:29).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is this energizing power that God exerts upon and within the
          righteous which enables them to serve Him acceptably. Said the prophet
          of old, "But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord"
          (Micah 3:8). And said our Lord to His Apostles, "Ye shall receive
          power, after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you" (Acts 1:8), and
          thus it proved, for of these same men we read subsequently, "And with
          great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord
          Jesus: and great grace was upon them all" (Acts 4:33). So it was, too,
          with the Apostle Paul, "and my speech and my preaching was not with
          enticing word of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and
          of power" (1 Cor. 2:4). But the scope of this power is not confined to
          service, for we read in 2 Peter 1:3, "According as His Divine power
          hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,
          through the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue."
          Hence it is that the various graces of the Christian character, "love,
          joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance," are ascribed directly to God Himself, being denominated
          "the fruit of the Spirit" (Gal. 5:22-23). Compare Ephesians 5:9.
        </p>
        <p>3. God exerts upon His own elect a directing influence or power.</p>
        <p>
          Of old He led His people across the wilderness, directing their steps
          by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night; and today
          He still directs His saints, though now from within rather from
          without. "For this God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our
          Guide even unto death" (Psa. 48:14), but He "guides" us by working in
          us both to will and to do His good pleasure. That He does so guide us
          is clear from the words of the Apostle in Ephesians 2: 10-"For we are
          His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
          hath before ordained that we should walk in them." Thus all ground for
          boasting is removed and God gets all the glory, for with the prophet
          we have to say, "LORD, Thou wilt ordain peace for us: for Thou also
          hast wrought all our works in us" (Isa. 26:12). How true then that "A
          man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps" (Prov.
          16:29)! Compare Psalm 65:4; Ezekiel 36:27.
        </p>
        <p>4. God exerts upon His own elect a preserving influence or power.</p>
        <p>
          Many are the Scriptures which set forth this blessed truth. "He
          preserveth the souls of His saints; He delivereth them out of the hand
          of the wicked" (Psa. 97:10). "For the LORD loveth judgment, and
          forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of
          the wicked shall be cut off" (Psa. 37:28). "The LORD preserveth all
          them that love Him: but all the wicked will He destroy" (Psa. 145:20).
          It is needless to multiply texts or to raise an argument at this point
          respecting the believer's responsibility and faithfulness-we can no
          more "persevere" without God preserving us than we can breathe when
          God ceases to give us breath; we are "kept by the power of God through
          faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time" (1 Peter
          1:5). Compare 1 Chronicles 18:6. It remains for us now to consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>GOD'S METHOD OF DEALING WITH THE WICKED:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In contemplating God's governmental dealings with the non-elect we
          find that He exerts upon them a fourfold influence or power. We adopt
          the clear-cut divisions suggested by Dr. Rice:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God exerts upon the wicked a restraining influence by which they
          are prevented from doing what they are naturally inclined to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          A striking example of this is seen in Abimelech, king of Gerar.
          Abraham came down to Gerar and fearful lest he might be slain on
          account of his wife he instructed her to pose as his sister. Regarding
          her as an unmarried woman, Abimelech sent and took Sarah unto himself;
          and then we learn how God put forth His power to protect her
          honor-"And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
          this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from
          sinning against Me: therefore suf ered I thee not to touch her" (Gen.
          20:6). Had not God interposed, Abimelech would have grievously wronged
          Sarah, but the Lord restrained him and allowed him not to carry out
          the intentions of his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          A similar instance is found in connection with Joseph and his
          brethren's treatment of him. Owing to Jacob's partiality for Joseph
          his brethren "hated him," and when they thought they had him in their
          power "they conspired against him to slay him" (Gen. 37:18). But God
          did not allow them to carry out their evil designs. First He moved
          Reuben to deliver him out of their hands, and next he caused Judah to
          suggest that Joseph should be sold to the passing Ishmaelites, who
          carried him down into Egypt. That it was God who thus restrained them
          is clear; he made known himself to his brethren; said he, "So now it
          was not you that sent me hither, but God" (Gen. 45:8)!

          The restraining influence which God exerts upon the wicked was
          strikingly exemplified in the person of Balaam, the prophet hired by
          Balak to curse the Israelites. One cannot read the inspired narrative
          without discovering that, left to himself, Balaam had readily and
          certainly accepted the offer of Balak. How evidently God restrained
          the impulses of his heart is seen from his own acknowledgment-"How
          shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the
          LORD hath not defied? Behold I have received commandment to bless: and
          He hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it" (Num. 23:8, 20).
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does God exert a restraining influence upon wicked
          individuals but He does so upon whole peoples as well. A remarkable
          illustration of this is found in Exodus 34:24-"For I will cast out the
          nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man
          desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy
          God thrice in the year." Three times every male Israelite, at the
          command of God, left his home and inheritance and journeyed to
          Jerusalem to keep the Feasts of the Lord; and in the above Scriptures
          we learn He promised them that while they were at Jerusalem He would
          guard their unprotected homes by restraining the covetous designs and
          desires of their heathen neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. God exerts upon the wicked a softening influence disposing them
          contrary to their natural inclinations to do that which will promote
          His cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above, we referred to Joseph's history as an illustration of God
          exerting a restraining influence upon the wicked, let us note now his
          experiences in Egypt as exemplifying our assertion that God also
          exerts a softening influence upon the unrighteous. We are told that
          while he was in the house of Potiphar "The LORD was with Joseph, and
          his master saw the LORD was with him," and in consequence, "Joseph
          found favor in his sight and he made him overseer over his house"
          (Gen. 39:2, 3, 4). Later, when Joseph was unjustly cast into prison,
          we are told "But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and
          gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison" (Gen. 39:21),
          and in consequence the prison-keeper showed him much kindness and
          honor. Finally, after his release from prison, we learn from Acts 7:10
          that the Lord "gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king
          of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
        </p>
        <p>
          An equally striking evidence Xof God's power to melt the hearts of his
          enemies, was seen in Pharaoh's daughter's treatment of the infant
          Moses. The incident is well known. Pharaoh had issued an edict
          commanding the destruction of every male child of the Israelites. A
          certain Levite had a son born to him who for three months was kept
          hidden by his mother. No longer able to conceal the infant Moses she
          placed him in an ark of bulrushes and laid him by the river's brink.
          The ark was discovered by none less than the king's daughter who had
          come down to the river to bathe, but instead of heeding her father's
          wicked decree and casting the child into the river we are told that
          "she had compassion on him" (Exo. 2:6)! Accordingly, the young life
          was spared and later Moses became the adopted son of this princess!
        </p>
        <p>
          God has access to the hearts of all men and He softens or hardens them
          according to His Sovereign purpose. The profane Esau swore vengeance
          upon his brother for the deception which he had practiced upon his
          father, yet when next he met Jacob, instead of slaying him we are told
          that Esau "fell on his neck and kissed him" (Gen. 33:4)! Ahab, the
          weak and wicked consort of Jezebel, was highly enraged against Elijah
          the prophet, at whose word the heavens had been shut up for three
          years and a half: so angry was he against the one whom he regarded as
          his enemy that we are told he searched for him in every nation and
          kingdom and when he could not be found "he took an oath" (1 Kings
          18:10). Yet, when they met, instead of killing the prophet, Ahab
          meekly obeyed Elijah's behest and "sent unto all the children of
          Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel" (v. 20).
          Again; Esther the poor Jewess is about to enter the presence-chamber
          of the august Medo-Persian monarch which, said she, "is not according
          to the law" (Esth. 4:16). She went in expecting to "perish," but we
          are told "She obtained favor in his sight, and the king held out to
          Esther the golden sceptre" (5:2). Yet again; the boy Daniel is a
          captive in a foreign court. The king "appointed" a daily provision of
          meat and drink for Daniel and his fellows. But Daniel purposed in his
          heart that he would not defile himself with the allotted portion, and
          accordingly made known his purpose to his master, the prince of the
          eunuchs. What happened? His master was a heathen and "feared" the
          king. Did he turn then upon Daniel and angrily demand that his orders
          be promptly carried out? No; for we read, "Now God had brought Daniel
          into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs" (Dan. 1:9)!
        </p>
        <p>
          "The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water:
          He turneth it whithersoever He will" (Prov. 21:1). A remarkable
          illustration of this is seen in Cyrus, the heathen king of Persia.
          God's people were in captivity, but the predicted end of their
          captivity was almost reached. Meanwhile the Temple at Jerusalem lay in
          ruins, and, as we have said, the Jews were in bondage in a distant
          land. What hope was there then that the Lord's house would be
          re-built? Mark now what God did, "Now in the first year of Cyrus king
          of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
          fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
          that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it in
          writing, saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of
          Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He hath
          charged me to build Him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah" (Ezra
          1:1, 2). Cyrus, be it remembered, was a pagan, and as secular history
          bears witness, a very wicked man, yet the Lord moved him to issue this
          edict that His Word through Jeremiah seventy years before might be
          fulfilled. A similar and further illustration is found in Ezra 7:27,
          where we find Ezra returning thanks for what God had caused King
          Artaxerxes to do in completing and beautifying the house which Cyrus
          had commanded to be erected-"Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers
          which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify
          the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem" (Ezra 7:27).
        </p>

          3. God exerts upon the wicked a directing influence so that good is
          made to result from their intended evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more we revert to the history of Joseph as a case in point. In
          selling Joseph to the Ishmaelites his brethren were actuated by cruel
          and heartless motives. Their object was to make away with him, and the
          passing of these traveling traders furnished an easy way out for them.
          To them the act was nothing more than the enslaving of a noble youth
          for the sake of gain. But now observe how God was secretly working and
          over-ruling their wicked actions. Providence so ordered it that these
          Ishmaelites passed by just in time to prevent Joseph being murdered,
          for his brethren had already taken counsel together to put him to
          death. Further; these Ishmaelites were journeying to Egypt, which was
          the very country to which God had purposed to send Joseph, and He
          ordained they should purchase Joseph just when they did. That the hand
          of God was in this incident, that it was something more than a
          fortunate coincidence, is clear from the words of Joseph to his
          brethren at a later date, "God sent me before you to preserve you a
          posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance"
          (Gen. 45:7).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another equally striking illustration of God directing the wicked is
          found in Isaiah 10:5-7: "O Assyrian, the rod of Mine anger, and the
          staff in their hand is Mine indignation. I will send him against an
          hypocritical nation, and against the people of My wrath will I give
          him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread
          them down like the mire of the streets. Howbeit he meaneth not so,
          neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and
          cut off nations not a few." Assyria's king had determined to be a
          world-conqueror, to "cut off nations not a few." But God directed and
          controlled his military lust and ambition, and caused him to confine
          his attention to the conquering of the insignificant nation of Israel.
          Such a task was not in the proud king's heart-"he meant it not so"-but
          God gave him this charge and he could do nothing but fulfill it.
          Compare also Judges 7:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          The supreme example of the controlling, directing influence which God
          exerts upon the wicked, is the Cross of Christ with all its attending
          circumstances. If ever the superintending providence of God was
          witnessed it was there. From all eternity God had predestined every
          detail of that event of all events. Nothing was left to chance or the
          caprice of man. God had decreed when and where and how His blessed Son
          was to die. Much of what He had purposed concerning the Crucifixion
          had been made known through the Old Testament prophets, and in the
          accurate and literal fulfillment of these prophecies we have clear
          proof, full demonstration, of the controlling and directing influence
          which God exerts upon the wicked. Not a thing occurred except as God
          had ordained, and all that He had ordained took place exactly as He
          purposed. Had it been decreed (and made known in Scripture) that the
          Saviour should be betrayed by one of His own disciples-by His
          "familiar friend"-see Psalm 41:9 and compare Matthew 26:50-then the
          Apostle Judas is the one who sold Him. Had it been decreed that the
          betrayer should receive for his awful perfidy thirty pieces of silver,
          then are the chief priests moved to offer him this very sum. Had it
          been decreed that this betrayal sum should be put to a particular use,
          namely, purchase of the potter's field, then the hand of God directs
          Judas to return the money to the chief priests and so guided their
          "counsel" (Matt. 27:7) that they did this very thing. Had it been
          decreed that there should be those who bore "false witness" against
          our Lord (Psa. 35:11), then accordingly such were raised up. Had it
          been decreed that the Lord of Glory should be spat upon and "scourged"
          (Isa. 50:6), then there were not found wanting those who were vile
          enough to do so. Had it been decreed that the Saviour should be
          "numbered with the transgressors," then unknown to himself, Pilate,
          directed by God, gave orders for His crucifixion along with two
          thieves. Had it been decreed that vinegar and gall should be given Him
          to drink while He hung upon the Cross, then this decree of God was
          executed to the very letter. Had it been decreed that the heartless
          should gamble for His garments, then sure enough they did this very
          thing. Had it been decreed that not a bone of Him should be broken
          (Psa. 34:20), then the controlling hand of God which suffered the
          Roman soldier to break the legs of the thieves, prevented him from
          doing the same with our Lord. Ah! there were not enough soldiers in
          all the Roman legions, there were not sufficient demons in all the
          hierarchies of Satan, to break one bone in the body of Christ. And
          why? Because the Almighty Sovereign had decreed that not a bone should
          be broken. Do we need to extend this paragraph any farther? Does not
          the accurate and literal fulfillment of all that Scripture had
          predicted in connection with the Crucifixion, demonstrate beyond all
          controversy that an Almighty power was directing and superintending
          everything that was done on that Day of days?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. God also hardens the hearts of wicked men and blinds their minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          "God hardens men's hearts! G od blinds men's minds!" Yes, so Scripture
          represents Him. In developing this theme of the Sovereignty of God in
          Operation we recognize that we have now reached its most solemn aspect
          of all, and that here especially, we need to keep very close indeed to
          the words of Holy Writ. God forbid that we should go one fraction
          further than His Word goes; but may He give us grace to go as far as
          His Word goes. It is true that secret things belong unto the Lord, but
          it is also true that those things which are revealed in Scripture
          belong unto us and to our children.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal subtly with His
          servants" (Psa. 105:25). The reference here is to the sojourn of the
          descendants of Jacob in the land of Egypt when, after the death of the
          Pharaoh who had welcomed the old patriarch and his family, there
          "arose up a new king who knew not Joseph"; and in his days the
          children of Israel had "increased greatly" so that they outnumbered
          the Egyptians; then it was that God "turned their heart to hate His
          people."
        </p>
        <p>
          The consequence of the Egyptians' "hatred" is well known: they brought
          them into cruel bondage and placed them under merciless taskmasters
          until their lot became unendurable. Helpless and wretched the
          Israelites cried unto Jehovah, and in response He appointed Moses to
          be their deliverer. God revealed Himself unto His chosen servant, gave
          him a number of miraculous signs which he was to exhibit at the
          Egyptian court, and then bade him to go to Pharaoh and demand that the
          Israelites should be allowed to go to a three days' journey into the
          wilderness, that they might worship the Lord. But before Moses started
          out on his journey God warned him concerning Pharaoh, "I will harden
          his heart that he shall not let the people go" (Exo. 4:21). If it be
          asked, Why did God harden Pharaoh's heart? the answer furnished by
          Scripture itself is, In order that God might show forth His power in
          him (Rom. 9:17); in other words, it was so that the Lord might
          demonstrate that it was just as easy for Him to overthrow this haughty
          and powerful monarch as it was for Him to crush a worm. If it should
          be pressed further, Why did God select such a method of displaying His
          power? then the answer must be that being Sovereign God reserves to
          Himself the right to act as He pleases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only are we told that God hardened the heart of Pharaoh so that he
          would not let the Israelites go, but after God had plagued his land so
          severely that he reluctantly gave a qualified permission, and after
          that the first-born of all the Egyptians had been slain, and Israel
          had actually left the land of bondage, God told Moses, "And I, behold,
          I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them:
          and I will get Me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his
          chariots, and upon his horsemen. And the Egyptians shall know that I
          am the LORD, when I have gotten Me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his
          chariots, and upon his horsemen" (Exo. 14:17, 18).
        </p>
        <p>
          The same thing happened subsequently in connection with Sihon, king of
          Heshbon, through whose territory Israel had to pass on their way to
          the promised land. When reviewing their history Moses told the people,
          "But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD
          thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He
          might deliver him into thy hand" (Deut. 2:30)!
        </p>
        <p>
          So it was also after that Israel had entered Canaan. We read, "There
          was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the
          Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle. For
          it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come
          against Israel in battle, that He might destroy them, as the Lord
          commanded Moses" (Josh. 11:19, 20). From other Scriptures we learn why
          God purposed to "destroy utterly" the Canaanites-it was because of
          their awful wickedness and corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor is the revelation of this solemn truth confined to the Old
          Testament. In John 12:37-40 we read, "But though He had done so many
          miracles before them, yet they believed not on Him: that (in order
          that) the saying of Esaias (Isaiah) the prophet might be fulfilled,
          which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath
          the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe,
          because that Esaias said again, HE hath blinded their eyes, and
          hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor
          understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal
          them." It needs to be carefully noted here that these whose eyes God
          "blinded" and whose heart He "hardened" were men who had deliberately
          scorned the Light and rejected the testimony of God's own Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly we read in 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12, "And for this cause God
          shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that
          they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure
          in unrighteousness." What God did unto the Jews of old He is yet going
          to do unto Christendom. Just as the Jews of Christ's day despised His
          testimony, and in consequence were "blinded," so a guilty Christendom
          which has rejected the Truth shall yet have sent them from God a
          "strong delusion" that they may believe a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is God really governing the world? Is He exercising rule over the
          human family? What is the modus operandi of His governmental
          administration over mankind? To what extent and by what means does He
          control the sons of men? How does God exercise an influence upon the
          wicked, seeing their hearts are at enmity against Him? These are some
          of the questions we have sought to answer from Scripture in the
          previous sections of this chapter. Upon His own elect God exerts a
          quickening, an energizing, a directing, and a preserving power. Upon
          the wicked God exerts a restraining, softening, directing, and
          hardening and blinding power, according to the dictates of His own
          infinite wisdom and unto the outworking of His own eternal purpose.
          God's decrees are being executed. What He has ordained is being
          accomplished. Man's wickedness is bounded. The limits of evil-doing
          and of evildoers has been Divinely defined and cannot be exceeded.
          Though many are in ignorance of it, all men, good and bad, are under
          the jurisdiction of and are absolutely subject to the administration
          of the Supreme Sovereign-"Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent
          reigneth" (Rev. 19:6)-reigneth over all.
