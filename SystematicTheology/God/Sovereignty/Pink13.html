        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>"Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth" (Rev. 19:6).</p>
        <p>
          In our Foreword to the Second Edition we acknowledge the need for
          preserving the balance of Truth. Two things are beyond dispute: God is
          Sovereign, man is responsible. In this book we have sought to expound
          the former; in our other works we have frequently pressed the latter.
          That there is real danger of over-emphasizing the one and ignoring the
          other, we readily admit; yea, history furnishes numerous examples of
          cases of each. To emphasize the Sovereignty of God without also
          maintaining the accountability of the creature tends to fatalism; to
          be so concerned in maintaining the responsibility of man as to lose
          sight of the Sovereignty of God is to exalt the creature and dishonor
          the Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost all doctrinal error is really, Truth perverted, Truth
          wrongfully divided, Truth disproportionately held and taught. The
          fairest face on earth, with the most comely features, would soon
          become ugly and unsightly if one member continued growing while the
          others remained undeveloped. Beauty is, primarily, a matter of
          proportion. Thus it is with the Word of God: its beauty and
          blessedness are best perceived when its manifold wisdom is exhibited
          in its true proportions. Here is where so many have failed in the
          past. A single phase of God's Truth has so impressed this man or that
          he has concentrated his attention upon it, almost to the exclusion of
          everything else. Some portion of God's Word has been made a "pet
          doctrine," and often this has become the distinctive badge of some
          party. But it is the duty of each servant of God to "declare all the
          counsel of God" (Acts 20:27).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that the degenerate days in which our lot is cast, when on
          every side man is exalted and "superman" has become a common
          expression, there is real need for a special emphasis upon the
          glorious fact of God's supremacy. The more so where this is expressly
          denied. Yet even here much wisdom is required lest our zeal should not
          be "according to knowledge." The words "meat in due season" should
          ever be before the servant of God. What is needed, primarily, by one
          congregation may not be specifically needed by another. If called to
          labor where Arminian preachers have preceded, then the neglected truth
          of God's Sovereignty should be expounded, though with caution and care
          lest too much "strong meat" be given to "babes." The example of Christ
          in John 16:12 "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
          bear them now," must be borne in mind. On the other hand, if I am
          called to take charge of a distinctly Calvinistic pulpit, then the
          truth of human responsibility (in its many aspects) may be profitably
          set forth. What the preacher needs to give out is not what his people
          most like to hear, but what they most need, i.e., those aspects of
          truth they are least familiar with, or least exhibiting in their walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          To carry into actual practice what we have inculcated above will, most
          probably, lay the preacher open to the charge of being a Turncoat. But
          what matters that if he has his Master's approval? He is not called
          upon to be "consistent" with himself nor with any rules drawn up by
          man; his business is to be consistent with Holy Writ. And in Scripture
          each part or aspect of Truth is balanced by another aspect of Truth.
          There are two sides to everything, even to the character of God for He
          is "light" (1 John 1:5) as well as "love" (1 John 4:8), and therefore
          are we called upon to "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of
          God" (Rom. 11:22). To be all the time preaching on the one to the
          exclusion of the other caricatures the Divine character.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Son of God became incarnate He came here in "the form of a
          servant" (Phil. 2:7); nevertheless, in the manger He was "Christ the
          Lord" (Luke 2:11)! All things are possible with God (Matt. 19:26) yet
          God "cannot lie" (Titus 1:2). Scripture says "Bear ye one another's
          burdens" (Gal. 6:2), yet the same chapter insists "every man shall
          bear his own burden" (Gal. 6:5). We are enjoined to take "no thought
          for the morrow" (Matt. 6:34), yet "if any provide not for his own, and
          specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is
          worse than an infidel" (1 Tim. 5:8). No sheep of Christ's can perish
          (John 10:28, 29), yet the Christian is bidden to make his "calling and
          election sure" (2 Peter 1:10). And so we might go on multiplying
          illustrations. These things are not contradictions but
          complementaries: the one "balances the other." Thus, the Scriptures
          set forth both the Sovereignty of God and the responsibility of man.
          So, too, should every servant of God, and that, in their proper
          proportion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we return now to a few closing reflections upon our present theme,
          "And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in
          the house of the LORD, before the new court, and said, LORD God of our
          fathers, art not Thou God in Heaven? and rulest not Thou over all the
          kingdoms of the heathen? and in Thine hand is there not power and
          might, so that none is able to withstand Thee?" (2 Chron. 20:5, 6).
          Yes, the Lord is God, ruling in supreme majesty and might. Yet in our
          day, a day of boasted enlightenment and progress, this is denied on
          every hand. A materialistic science and atheistic philosophy have
          bowed God out of His own world, and everything is regulated, forsooth,
          by (impersonal) laws of Nature. So in human affairs: at best God is a
          far-distant spectator, and a helpless one at that. God could not help
          the launching of the dreadful war, and though He longed to put a stop
          to it He was unable to do so-and this in the face of 1 Chronicles
          5:22; 2 Chronicles 24:24! Having endowed man with "free agency" God is
          obliged to let man make his own choice and go his own way, and He
          cannot interfere with him, or otherwise his moral responsibility would
          be destroyed! Such are the popular beliefs of the day. One is not
          surprised to find these sentiments emanating from German theologians,
          but how sad that they should be taught in many of our Seminaries,
          echoed from many of our pulpits, and accepted by many of the rank and
          file of professing Christians.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most flagrant sins of our age is that of irreverence-the
          failure to ascribe the glory which is due the august majesty of God.
          Men limit the power and activities of the Lord in their degrading
          concepts of His being and character. Originally, man was made in the
          image and likeness of God, but today we are asked to believe in a god
          made in the image and likeness of man. The Creator is reduced to the
          level of the creature: His omniscience is called into question, His
          omnipotencey is no longer believed in, and His absolute Sovereignty is
          flatly denied. Men claim to be the architects of their own fortunes
          and the determiners of their own destiny. They know not that their
          lives are at the disposal of the Divine Despot. They know not they
          have no more power to thwart His secret decrees than a worm has to
          resist the tread of an elephant. They know not that "The LORD hath
          prepared His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom ruleth over all"
          (Psa. 103:19).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the foregoing pages we have sought to repudiate such paganistic
          views as the above-mentioned, and have endeavored to show from
          Scripture that God is God, on the Throne, and that so far from the
          recent war being an evidence that the helm had slipped out of His hand
          it was a sure proof that He still lives and reigns, and is now
          bringing to pass that which He had fore-determined and foreannounced
          (Matt. 24:6-8 etc.). That the carnal mind is enmity against God, that
          the unregenerate man is a rebel against the Divine government, that
          the sinner has no concern for the glory of his Maker, and little or no
          respect for His revealed will, is freely granted. But, nevertheless,
          behind the scenes God is ruling and over-ruling, fulfilling His
          eternal purpose, not only in spite of but also by means of those who
          are His enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          How earnestly are the claims of man contended for against the claims
          of God! Has not man power and knowledge, but what of it? Has God no
          will, or power, or knowledge? Suppose man's will conflicts with God's,
          then what? Turn to the Scripture of Truth for answer. Men had a will
          on the plains of Shinar and determined to build a tower whose top
          should reach unto Heaven, but what came of their purpose? Pharaoh had
          a will when He hardened his heart and Pharaoh refused to allow
          Jehovah's people to go and worship Him in the wilderness, but what
          came of his rebellion? Balak had a will when he hired Balaam to come
          and curse the Hebrews, but of what avail was it? The Canaanites had a
          will when they determined to prevent Israel occupying the land of
          Canaan, but how far did they succeed? Saul had a will when he hurled
          his javelin at David, but it entered the wall instead! Jonah had a
          will when he refused to go and preach to the Ninevites, but what came
          of it? Nebuchadnezzar had a will when he thought to destroy the three
          Hebrew children, but God had a will too, and the fire did not harm
          them. Herod had a will when he sought to slay the Child Jesus, and had
          there been no living, reigning God, his evil desire would have been
          effected: but in daring to pit his puny will against the irresistible
          will of the Almighty his efforts came to nought. Yes, my reader, and
          you, too, had a will when you formed your plans without first seeking
          counsel of the Lord, therefore did He overturn them! "There are many
          devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of LORD, that shall
          stand" (Prov. 19:21).
        </p>
        <p>
          What a demonstration of the irresistible Sovereignty of God is
          furnished by that wonderful statement found in Revelation 17:17: "For
          God hath put in their hearts to fulfill His will, and to agree, and
          give their kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall be
          fulfilled." The fulfillment of any single prophecy is but the
          Sovereignty of God in operation. It is the demonstration that what He
          has decreed He is able also to perform. It is proof that none can
          withstand the execution of His counsel or prevent the accomplishment
          of His pleasure. It is evidence that God inclines men to fulfill that
          which He has ordained and perform that which He has foredetermined. If
          God were not absolute Sovereign then Divine prophecy would be
          valueless, for in such case no guarantee would be left that what He
          had predicted would surely come to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill His will, and to agree,
          and give their kingdom unto the Beast, until the words of God shall be
          fulfilled" (Rev. 17:17). We can not do better than quote here the
          excellent comments of our esteemed friend, Mr. Walter Scott, upon this
          verse-"God works unseen, but not the less truly, in all the political
          changes of the day. The astute statesman, the clever diplomatist, is
          simply an agent in the Lord's hands. He knows it not. Self-will and
          motives of policy may influence to action, but God is steadily working
          toward an end-to exhibit the heavenly and earthly glories of His Son.
          Thus, instead of kings and statesmen thwarting God's purpose, they
          unconsciously forward it. God is not indifferent, but is behind the
          scenes of human action. The doings of the future ten kings in relation
          to Babylon and the Beast-the ecclesiastical and secular powers-are not
          only under the direct control of God, but all is done in fulfillment
          of His words."
        </p>
        <p>
          Closely connected with Revelation 17:17 is that which is brought
          before us in Micah 4:11, 12: "Now also many nations are gathered
          against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon
          Zion. But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand
          they His counsel: for He shall gather them as sheaves into the floor."
          This is another remarkable statement, inspired of God, and three
          things in it deserve special notice. First, a day is coming when "many
          nations" shall "gather against" Israel with the express purpose of
          humiliating her. Second, quite unconsciously to themselves-for they
          "understand not" His counsel-they are "gathered" together by God, for
          "He shall gather them." Third, God gathers these "many nations"
          against Israel in order that the daughter of Zion may "beat them in
          pieces" (v. 13). Here then is another instance which demonstrates
          God's absolute control of the nations, of His power to fulfill His
          secret counsel or decrees through and by them, and of His inclining
          men to perform His pleasure though it be performed blindly and
          unwittingly by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more. What a word was that of the Lord Jesus as He stood before
          Pilate! Who can depict the scene! There was the Roman official, and
          there also was the Servant of Jehovah standing before him. Said
          Pilate, "Whence art Thou?" And we read "Jesus gave him no answer."
          Then said Pilate unto Him "Speakest Thou not unto me? Knowest Thou not
          that I have power to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee?"
          (John 19:10). Ah! that is what Pilate thought. That is what many
          another has thought. He was merely voicing the common conviction of
          the human heart, the heart which leaves God out of its reckoning. But
          hear the Lord Jesus as He corrects Pilate, and at the same time
          repudiates the proud boasting of men in general: "thou couldest have
          no power against Me, except it were given thee from above" (John
          19:11). How sweeping is this assertion! Man-even though he be a
          prominent official in the most influential empire of his day-has no
          power except that which is given him from above, no power, even, to do
          that which is evil, i.e., carry out his own evil designs unless God
          empowers him so that His purpose may be forwarded. It was God who gave
          Pilate the power to sentence to death His well-beloved Son! And how
          this rebukes the sophistries and reasonings of men who argue that God
          does nothing more than permit evil! Why, go right back to the very
          first words spoken by the Lord God to man after the Fall and hear Him
          saying "I will put ENMITY between thee and the woman, and between thy
          seed and her seed" (Gen. 3:15)! Bare permission of sin does not cover
          all the facts which are revealed in Scripture touching this mystery.
          As Calvin succinctly remarked "But what reason shall we assign for His
          permitting it but because it is His will?"
        </p>
        <p>
          At the close of Chapter Eleven we promised to give attention to one or
          two other difficulties which were not examined at that time. To them
          we now turn. If God has not only predetermined the salvation of His
          own but has also foreordained the good works which they are to walk in
          (Eph. 2:10), then what incentive remains for us to strive after
          practical godliness? If God has fixed the number of those who are to
          be saved, and the others are vessels of wrath fitted to destruction,
          then what encouragement have we to preach the Gospel to the lost? Let
          us take up these questions in the order of mention.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY AND THE BELIEVER'S GROWTH IN GRACE.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If God has foreordained everything that comes to pass, of what avail
          is it for us to "exercise" ourselves "unto godliness" (1 Tim. 4:7)? If
          God has before ordained the good works in which we are to walk (Eph.
          2:10) then why should we be "careful to maintain good works" (Titus
          3:8)? This only raises once more the problem of human responsibility.
          Really, it should be enough for us to reply, God has bidden us do so.
          Nowhere does Scripture inculcate or encourage a spirit of fatalistic
          indifference. Contentment with our present attainments is expressly
          disallowed. The word to every believer is "Press toward the mark for
          the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:14).
          This was the Apostle's aim, and it should be ours. Instead of
          hindering the development of Christian character, a proper
          apprehension and appreciation of God's Sovereignty will forward it.
          Just as the sinner's despair of any help from himself is the first
          prerequisite of a sound conversion, so the loss of all confidence in
          himself is the first essential in the believer's growth in grace; and
          just as the sinner despairing of help from himself will cast him into
          the arms of Sovereign mercy so the Christian, conscious of his own
          frailty, will turn unto the Lord for power. It is when we are weak we
          are strong (2 Cor. 12:10): that is to say, there must be consciousness
          of our weakness before we shall turn to the Lord for help. While the
          Christian allows the thought that he is sufficient in himself, while
          he imagines that by mere force of will he shall resist temptation,
          while he has any confidence in the flesh then, like Peter who boasted
          that though all forsook the Lord yet should not he, so we shall
          certainly fail and fall. Apart from Christ we can do nothing (John
          15:5). The promise of God is "He giveth power to the faint; and to
          them that have no might (of their own) He increaseth strength" (Isa.
          40:29).
        </p>
        <p>
          The question now before us is of great practical importance, and we
          are deeply anxious to express ourselves clearly and simply. The secret
          of development of Christian character is the realization of our own
          powerlessness, acknowledged powerlessness, and the consequent turning
          unto the Lord for help. The plain fact is that of ourselves we cannot
          do this, or make ourselves do it. "In nothing be anxious"-but who can
          avoid and prevent anxiety when things go wrong? "Awake to
          righteousness and sin not"-but who can help sinning? These are merely
          examples selected at random from scores of others. Does then God mock
          us by biding us do what He knows we are unable to do? The answer of
          Augustine to this question is the best we have met with-"God gives
          commands we cannot perform, that we may know what we ought to request
          from Him." A consciousness of our powerlessness should cast us upon
          Him who has all power. Here then is where a vision and view of God's
          Sovereignty helps, for it reveals His sufficiency and shows us our
          insufficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY AND CHRISTIAN SERVICE.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If God has determined before the foundation of the world the precise
          number of those who shall be saved then why should we concern
          ourselves about the eternal destiny of those with whom we come into
          contact? What place is left for zeal in Christian service? Will not
          the doctrine of God's Sovereignty, and its corollary of
          predestination, discourage the Lord's servants from faithfulness in
          evangelism? No; instead of discouraging His servants a recognition of
          God's Sovereignty is most encouraging to them. Here is one, for
          example, who is called upon to do the work of an evangelist, and he
          goes forth believing in the freedom of the will and in the sinner's
          own ability to come to Christ. He preaches the Gospel as faithfully
          and zealously as he knows how; but he finds the vast majority of his
          hearers are utterly indifferent and have no heart at all for Christ.
          He discovers that men are, for the most part, thoroughly wrapt up in
          the things of the world, and that few have any concern about the world
          to come. He beseeches men to be reconciled to God and pleads with them
          over their soul's salvation. But it is of no avail. He becomes
          thoroughly disheartened and asks himself, What is the use of it all?
          Shall he quit, or had he better change his mission and message? If men
          will not respond to the Gospel, had he not better engage in that which
          is more popular and acceptable to the world? Why not occupy himself
          with humanitarian efforts, with social uplift work, with the purity
          campaign? Alas! that so many men who once preached the Gospel are now
          engaged in these activities instead.

          What then is God's corrective for His discouraged servant? First, he
          needs to learn from Scripture that God is not now seeking to convert
          the world, but that in this Age He is "taking out of the Gentiles" a
          people for His name (Acts 15:14). What then is God's corrective for
          His discouraged servant? This: a proper apprehension of God's plan for
          this Dispensation. Again: what is God's remedy for dejection at
          apparent failure in our labors? This: the assurance that God's purpose
          cannot fail, that God's plans cannot miscarry, that God's will must be
          done. Our labors are not intended to bring about that which God has
          not decreed. Once more: what is God's word of cheer for the one who is
          thoroughly disheartened at the lack of response to his appeals and the
          absence of fruit, for his labors? This: that we are not responsible
          for results: that is God's side, and God's business. Paul may "plant,"
          and Apollos may "water," but it is God who "gave the increase" (1 Cor.
          3:6). Our business is to obey Christ and preach the Gospel to every
          creature, to emphasize the "Whosoever believeth" and then to leave the
          Sovereign operations of the Holy Spirit to apply the Word in
          quickening power to whom He wills, resting on the sure promise of
          Jehovah: "For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from Heaven, and
          returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring
          forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the
          eater: So shall My Word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall
          not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please
          (it may not be that which we please), and it shall prosper in the
          thing whereto I sent it" (Isa. 55:10, 11). Was it not this assurance
          that sustained the beloved Apostle when he declared "Therefore (see
          context) I endure all things for the elect's sake" (2 Tim. 2:10)! Yea,
          is not this same lesson to be learned from the blessed example of the
          Lord Jesus! When we read that He said to the people "Ye also have seen
          Me, and believe not," He fell back upon the Sovereign pleasure of the
          One who sent Him, saying "All that the Father giveth Me shall come to
          Me, and him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out" (John 6:37).
          He knew that His labor would not be in vain. He knew God's Word would
          not return unto Him "void." He knew that "God's elect" would come to
          Him and believe on Him. And this same assurance fills the soul of
          every servant who intelligently rests upon the blessed truth of God's
          Sovereignty.

        <p>
          Ah, fellow-Christian-worker, God has not sent us forth to "draw a bow
          at a venture." The success of the ministry which He has committed into
          our hands is not left contingent on the fickleness of the wills in
          those to whom we preach. How gloriously encouraging, how
          soul-sustaining the assurance are those words of our Lord's if we rest
          on them in simple faith: "And other sheep I have ("have" mark you, not
          "will have"; "have" because given to Him by the Father before the
          foundation of the world), which are not of this fold (i.e. the Jewish
          fold then existing): them also I must bring, and they shall hear My
          voice" (John 10:16). Not simply, "they ought to hear My voice," not
          simply "they may hear My voice," not "they will if they are willing."
          There is no "if," no uncertainty about it. "They shall hear My voice"
          is His own positive, unqualified, absolute promise. Here then is where
          faith is to rest! Continue your quest, dear friend, after the "other
          sheep" of Christ's. Be not discouraged because the "goats" heed not
          His voice as you preach the Gospel. Be faithful, be scriptural, be
          persevering, and Christ may use even you to be His mouthpiece in
          calling some of His lost sheep unto Himself. "Therefore, my beloved
          brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of
          the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the
          Lord" (1 Cor. 15:58).
        </p>
        <p>
          It now remains for us to offer a few closing reflections and our happy
          task is finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          God's Sovereign election of certain ones to salvation is a MERCIFUL
          provision. The sufficient answer to all the wicked accusations that
          the doctrine of Predestination is cruel, horrible, and unjust, is that
          unless God had chosen certain ones to salvation none would have been
          saved, for "there is none that seeketh after God" (Rom. 3:11). This is
          no mere inference of ours but the definite teaching of Holy Scripture.
          Attend closely to the words of the Apostle in Romans 9 where this
          theme is fully discussed: "Though the number of the children of Israel
          be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved... And as Esaias
          (Isaiah) said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed,
          we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrah" (Rom. 9:27,
          29). The teaching of this passage is unmistakable: but for Divine
          interference Israel would have become as Sodom and Gomorrah. Had God
          left Israel alone human depravity would have run its course to its own
          tragic end. But God left Israel a "remnant" or "seed." Of old the
          cities of the plain had been obliterated for their sin and none was
          left to survive them; and so it would have been in Israel's case had
          not God "left" or spared a remnant. Thus it is with the human race:
          but for God's Sovereign grace in sparing a remnant all of Adam's
          descendants had perished in their sins. Therefore, we say that God's
          Sovereign election of certain ones to salvation is a merciful
          provision. And, be it noted, in choosing the ones He did God did no
          injustice to the others who were passed by, for none had any right to
          salvation. Salvation is by grace, and the exercise of grace is a
          matter of pure Sovereignty-God might save all or none, many or few,
          one or ten thousand, just as He saw best. Should it be replied, But
          surely it were "best" to save all, the answer would be: We are not
          capable of judging. We might have thought it "best" never to have
          created Satan, never to have allowed sin to enter the world, or having
          entered to have brought the conflict between good and evil to an end
          long before now. Ah! God's ways are not ours, and His ways are "past
          finding out."
        </p>
        <p>
          God foreordains everything which comes to pass. His Sovereign rule
          extends throughout the entire Universe and is over every creature.
          "For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things" (Rom.
          11:36). God initiates all things, regulates all things, and all things
          are working unto His eternal glory. "There is but one God, the Father,
          of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
          whom are all things, and we by Him" (1 Cor. 8:6). And again,
          "According to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the
          counsel of His own will" (Eph. 1:11). Surely if anything could be
          ascribed to chance it is the drawing of lots, and yet the Word of God
          expressly declares "The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole
          disposing thereof is of the LORD" (Prov. 16:33)!
        </p>
        <p>
          God's wisdom in the government of our world shall yet be completely
          vindicated before all created intelligences. God is no idle Spectator,
          looking on from a distant world at the happenings, on our earth, but
          is Himself shaping everything to the ultimate promotion of His own
          glory. Even now He is working out His eternal purpose, not only in
          spite of human and Satanic opposition but by means of them. How wicked
          and futile have been all efforts to resist His will shall one day be
          as fully evident as when of old He overthrew the rebellious Pharaoh
          and his hosts at the Red Sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been well said "The end and object of all is the glory of God.
          It is perfectly, divinely true, that 'God hath ordained for His own
          glory whatsoever comes to pass.' In order to guard this from all
          possibility of mistake, we have only to remember who is this God, and
          what the glory that He seeks. It is He who is the God and Father of
          our Lord Jesus Christ-of Him in whom divine love came seeking not her
          own, among us as 'One that serveth.' It is He who, sufficient in
          Himself, can receive no real accession of glory from His creatures,
          but from whom-'Love,' as He is 'Light'-cometh down every good and
          every perfect gift, in whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning.
          Of His own alone can His creatures give to Him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The glory of such an one is found in the display of His own goodness,
          righteousness, holiness, truth; in manifesting Himself as in Christ He
          has manifested Himself and will forever. The glory of this God is what
          of necessity all things must serve-adversaries and evil as well as all
          else. He has ordained it; His power will insure it; and when all
          apparent clouds and obstructions are removed, then shall He rest-'rest
          in His love' forever, although eternity only will suffice for the
          apprehension of the revelation. 'God shall be all in all' (italics
          ours throughout this paragraph) gives in six words the ineffable
          result" (F. W. Grant on "Atonement").
        </p>
        <p>
          That what we have written gives but an incomplete and imperfect
          presentation of this most important subject we must sorrowfully
          confess. Nevertheless, if it results in a clearer apprehension of the
          majesty of God and His Sovereign mercy we shall be amply repaid for
          our labors. If the reader has received blessing from the perusal of
          these pages let him not fail to return thanks to the Giver of every
          good and every perfect gift, ascribing all praise to His inimitable
          and Sovereign grace.
