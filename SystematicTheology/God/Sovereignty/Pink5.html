        <h2>5 - The Sovereignty Of God In Reprobation</h2>
        <p>"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God" (Rom. 11:22).</p>
        <p>
          In the last chapter when treating of the Sovereignty of God the Father
          in Salvation, we examined seven passages which represent Him as making
          a choice from among the children of men, and predestinating certain
          ones to be conformed to the image of His Son. The thoughtful reader
          will naturally ask, And what of those who were not "ordained to
          eternal life?" The answer which is usually returned to this question,
          even by those who profess to believe what the Scriptures teach
          concerning God's Sovereignty, is, that God passes by the non-elect,
          leaves them alone to go their own way, and in the end casts them into
          the Lake of Fire because they refused His way, and rejected the
          Saviour of His providing. But this is only a part of the truth; the
          other part-that which is most offensive to the carnal mind-is either
          ignored or denied.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of the awful solemnity of the subject here before us, in view
          of the fact that today almost all-even those who profess to be
          Calvinists-reject and repudiate this doctrine, and in view of the fact
          that this is one of the points in our book which is likely to raise
          the most controversy, we feel that an extended inquiry into this
          aspect of God's Truth is demanded. That this branch of the subject of
          God's Sovereignty is profoundly mysterious we freely allow, yet, that
          is no reason why we should reject it. The trouble is that, nowadays,
          there are so many who receive the testimony of God only so far as they
          can satisfactorily account for all the reasons and grounds of His
          conduct, which means they will accept nothing but that which can be
          measured in the petty scales of their own limited capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stating it in its baldest form the point now to be considered is, Has
          God foreordained certain ones to damnation? That many will be
          eternally damned is clear from Scripture, that each one will be judged
          according to his works and reap as he has sown, and that in
          consequence his "damnation is just" (Rom. 3:8), is equally sure, and
          that God decreed that the non-elect should choose the course they
          follow we now undertake to prove.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what has been before us in the previous chapter concerning the
          election of some to salvation, it would unavoidably follow, even if
          Scripture had been silent upon it, that there must be a rejection of
          others. Every choice evidently and necessarily implies a refusal, for
          where there is no leaving out there can be no choice. If there be some
          whom God has elected unto salvation (2 Thess. 2:13), there must be
          others who are not elected unto salvation. If there are some that the
          Father gave to Christ (John 6:37), there must be others whom He did
          not give unto Christ. If there be some whose names are written in the
          Lamb's Book of Life (Rev. 21:27), there must be others whose names are
          not written there. That this is the case we shall fully prove below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now all will acknowledge that from the foundation of the world God
          certainly foreknew and foresaw who would and who would not receive
          Christ as their Saviour, therefore in giving being and birth to those
          He knew would reject Christ, He necessarily created them unto
          damnation. All that can be said in reply to this is, No, while God did
          foreknow these would reject Christ, yet He did not decree that they
          should. But this is a begging of the real question at issue. God had a
          definite reason why He created men, a specific purpose why He created
          this and that individual, and in view of the eternal destination of
          His creatures, He purposed either that this one should spend eternity
          in Heaven or that this one should spend eternity in the Lake of Fire.
          If then He foresaw that in creating a certain person that that person
          would despise and reject the Saviour, yet knowing this beforehand He,
          nevertheless, brought that person into existence, then it is clear He
          designed and ordained that that person should be eternally lost.
          Again; faith is God's gift, and the purpose to give it only to some,
          involves the purpose not to give it to others. Without faith there is
          no salvation--"He that believeth not shall be damned"-hence if there
          were some of Adam's descendants to whom He purposed not to give faith,
          it must be because He ordained that they should be damned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only is there no escape from these conclusions, but history
          confirms them. Before the Divine Incarnation, for almost two thousand
          years, the vast majority of mankind were left destitute of even the
          external means of grace, being favored with no preaching of God's Word
          and with no written revelation of His will. For many long centuries
          Israel was the only nation to whom the Deity vouchsafed any special
          discovery of Himself- "Who in times past suffered all nations to walk
          in their own ways" (Acts 14:16)--"You only (Israel) have I known of
          all the families of the earth" (Amos 3:2). Consequently, as all other
          nations were deprived o f the preaching of God's Word, they were
          strangers to the faith that cometh thereby (Rom. 10:17). These nations
          were not only ignorant of God Himself, but of the way to please Him,
          of the true manner of acceptance with Him, and the means of arriving
          at the everlasting enjoyment of Himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if God had willed their salvation, would He not have vouchsafed
          them the means of salvation? Would He not have given them all things
          necessary to that end? But it is an undeniable matter of fact that He
          did not. If, then, Deity can, consistently, with His justice, mercy,
          and benevolence, deny to some the means of grace, and shut them up in
          gross darkness and unbelief (because of the sins of their forefathers,
          generations before), why should it be deemed incompatible with His
          perfections to exclude some persons, many, from grace itself, and from
          that eternal life which is connected with it? seeing that He is Lord
          and Sovereign Disposer both of the end to which the means lead, and
          the means which lead to that end?
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming down to our own day, and to those in our own country-leaving
          out the almost unnumerable crowds of unevangelized heathen-is it not
          evident that there are many living in lands where the Gospel is
          preached, lands which are full of churches, who die strangers to God
          and His holiness? True, the means of grace were close to their hand,
          but many of them knew it not. Thousands are born into homes where they
          are taught from infancy to regard all Christians as hypocrites and
          preachers as arch-humbugs. Others, are instructed from the cradle in
          Roman Catholicism, and are trained to regard Evangelical Christianity
          as deadly heresy, and the Bible as a book highly dangerous for them to
          read. Others, reared in "Christian Science" families, know no more of
          the true Gospel of Christ than do the unevangelized heathen. The great
          majority of these die in utter ignorance of the Way of Peace. Now are
          we not obliged to conclude that it was not God's will to communicate
          grace to them? Had His will been otherwise, would He not have actually
          communicated His grace to them? If, then, it was the will of God, in
          time, to refuse to them his grace, it must have been His will from all
          eternity, since His will is, as Himself, the same yesterday, and today
          and forever. Let it not be forgotten that God's providences are but
          the manifestations of His decrees: what God does in time is only what
          He purposed in eternity-His own will being the alone cause of all His
          acts and works. Therefore from His actually leaving some men in final
          impenitency and unbelief we assuredly gather it was His everlasting
          determination so to do; and consequently that He reprobated some from
          before the foundation of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Westminster Confession it is said, "God from all eternity did
          by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will, freely and
          unchangeably foreordain whatsoever comes to pass." The late Mr. F. W.
          Grant-a most careful and cautious student and writercommenting on
          these words said: "It is perfectly, divinely true, that God hath
          ordained for His own glory whatsoever comes to pass." Now if these
          statements are true, is not the doctrine of Reprobation established by
          them? What, in human history, is the one thing which does come to pass
          every day? What, but that men and women die, pass out of this world
          into a hopeless eternity, an eternity of suffering and woe. If then
          God has foreordained whatsoever comes to pass then He must have
          decreed that vast numbers of human beings should pass out of this
          world unsaved to suffer eternally in the Lake of Fire. Admitting the
          general premise, is not the specific conclusion inevitable?
        </p>
        <p>
          In reply to the preceding paragraphs the reader may say, All this is
          simply reasoning, logical no doubt, but yet mere inferences. Very
          well, we will now point out that in addition to the above conclusions
          there are many passages in Holy Writ which are most clear and definite
          in their teaching on this solemn subject; passages which are too plain
          to be misunderstood and too strong to be evaded. The marvel is that so
          many good men have denied their undeniable affirmations.
        </p>

          "Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. There was not a
          city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the
          inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle. For it was of
          the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel
          in battle, that He might destroy them utterly, and that they might
          have no favor, but that He might destroy them as the LORD commanded
          Moses" (Josh. 11:18-20). What could be plainer than this? Here was a
          large number of Canaanites whose hearts the Lord hardened, whom He had
          purposed to utterly destroy, to whom He showed "no favor." Granted
          that they were wicked, immoral, idolatrous; were they any worse than
          the immoral, idolatrous cannibals of the South Sea Islands (and many
          other places), to whom God gave the Gospel through John G. Paton!
          Assuredly not. Then why did not Jehovah command Israel to teach the
          Canaanites His laws and instruct them concerning sacrifices to the
          true God? Plainly, because He had marked them out for destruction, and
          if so, that from all eternity.
