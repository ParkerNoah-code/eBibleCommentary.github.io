        <h2>4 - The Sovereignty Of God In Salvation</h2>
        <p>
          "O the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
          how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out"
          (Rom. 11:33).
        </p>
        <p>
          "Salvation is of the LORD" (Jonah 2:9); but the Lord does not save
          all. Why not? He does save some; then if He saves some, why not
          others? Is it because they are too sinful and depraved? No; for the
          Apostle wrote, "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
          acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of
          whom I am chief" (1 Tim. 1:15). Therefore, if God saved the "chief" of
          sinners, none are excluded because of their depravity. Why then does
          not God save all? Is it because some are too stonyhearted to be won?
          No; because it is written, that God will "take the stony heart out of
          their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh" (Ezek. 11:19). Then
          is it because some are so stubborn, so intractable, so defiant that
          God is unable to woo them to Himself? Before we answer this question
          let us ask another; let us appeal to the experience of the Christian
          reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friend, was there not a time when you walked in the counsel of the
          ungodly, stood in the way of sinners, sat in the seat of the scorners,
          and with them said, "We will not have this Man to reign over us" (Luke
          19:14)? Was there not a time when you "would not come to Christ that
          you might have life" (John 5:40)? Yea, was there not a time when you
          mingled your voice with those who said unto God, "Depart from us; for
          we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways. What is the Almighty, that we
          should serve Him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto
          Him?" (Job 21:14, 15)? With shamed face you have to acknowledge there
          was. But how is it that all is now changed? What was it that brought
          you from haughty self-sufficiency to a humble suppliant; from one that
          was at enmity with God to one that is at peace with Him; from
          lawlessness to subjection; from hate to love? And as one 'born of the
          Spirit' you will readily reply, "By the grace of God I am what I am"
          (1 Cor. 15:10). Then do you not see that it is due to no lack of power
          in God, nor to His refusal to coerce man, that other rebels are not
          saved too? If God was able to subdue your will and win your heart, and
          that without interfering with your moral responsibility, then is He
          not able to do the same for others? Assuredly He is. Then how
          inconsistent, how illogical, how foolish of you, in seeking to account
          for the present course of the wicked and their ultimate fate, to argue
          that God is unable to save them, that they will not let Him. Do you
          say, "But the time came when I was willing, willing to receive Christ
          as my Saviour"? True, but it was the Lord who made you willing (Psa.
          110:3; Phil. 2:13); why then does He not make all sinners willing?
          Why, but for the fact that He is Sovereign and does as He pleases! But
          to return to our opening inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is it that all are not saved, particularly all who hear the
          Gospel? Do you still answer, Because the majority refuse to believe?
          Well, that is true, but it is only a part of the truth. It is the
          truth from the human side. But there is a Divine side too, and this
          side of the truth needs to be stressed or God will be robbed of His
          glory. The unsaved are lost because they refuse to believe; the others
          are saved because they believe. But why do these others believe? What
          is it that causes them to put their trust in Christ? Is it because
          they are more intelligent than their fellows, and quicker to discern
          their need of salvation? Perish the thought-"Who maketh thee to dif er
          from another? And what hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now if
          thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not
          received it?" (1 Cor. 4:7). It is God Himself who maketh the
          difference between the elect and the non-elect, for of His own it is
          written, "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us
          an understanding, that we may know Him that is true" (1 John 5:20).
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith is God's gift, and "all men have not faith" (2 Thess. 3:2);
          therefore, we see that God does not bestow this gift upon all. Upon
          whom then does He bestow this saving favor? And we answer, upon His
          own elect-"As many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts
          13:48). Hence it is that we read of "the faith of God's elect" (Titus
          1:1). But is God partial in the distribution of His favors? Has He not
          the right to be? Are there still some who murmur against the Goodman
          of the house'? Then His own words are sufficient reply-"Is it not
          lawful for Me to do what I will with Mine own?" (Matt. 20:15). God is
          Sovereign in the bestowment of His gifts, both in the natural and in
          the spiritual realms. So much then for a general statement, and now to
          particularize.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD THE FATHER IN SALVATION.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the one Scripture which most emphatically of all asserts the
          absolute Sovereignty of God in connection with His determining the
          destiny of His creatures, is the Ninth of Romans. We shall not attempt
          to review here the entire chapter, but will confine ourselves to
          verses 21-23- "Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same
          lump, to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? What
          if God, willing to show His wrath, and to make His power known,
          endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to
          destruction: And that He might make known the riches of His glory on
          the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory?" These
          verses represent fallen mankind as inert and as impotent as a lump of
          lifeless clay. This Scripture evidences that there is "no difference,"
          in themselves, between the elect and the non-elect; they are clay of
          "the same lump," which agrees with Ephesians 2:3, where we are told
          that all are by nature "children of wrath." It teaches us that the
          ultimate destiny of every individual is decided by the will of God,
          and blessed it is that such be the case; if it were left to our wills,
          the ultimate destination of us all would be the Lake of Fire. It
          declares that God Himself does make a difference in the respective
          destinations to which He assigns His creatures, for one vessel is made
          "unto honor and another unto dishonor"; some are "vessels of wrath
          fitted to destruction," others are "vessels of mercy, which He had
          afore prepared unto glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          We readily acknowledge that it is very humbling to the proud heart of
          the creature to behold all mankind in the hand of God as the clay in
          the potter's hand, yet this is precisely how the Scriptures of Truth
          represent the case. In this day of human boasting, intellectual pride,
          and deification of man, it needs to be insisted upon that the potter
          forms his vessels for himself. Let man strive with his Maker as he
          will, the fact remains that he is nothing more than clay in the
          Heavenly Potter's hands, and while we know that God will deal justly
          with His creatures, that the Judge of all the earth will do right,
          nevertheless, He shapes His vessels for His own purpose and according
          to His own pleasure. God claims the indisputable right to do as He
          wills with His own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only has God the right to do as He wills with the creatures of His
          own hands, but He exercises this right, and nowhere is that seen more
          plainly than in His predestinating grace. Before the foundation of the
          world God made a choice, a selection, an election. Before His
          omniscient eye stood the whole of Adam's race, and from it He singled
          out a people and predestinated them "to be conformed to the image of
          His Son," "ordained" them unto eternal life. Many are the Scriptures
          which set forth this blessed truth, seven of which will now engage our
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed" (Acts 13:48).
          Every artifice of human ingenuity has been employed to blunt the sharp
          edge of this Scripture and to explain away the obvious meaning of
          these words, but it has been employed in vain, though nothing will
          ever be able to reconcile this and similar passages to the mind of the
          natural man. "As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed."
          Here we learn four things: First, that believing is the consequence
          and not the cause of God's decree. Second, that a limited number only
          are "ordained to eternal life," for if all men without exception were
          thus ordained by God, then the words "as many as" are a meaningless
          qualification. Third, that this "ordination" of God is not to mere
          external privileges but to "eternal life," not to service but to
          salvation itself. Fourth, that all-"as many as," not one less-who are
          thus ordained by God to eternal life will most certainly believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comments of the beloved Spurgeon on the above passage are well
          worthy of our notice. Said he, "Attempts have been made to prove that
          these words do not teach predestination, but these attempts so clearly
          do violence to language that I shall not waste time in answering them.
          I read: 'As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,' and I
          shall not twist the text but shall glorify the grace of God by
          ascribing to that grace the faith of every man. Is it not God who
          gives the disposition to believe? If men are disposed to have eternal
          life, does not He-in every case-dispose them? Is it wrong for God to
          give grace? If it be right for Him to give it, is it wrong for Him to
          purpose to give it? Would you have Him give it by accident? If it is
          right for Him to purpose to give grace today, it was right for Him to
          purpose it before today-and, since He changes not-from eternity."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according
          to the election of grace. And if by grace, then it is no more of
          works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then
          is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work" (Rom. 11:5, 6).
          The words "Even so" at the beginning of this quotation refer us to the
          previous verse where we are told, "I have reserved to Myself seven
          thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal." Note particularly
          the word "reserved." In the days of Elijah there were seven thousand-a
          small minority-who were Divinely preserved from idolatry and brought
          to the knowledge of the true God. This preservation and illumination
          was not from anything in themselves, but solely by God's special
          influence and agency. How highly favored such individuals were to be
          thus "reserved" by God! Now says the Apostle, Just as there was a
          "remnant" in Elijah's days "reserved by God," even so there is in this
          present dispensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A remnant according to the election of grace." Here the cause of
          election is traced back to its source. The basis upon which God
          elected this "remnant" was not faith foreseen in them, because a
          choice founded upon the foresight of good works is just as truly made
          on the ground of works as any choice can be, and in such a case it
          would not be "of grace"; for, says the Apostle, "if by grace, then it
          is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace"; which means
          that grace and works are opposites, they have nothing in common, and
          will no more mingle than oil and water. Thus the idea of inherent good
          foreseen in those chosen, or of anything meritorious performed by
          them, is rigidly excluded. "A remnant according to the election of
          grace" signifies an unconditional choice resulting from the Sovereign
          favor of God; in a word, it is absolutely a gratuitous election.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after
          the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: But God hath
          chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God
          hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which
          are mighty: and base things of the world, and things which are
          despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to
          nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in His presence" (1
          Cor. 1:26-29). Three times over in this passage reference is made to
          God's choice, and choice necessarily supposes a selection, the taking
          of some and the leaving of others. The Chooser here is God Himself, as
          said the Lord Jesus to the Apostles, "Ye have not chosen Me, but I
          have chosen you" (John 15:16). The number chosen is strictly
          defined-"not many wise men after the flesh, not many noble," etc.,
          which agree with Matthew 20:16, "So the last shall be first, and the
          first last; for many be called, but few chosen." So much then for the
          fact of God's choice; now mark the objects of His choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ones spoken of above as chosen of God are "the weak things of the
          world, base things of the world, and things which are despised." But
          why? To demonstrate and magnify His grace. God's ways as well as His
          thoughts are utterly at variance with man's. The carnal mind would
          have supposed that a selection had been made from the ranks of the
          opulent and influential, the amiable and cultured, so that
          Christianity might have won the approval and applause of the world by
          its pageantry and fleshly glory. Ah, but "that which is highly
          esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God" (Luke 16:15).
          God chooses the "base things." He did so in Old Testament times. The
          nation which He singled out to be the depository of His holy oracles
          and the channel through which the promised Seed should come was not
          the ancient Egyptians, the imposing Babylonians, nor the highly
          civilized and cultured Greeks. No; that people upon whom Jehovah set
          His love and regarded as 'the apple of His eye' were the despised,
          nomadic Hebrews. So it was when our Lord tabernacled among men. The
          ones whom He took into favored intimacy with Himself and commissioned
          to go forth as His ambassadors were, for the most part, unlettered
          fishermen. And so it has been ever since. So it is today: at the
          present rates of increase, it will not be long before it is manifested
          that the Lord has more in despised China who are really His, than He
          has in the highly favored U.S.A.; more among the uncivilized blacks of
          Africa, than He has in cultured (?) Germany! And the purpose of God's
          choice, the raison d' etre of the selection He has made is, "that no
          flesh should glory in His presence"-there being nothing whatever in
          the objects of His choice which should entitle them to His special
          favors, then, all the praise will be freely ascribed to the exceeding
          riches of His manifold grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
          blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:
          According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the
          world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him; having
          predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
          Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will... In whom also we
          have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the
          purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His own
          will" (Eph. 1:3-5, 11). Here again we are told at what point in
          time-if time it could be called-when God made choice of those who were
          to be His children by Jesus Christ. It was not after Adam had fallen
          and plunged his race into sin and wretchedness, but long ere Adam saw
          the light, even before the world itself was founded, that God chose us
          in Christ. Here also we learn the purpose which God had before Him in
          connection with His own elect: it was that they "should be holy and
          without blame before Him"; it was "unto the adoption of children"; it
          was that they should "obtain an inheritance." Here also we discover
          the motive which prompted Him. It was "in love that He predestinated
          us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself"-a
          statement which refutes the oft made and wicked charge that, for God
          to decide the eternal destiny of His creatures before they are born,
          is tyrannical and unjust. Finally, we are informed here, that in this
          matter He took counsel with none, but that we are "predestinated
          according to the good pleasure of His will."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
          beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
          salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
          truth" (2 Thess. 2:13). There are three things here which deserve
          special attention. First, the fact that we are expressly told that
          God's elect are "chosen to salvation." Language could not be more
          explicit. How summarily do these words dispose of the sophistries and
          equivocations of all who would make election refer to nothing but
          external privileges or rank in service! It is to "salvation" itself
          that God hath chosen us. Second, we are warned here that election unto
          salvation does not disregard the use of appropriate means: salvation
          is reached through "sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
          truth." It is not true that because God has chosen a certain one to
          salvation that he will be saved willy-nilly, whether he believes or
          not: nowhere do the Scriptures so represent it. The same God who
          predestined the end also appointed the means; the same God who "chose
          unto salvation" decreed that His purpose should be realized through
          the work of the Spirit and belief of the truth. Third, that God has
          chosen us unto salvation is a profound cause for fervent praise. Note
          how strongly the Apostle expresses this-"we are bound to give thanks
          always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath
          from the beginning chosen you to salvation," etc. Instead of shrinking
          hack in horror from the doctrine of predestination, the believer, when
          he sees this blessed truth as it is unfolded in the Word, discovers a
          ground for gratitude
