        <h2>2 - The Sovereignty Of God In Creation</h2>
        <p>
          "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power: for
          Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were
          created" (Rev. 4:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          Having shown that Sovereignty characterizes the whole Being of God,
          let us now observe how it marks all His ways and dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the great expanse of eternity which stretches behind Genesis 1:1,
          the universe was unborn and creation existed only in the mind of the
          great Creator. In His Sovereign majesty God dwelt all alone. We refer
          to that far distant period before the heavens and the earth were
          created. There were then no angels to hymn God's praises, no creatures
          to occupy His notice, no rebels to be brought into subjection. The
          great God was all alone amid the awful Silence of His own vast
          universe. But even at that time, if time it could be called, God was
          Sovereign. He might create or not create according to His own good
          pleasure. He might create this way or that way; He might create one
          world or one million worlds, and who was there to resist His will? He
          might call into existence a million different creatures and place them
          on absolute equality, endowing them with the same faculties and
          placing them in the same environment; or, He might create a million
          creatures each differing from the others, and possessing nothing in
          common save their creaturehood, and who was there to challenge His
          right? If He so pleased, He might call into existence a world so
          immense that its dimensions were utterly beyond finite computation;
          and were He so disposed, He might create an organism so small that
          nothing but the most powerful microscope could reveal its existence to
          human eyes. It was His Sovereign right to create, on the one hand, the
          exalted seraphim to burn around His throne, and on the other hand, the
          tiny insect which dies the same hour that it is born. If the mighty
          God chose to have one vast gradation in His universe, from loftiest
          seraph to creeping reptile, from revolving worlds to floating atoms,
          from macrocosm to microcosm, instead of making everything uniform, who
          was there to question His Sovereign pleasure?
        </p>
        <p>
          Behold then the exercise of Divine Sovereignty long before man ever
          saw the light. With whom took God counsel in the creation and
          disposition of His creatures? See the birds as they fly through the
          air, the beasts as they roam the earth, the fishes as they swim in the
          sea, and then ask, Who was it that made them to differ? Was it not
          their Creator who Sovereignly assigned their various locations and
          adaptations to them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Turn your eye to the heavens and observe the mysteries of Divine
          Sovereignty which there confront the thoughtful beholder: "There is
          one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory
          of the stars: for one star dif ereth from another star in glory" (1
          Cor. 15:41). But why should they? Why should the sun be more glorious
          than all the other planets? Why should there be stars of the first
          magnitude and others of the tenth? Why such amazing inequalities? Why
          should some of the heavenly bodies be more favorably placed than
          others in their relation to the sun? And why should there be "shooting
          stars," falling stars, "wandering stars" (Jude 13), in a word, ruined
          stars? And the only possible answer is, "For Thy pleasure they are and
          were created" (Rev. 4:11).
        </p>
        <p>
          Come now to our own planet. Why should two thirds of its surface be
          covered with water, and why should so much of its remaining third be
          unfit for human cultivation or habitation? Why should there be vast
          stretches of marshes, deserts and ice-fields? Why should one country
          be so inferior, topographically, from another? Why should one be
          fertile, and another almost barren? Why should one be rich in minerals
          and another own none? Why should the climate of one be congenial and
          healthy, and another uncongenial and unhealthy? Why should one abound
          in rivers and lakes, and another be almost devoid of them? Why should
          one be constantly troubled with earthquakes, and another be almost
          entirely free from then? Why? Because thus it pleased the Creator and
          Upholder of all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the animal kingdom and note the wondrous variety. What
          comparison is possible between the lion and the lamb, the bear and the
          kid, the elephant and the mouse? Some, like the horse and the dog, are
          gifted with great intelligence; while others, like sheep and swine,
          are almost devoid of it. Why? Some are designed to be beasts of
          burden, while others enjoy a life of freedom. But why should the mule
          and the donkey be shackled to a life of drudgery while the lion and
          tiger are allowed to roam the jungle at their pleasure? Some are fit
          for food, others unfit; some are beautiful, others ugly; some are
          endowed with great strength, others are quite helpless; some are fleet
          of foot, others can scarcely crawl-contrast the hare and the tortoise;
          some are of use to man, others appear to be quite valueless; some live
          for centuries, others a few months at most; some are tame, others
          fierce. But why all these variations and differences? What is true of
          the animals is equally true of the birds and fishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But consider now the vegetable kingdom. Why should roses have thorns,
          and lilies grow without them? Why should one flower emit a fragrant
          aroma and another have none? Why should one tree bear fruit which is
          wholesome and another that which is poisonous? Why should one
          vegetable be capable of enduring frost and another wither under it?
          Why should one apple tree be loaded with fruit, and another tree of
          the same age and in the same orchard be almost barren? Why should one
          plant flower a dozen times in a year and another bear blossoms but
          once a century? Truly, "whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did He in
          Heaven, and in the earth, in the seas, and all deep places" (Psa.
          135:6).
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the angelic hosts. Surely we shall find uniformity here. But
          no; there, as elsewhere, the same Sovereign pleasure of the Creator is
          displayed. Some are higher in rank than others; some are more powerful
          than others; some are nearer to God than others. Scripture reveals a
          definite and well-defined gradation in the angelic orders. From
          arch-angel, past seraphim and cherubim, we come to "principalities and
          powers" (Eph. 3:10), and from principalities and powers to "rulers"
          (Eph. 6:12), and then to the angels themselves, and even among them we
          read of "the elect angels" (1 Tim. 5:21). Again we ask, Why this
          inequality, this difference in rank and order? And all we can say is
          "Our God is in the heavens, He hath done whatsoever He hath pleased"
          (Psa. 115:3).
        </p>
        <p>
          If then we see the Sovereignty of God displayed throughout all
          creation, why should it be thought a strange thing if we behold it
          operating in the midst of the human family? Why should it be thought
          strange if to one God is pleased to give five talents and to another
          only one? Why should it be thought strange if one is born with a
          robust constitution and another of the same parents is frail and
          sickly? Why should it be thought strange if Abel is cut off in his
          prime, while Cain is suffered to live on for many years? Why should it
          be thought strange that some should be born black and others white;
          some be born idiots and others with high intellectual endowments; some
          be born constitutionally lethargic and others full of energy; some be
          born with a temperament that is selfish, fiery, egotistical, others
          who are naturally self-sacrificing, submissive and meek? Why should it
          be thought strange if some are qualified by nature to lead and rule,
          while others are only fitted to follow and serve? Heredity and
          environment cannot account for all these variations and inequalities.
          No; it is God who maketh one to differ from another. Why should He?
          "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight" must be our
          reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learn then this basic truth, that the Creator is absolute Sovereign,
          executing His own will, performing His own pleasure, and considering
          nought but His own glory. "The LORD hath made all things FOR HIMSELF"
          (Prov. 16:4). And had He not a perfect right to? Since God is God, who
          dare challenge His prerogative? To murmur against Him is rank
          rebellion. To question His ways is to impugn His wisdom. To criticize
          Him is sin of the deepest dye. Have we forgotten who He is? Behold,
          "All nations before Him as are nothing; and they are counted to Him
          less than nothing, and vanity. To whom then will ye liken God?" (Isa.
          40:17, 18).
