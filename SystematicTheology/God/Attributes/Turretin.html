          FIFTH QUESTION Can the divine attributes be really distinguished from
          the divine essence? We deny against the Socinians What are the divine
          attributes? I. To understand the question certain things must be
          premised concerning the divine attributes. The divine attributes are
          the essential properties by which he makes himself known to us who are
          weak and those by which he is distinguished from creatures; or they
          are those which are attributed to him according to the measure of our
          conception in order to explain his nature. II. Attributes are not
          ascribed to God properly as something superadded (epousiddes) to his
          essence (something accidental to the subject), making it perfect and
          really distinct from himself; but improperly and transumptively
          inasmuch as they indicate perfections essential to the divine nature
          conceived by us as properties. III. Although the several attributes
          represent the most fertile and simple nature of God, yet they can
          represent it only inadequately (i.e., not according to its total
          relation, but now under this perfection, then under another). For what
          we cannot take in by one adequate conception as being finite, we
          divide into various inadequate conceptions so as to obtain some
          knowledge of him (which is not a proof of error in the intellect, but
          only of imperfection). Thus omnipotence is the divine essence itself
          apprehended as free from every obstacle in acting; eternity is the
          essence of God as without limit in duration; and so of the rest. IV.
          These inadequate conceptions of the essence of God are presented to us
          by a precisive abstraction (abstractionem praecisivam) or by a simple
          and negative precision (as I may think of goodness by not thinking of
          power); but not by an exclusive or privative precision (as, for
          example, I may assert him to be omnipotent who is neither merciful nor
          just). Statement of the question. V. The question concerning the
          divine attributes as distinct from the divine essence is agitated with
          us by the Socinians (who, the more easily to prove that the Holy
          Spirit is not God or a divine person—although he may be called a
          virtue of God—maintain that the attributes of God are really distinct
          from his essence). The orthodox teach that they are really the same
          with his essence, but are to be distinguished from it virtually and
          eminently. VI. Those things are said to differ really which are
          distinguished as things diverse according to essence, whether they
          agree with the subject or not. But to be distinguished virtually is
          nothing else than either by virtue to contain distinct effects, or to
          have unitedly in themselves what are distinct in others, or to have an
          eminent virtue which can be the principal of diverse actions. Its
          foundation cannot be intrinsic, but extrinsic; not on the part of the
          principal or subject, but in relation to the end and object; on
          account of the diversity of operations and effects arising out of the
          properties and according to which diverse formal conceptions of them
          are formed. VII. The attributes of God cannot really differ from his
          essence or from one another (as one thing from another) because God is
          most simple and perfect. Now a real distinction presupposes things
          diverse in essence which the highest simplicity rejects. Things really
          diverse can become one only by aggregation (which is opposed to
          absolute perfection). Again, if they differed really, the essence
          would be made perfect by something really distinct from itself and so
          could not be in itself most perfect. Third, it would follow that God
          is not therefore immutable because he would have in himself passive
          potency (the root of mutability) by which the attributes might either
          be elicited from the essence or added to it. But since God is the
          first and independent being (which is whatever can be) nothing can be
          added to or taken away from him. VIII. Yet that the attributes of God
          differ both from his essence and mutually from one another is evident
          from the diversity of conceptions. For where there is ground for
          founding distinct formal conceptions of anything (although one and
          simple in itself considered), there we must necessarily grant virtual
          and eminent distinction. Since therefore in the most simple divine
          essence there is ground for forming diverse formal conceptions
          concerning the divine perfections (which is evident from their
          distinct definition and explanation), it is best to say that these
          attributes giving rise to such conceptions are virtually to be
          distinguished both from the essence and from each other. IX. Although
          the attributes are essentially and intrinsically one in God, yet they
          may properly be said to be distinguished both intellectually
          (noématikos) as to the diverse formal conception and objectively and
          effectively as to the various external objects and effects. Hence it
          is evident that this distinction is neither simply real between things
          and things, nor formal (which is only in our manner of conception),
          but eminent (which although it does not hold itself on the part of the
          thing as between thing and thing, yet has a foundation in the thing on
          account of the diversity of objects and effects). Sources of
          explanation. X. Although our formal conceptions of the essence and
          properties of God may be diverse, yet they cannot be called false. For
          there answer to them as many objective conceptions, actually
          indivisible indeed in God on account of his most perfect simplicity,
          but yet virtually and eminently distinct. XI. Attributes may be
          mutually predicated of each other in an identical sense inasmuch as
          they may be considered as having unity and identity with each other
          (as when I say the divine intellect is the same thing with his will,
          or his justice is the same thing with his mercy). However this is not
          the case in the formal sense because they are formally distinguished
          in our conceptions and by their objects (so I cannot say justice is
          mercy because the formal conception of justice differs from the formal
          conception of mercy). XII. He who conceives what is actually and
          really one and simple in God as actually and really diverse, conceives
          what is false. But he who conceives that which is actually one in
          itself as more than one virtually and extrinsically or objectively,
          does not conceive what is false. Rather he conceives the thing
          imperfectly and inadequately on account of the weakness of the human
          intellect and the eminence and perfection of the divine nature. XIII.
          The divine attributes may be regarded either absolutely and
          subjectively in themselves (and on the part of God) or relatively as
          to their effects towards creatures (or on the part of the object). I
          confess that in the latter way punitive justice and sparing mercy are
          opposed, but not in the former (concerning which we treat). XIV. The
          properties are many on the part of the object and end (or of the
          operations and effects), but not on the part of the subject or
          principle, which is one and perfectly simple. XV. Where there is
          priority and posteriority as to absolute and real being, there is a
          real difference; but not where there is only priority and posteriority
          as to known and intelligible being (which is the case in God and his
          attributes). XVI. The definition of a thing in itself differs from our
          conceptions of that thing. The former, not the latter, argues a real
          distinction. Now the definitions of the divine properties are rather
          of our conceptions (conceiving God under this or that relation) than
          of the thing itself (which is one and most simple).

          SIXTH QUESTION Is the distinction of attributes into communicable and
          incommunicable a good one? We affirm I. Among the various distinctions
          of the divine attributes, none occurs more frequently than that by
          which they are distributed into communicable and incommunicable.
          Concerning this a few things must be spoken because it is not equally
          received by all. Communicable and incommunicable attributes. II. In
          order to understand the distinction, note that communication is
          twofold: one essential and formal (through the intrinsic being of a
          thing); the other by resemblance and analogy (with respect to the
          effects and works). As to the former, we say all the properties of God
          are equally incommunicable, no more capable of being communicated than
          the divine essence. Otherwise they would cease to be properties. But
          the latter we confess can be granted since God produces in creatures
          (especially in rational creatures) effects analogous to his own
          properties, such as goodness, justice, wisdom, etc. IIT. In this
          sense, those attributes can properly be called incommunicable strictly
          and in every way, which are so proper to God that nothing similar or
          analogous, or any image and trace can be found in creatures. Such are
          the negative attributes which remove from him whatever is imperfect in
          creatures (such as infinity, immensity, eternity, which are such that
          every creature is either without them or has their contraries). But
          others are not badly termed communicable (of which there is some
          appearance or certain faint vestiges in creatures) and by simple
          analogy of name and effects. Such are the affirmative attributes which
          are attributed to God by way of eminence or causality. IV. The
          communicable attributes are not predicated of God and creatures
          univocally because there is not the same relation as in things simply
          univocal agreeing in name and definition. Nor are they predicated
          equivocally because there is not a totally diverse relation, as in
          things merely equivocal agreeing only in name. They are predicated
          analogically, by analogy both of similitude and of attribution. The
          former is when things are called by the same name on account of a
          certain similarity existing between them; the latter when one name is
          so attributed to more than one thing that it may be said of one
          primarily and principally or by priority, but of the others
          secondarily and by posteriority on account of dependence on that
          first. So these attributes may be predicated of God essentially and in
          a manner plainly singular (i.e., infinitely and most perfectly) and so
          also in the abstract. In this sense, God alone is said to be good (Mt.
          19:17), ie., originally, independently, essentially; but conceming
          creatures only secondarily, accidentally and participatively. V.
          Believers are said to be partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4)
          not univocally (by a formal participation of the divine essence), but
          only analogically (by the benefit of regeneration which impresses upon
          them the marks of holiness and righteousness most properly belonging
          to God, since they are renewed after the image of their Creator, Col.
          3:10). Thus we must understand what often occurs in the fathers when
          they speak of the renewed man (theousthai) and the one made
          conformable to God (theoeidé); not essentially (which applies to the
          Son alone), but analogically. VI. The distinction of attributes into
          communicable and incommunicable argues no inequality of the divine
          properties (as if some were more proper to God than others) because
          all are equally essential to him. But this commends the goodness and
          glory of God because he willed to express in his creatures some
          resemblance and shadow (aposkiasmation) of his own perfections. VII.
          This distinction cannot favor the error of those who maintain that the
          divine properties were communicated to the human nature of Christ. As
          will be seen in the proper place, communication in the concrete, as to
          the person (which we acknowledge in Christ), differs from
          communication in the abstract, as to nature (which we deny).
          Communication may be formal and intransitive by a transfusion of the
          same properties which are in God into the human nature of Christ
          (which we reject); or it may be transitive and effective by analogy
          (which we hold can be granted in rational creatures in respect to the
          affirmative attributes).

          SEVENTH QUESTION: THE SIMPLICITY OF GOD Is God most simple and free
          from all composition? We affirm against Socinus and Vorstius I. The
          Socinians agitate this controversy with us since they deny that
          simplicity can be attributed to God according to the Scriptures and
          think it should be expunged from the number of the divine attributes
          for no other purpose than to weaken more easily the mystery of the
          Trinity by establishing the composition of the divine essence (The
          Racovian Catechism 3.1 [1818], p. 33). Vorstius retained this error
          (with various others also) and introduced it into his Tractatus
          theologicus de Deo (1610) and in the notes to “Disputatione II]: De
          Natura Dei” (cf. Tractatus theologicus de Deo [1610], pp. 19-28). With
          these the Remonstrants also agree. In their Apology, they deny that
          the simplicity of God is necessary to be believed or that anything
          occurs in Scripture relative to it, but that the whole doctrine is
          metaphysical whether you consider the word or the thing (“Apologia pro
          confessione sive declaratione ... Remonstrantes,” 2 in Episcopius,
          Operum theologicorum [1665], Pt. II, p. 129). But the orthodox have
          constantly taught that the essence of God is perfectly simple and free
          from all composition. II. Simple is used in two senses: either
          absolutely and simply; or relatively and comparatively. Absolutely is
          such as in every kind of being excludes composition; comparatively is
          such as excludes it only with respect to some. Heaven and the elements
          are called simple bodies with respect to mixed, but do not exclude
          composition from their matter and form and quantitative parts. Angels
          and souls are simple with respect to bodies, but not absolutely such
          because they always involve a composition. Here we speak of absolute
          and not of comparative simplicity. III. The simplicity of God
          considered not morally, but physically, is his incommunicable
          attribute by which the divine nature is conceived by us not only as
          free from all composition and division, but also as incapable of
          composition and divisibility. Proof that God is perfectly simple. IV.
          This is proved to be a property of God: (1) from his independence,
          because composition is of the formal reason of a being originated and
          dependent (since nothing can be composed by itself, but whatever is
          composed must necessarily be composed by another; now God is the first
          and independent being, recognizing no other prior to himself); (2)
          from his unity, because he who is absolutely one, is also absolutely
          simple and therefore can neither be divided nor composed; (3) from his
          perfection, because composition implies imperfection inasmuch as it
          supposes passive power, dependency and mutability; (4) from his
          activity, because God is a most pure act having no passive admixture
          and therefore rejecting all composition (because in God there is
          nothing which needs to be made perfect or can receive perfection from
          any other, but he is whatever can be and cannot be other than what he
          is). Whence he is usually described not only by concrete but also by
          abstract names—life, light, truth, etc. V. From the removal of all
          species of composition (such as physical—of matter and form, since he
          is incorporeal); or of quantitative parts (which do not apply to God);
          or of subject and accident (because no accident can make the most
          perfect still more perfect); logical (of kind and difference because
          God is above every genus, nor is his a common nature capable of being
          restricted by difference); metaphysical act and power (since he is a
          pure act and incapable of change properly so called, to whom nothing
          new can happen or be received by him); of essence and existence (as in
          created things in which the nature of existence differs from that of
          essence, since their essence can be conceived without existence; nor
          does existence enter into their definition because they can be and not
          be, and existence with respect to them is something contingent, not
          necessary. For in God essence cannot be conceived without existence,
          and it is repugnant to conceive of God as not existing; hence
          philosophers call him a being by essence (i.e., which exists in virtue
          of its own essence) and of the nature of whose essence it is that he
          always exists. For this reason, God calls himself Jehovah (viz., he
          who is, “I am that I am” [‘hyh ‘shr ‘hyh]) to signify that being
          belongs to him in a far different manner than to all created things,
          not participatively and contingently, but necessarily, properly and
          independently. Finally, his simplicity is proved from nature and
          subsistence; for persons and essence are not related as real component
          extremes from which a tertium quid may arise (as in human things from
          the nature of man and the subsistence of Peter arises that person whom
          we call Peter); otherwise not a Trinity but a certain quaternity would
          be conceived of in God; nor do modes (such as subsistences) compose,
          they only modify. VI. But as God rejects all composition in himself,
          so his simplicity hinders him also from being compounded with any
          created things so as to hold the relation of some part either of
          matter or form (against the opinion of the Platonists who supposed God
          to be the soul of the world; and of the Manicheans who held that all
          creatures were propagated from the essence of God). This is so both
          because he is altogether diverse from creatures, and because he is
          immutable and incorruptible (he cannot coalesce in one with any
          mutable and corruptible created thing). For all composition infers
          mutation by which a thing becomes part of a whole, which it was not
          before. Sources of explanation. VII. If all things are said to be of
          God (Rom. 11:36), this must be understood not hylikos (“belonging to
          matter”) and materially, but demiourgikos (“formatively”) and
          efficiently. We are called the race and offspring of God (Acts 17:28),
          not by a participation of the same essence, but by similarity of
          likeness; efficiently not essentially, as also he is called the
          “Father of spirits” (Heb. 12:9) with reference to creation, not to
          composition. The Son of God is God-man (theanthropos) not by
          composition properly so-called, but by hypostatical union (by which
          the Word [logos] indeed assumed human nature in one hypostasis, but
          was not compounded with it as part with part; but stood to it in the
          relation of perfecter and sustainer to make perfect and sustain an
          essential adjunct, so that the human nature indeed did thence receive
          perfection, but nothing was added by it to the divine nature). VIII.
          Composition is in that in which there is more than one real entity,
          but not where there is only more than one mode because modes only
          modify and characterize, but do not compose the essence. But in divine
          things there are one essence and three hypostases (which are modes
          distinguishing indeed the persons from each other, but not composing
          because they are not real entities concurring to the composition of
          some fourth thing, since they have one common essence; but they are
          only modifications according to which the essence is conceived to
          subsist in three persons). IX. Simplicity and triplicity are so
          mutually opposed that they cannot subsist at the same time (but not
          simplicity and Trinity because they are said in different respects):
          simplicity in respect to essence, but Trinity in respect to persons.
          In this sense, nothing hinders God (who is one in essence) from being
          three persons. X. The decrees of God can be regarded in two ways:
          either subjectively (if it is right so to speak, i.e., on the part of
          the internal act in itself and absolutely); or objectively,
          extrinsically and relatively with respect to creatures (respectively).
          In the former manner, they do not differ from God himself and are no
          other than God himself decreeing. But in the latter, they do differ
          because they may be conceived as many and various (not as to the
          thing, since God has decreed all things by one single and most simple
          act, but as to the objects), even as the knowledge of God is
          conversant with innumerable objects without detriment to his unity.
          XI. The decrees of God are free, not absolutely and as to the
          principle, but relatively and objectively and as to the end. For there
          could be no external object necessarily terminating to the divine
          will, for God stands in need of nothing out of himself. Therefore they
          could be and not be. But this does not hinder them from being called
          necessary as to the principle and internal act because the act of
          intelligence and will could not be absent from God at all. He could
          not be God without intelligence and will. They are necessary,
          therefore, as to internal existence, but free as to external relation
          (schesin) and habit. Nor can the will of God be said to cease
          absolutely, but with respect to the external object on which it is
          terminated. XII. The decrees of God are immanent acts of the divine
          will, but not properly its effect. God ought not to be called so much
          the cause as the principle of them. Hence there is no need that they
          should be posterior to God except in our order and in the manner of
          conceiving them. XIII. Although the essence of God (considered simply
          in itself) is absolute and implies no relation to creatures, yet this
          does not hinder it (when considered with relative opposition to
          creatures and as determining itself in the manner of vital principle
          to the production of this or that thing out of itself) from having a
          certain reference (schesin) and relation to creatures. Nor can that
          manifold relation make composition in God, more than the relation
          which his omniscience and omnipotence bear to things ad extra,
          constituted a real difference between God and his omnipotence and
          omniscience. XIV. Whatever in God is essential and absolute is God
          himself. Thus the absolute attributes may be identified really with
          the divine essence and are in it essentially, not accidentally. If
          they are predicated of God in the concrete, their subject is only of
          denomination, not of inhesion (inhaesionis). But whatever is personal
          and modal in God is indeed God himself in the concrete, though not in
          the abstract. XV. The relative attributes do not argue composition,
          but distinction. The formal nature of relations is not to be in, but
          to be to. Nor do they superadd a new perfection to the essence, but
          only imply a habitude of the essence to other things. Paternity and
          dominion do not render him another being, but in a different manner
          dispose the possessor without superinducing a change in him. XVI. The
          personal property of the Son does not make his essence different from
          that of the Father, nor of a simple essence make a composed, for
          nothing real is added to the essence, rather it only makes the Son
          distinct from the Father. Distinction is not composition. XVII. The
          fathers often insist on this simplicity of God. “The nature of God is
          simple and immutable and undisturbed, nor is he himself one thing and
          what he is and has another thing” (Augustine, 1. 5, de Trinit. c. 1+).
          And after teaching that no creature is truly and perfectly simple, he
          adds: “Now although God may be called manifold, yet he is truly
          perfectly simple, for he is called great, wise, happy, and true, and
          whatever with propriety may be said of him. But his greatness is the
          same as his wisdom, for he is not great in mass, but in virtue, and
          his goodness is the same as his wisdom and greatness and truth” (The
          Trinity 6.6, 7* [FC 45:208-9; PL 42.929]). So too Athanasius: “God is
          not composed who composed all things that they might be; nor is he
          such as those things are which were made by his word; since he is a
          simple substance in whom there is no quality nor any shadow of change,
          as James testifies” (To the Bishops of Africa 8 [NPNF2, 4:493; PG
          26.1043)).

          FIGHTH QUESTION: THE INFINITY OF GOD Is God infinite in essence? We
          affirm against Socinus and Vorstius I. The infinity of God follows his
          simplicity and is equally diffused through the other attributes of
          God, and by it the divine nature is conceived as free from all limit
          in imperfection: as to essence (by incomprehensibility) and as to
          duration (by eternity) and as to circumscription, in reference to
          place (by immensity). We here treat of the first, leaving the others
          for future consideration. Statement of the question. II. We do not
          treat here of infinity (improperly so called and as to us) as the
          number of the stars and of the sands upon the seashore is said to be
          infinite. For we cannot count them (although in itself it is
          necessarily finite) since there is nothing actually and absolutely
          infinite but God. We treat of infinity proper and in itself. III. We
          do not treat of syncategorematic and relative infinity, concerning
          which it is said there are not so many but there may be more (as
          quantity is said to be infinitely divisible). But we treat of
          categorematic and absolute; not of potential infinity (in which sense
          the longing of matter with respect to forms is said to be infinite),
          but of infinity actually such (according to which the essence is not
          only indefinite [aoristos], but truly infinite [apeiros]); not only
          actually infinite in the oblique case, but also an infinite act in the
          proper case. IV. The Socinians and Vorstius, who ploughs with their
          oxen, interfere with this infinity. As they do not acknowledge the
          immensity of God as to essence, so they deny that God is actually
          infinite simply, although with respect to us he may often be called
          such. And the Remonstrants agree with them (although indirectly)
          ascribing indeed infinity of power and operation to God, but either
          taking away or calling in question the infinity of his essence. Proof
          that God is infinite in essence: from Ps. 145:3; Job 11:7. V. The
          orthodox attribute absolute infinity to God with respect to essence.
          In the first place, Scripture clearly teaches it: “Great is the Lord,
          and greatly to praised, and of his greatness there is no end” (Ps.
          145:3). Here the psalmist speaks not of the greatness of mass (which
          can in no way apply to the most simple God), but of the greatness, or
          better the infinity, of essence and virtue. Thus Zophar: “Canst thou
          by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto
          perfection? It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than
          hell; what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the
          earth, and broader than the sea” (Job 11:7—9). Nor ought it to be said
          that these words properly refer to perfection of wisdom, as Crellius
          wishes (“De Deo et Ejus Attributis,” 1.27 in Opera [1656], 4:91). For
          besides the passage itself testifying that it treats of the
          incomprehensibility of God, if it had reference only to wisdom, the
          argument would not lose a particle of its force because the property
          of an infinite perfection cannot agree with a finite nature. To the
          same purpose are the following: “Who hath measured the waters in the
          hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span?” (Is. 40:12);
          “Behold, the nations before him are as a drop of a bucket, and as
          nothing” (Is. 40:15, 17). From the perfection of God. VI. Second, from
          the pure perfection of God. For since he has every perfection which
          can be and be possessed, it is evident that nothing can be or be
          conceived better and more perfect. Thus he must necessarily be
          infinite because an infinite good is better than a finite. Besides,
          the perfections in created things are included within certain limits
          beyond which they are not extended and all their activity has a
          certain sphere beyond which it cannot go. However in God it is
          different. Besides containing every perfection of every being, he has
          it in the most eminent manner (i.e., he embraces every degree of every
          perfection without any limitation). And his power. VII. This is
          further confirmed by the consideration of his power. Since power (as
          the other attributes) may be identified with the essence, the essence
          must be the same with it in nature and therefore infinite no less than
          it. That his power is infinite is evident from this—that with God
          nothing is impossible (for this cannot be said of finite and limited
          power). Finally, if the essence of God is finite, he must be limited
          by some cause (which cannot be said of him who has no cause superior
          to himself, but is the cause of all). Therefore we can join with the
          ancients in saying that “God is infinite and incomprehensible and that
          infinity and incomprehensibility are the one thing which can be
          comprehended concerning him” (apeiron akatalépton to theion kai touto
          monon autou katalépton he hapeiria, kai hé akatalépsia). VIII. God is
          said to be infinite in essence in three ways: (1) originally, because
          he is absolutely independent, who neither has nor can have anything
          prior or superior to himself; (2) formally, because he has an
          absolutely infinite (apeiron) essence; (3) virtually, because his
          activity has no finite sphere, nor does he need the concourse of any
          cause in acting, but does all things whatsoever he wills. Sources of
          explanation. IX. Although God cannot produce an infinite effect
          (because it is not producible), yet he does not cease to be of
          infinite virtue because he acts in an infinite mode. The infinity,
          which cannot be found in the end on account of repugnancy, is found in
          that mode of acting. X. Comprehension either denotes the full
          obtaining and fruition of the thing desired in reference (schesin) to
          those who reach the goal in a race (in which sense the saints in
          heaven are called “attainers” [Phil. 3:12; 1 Cor. 9:24] to distinguish
          them from believers who are still on the road); or it denotes the
          accurate and perfectly absolute knowledge of God, which is perfectly
          adequate to the object. In this sense, none can be said to have
          attained—neither men nor angels—because the finite is not capable of
          the infinite. XI. Although God perfectly and adequately knows himself,
          it does not follow that his essence is finite because both the
          knowledge and apprehension which God has of himself are infinite. Thus
          the essence is said to be finite to God less properly. Not that God
          judges his essence to be finite, but that his knowledge is adequate to
          it. XII. It implies a contradiction for something to be indefinite and
          to be actually infinite without any limits of essence, and actually
          this something (i.e., most singular) undivided in itself and divided
          from every other. XIII. Although all creatures are at an infinite
          distance from the uncreated perfection, and between them and God there
          is no proportion of equality and commensuration, it does not follow
          that all creatures are equally perfect because the measure of the
          creatures’ perfection is not taken from their distance from the
          perfection of God, but from the greater or lesser degrees of
          perfection which each thing partakes from God. XIV. All perfections
          belong to God, either formally (as perfections simply such, i.e.,
          which absolutely speaking it is better to have than not to have, and
          than which no greater perfection can be conceived); or eminently (as
          perfections relatively, which indeed in their kind indicate some
          perfection, but necessarily conjoined with some imperfection; and
          because it cannot have them properly and formally, yet is said to
          possess them virtually and eminently because it can produce that
          perfection or because it can perform without it whatever that can
          perform, all imperfection being excluded). XV. That which is so that
          it is not anything else (neither formally nor eminently) is finite
          with respect to substance. Of God however this cannot be said, who is
          so something that nevertheless he is all things eminently, containing
          in himself eminently the perfections of all things. XVI. Although
          local infinity requires that formal existence of a thing in all
          places, yet infinity of essence does not require the thing to be
          formally all substance, but only to contain the perfections of every
          substance, if not formally, at least eminently.

          NINTH QUESTION: THE IMMENSITY OF GOD Is God immense and omnipresent as
          to essence? We affirm against Socinus and Vorstius I. After the
          infinity of God with respect to essence, the same is to be considered
          with respect to place and time by which he is conceived as
          uncircumscribed by any limits (aperigraptos) of place or time. The
          former is called immensity, the latter eternity. We must speak of
          these separately— first of immensity. Statement of the question. II.
          The question does not concern the presence of power and operation
          which is called energetic (energetiké) (as the sun is said to be
          present with us by the power of his rays although, very far distance
          in his body); for the adversaries do not deny this. Rather the
          question concerns the presence of nature (ousiddes), called essential,
          which they do not admit. Ill. The question does not concern the
          various modes of the special divine presence, according to which it is
          said to be in Christ by hypostatical union and fulness of deity (Col.
          2:9), in heaven by glory (1 K. 8:27), in the church by grace (Ezk.
          48:35). The divine presence is either: a symbolical presence, when
          under some visible symbol he manifests himself to believers (as to
          Moses in the bush, to the people in the cloudy pillar, to the
          patriarchs under the form of angels and men); or a sacramental and
          mystical presence, when under external signs and elements he exhibits
          and confirms his grace to us; or a spiritual and vivifying presence
          and when by his Spirit he dwells in the hearts of believers. No one
          denies that these various species of the presence of God are
          particular and proper to certain places. However the question relates
          to the general presence of God by essence, abstracted from all these
          singular modes. IV. God may be said to be present with all things in
          three modes: (1) by power and operation; (2) by knowledge; (3) by
          essence. This is usually expressed by the Scholastics in the line:
          Inter, praesenter Deus est, et ubique potenter (“Meanwhile, God is
          present, and everywhere powerfully”). He is said to be everywhere by
          his power because he produces and governs all things and works all
          things in all (in which sense Paul says, “In him we live and move and
          have our being,” Acts 17:28). He is present with all by his knowledge
          because he sees and beholds all things which are and become in every
          place as intimately present to and placed before him. Hence “all
          things” are said “to be naked and open unto the eyes of him” and
          “there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight” (Heb. 4:13).
          Finally, he is everywhere by his essence because his essence
          penetrates all things and is wholly by itself intimately present with
          each and everything. Now it is of this last presence we properly treat
          here, for our adversaries themselves do not deny that God is
          everywhere present by his power and knowledge (as has been said
          already). V. Three modes of being in a place are commonly held: (1)
          circumscriptively—attributed to bodies because they are in place and
          space so as to be commensurate with parts of space; (2)
          definitively—applicable to created spirits and incorporeal substances
          (which are defined by certain places, and are so here as not to be
          anywhere else); (3) repletively—which is ascribed to God because his
          immense essence is present with all and, as it were, completely fills
          all places. But although this distinction (when cut to the quick) may
          be inaccurate and repletion may seem to belong properly to a body
          occupying place by its extension, yet since it has been by long use
          received among philosophers and theologians (and can take appropriate
          sense according to the mind of the Holy Spirit himself, who testifies
          that “God fills heaven and earth,” Jer. 23:24), it ought not to be
          rashly rejected (if skillfully explained and understood in a sound
          sense, especially since we have no proper and accurate terms for
          explaining the ubiquity of God and are compelled here to use phrases
          borrowed from finite and corporeal things). VI. Therefore God is so
          said to be repletively everywhere on account of the immensity of his
          essence, that this should be understood in a most different manner
          from the mode of being in place of bodies (i.e., beyond the occupation
          of space, and the multiplication, extension, division of itself, or
          its mingling with other things, but independently and indivisibly).
          For wherever he is, he is wholly; wholly in all things, yet wholly
          beyond all; included in no place and excluded from none; and not so
          much in a place (because finite cannot comprehend infinite) as in
          himself. Hence the rabbis call him place (mqvm) to intimate that he is
          not contained in place, but contains all things in himself. Theophilus
          (of Antioch) says, “God is the place of all things, and is place to
          himself” (ho Theos topos esti ton holon, kai heauto topos esti, To
          Autolycus 2.3 [ANF 2:95; PG 6.1049]). VII. The Socinians with Vorstius
          argue with us concerning this immensity and omnipresence of God,
          admitting his presence as to virture and operation, but denying it as
          to essence. They maintain that God is contained in heaven (as Socinus,
          “De Jesu Christi Invocatione Disputatio ... cum Francisco Davidis,” in
          Opera Omnia [1656], 2:709-66 and Crellius, “De Deo et Ejus
          Attributis,” 1.27* in Opera [1656], 4:90—93 often assert) and endeavor
          to sustain this by various arguments. Vorstius, although seeming to
          hold back (epechein) on this question, yet sufficiently opens up his
          opinion in his Tractatus theologicus de Deo (1610), p. 230 and his
          Apologetica Exegesis (1611), placing substantial omnipresence among
          absurdities (asystata) and impossibilities (adynata). He expressly
          teaches that God (according to his essence) is in heaven, but
          according to his virtue and efficacy is on the earth and present with
          all creatures. VIII. But the orthodox believe and confess the
          immensity and omnipresence of God, not only as to virtue and
          operation, but principally as to essence. Still they think the mode of
          it should neither be curiously inquired into, nor be rashly defined.
          This only is to be held as certain—that it does not consist either in
          the multiplication of the divine essence (which is one numerically and
          individually); or in the extension and diffusion of any corporeal mass
          (since he is an uncreated spirit); or in physical contact (which
          belongs only to bodies); but in the simple and to us incomprehensible
          infinity of the divine essence, which is so intimately present with
          all things that it is both everywhere in the world and yet is not
          included in the world. Proof of God’s immensity from Scripture. IX.
          The reasons are: (1) Scripture ascribes this omnipresence to God
          —‘“Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from
          thy presence. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my
          bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the
          morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall
          thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me” (Ps. 139:7—10*).
          “Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
          footstool; where is the house that ye build unto me?” (Is. 66:1). In
          the latter, he proves that he cannot be included in temples made with
          hands, not by a reason drawn from the distance of the place in which
          his proper seat is (as Vorstius feigns), but from the magnitude of his
          substance, which completely fills the universe. Yea, he elsewhere
          protests that he fills heaven and earth: “Do not I fill heaven and
          earth?” (Jer. 23:24). That no one might imagine he is contained within
          heaven or the world, elsewhere the Holy Spirit testifies: “the heaven
          of heavens cannot contain him” (1 K. 8:27). X. To no purpose is it
          objected by Crellius that these passages treat of omnipresence of
          power and efficacy, not of essence. For (a) the words themselves teach
          the contrary (which refer not only to operation, but to the very
          essence itself; for what else can these words mean: “Thou art there; I
          fill heaven and earth; the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee’);
          (b) from parity, he ought to be in the sepulcher or in hell in the
          same way in which he is said to be in heaven because the presence of
          God is equally asserted of both places. Either he is everywhere as to
          essence or he is nowhere as to essence. (c) The design of the psalmist
          is to show that no one can be concealed from God so as not to be seen
          by him because he can be nowhere where God is not and can hide himself
          in no place where God cannot easily detect him (since the darkness and
          the light are both alike to him). (d) Things which ought to be
          composed are opposed. The presence of power does not exclude, but
          necessarily supposes the presence of essence. For where God is not,
          there he cannot operate because he operates immediately by his
          essence. Therefore, if he operates everywhere, he must be everywhere.
          XI. (2) The same thing is proved by those passages which teach that
          God works all things in all and sustains them by the word of his power
          (Heb. 1:3), and that he is not far from everyone of us because in him
          we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:27, 28). The presence of
          a spirit cannot be known more certainly than by its operations, nor is
          it less impossible for anyone to effect something where he is not,
          than when he is not. Nor ought it to be said that God works all things
          in all, but by second (or physical or hyperphysical) causes, and
          therefore the presence of the essence is not to be directly inferred
          from the operation. For besides the fact that God does not always act
          by second causes (but often immediately by himself as in the creation
          of the world, its sustentation, the miracles and works of grace in the
          heart), when he uses second causes, he is most intimately present with
          them in order to work by them. XII. (3) If God is not immense in
          essence, but finite, it will favor the contradiction that the creature
          is greater than God. For as nothing can be added to infinity, so it is
          of the nature of the finite that something can always be added to it.
          Indeed if the essence of God is not elsewhere than in heaven, the
          universe will be greater than God. Again if he is finite in essence,
          he must also be finite in power because infinite power cannot be in a
          finite subject. Third, if God is not immediately present with
          creatures by his essence, but only by operation, the belief of the
          incarnation of the Son of God could not rest upon a sure foundation.
          For what kind of an hypostatical union could have taken place with the
          human nature, if the divine essence remained concluded in heaven and
          was not present on the earth? Sources of explanation. XIII. God is
          said “to be in heaven,” not exclusively of the earth, as if he is
          included in heaven as to essence; but because in heaven as a royal
          palace, he displays his glory in an eminent manner. Nor if worshippers
          raise their eyes to heaven, either by natural instinct or by command
          of the word, is this done because God is included in heaven (which the
          apostle proves, Acts 17:24), but (1) in order that when we are about
          to approach unto God, we may elevate all our thoughts above these
          terrestrial and fleeting things and think nothing concerning God but
          what is great and lofty; (2) that we may know heaven to be the seat
          and throne of God, where there is a more illustrious display and a
          richer communication of glory and grace, whence all blessings are to
          be looked for and sought (as under the old dispensation the
          worshippers turned their faces towards the ark and temple and not
          because God was included in the ark or temple, but on account of the
          remarkable manifestation of grace usually made there); (3) that we may
          also remember that heaven is the habitation prepared for us by God,
          towards which we ought continually to press (as the Israelites driven
          into exile looked back to the temple, panting as it were in wishes for
          their country and liberty; so we should be kept in mind of our exile
          and pilgrimage, so as to breathe after liberty and seek our country
          with unwearied exertion); (4) to show that our prayers should no
          longer be directed to a certain fixed place on earth, but should be
          elevated to heaven, to be placed upon our altar (Christ in heaven) to
          be sanctified by him. XIV. It is not unworthy of the divine majesty to
          be everywhere on earth, even in the most filthy places, because he is
          not there by physical contact or by any mingling or composition, but
          as the efficient and conserving cause of things. (2) If it was not
          unworthy of God to create all things even the most mean, why should it
          be unworthy of him to be perpetually present with them? The sun by his
          rays permeates sordid places without being polluted by them, and how
          much less God? XV. God is far off from the wicked (as to the special
          presence of his favor and grace), but is always present with them by
          his general presence of essence. Where God is, there indeed is his
          grace originally and subjectively, but not always effectively because
          its exercise is perfectly free. XVI. It is absurd to suppose God to be
          in the devils and the wicked as he is in believers (as a gracious
          God), but not to be in them as a Judge and the avenger of crimes; not
          as an approver of wickedness, but as the Creator and sustainer of
          nature. Although he is differently in heaven and in hell (here by
          grace, there by justice; here as blessing, there as punishing), yet he
          can be in both places as to the immensity of his essence. XVII.
          Although the essence of God is abstracted from all created entities,
          it does not follow that he cannot be omnipresent as to essence. For it
          is said to be abstracted inasmuch as it is divided from them and is
          not a part of them; but it is said to be omnipresent, not that it
          comes into composition with them as a part or is contained by them,
          but inasmuch as it is terminated by the essence of none, nor excluded
          from it. XVII. When God is said to be immense (as so everywhere in the
          world that nevertheless he is not included in the world, which is
          finite, but may be conceived to be also beyond the world), this ought
          not to be understood positively (as if certain spaces are to be
          conceived of beyond the world which God completely fills by his
          presence), but negatively (inasmuch as the universal spaces of the
          world do not exhaust the immensity of God so as to be contained in and
          circumscribed by them). He is said, therefore, to be beyond the world
          because included in it, not as being in certain imaginary places, but
          in himself by the infinity of his own essence, as he was before the
          creation of the world in himself. “He was to himself both place, and
          world and all things,” as Tertullian says (Against Praxeas 5 [ANF
          3:600; PL 2.160]). XIX. He who conceives God as everywhere present by
          his essence, does not therefore conceive him as extended like bodies
          through the whole world, but as containing the whole world in the most
          simple infinity of his Own essence (or as coexisting indivisibly with
          all created things), just as eternity holds in its embrace all time as
          a point and coexists with it indivisibly. XX. So far is the doctrine
          of the essential omnipresence of God from favoring atheism (as the
          Remonstrants in their “Apologia pro confessione sive declaratione ...
          Remonstrantes,” in Episcopius, Operum theologicum, Pt. If [1656], p.
          130 maintain) that on the contrary the denial of it encourages it not
          a little because it takes away the reverence and fear of him, feigning
          that he is absent and therefore either does not see or cannot punish
          the sins of men. But the pious, who fear God, are said to walk before
          him because they are incited by his presence to his worship and
          service. XXI. It is one thing to declare and demonstrate a posteriori
          the presence of God through the external operation; another thing to
          define a priori the presence of God by that operation or to maintain
          that God is not present except by power and operation. The former we
          acknowledge can rightly be done, but the latter we deny because the
          operation of God supposes his presence, and he must first be conceived
          to be and to exist before he can be conceived of as acting. Certain
          more modern thinkers (who limit the omnipresence of God by his
          operation), may be allowed their opinion if they understand it in the
          former sense for its manifestation a posteriori; but if they refer it
          to its constitution a priori, it is deservedly rejected as contrary to
          Scripture and approaching too near the error of the Socininans. XXII.
          Although the immensity and omnipresence of God are always connected
          together, yet they admit of distinction. The former indicates an
          absolute property belonging to him from eternity; the latter, based
          upon it, denotes a habitude to place existing in time. They are
          related to each other as a first and second act or a principle
          (principii) and a principiate (principiati). For out of immensity
          arises omnipresence, which supposes immensity as its foundation. God
          is therefore omnipresent because he is immense. XXIII. When God is
          said to ascend or descend, to go away or to come, this does not take
          away his omnipresence because it is not said with respect to his
          essence, but only to the absence or presence of his diverse
          operations. God therefore comes when in a peculiar manner he works
          anywhere, either in grace or in justice; but he departs when he
          removes the symbols of his grace and denies to men the testimonies of
          his saving presence. Otherwise “in him we live, and move and have our
          being,” as Paul says in Acts 17:28. XXIV. The heathen themselves were
          not ignorant of this attribute of God. Trismegistus says, “God is a
          circle whose center is everywhere, but his circumference nowhere”
          (?cf. “Asclepius,” 3.27b in Hermetica [ed. W. Scott, 1985], 1:324).
          Aratus says, “All things are full of Jove” (Phaenomena 1-4 [Loeb,
          206—7]). Virgil says, “God they say, pervades all things, earth and
          sea’s expanse and heaven’s depth” (Georgics 4.221 [Loeb, 1:210-11]).
          To the same purpose are the following: quo fugis Encelade,* quascunque
          accesseris oras sub Jove semper eris+. Seneca says, “Wherever you turn
          yourself, there you will meet him; no place is without him; he fills
          his own work” (“De Beneficiis,” 4.8.2 in Seneca: Moral Essays III
          [Loeb, 3:218-19]).

          TENTH QUESTION: THE ETERNITY OF GOD Does the eternity of God exclude
          succession according to priority and posteriority 2? We affirm against
          the Socinians Statement of the question. I. The infinity of God in
          reference to duration is called eternity to which these three things
          are ascribed: (1) that it is without beginning; (2) without end; (3)
          without succession (i.e., the duration of a thing as to priority and
          posteriority, as to present, past and future). The question here
          properly is not whether God is eternal with reference to the two
          former (i.e., whether he is without beginning and end). Socinus and
          Vorstius cannot deny this against so many perfectly clear testimonies
          of Scripture. The question concerns the third—whether his eternity is
          without succession or whether it is subject to the differences of time
          as they pretend (see Crellius, “De Deo et Ejus Attributis,” 1.18 in
          Opera [1656], 4:41-45). We maintain that God is free from every
          difference of time, and no less from succession than from beginning
          and end. II. The question does not concern eternity improperly and
          relatively so called (as it is taken sometimes for the long duration
          of a thing, as circumcision is called “an eternal covenant” [Gen
          17:7], i.e., constant, which ought to continue until the restitution
          of all things [diorthdsin]; and the hills are said to be “eternal” by
          Moses [Dt. 33:15] because on account of their long continuance and
          constant duration they seem to approach eternity; or it may be used
          for that which has no end, although it might have had a beginning, as
          the angels and souls are eternal). Rather the question concerns
          eternity absolutely and properly so called, both anterior as well as
          posterior. The eternity of God proved. III. Scripture teaches that
          such eternity belongs to God, not only when it calls God “eternal”
          (Gen. 21:33; “who inhabits eternity,” Is. 57:15; “the king eternal,
          immortal, invisible,” 1 Tim. 1:17; “who was before the world was
          formed ... from everlasting and to everlasting,” Ps. 90:1, 2), but
          also when it ascribes all the properties of eternity to him (Ps.
          102:26—28): both dividedly that he is without beginning because he was
          before the foundation of the earth (Ps. 102:25*), without end—‘“who is
          ever the same, and whose years shall have no end” (Ps. 102:27*);
          without succession because he is said “to remain” without any change
          and “always to be the same” (Ps. 102:27*)—for he is not always the
          same from whom almost every moment something anteriorly is removed and
          by whom posteriorly something is added. Conjointly when to the
          mutability of the most constant things (which have a beginning, end
          and succession) is opposed the perpetual continuance of God in the
          same state; “the heavens shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea all
          of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
          them, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years
          shall have no end” (Ps. 102:25—27*). The passage in Jam. 1:17 is
          similar: “with God is no variableness, neither shadow of turning”
          (parallagén, é@ tropés aposkiasma). The succession and flow of the
          parts of duration (which exist successively) necessarily involve a
          certain species of motion (which cannot be applied to God). IV. Again,
          he is said to be “the first and the last” (Is. 41:4) and “the Alpha
          and Omega” (Rev. 1:8). He is the beginning without beginning because
          while he is the beginning of all things, he himself has no beginning.
          He is the end without end because (since he is the end to which all
          things are referred) he can have no end. Now that which is without
          beginning is also without succession because succession depends upon a
          beginning and implies order according to former and latter. The name
          Jehovah necessarily includes this eternity because (as has been said)
          it designates God to be the first and independent being, liable to no
          change. Hence the French Version appropriately translates it
          everywhere by I’Eternel because eternity eminently (kat’ exochén)
          belongs to him alone. V. The eternity of God cannot have succession
          because his essence, with which it is really identified, admits none.
          This is so both because it is perfectly simple and immutable (and
          therefore rejects the change of former into latter, of past into
          present, of present into future, which succession involves), and
          because it is unmeasurable, as being the first and independent.
          However that which continues by succession can in some way be
          measured. VI. True eternity has been defined by the Scholastics to be
          “the interminable possession of life—complete, perfect and at once.”
          Thus it excludes succession no less than end and ought to be conceived
          as a standing, but not a flowing, now. The reason is because nothing
          flows away with time from the life of God as from ours. God has every
          moment at once whatever we have dividedly by succession of time. Hence
          philosophers have well said that neither the future nor the past (he
          will be or was), but only the present (he is) can properly be applied
          to him. For the eternal duration of God embraces indeed all time—the
          past, present and future; but nothing in him can be past or future
          because his life remains always the same and immutable. Sources of
          explanation. VII. The three differences of time are applied to God
          when he is called “the one who is, and was and is to come” (ho on, kai
          ho én, kai ho erchomenos, Rev. 1:4). This is not done formally, but
          eminently and after the manner of men (anthropopathos), to describe
          (if possible) in this manner the eternity of God. This is not done
          dividedly as if they might be predicated of him successively, but
          undividedly because the eternity of God embraces all time at once.
          Hence the past is affirmed without the negation of the present and the
          future, and the present is asserted, but without the negation of the
          past and the future. “Although,” says Augustine, “that immutable and
          ineffable nature does not admit of he was or will be, but only of he
          is, yet on account of the mutability of time, with which our mortality
          and mutability is concerned, we may say without error, he is, was, and
          will be. He was in the past ages, he is in the present, he will be in
          the future. He was because he never was not; he will be because he
          will never cease to be; he is because he always is” (Tractate 99, On
          the Gospel of John [NPNF1, 7:383; PL 35.1888]). VIII. Although
          eternity may coexist with all the differences of time, it does not
          follow that they equally coexist among themselves. It does not coexist
          with them taken together and existing at once, but coexists with them
          existing dividedly and mutually succeeding each other. Thus the past
          while it was, coexisted with eternity, the present now coexists with
          it, and the future will coexist with it. IX. Things which agree with
          one third thing, agree together themselves, but only with respect to
          the same third thing. Thus all the differences of time agree together
          in this—that each when it exists, coexists with the whole of eternity.
          However they ought not therefore to agree among themselves so as to
          coexist at once because the whole eternity does not coexist with them
          taken at once, but dividedly as they mutually succeed each other (as
          the sun and its motion coexist with all the days of the ages;
          nevertheless it does not thence follow that they all coexist among
          themselves because every day coexists in its own order with the sun,
          which is always the same). X. Although time coexists with the whole of
          eternity, it is not therefore eternal because that coexistence is not
          adequate (as if they were of the same duration and nature), but
          inadequate (of a thing evidently heterogeneous both as to nature and
          as to duration). XI. The indivisible eternity of God embraces all
          divisible times, not coextensively or formally, but eminently and
          indivisibly. Thus the immense God embraces in his immensity all the
          extended and divisible parts of the world (although indivisible in his
          nature) because wherever he is, he is wholly. XII. A point is either
          mathematical (the beginning of a line or of time); or physical and
          political (viz., the shortest extension either of mass or of time); or
          metaphysical (which denotes the negation of extension and
          divisibility). In this third sense, it is not absurd that the world
          and time should be contained in a point of eternity. XIII. When a
          thousand years are said to be in the sight of God as one day (Ps.
          90:4), it refers not only to estimation (that God considers a thousand
          years as no more than one day), but also to the comparison of our
          duration (which is ephemeral [ephémeros]) with the divine (which is
          eternal). It intimates that God is not to be measured by our rule, as
          if his promise could be retarded, even if in our judgment fulfilled
          too late. For God is not subject to any differences of time, but a
          thousand years in his sight are as one day. XIV. God is called “the
          ancient of days,” not as stricken with old age and sated with years
          (as the Saturn of the heathen), but as before and more ancient than
          days themselves and the birth of time. Therefore days and years are
          not ascribed to him properly, but after the manner of men. For we who
          live in time can conceive nothing unless by a relation (schesin) to
          time, in which we are. XV. When the actions of God are considered
          either as past or present or future, this is said not with respect to
          the efficient reason, but in reference to the effects and objects
          (which are produced in diverse times and on which his acts are
          terminated). XVI. Time and eternity are not related to each other as
          part and whole, but as species of duration mutually opposed. Eternity
          always was and will be. However, time neither always was nor always
          will be, but will cease with the world. ELEVENTH QUESTION: THE
          IMMUTABILITY OF GOD Is God immutable both in essence and will? We
          affirm I. Immutability is an incommunicable attribute of God by which
          is denied of him not only all change, but also all possibility of
          change, as much with respect to existence as to will. II. The
          adversaries oppose this immutability of God, especially that which
          relates to the acts of his will. Hence God can now will what he before
          nilled and nill now what he before willed (Crellius, “De Deo et Ejus
          Attributis,” 1.21 in Opera [1656], 4:47—49; Vorstius, Tractus
          theologicus de Deo [1610]). With the orthodox, we maintain that every
          kind of immutability is to be ascribed to him both as to nature and as
          to will. The immutability of God proved. III. (1) Scripture expressly
          attributes it to him: “I am the Lord, I change not” (Mal. 3:6); “the
          heavens shall perish, but thou shalt endure” (Ps. 102:26); “with God
          is no variableness, neither shadow of turning” (Jam. 1:17). In the
          latter not only change is denied of him, but even the shadow of
          change, that he may be contrasted with the sun, the fountain of
          material light, liable to various changes and eclipses by which its
          light is intercepted. But God, the father of lights, acknowledges no
          tropics and can be obscured by no clouds since there is nothing to
          intercept his influence. The immutability of the divine will and
          counsel in particular is often asserted: “God is not a man, that he
          should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; hath he
          said, and shall he not do it? Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make
          it good?” (Num. 23:19). “My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my
          pleasure” (Is. 46:10; cf. Pss. 33:11; 110:4; 1 S. 15:29; Heb. 6:17).
          IV. Reason confirms it for he is Jehovah, and so a necessary and
          independent being that can be changed by no one. “All created things
          are mutable” (pan ktiston trepton), says John of Damascus (Dialogus
          contra Manichaeos 68 [PG 94.1568]) because they take their being from
          some other than themselves. God is immutable because he is from
          himself and recognizes no cause above himself. (2) He can neither be
          changed for the better (because he is the best) nor for the worse
          (because he would cease to be the most perfect). Augustine says,
          “Whatsoever is changed from the better for the worse, and from the
          worse for the better, is not God, because perfect virtue can neither
          change for the better, nor true eternity for the worse” (Tractate 23*,
          On the Gospel of John [NPNF1, 7:154; PL 35.1588]). (3) All causes of
          change are removed from him: dependence a priori; passive power; error
          of mind; inconstancy of will. Sources of explanation. V. Creation did
          not produce a change in God, but in creatures; not a physical change
          and properly so called (which supposes its material), but
          hyperphysical by which the creature passes from nonexistence to
          existence. An agent said to be changed (which in itself becomes
          different from what it was before), but which becomes different (not
          in itself but only relatively and in order to another thing) cannot be
          said to be changed. Now when God became the Creator, he was not
          changed in himself (for nothing new happened to him, for from eternity
          he had the efficacious will of creating the world in time), but only
          in order to the creature (because a new relation took place with it).
          And as to the act of creation being transient not immanent, it is not
          so much in God as from him. VI. God was not changed by the
          incarnation; the Word (logos) was made flesh, not by a conversion of
          the Word (tou logou) into flesh, but by an assumption of the flesh to
          the hypostasis of the Word (logou). VII. It is one thing to change the
          will; another to will the change of anything. God can will the change
          of various things (as the institution and abrogation of the Levitical
          worship) without prejudice to the immutability of his will because
          even from eternity he had decreed such a change. So from eternity he
          decreed to create the world and preserve it until a certain time, but
          afterwards to destroy it with a flood. In the same manner, we must
          reason concerning his knowledge. The knowledge of God does not change
          with the thing known because God who knew it not only knew that this
          change would take place, but even decreed it. VIII. It is one thing to
          be indifferent to various objects; another to be mutable. The cause of
          indifference is not mutability, but liberty. The will of God could be
          indifferent before the decree, but after the decree it cannot be
          mutable. IX. The power of varying his own acts is not the principle of
          mutability in itself, but only in its objects (unless it is understood
          of the variation of his own acts which a perfect will does not vary,
          but only an imperfect; for no one can vary his purpose unless some
          disadvantage is discovered attending it, which cannot be the case in
          God). X. It is one thing to inquire whether God might have determined
          himself to other objects than those he has decreed before he had
          resolved anything concerning them; another whether the decree having
          been formed he could rescind it. The latter we deny, but the former we
          assert. And yet no mutability is thus charged upon God because he is
          therefore said to be changed (who begins to will what he nilled or to
          nill what he willed) which can have no place in God. XI. Repentance is
          attributed to God after the manner of men (anthropopathos) but must be
          understood after the manner of God (theoprepOos): not with respect to
          his counsel, but to the event; not in reference to his will, but to
          the thing willed; not to affection and internal grief, but to the
          effect and external work because he does what a penitent man usually
          does. If repentance concerning the creation of man (which he could not
          undo) is ascribed to God (Gen. 6:6, 7*), it must be understood not
          pathetically (pathetikos), but energetically (energetikos). Although
          he could not by a non-creation undo what he had done, yet by a
          destruction he could produce change. XII. Unfulfilled promises and
          threatenings do not argue a change of will because they were
          conditional, not absolute. This is evident from Jer. 18:7— 8*,
          Although the condition may not often be expressed, it must be
          understood as tacit and implied. XIII. When the death of Hezekiah was
          predicted, there was not a declaration of what would happen according
          to the will of God, but of what (according to the nature of second
          causes) would happen unless God interposed. XIV. The necessity of the
          immutability we ascribe to God does not infer Stoic fate. It is only
          an extrinsic necessity and from the hypothesis of the divine will,
          without interference with the liberty and contingency of things, as
          will be proved hereafter when we come to the decrees.

          TWELFTH QUESTION: THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD Do all things fall under the
          knowledge of God, both singulars and future contingencies? We affirm
          against Socinus I. Among the communicable and positive attributes
          (which affirm some perfection of God), there are three principal ones
          by which his immortal and perfectly happy life is active: intellect,
          will and power. The first belongs to the principle as directing, the
          second as enjoining, the third as executing. II. Concerning the
          intellect of God and the disquisition of his knowledge, two things
          above all others must be attended to: the mode and object. The mode
          consists in his knowing all things perfectly, undividedly, distinctly
          and immutably. It is thus distinguished from human and angelic
          knowledge: perfectly because he knows all things by himself or by his
          essence (not by forms abstracted from things—as is the case with
          creatures—both because these are only in time with the things
          themselves, but the knowledge of God is eternal, and because he can
          have no cause out of himself). (2) Undividedly, because he knows all
          things intuitively and noetically, not discursively and dianoetically
          (by ratiocination and by inferring one thing from another). If God is
          sometimes set forth as inquiring or reasoning, this is not said
          properly, but humanly (the Scriptures lisping with us to the perfect
          and certain knowledge of God). (3) Distinctly, not that by a diverse
          conception he collects diverse predicates of things, but because he
          most distinctively sees through all things at one glance so that
          nothing, even the most minute, can escape him. (4) Immutably, because
          with him there is no shadow of change, and as he himself remaining
          immovable gives motion to all, so he sees the various turns and
          changes of things by an immutable cognition. III. The object of the
          knowledge of God is both himself (who most perfectly knows himself in
          himself) and all things extrinsic to him whether possible or future
          (i.e., as to their various orders and states; as to quantity— great
          and small; as to quality—good and bad; as to predication—universals
          and singulars; as to time—past, present and future; as to
          state—necessary and free or contingent). Whether God knows singulars.
          IV. The principal question agitated here is that about singulars and
          future contingent things which some wish to withdraw from the
          knowledge of God; singulars indeed, as Averroes, who denies that they
          can be exactly known by God. This is also charged upon Jerome since he
          thinks it to be absurd and “unworthy of the divine majesty to let it
          down to this, that it should know how many gnats are born or die every
          moment, number of cinches and fleas on earth” (Commentariorum in
          Abucuc 1.1 [PL 25.1286] on Hab. 1:13*, 14*). This opinion is highly
          injurious towards God, if precisely urged. But these rather harsh
          words can be softened and understood comparatively; they mean nothing
          else than to withdraw these things from the special care exercised
          towards men, to teach their advantage over them. Jerome seems to
          intimate this by adding: “Nor are we such foolish flatterers of God
          as, while drawing down his power to the lowest things, to be injurious
          to ourselves, teaching that the same providence extends to irrational
          as to rational creatures” (ibid.). V. Indeed Scripture is so clear on
          this subject as to leave no room for doubt. For why should Christ say
          that the hairs of our head are all numbered and not one sparrow can
          fall on the ground without the will of the Father (Mt. 10:29, 30)? How
          could Paul assert that all things are naked and open (tetrachélismena)
          unto him, and there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight
          (Heb. 4:13)? How could the psalmist intimate that God tells the number
          of the stars and calls them all by their names (Ps. 147:4) unless God
          beheld individual things? And if God created and governs them, why
          should he not also know them? VI. The divine understanding is no more
          debased by the knowledge of a mean thing than the sun is polluted by a
          filthy thing. And if the power of God was not lowered when he created
          them, why should his knowledge be debased by the contemplation of
          them? Yea, since all things (even the greatest) are the smallest
          before him in comparison with his infinity (as Is. 40:15 magnificently
          says) and, as it were, nothing, the knowledge of all things should be
          denied of him if the smallest are removed from his notice. Statement
          of the question: the knowledge of future contingent things. VII.
          Another question of greater importance refers to future contingent
          things, the knowledge of which the Socinians endeavor to wrest from
          God in order to establish more easily the indifference of free will
          (its freedom from all necessity, even from that which is usually
          placed upon it by the foreknowledge of God). They may sometimes seem
          to attribute to him a full knowledge of all things, even of those
          which are future. “Under the name of the wisdom of God in this place
          we embrace the knowledge of all things.” And a little after: “As to
          future things, there are the most palpable proofs in Scripture that
          God knows them also” (Crellius, “De Deo et Ejus Attributis,” 1.24,
          Opera [1656], 4:65). Yet elsewhere they openly withdraw from him the
          knowledge of future contingencies as not being in the class of
          knowable things, saying either that he does not know them absolutely
          or only indeterminately and probably. Socinus says, “Since, then,
          there is no reason, no passage of Scripture, from which it can be
          clearly gathered that God knew all things which happened before they
          happened, we must conclude that we are by no means to assert such a
          foreknowledge of God, especially when both many reasons and sound
          testimony are not wanting, utterly opposed to it” (Praelectionis
          theologicae 11 [1627], p. 38). So too Crellius: “They act
          inconsiderately who say that God knows determinately future
          contingencies because otherwise he would not be omniscient, since the
          rasher, therefore, he cannot conceive future things determinately
          because he is omniscient and never errs in this that can be known”
          (“De Deo et Ejus Attributis,” 1.24, Opera [1656], 4:66, 68). And
          Smalcius in opposition to Frantzius, still more clearly: “But how can
          that be true which destroys itself and is repugnant to the Scriptures
          or does great violence to them? To say that God knows those things
          which are in no manner, such as future contingencies are, is to
          contradict himself; for what is knowable is not properly contingent,
          and what is properly contingent cannot be known” (Refutatio Thesium D.
          Wolfgangi Frantzii, Disp. XXII* [1614], pp. 436— 37). On the other
          hand, the orthodox maintain that future contingent things fall under
          the infallible knowledge of God. VIII. On the state of the question
          observe: (1) that a thing may be contingent in two ways—either with
          respect to the first cause (inasmuch as it can be produced or not
          produced by God, and so all creatures are contingent with respect to
          God because he might not have created any if he had so willed); or
          with respect to second causes (which can produce or not produce their
          effect and are thus distinguished from necessary causes). We here
          speak of future contingents in the latter and not in the former sense.
          IX. (2) A thing can be considered either as to the certainty of event
          or as to the mode of production. A future contingent thing implies
          both; for as future it signifies the certainty of event, but as
          contingent the mode of production. It has the former from the decree
          of the first cause; the latter from the constitution of the second
          cause. X. Thus the question is whether things, not any whatsoever and
          having a necessary cause (for there is no doubt as to these), but
          contingent (which have a free cause) and indifferent (adiaphoron); not
          logically as to the first cause, in which sense even the most
          necessary things are contingent (since they can be and not be), but
          physically (as to the contingent second cause) fall under the
          infallible knowledge of God, not as knowing them only indeterminately
          and probably, but determinately and most certainly. This the Socinians
          deny; we affirm. XI. The reasons are: (1) Scripture frequently claims
          such a knowledge of God—“Lord, thou knowest all things” (Jn. 21:17)
          and “God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things” (1 Jn.
          3:20). The objection is fruitless that “all things” refers to all
          knowable things and that future contingents are not such. This is the
          proton pseudos (a thing to be proved, not taken for granted). However
          we say they are knowable not in_ themselves determinately, but in the
          decree of God. XII. “Known unto God,” said James, “are all his works
          from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18). If all works, therefore
          also the free and contingent; if known from eternity, therefore also
          the future. Nor ought it to be said: (a) that the reference here is
          not to every work of God or of men, but to that of which James was
          speaking—the calling of the Gentiles. For the universal mark admits of
          no restriction, but shows that James proceeded from the genus to the
          species, from the thesis to the hypothesis in this sense—whatever God
          does in time, he decreed and foreknew from eternity; therefore he
          decreed and foreknew that the Gentiles would be introduced into the
          communion of the church without an observance of the Mosaic Law; (b)
          that it refers to works which are and not to those which neither have
          been, nor are, nor will certainly be, such as future contingents are.
          For although they are not as to real being, yet they are as to known
          being; although they will not certainly be as to second causes, yet
          they will certainly be as to the first by which they are defined, (c)
          The calling of the Gentiles was so a work of God that it ought also to
          be the work of the nations because they ought to respond to his call
          through grace. Therefore if God certainly knew that call, he ought to
          know future contingent things. XIII. “All things are naked and open
          unto his eyes” (Heb. 4:13). If all things, therefore the thoughts and
          voluntary actions of men; and existing not only in act but also
          future, which God sees not only in their causes, but also in his
          decree. Hence he is said “to understand our thoughts afar off, and to
          know our downsittings and uprisings; for there is not a word in my
          tongue, but thou knowest it altogether” (Ps. 139:1-4*)—therefore not
          only actually existing, but also future: “Before I formed thee in the
          belly, I knew thee” (Jer. 1:5); “I knew that thou wouldst deal very
          treacherously” (Is. 48:8); “I know the things that come into your
          mind, every one of them” (Ezk. 11:5). XIV. (2) Because God predicts
          future contingent things, therefore he knows them. For unless he
          infallibly knows, he could not certainly predict them, as he
          frequently does. “The foreknowledge of God has as many witnesses, as
          he has made prophets” (Tertullian, Against Marcion 2.5 [ANF 3:301; PL
          2.290]). “He declares the end from the beginning and from ancient
          times the things that are not yet done” (Is. 46:10). “Show the things
          that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods” (Is.
          41:23). God thus distinguishes himself from false gods and creatures.
          The examples of prediction occur everywhere in the Scriptures. What do
          our adversaries reply here? That these predictions are of
          probabilities only, as they impiously speak. But who can stand the
          blasphemous expression: that the infallible knowledge of God is merely
          conjectural, and his word (which is stronger than heaven and earth,
          and of which not even an iota can pass away until all be fulfilled) is
          founded upon mere fallible probabilities; that these predictions are
          of things which God had decreed to bring about? But there is no future
          thing which God has not decreed, either to do if good or to permit if
          bad; nor can he foreknow unless he has decreed them. That they are
          rather admonitions than predictions? But the passages themselves prove
          the contrary, for a prediction is simply the narration of a future
          thing, but an admonition is a persuasion to a work of virtue or a
          dissuasion from the contrary. For if some predictions can lead to the
          persuasion of men, it does not follow that they are not predictions;
          that this is said only of certain future things, not of all. But why
          should it be said of some and not of all? No reason can be assigned
          for the diversity. XV. (3) Because the most perfect nature of God
          demands it; for if the knowledge of future things is a perfection in
          creatures, much more will it be so in God. Again, because he is
          omniscient (which he would not be unless his knowledge extended to all
          things not only past and present, but also future—contingent as well
          as necessary), (a) Because he is the searcher of hearts
          (kardiognostés), which would not be true if he did not most intimately
          know not only the thoughts, purposes and affections of the heart, but
          also the propensities and dispositions before their actual execution
          (Jer. 17:9, 10; Job 34:21; Jn. 2:24, 25; Acts 1:24; Rev. 2:23). (b)
          Because he is omnipresent—everywhere and intimately present with all
          his creatures and moving and directing them before they move or direct
          themselves. XVI. (4) The decree of providence draws this necessarily
          after it because as whatever takes place in time, God immutably
          decreed either to effect or to permit, so he ought infallibly to
          foreknow it all. The reason is that the foreknowledge of God follows
          his decree, and as the decree cannot be changed, so neither can his
          knowledge be deceived: “Our God is in the heavens: he hath done
          whatsoever he pleased” (Ps. 115:3); “For of him, and through him, and
          to him, are all things” (Rom. 11:36); “He worketh all things after the
          counsel of his own will” (Eph. 1:11). Nor can these passages be
          referred only to the things which God himself does and not to those
          which ought to be done by men (as placed in their will, as Socinus
          maintains). For all things alike are subject to divine providence; nor
          does the liberty of human actions hinder them from falling under his
          knowledge and decree, as will be proved hereafter. XVII. Although it
          is difficult to comprehend the mode in which God certainly knows
          future contingent things, yet the thing itself (confirmed by so many
          passages of Scripture and reasons) is not therefore to be denied.
          Sources of explanation. XVIII. The principal foundation of the divine
          knowledge about future contingent things is not either the nature of
          second causes (which is supposed to be indifferent [adiaphoros]) or
          simply the divine essence, as immutable by creatures and as capable of
          producing them because it is the foundation of the possibility of
          things; the decree alone by which things pass from a state of
          possibility to a state of futurition (in which he sees them as it were
          determined and certainly future); and because the decree of God is not
          occupied about the thing, but also about the mode of the thing (i.e.,
          that the thing may take place according to the nature of its cause,
          necessarily if necessary, freely if free, God sees them in the decree
          not only as certainly future, but also as certainly future
          contingently). XIX. Of whatever things there is not a determinate
          truth, of them there cannot be a certain and infallible knowledge if
          they are absolutely and in every respect indeterminate. But future
          contingent things are not such. For if they are indeterminate with
          respect to the second cause and in themselves, they are not so as to
          the first cause which decreed their futurition. If their truth is
          indeterminate with respect to us (who cannot see in which direction
          the free second cause is about to incline itself), it is not so with
          respect to God to whom all future things appear as present. XX. It is
          not inconsistent (asystaton) for the same thing to be said to be
          possible and impossible at the same time (but as to different things
          [kat’ allo kai allo]): possible with respect to potency or the second
          cause (considered in itself and in a divided sense) and impossible
          relatively (on the hypothesis of the divine decree and foreknowledge).
          So it was possible for Christ not to be crucified, if God had so
          willed, and impossible on account of the decree. What therefore in the
          compound sense and on the supposition of the decree of God concerning
          the futurition of the thing was impossible not to take place; yet in
          the divided sense (and the decree being laid aside) was possible not
          to take place. XXI. It is one thing for a thing to be able to be done
          or not to be done (i.e., for a thing to be possible or not to be
          future hypothetically); another for a thing to be able to be at the
          same time future and not future. The former denotes only the temporal
          identity of power as much as the thing could be done or not; the
          latter implies the power of temporal identity because it is supposed
          that something could at the same time be and not be. Contingency
          applies to the former method, not to the second which is absurd
          (asystatos). XXII. We acknowledge a contradiction in these two
          propositions—the man is about to walk and he is not about to walk; but
          not in these—the man is about to walk, and he is able not to walk. The
          first speaks of the truth of futurition; the latter of the truth of
          possibility. There is no repugnancy between these two propositions,
          and they can be true at the same time. Adam is certainly about to
          fall, and Adam is able not to fall (the former speaks of futurition of
          a thing from the decree; the latter of the possibility of a thing from
          the disposition of the second cause). XXIII. The infallibility and
          certainty of the event does not take away the nature of the
          contingency of things because things can happen necessarily as to the
          event and yet contingently as to the mode of production. If there is
          granted a prescience of future contingent things, all things would
          take place necessarily by necessity of consequence, by the necessity
          of infallibility; not by necessity of the consequent and absolute.
          Therefore, there remains always this distinction between necessary and
          contingent things. The former have an intrinsic necessity because they
          arise from necessary proximate causes and are such in themselves;
          while the contingent, although having an extrinsic necessity by reason
          of the event, yet in their nature take place by contingent causes.
          XXIV. The freedom of the will is indeed overthrown by a physical and
          coactive necessity which is at variance with the formal reason of
          liberty, but not by a hypothetical necessity and of the infallibility
          of the event, for the same thing in this respect can be both free and
          necessary. Hence although men’s actions may be free (because done
          spontaneously and by a previous judgment of reason), they do not cease
          to be necessary with respect to the divine decree and foreknowledge.
          Now the foreknowledge of God implies indeed the infallibility of
          futurition and of the event and the necessity of consequence, and yet
          does not imply coaction or violence, nor take away from the will its
          intrinsic liberty. XXV. The infallible foreknowledge of God does not
          imply that God is the cause of sins because God foreknows sins as
          certainly about to be (for example, the selling of Joseph and the
          betrayal of Christ); not as if they were to be effected by him as
          sins, but to be permitted and yet regulated by him. This mode makes
          him no more guilty in his foreknowledge and decree than in the
          execution because neither the decree nor the foreknowledge subject the
          man to an intrinsic necessity, but only to an extrinsic as to the
          event. XXVI. God does not make trial of men from ignorance (in this
          way to gain knowledge which he was not possessed of before), but from
          his most wise providence in order to declare to others what was before
          unknown to them. Thus he tried Abraham (not in order that he might
          know his faith and obedience by this experiment, which he was
          previously ignorant of, since even before he professed that he knew
          his piety [Gen. 18:19], but in order to make known to the world and
          the church his remarkable faith). If it is said that God then knew
          that he feared him (“Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou
          hast not withheld thine only son from me,” Gen. 22:12), this is not to
          be understood absolutely of the knowledge which God obtained, but
          transitively of the knowledge which he gave to others (as similar
          words are often used in the Scriptures). XXVII. Although God testifies
          that he willed to go down and see whether the cry of Sodom which came
          to him was true (Gen. 18:21), it does not follow that he was ignorant
          of the nature and degree of the impiety of that city before. He had
          already said, “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great.” But this is
          said after the manner of men (anthropopathos) to intimate that he
          performs the part of a good and exact Judge, and neither pronounces
          nor executes anything rashly (as an accurate judge inquires on the
          spot into the thing itself to avoid precipitate action). XXVIII. God
          is said to expect grapes from the vineyard (Is. 5:4) not because he
          was ignorant of what would happen, but this is spoken after the manner
          of men because he seriously charged the people to be studious of good
          works; and such was the nature of the gifts bestowed that he was as
          much bound to expect fruit from them (unless they had fallen upon an
          ungrateful soil) as the industrious husbandman is accustomed to look
          for fruit from a vineyard properly cultivated. XXIX. When God
          conceives future contingent things as certainly future, he does not
          conceive of them otherwise than they are; but he knows them relatively
          to the decree as necessarily about to take place and determinate
          which, relative to their cause, he knows as indeterminate and
          contingently future. Therefore, God foreknows them both in himself and
          in his decree (as the first cause), and so they are necessary on
          account of the immutability of the decree and the infallibility of
          foreknowledge; and God foreknows them in the second causes on which
          they proximately and immediately depend, which are per se indefinite,
          and so they are contingent things.

          THIRTEENTH QUESTION: MIDDLE KNOWLEDGE Is there a middle knowledge in
          God between the natural and the free? We deny against the Jesuits,
          Socinians and Remonstrants The twofold middle knowledge. I. Although
          the knowledge of God is one and simple intrinsically no less than his
          essence, yet it can be considered in different ways extrinsically as
          to the objects. But it is commonly distinguished by theologians into
          the knowledge of simple intelligence (or natural and indefinite) and
          the knowledge of vision (or free and definite). The former is the
          knowledge of things merely possible and is therefore called indefinite
          because nothing on either hand is determined concerning them by God.
          The latter is the knowledge of future things and is called definite
          because future things are determined by the sure will of God. Hence
          they mutually differ: (1) in object because the natural knowledge is
          occupied with possible things, but the free about future things; (2)
          in foundation because the natural is founded on the omnipotence of
          God, but the free depends upon his will and decree by which things
          pass from a state of possibility to a state of futurition; (3) in
          order because the natural precedes the decree, but the free follows it
          because it beholds things future; now they are not future except by
          the decree. The origin of the middle knowledge. II. Besides these two
          species of divine knowledge, a third was devised by the Jesuits,
          Fonseca, Lessius, Molina. It is not agreed among themselves who is the
          true parent of this fetus (foetus) (each claiming it for himself)
          which they called “middle” because it is between the natural and the
          free and differs from both. It differs from the indefinite and natural
          because it is occupied about future, but not about possible things. It
          differs from the free because it relates not to things certainly
          future, but only hypothetically so. The authors explain this middle
          knowledge to mean the foreknowledge of God about future conditional
          events whose truth depends not upon the free decree of God (being
          anterior to this), but upon the liberty of the creature (which God
          certainly foresees), whether in itself or in the thing (how it will
          determine itself if placed in certain given circumstances). III. The
          design of the Jesuits was to defend the semi-Pelagian heresy of
          foreseen faith and good works in election, and to support the figment
          of free will in order the more easily to free themselves from the
          arguments of the Dominicans who rejected such a foresight (principally
          for this reason—that since there is no knowledge in God [unless either
          natural—of things possible—or free—of things future] all foreknowledge
          of faith and of the good use of free will ought to depend upon, not to
          precede the decree). This argument they supposed could be escaped in
          no other way than by inventing this middle knowledge. There is no need
          to take account of the disturbances this question executed among the
          Jesuits and Dominicans. The pope, in the meantime, to whose tribunal
          the whole matter was frequently referred for his infallible judgment,
          in an affair of so great moment, slept and did not dare to determine
          anything. It suffices to make this observation—that what the Jesuits
          contended for as their Helen was fiercely assailed as most false by
          the Dominicans (among whom were the eminent Cumel, Ripa, Alvarez,
          Nugno and others with whom the Jansenists of this day agree). IV. This
          invention was afterwards adopted by the Socinians and Remonstrants who
          courageously defend it so as to preserve free will in the citadel; see
          Arminus ‘Certain Articles to be Diligently Examined and Weighed,’ “On
          God Considered According to His Nature,” The Writings of James
          Arminius (1956), 2:480-81; Vorstius, Tractatus theologicus de Deo
          (1610); Grevinchovius, Dissertatio theologica de duabus quaestionibus
          ... controversis ... inter G. Amesium (1615). Statement of the
          question. V. The question is not whether God knows future
          contingencies (for all agree that God knows from eternity by a certain
          knowledge not only things themselves, but all their combinations and
          connections, whether present, past and future, or necessary and
          contingent). Rather the question is whether they belong to a kind of
          middle knowledge distinct from the natural and free. The latter we
          deny. VI. The question does not concern necessary conditional future
          things, which on this or that given condition cannot but take place
          (as—if the sun rises, it will be day; if Peter heartily repents, he
          will be saved), for as these are necessarily connected together either
          from the nature of the thing or on the hypothesis of the divine
          decree, they fall under either the natural knowledge of God (if the
          condition is only possible) or the free (if it is future and decreed
          by him). Rather the inquiry relates to contingent conditional future
          things, which (the condition being posited) can be and not be; for
          example, if John would be of Lutetia, he would speak or would sin and
          the like. The inquiry relates to whether they can be certainly and
          determinately known antecedently to the decree of God; this we deny.
          VII. The question is not whether the knowledge of conditional future
          things is in God antecedently to every decree (for our adversaries do
          not deny that a certain general decree precedes by which he has
          decreed to produce the second causes and is ready to afford at least a
          general and indifferent cooperation to the creature, as often as he
          willed that they should determine themselves to act). Rather the
          question is whether a special decree concerning the certain futurition
          of this or that thing precedes so that God may see that thing
          antecedently to such a decree (either in itself or in its causes).
          This they maintain; we deny. VIII. Therefore the question is whether
          besides the natural knowledge (which is only of things possible) and
          the knowledge of vision (which is only of things future), there may be
          granted in God a certain third or middle knowledge concerning
          conditional future things by which God knows what men or angels will
          freely do without a special decree preceding (if placed with these or
          those circumstances in such an order of things). The Jesuits,
          Socinians and Remonstrants affirm this; the orthodox deny it. Proof
          that no such middle knowledge can _ be granted. IX. The reasons are:
          (1) Natural and free knowledge embrace all knowable things and
          entities and are not to be multiplied unnecessarily. There is nothing
          in the nature of things which is not possible or future; nor can
          future conditional things constitute a third order. For they are such
          either from a condition only possible or powerful, yet never to take
          place, or from a condition certainly future and decreed. In the former
          manner, they do not recede from the nature of possible things and
          belong to natural knowledge; in the latter, they are future and
          decreed by God and come under the free knowledge. X. (2) Things not
          true cannot be foreknown as true. Now conditional future things are
          not true apart from the determination of the divine will; for example,
          the Sidonians would have repented if the powers had been supplied to
          them, for they would have been indifferently disposed in their nature
          to repent or not to repent, those powers being given; therefore from
          some other source ought to come the truth that they would repent,
          those powers being posited, if it is at all true. But no cause of this
          thing can be imagined except the will of God. There was nothing from
          eternity which could be the cause of the determination of a thing
          indifferent to either part except the will of God; not his essence or
          knowledge, for neither can operate ad extra separated from the will.
          Therefore, as no effect can be understood as future (whether
          absolutely or hypothetically) without the divine decree (because no
          creature can be in the world without the divine causality), so no
          future conditional thing can be knowable before the decree. XI. (3) If
          all the acts of the created will fall under the divine providence so
          that none are independent and indeterminate, no middle knowledge can
          be granted (which is supposed to have for its object the free
          determination of the will, depending upon no superior cause). Now that
          there is such a subjection of the created will is evident from the
          dependence between the first cause and second causes, between the
          Creator and creatures. Nor can it suffice to save that dependence that
          the will may be said to be created and its liberty given by God for it
          would not cease to be the principle of its own determination, if its
          acts did not depend upon some decree. It would not be indeed the first
          being, but yet it would be the first operator (nor any more the
          second, but the first cause because if it depended in being upon God,
          it would not depend upon him in operation). XII. (4) No uncertain
          knowledge should be ascribed to God. The middle knowledge can have no
          certainty because it is occupied about an uncertain and contingent
          object (viz., the indifference [adiaphorian] of the will). I ask,
          therefore, whence can God certainly know what will or will not take
          place? For either this can be done from the nature of the things
          themselves when he regards them (either in their causes or in
          themselves) as free acts in a created will (which pleases
          Bellarmine)—but how can an uncertain thing afford foundation to
          certain knowledge—or this can be done from the infinity of divine
          knowledge, which certainly foreknows in what direction moral
          persuasion will incline the will (otherwise free) to the opposite
          (which Vasquez and Suarez hold); but how could infirmity of knowledge
          change the nature of things and see a thing as certainly to take place
          which is contingent? Again knowledge either makes the event certain or
          foresees it as certain. If it makes it so, how can it foreknow it as
          such; where then is the indifference of the will? If it foresees it as
          certain, how could the foresight of an uncertain and indifferent thing
          be itself certain? Or from the eternal existence of things by which
          they are said to be present to God (as others prefer); but since they
          could have no real being from eternity (but only an intentional), they
          cannot be said to have existed from eternity otherwise than by reason
          of the decree in which they obtain their futurition. Since, therefore,
          the certain necessity of the event cannot be founded on the contingent
          connection of the ends or on the knowledge which recognizes but does
          not make the thing, it follows that it is only from the efficacious
          decree of the connector. Thomas Aquinas says most satisfactorily, “He
          who knows an effect contingent in its own cause only and not in some
          superior cause certainly determining it, has only a conjectural
          knowledge concerning it; since from an indifferent cause as far as it
          is indifferent, a determinate act cannot flow; and for the same reason
          from a contingent antecedent, as far as it is contingent, a necessary
          conclusion cannot flow before the decree of the divine will” (ST, I,
          Q. 14, Art. 13, p. 83). XIII. (5) This middle knowledge takes away the
          dominion of God over free acts because according to it the acts of the
          will are supposed to be antecedent to the decree and therefore have
          their futurition not from God, but from itself. Indeed God would seem
          rather to depend upon the creature while he could decree or dispose
          nothing, unless a determination of the human will were posited which
          God would see in such a connection of things. Nor ought the reply to
          be made that the dominion of God is not therefore taken away because
          he can remove that connection or some circumstance of it; for example,
          in the foreknowledge by which God knew that Peter would deny Christ if
          placed in a certain condition, God could hinder him from denying
          Christ by taking away some _ foreseen circumstance (for instance, the
          fear of death) or by adding greater light in the intellect and a
          greater inclination in the will to confession, and the like. For it is
          not sufficient for the support of the dominion of God that he could
          hinder Peter from denying Christ, for he might have deprived Peter of
          life before the apprehension of Christ (but this would be to have
          dominion over the life of Peter, not over his free will); but it is
          requisite that the free acts of Peter, of denying or not denying
          Christ, should depend upon him (which is denied on the supposition of
          this knowledge). In fine, if God can take away one foreseen
          circumstance, he can therefore change the event of the thing: if he
          can by a decree change the event of a thing, therefore it also
          pertains to the decree to procure it; for he who hinders the event by
          a removal of some circumstance ought to cause it by supplying the
          circumstances. XIV. (6) On the supposition of such a knowledge, a
          reason for predestination can be assigned out of God besides his
          purpose and good pleasure (eudokian) because the foreseen consent of
          the will of Jacob placed in such circumstances would be at least the
          condition without which God could not predestine to salvation Jacob
          rather than Esau. But no reason for that election can be derived from
          Paul except the purpose (eudokian) of God: “For the children being not
          yet born, neither having done any good or evil” not on account of a
          foreseen good use of free will through middle knowledge, but “that the
          purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of
          him that calleth; it was said, the elder shall serve the younger”
          (Rom. 9:11, 12*). Nor should it be said that this condition is
          assigned on the part of God who has the knowledge, not of men; for
          although it is God who foreknows, yet the object which he foreknows is
          maintained to be the good use of free will foreseen before the decree,
          so that the reason of the decree is put not in God, but in man. Thus
          grace might with greater propriety be called the servant of the human
          inclination than the mistress, and the companion than the cause,
          making God depend upon man rather than man upon God. Sources of
          explanation. XV. 1S. 23:11, 12 cannot favor this middle knowledge
          because it is not so much a prediction of future things which were
          still in futurition (as a revelation of things which then existed
          although secret, viz., of the plans discussed among the men of Keilah
          about the delivery of David if he stayed there). For when David was
          doubtful concerning the design of Saul and the intention of the men of
          Keilah towards himself, and therefore inquired of the Lord whether
          Saul was about to descend against the men of Keilah, and they would
          deliver him up into the hands of Saul (if he stayed among them), God
          answered that David should withdraw himself and fly from their fury,
          and that Saul would descend and the men of Keilah would deliver him up
          (if he remained there), because in truth both Saul girded himself for
          the journey, and the men of Keilah were even then secretly plotting to
          deliver David up to him. “For they will deliver thee up,” i.e., they
          have the will to do so, as the interlinear gloss has it. So the words
          “to descend” and “to deliver up” do not refer to the act itself as
          hypothetically future, but (as often elsewhere) they are put for the
          purpose and intention, i.e., to have in the mind to do this (as Acts
          12:6 and 16:27). XVI. The words of Christ (“If the mighty works which
          were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have
          repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes,” Mt. 11:21*) are not to be
          strained to the letter, as if they referred to something which on a
          certain condition would be determinately future. For it is a
          hyperbolical and proverbial kind of speech where Christ (by a
          comparison odious to the Jews) wishes to exaggerate the contumacy and
          rebellion of their cities (rendered illustrious by his miracles),
          which, as the searcher of hearts (kardiognostés), he knew to be
          greater and more obstinate than the wickedness of the inhabitants of
          Tyre and Sidon. So Christ does not speak of the foreknowledge of any
          future conditional things, but wishes by using a hyperbole to upbraid
          the Jews for ingratitude and impenitence greater than that of the
          Tyrians and Sidonians; as if a teacher (addressing a slow and dull
          scholar) should say, if I had taught an ass as long, he would have
          known it; or of an inexorable judge, if I had beaten rocks and stones
          as long, I could have broken them; we do not mean either that rocks
          could be softened or an ass taught, but only that the slowness of the
          scholar and the hardness of the judge are extreme. In the Same manner,
          Christ says, “If these should hold their peace, the stones would cry
          out” (Lk. 19:40); not as if the stones could cry out, but to show that
          his person, doctrine and works were so clear and indubitable that they
          could no longer be concealed. There is a similar passage in Ezk. 3:6:
          “Had I sent thee to a people of a strange speech, they would have
          hearkened unto thee.” XVII. In 2 S. 12:8, the prophet enumerates the
          blessings of God towards ungrateful David, to which he would have
          added greater if David had continued in obedience (not from any
          conditional decree or from middle knowledge, but according to the
          promise made to piety). So in Ps. 81:14, 15, we have a conditional
          promise with a reproof of ingratitude, but we read nothing concerning
          the foreknowledge of a future conditional thing before the decree. In
          the same manner are to be understood the words of Elisha to Joash:
          “Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
          smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it” (2 K. 13:19); not that he
          knew this by middle knowledge, but because the prophet would from his
          own wish infer that from a divine revelation made indefinitely. XVIII.
          It is one thing for God to foresee or know the connection of one thing
          with another (for example, of sin with death and of righteousness with
          life); another to know connection as future in such a subject placed
          in this or that state. This requires some decree to determine what
          ought to be done concerning that subject; but the former can be
          founded on possibility alone and the mutual habitude of things. XIX.
          It is one thing for God to know all the connections of all things as
          necessary and the causes of things about to happen through them
          antecedently to the decree; another to know the contingent connections
          of events and of all possibly future things. If the former were
          granted, it would favor the middle knowledge, but it is false that God
          knows all the connections of all things as necessary and about to
          produce infallibly the event of things (especially in free acts)
          antecedently to the decree upon which all the futurition of things
          depends. But the latter, which we allow, does not countenance the
          middle knowledge because contingent connections of this kind belong
          only to natural knowledge, when considered antecedently to the decree,
          determining the certain futurition of their connections or means. XX.
          What is conceived to be determinately from God can also be pronounced
          to be determinately; but what is conceived only to be possibly can be
          pronounced to be only possibly. Now it is denied that the coexistence
          of a free act on hypothesis can be conceived to be determinately
          antecedently to the decree; it is granted that it may be possibly. So
          it is true that Peter would possibly sin if placed in a given order of
          things antecedently to the decree; but not determinately so as to make
          it true that Peter would actually and in fact sin if placed in such an
          order of things. This could not be certain unless from a permissive
          decree of God. XXI. Necessity and contingency have a different
          relation in simple terms from what they have in complex. In the first
          manner, being is divided into necessary and contingent, nor can they
          belong to the same; but in the second (inasmuch as they arise from the
          diverse habitude of causes to their effects) so far coincide that what
          in respect to the first cause is necessary with respect to the second
          can be contingent, the first cause so disposing it. This not only
          insures the existence of the thing, but in its own manner that it is a
          necessary thing necessarily, a contingent contingently. Yet that
          necessity as to the first cause does not take away the liberty of free
          will because it is not a necessity of coaction, but of consequence or
          infallibility which best conspires with liberty. XXII. Although God
          antecedently to his decree can know of the various means which can be
          used to move the will (that this or that can have a greater influence
          than others if employed), yet he cannot know that they will actually
          persuade antecedently to the will of giving those means and of moving
          the will efficaciously to produce the effect. Nor has the illustration
          drawn from fire any force, which God knows to be possessed of the
          property of making warm antecedently to the will of creating fire
          which will actually warm. For the reason of natural agents determined
          in their nature to one thing is different from that of free agents,
          which can be inclined to one or the other of opposite things. XXIII.
          The cause of the existence of things differs from the cause of their
          futurition. Second causes can concur with God to cause the existence
          of a certain thing because they exist and are active at the same time
          with God. But no second cause can concur with him to cause the
          futurition of things because futurition was made from eternity, while
          all second causes are only in time. Hence it is evident that the
          futurition of things depends upon nothing but the decree of God, and
          therefore can be foreknown only from the decree.

        <p>
          FOURTEENTH QUESTION: THE WILL OF GOD Does God will some things
          necessarily and others freely? We affirm I. The will of God (whose
          object is only the good, as that of the intellect is the true)
          necessarily follows his understanding. But because good is either
          uncreated and infinite or finite and created, a twofold object can be
          assigned to the will: a primary (viz., God) as the infinite good; but
          the secondary (all created things out of God, holding the relation of
          finite good which also out of himself God wills, but not in the same
          manner); himself, indeed, necessarily by complacency, but all other
          things freely by decree— hence the proposed question arises. Statement
          of the question. II. On the state of the question observe: (1) that
          necessity is twofold; one absolute, which simply and by itself and its
          own nature cannot be otherwise, as that God is good, just, etc. The
          other hypothetical, which is not so of itself and simply such but that
          it could be otherwise, but yet on the positing of something it
          necessarily follows and could not be otherwise; as for example, if you
          posit that God predestinated Jacob to salvation, it is necessary that
          Jacob should be saved, namely on the hypothesis of the decree.
          Otherwise he could have been not predestinated and not saved. When,
          therefore, the question is asked whether God wills some things
          necessarily, but others freely I refer not only to the hypothetical
          necessity (for thus those things which God wills freely, the decree
          being posited, he no more not wills), but concerning the absolute
          necessity. III. Free is said either with reference to spontaneity or
          indifference: the former what is done spontaneously and without
          compulsion, but the latter what is so disposed that it can be done and
          not be done. When it is asked whether God wills some things freely,
          not only the will of spontaneity is meant (for so the things which God
          wills most necessarily, he wills also freely, i.e., without coaction),
          but properly the liberty of indifference (i.e., whether he so wills
          that he could have nilled them). IV. Third, there are two kinds of
          things willed: one principal, which holds relation of the ultimate
          end; another secondary, which has the relation of the means. In the
          former, the will is carried necessarily so that it cannot but be
          carried to it; in the latter, it is carried freely and by election
          having a necessary and inseparable connection with the ultimate end
          (so that without it the end cannot be). For then by the same necessity
          by which we will the ultimate end, we will also that means (as he who
          wills the preservation of life, wills also the taking of food, without
          which life cannot be preserved). V. This being established, I say that
          God wills himself necessarily, not only by a hypothetical necessity
          but also by an absolute necessity. He is the ultimate end and the
          highest good which he cannot but will and love, not only as to
          specification (that he can will and love nothing contrary), but also
          as to exercise (that he never ceases from willing and loving himself),
          for he cannot nill his own glory or deny himself. But other things he
          wills freely because, since no created thing is necessary with respect
          to God but contingent (as he could do without them), so he wills all
          things as that he could not will them (i.e., by the liberty not only
          of spontaneity, but also of indifference). VI. This liberty of the
          divine will about created things must be understood absolutely and a
          priori and with respect to the things considered in themselves not
          hypothetically and a posteriori with respect to the decrees
          themselves. For in this sense God wills created things necessarily
          from hypothesis because (supposing he has once willed) he can no more
          will them on account of the immutability of his will; but speaking
          absolutely he wills them freely because he is influenced to will them
          at first by no necessity, but by mere liberty and could abstain from
          their production. VII. But this indifference of the divine will, so
          far from lowering the majesty of God, is the greatest proof of his
          perfection who, as an independent being, needs nothing out of himself
          (which is the greatest testimony to the imperfection of creatures).
          VIII. God wills all created things not to make himself perfect (as if
          he stood in need of them), but to communicate himself and to manifest
          his goodness and glory in them. Hence because he could be without them
          without any detriment to his happiness, he is said to will them
          freely. For since God wills all things out of himself inasmuch as they
          are ordained for his goodness as the end (and the goodness of God is
          perfect without others so that no perfection can accrue to him from
          others), it follows that God wills other things from himself, not to
          be absolutely necessary, but only from supposition (ex hypothesi) (as
          Thomas Aquinas properly remarks, ST, I-I, Q. 19, Art. 3, pp. 104—5).
          IX. Although God wills all things on account of his goodness and wills
          his goodness necessarily, yet it does not follow that he wills by the
          same necessity all other things which he wills out of himself. For he
          wills these things not to increase, but to diffuse his goodness and so
          that he might be without them. X. There is not the same reason of the
          understanding in knowing and of the will in willing because the
          understanding has the things in itself and beholds them as they are in
          itself. However the will is carried towards them when in understanding
          they are understood after the manner of a recipient; but in willing,
          otherwise; the understanding beholds things as existing (at least in
          itself) and therefore cannot but understand them; whereas the will
          makes them, and besides is freely occupied about them. As therefore
          all things as they are in God have a certain necessity, but in
          themselves contingency; therefore whatever God knows, he knows from
          necessity; but not equally whatever he wills does he will from
          necessity. XI. Although every volition in God is eternal, yet they
          ought not immediately to be called absolutely necessary. For what is
          necessary originally on the part of the principle can be free
          terminatively and on the part of the object. XII. Here belongs the
          question concerning the will of God about sin (i.e., how God can be
          said to will sin), but this will come up more fitly under the head of
          providence.

        <p>
          FIFTEENTH QUESTION May the will be properly distinguished into the
          will of decree and of precept, good purpose (eudokias) and good
          pleasure (euarestias), signified, secret and revealed? We affirm I.
          Although the will in God is only one and most simple, by which he
          comprehends all things by a single and most simple act so that he sees
          and understands all things at one glance, yet because it is occupied
          differently about various objects, it thus happens that in our manner
          of conception, it may be apprehended as manifold (not in itself and
          intrinsically on the part of the act of willing, but extrinsically and
          objectively on the part of the things willed). II. Hence have arisen
          various distinctions of the will of God. The first and principal
          distinction is that of the decretive and preceptive will. The former
          means that which God wills to do or permit himself; the latter what he
          wills that we should do. The former relates to the futurition and the
          event of things and is the rule of God’s external acts; the latter is
          concerned with precepts and promises and is the rule of our action.
          The former cannot be resisted and is always fulfilled: “Who hath
          resisted his will?” (Rom. 9:19). The latter is often violated by men:
          “How often would I have gathered you together, and ye would not” (Mt.
          23:37). III. As there are various passages of Scripture in which the
          will of God is taken either for the decree (Rom. 9:19; Eph. 1:11) or
          for the precept (Ps. 143:10; Rom. 12:2), so there are also some in
          which both wills of God are signified at the same time (i.e., Jn.
          6:38, where Christ says, “I came down to do the will of him that sent
          me” [i.e., to fulfil the things decreed by God and to obey the command
          of the Father]). And when we say in the Lord’s Prayer, “Thy will be
          done,” we ask that our lives may correspond to his precepts and his
          decrees be fulfilled. IV. Although the precept falls also under the
          decree as to proposition, still it does not fall as to execution. Thus
          they may be properly distinguished from each other, so as the will of
          decree may be that which determines the event of things, but the will
          of precept that which prescribes to man his duty. Therefore God can
          (without a contradiction) will as to precept what he does not will as
          to decree inasmuch as he wills to prescribe something to man, but does
          not will to effect it (as he willed Pharaoh to release the people, but
          yet nilled their actual release). V. Hence it happens that although
          these wills may be conceived by us as diverse (owing to the diversity
          of the objects), yet they are not contrary. For as was just said, they
          are not occupied about the same thing. Undoubtedly if God by the power
          of his decree would impel men to do what he has by his law prohibited,
          or if when attempting to obey the law he would by an Opposite
          impediment recall them from obedience, he would will repugnancies and
          be himself opposed to his own will. But the decree of God does not
          contend with his command when he prescribes to man his bounden duty
          (for the performance of which, however, he does not will to give the
          strength because he wills indeed the thing as to the proposition of
          duty, but yet not as to the execution of the event). VI. The
          preceptive will has a twofold object: sometimes affirmative (with
          respect to which it can also be called affirmative when the effecting
          of the thing is prescribed); sometimes negative (with respect to which
          it can itself also be called negative consisting in the prohibition of
          a thing). So the decretive will may have affirmative objects with
          respect to which it is called effectual and affirmative as well with
          respect to the end as to the principle; but others negative with
          respect to which the will ceasing can be called also negative (if not
          as to the principle at least as to the end) and then may be called
          permissive by which he determines not to hinder the creature from
          sinning. For although that volition may be positive as to the
          principle (inasmuch as he wills not to hinder), yet it is properly
          called negative as to the end (which is a non-hindering). VII. The
          effective will cannot stand together with the negative preceptive. For
          God can never by himself will to effect what his law forbids as evil.
          Rather it best agrees with the affirmative preceptive will; for the
          same one who prescribes faith decrees to give it to the elect. The
          affirmative preceptive will can stand together with the negative
          decretive will, so that God may prescribe to the creature what
          nevertheless he does not will to effect in the creature. So he enjoins
          upon all the keeping of the law which, however, he does not effect in
          them. He enjoins faith in Christ upon the called which nevertheless he
          has decreed to withhold from many. VIII. Besides this distinction of
          will, there is another by which it is distributed into the will of
          eudokias and euarestias (often used by theologians). The will eudokias
          answers to the decretive; euarestias to the preceptive. This
          distinction has the warrant of Scripture, which often calls the former
          eudokian and the latter euarestian. Thus Christ (speaking of the
          decretive will) says with respect to those things by which he either
          conceals or reveals his mysteries: “even so, Father, for so it seemed
          good (eudokia) in thy sight” (Mt. 11:26); and Paul says “God
          predestinated us according to the good pleasure (eudokian) of his
          will” (Eph. 1:5). In Eph. 1:9, mention is made of good pleasure
          (eudokias) in this sense. The euarestian is frequently referred to the
          preceptive will, which is called both that of approbation and that of
          complacency (as in Rom. 12:2 where the will of God to which we ought
          to conform is called good and acceptable [euarestos]; cf. “proving
          what is acceptable [euareston] unto the Lord,” Eph. 5:10); “for this
          is acceptable [euareston] unto the Lord,” Col. 3:20). In this sense,
          euarestia indicates the preceptive and approving will by which God
          declares what is pleasing to himself and what he wills to be done by
          men; but eudokia indicates the decretive will by which God testifies
          his good pleasure about the things which he has determined to perform.
          IX. Therefore it is not so to be understood as if that which depends
          upon the eudokia of God may not also be acceptable (euareston) to him.
          For whatever God has decreed to be done is truly grateful to him in
          that respect, nor can he be said to will to perform what it would not
          please him to perform. But it can be received only in this way by
          which it is made to consist in the will of decree and precept—that by
          the will eudokias may be designated precisely that will by which God
          decrees to do or permit something and concerning which you can for the
          most part render no other reason than because it so pleased God; but
          by the will euarestias may be designated that by which he wills to
          propose to the creature his duty as a thing pleasing to him and in
          which he takes complacency. X. We may sometimes interchange the
          eudokian for the euarestia, when it is spoken of those things with
          which God is pleased because there is in them some quality or
          condition which agrees with the nature of God and therefore
          conciliates his favor; as the Father says of Christ, “In whom I am
          well pleased” (en ho eudokesa, Mt. 3:17), i.e., most ardently love.
          Yet even this may with propriety be referred to the will of good
          pleasure which Christ fulfilled most perfectly by satisfying his
          justice. Still here it is taken strictly for the decree, no reason for
          which is to be sought except the good pleasure of God. XI. Euarestia
          contradistinguished from eudokian in this connection means nothing
          else than the mere complacency by which God approves anything as just
          and holy and delights in it (and besides wills to prescribe it to the
          creature as his most just duty). Hence it does not properly include
          any decree or volition in God, but implies only the agreement of the
          thing with the nature of God (according to which he cannot but love
          what is agreeable to his holiness). For the approbation of anything is
          not forthwith his volition, nor if I approve a thing, should I
          therefore immediately will it. So that it is less properly called the
          will of God. XII. Although to the will euarestias belong also the
          promises of giving salvation to believers (which are proposed with the
          gospel precept), it does not follow that it ought to connote any
          condition, decree or volition (properly so called) concerning the
          giving of salvation to all. For such a decree cannot consist with the
          decree of reprobation, or with the wisdom of God, to which it is
          repugnant to will anything under an impossible condition (and which
          God, who alone can give it, has himself decreed to withhold from the
          creature). But from this we can only gather that there is an
          inseparable connection between faith and salvation, constituted by God
          himself so that no one can obtain salvation who does not possess
          faith, and no one can have faith without most certainly obtaining
          salvation. Thus the promises added to the precepts signify only what
          God will grant to believers and penitents, not what he wills to grant
          to all those to whom the precept is proposed. Will of sign and
          pleasure. XIII. The third distinction is into the will as signi and
          beneplaciti, introduced at first by Hugo St. Victor, taken from him by
          Lombard (Sententiarum 1, Dist. 45 [PL 192/2.641—44]), frequently used
          by all the Scholastics, and especially by Thomas Aquinas (ST, I, Q.
          19, Art. 11, 12, pp. 111-13) and, when properly explained, retained by
          our theologians. XIV. The Scholastics call that the beneplacit will
          which remains concealed previously in God and is left to his most free
          power and becomes at length known by some oracle or by the event. But
          the will of sign is that which by some sign (for instance by a precept
          or promise) is made known to us and which indicates some effect out of
          God as the sign of his will. Hence the Scholastics usually reckoned
          five signs by which the will of God is manifested: precept,
          prohibition, counsel, permission, operation. These were comprehended
          in this versicle: Praecipit et prohibet, permittit, consulit, implet.
          But this is false: (1) because there are more such signs, for instance
          promises and threatenings, prophecies and narrations; (2) operation is
          not a sign of will, but its effect belonging to the beneplacit will;
          (3) permission does not fall under the signified, but under the
          beneplacit will; (4) counsel may be either referred to the beneplacit
          or included in the precept. XV. With more propriety, therefore, the
          beneplacit will is made by us to answer to the decretive (which is
          nothing else than the decree of the good purpose of God about future
          external things); the will of sign is made by us to answer to the
          preceptive and approving (which prescribes to man his duty and
          indicates what is acceptable to God). XVI. It is called the signified
          will, not because it signifies what God wills to do about man or
          concerning man (for in this sense it would not differ from the
          beneplacit will), but because it signifies what God wills to enjoin
          upon man as pleasing to himself and his bounden duty. Hence that will
          may well be said to fall under the decree and good pleasure as to the
          precept of the thing, not as to the thing of the precept because God
          prescribes nothing in time which he has not decreed from eternity to
          prescribe. XVII. When the will of pleasure is contradistinguished from
          the signified will, the word “beneplacit” is not taken widely to
          denote the simple complacency and approbation of the thing or the
          decree of its injunction. In this sense, the will of sign can also be
          called the will of beneplacit because it is occupied about things
          approved by God and things which he decrees to enjoin upon the
          creature. But it is taken strictly to denote the placitum or decree of
          God concerning the effecting or permitting of a certain thing, just as
          the decrees of courts are called Placita (“decisions”). XVIII. There
          cannot be contrariety between these two wills because they do not will
          and nill the same thing in the same manner and respect. The will of
          purpose is the will of event and execution. The signified will is the
          will of duty and of the obligation to it. Thus God willed the
          immolation of Isaac by a will of sign as to the preception (i.e., he
          prescribed it to Abraham as a test of his obedience), but he nilled it
          by a beneplacit will as to the event itself because he had decreed to
          prohibit that slaughter. Now although these two acts of the divine
          will are diverse (“I will to command Abraham to slay his son” and “I
          do not will that immolation”), yet they are not contrary, for both
          were true—that God both decreed to enjoin this upon Abraham and
          equally decreed to hinder the effecting of it. Hence God without
          contrariety willed Isaac to be offered up and not to be offered up. He
          willed it as to the precept, but nilled it as to the effect. The whole
          will of God about this affair was not either only to command Abraham
          to make that sacrifice or to hinder it, but ought to embrace those two
          diverse acts (the former of which is affirmative, occupied with the
          injunction of the thing; and the latter negative, respecting the
          hindrance of it). Nor does it follow from this that man is ordered to
          believe what is false. For we are ordered to believe what is revealed
          just because it is revealed. However the event is not already revealed
          by a command of this kind, but only the duty and the obligation to it.
          XIX. Although God may be said to will the salvation of all by the will
          of sign and to nill it by the beneplacit will, yet there is no
          contradiction here. Besides the fact that the universal proposition is
          to be understood not so much of the singulars of the genera as of the
          genera of the singulars, the former will relates to the mere
          approbation of God and the command of duty, while the latter is
          concerned with its futurition and fulfillment. The former denotes what
          is pleasing to God and what he has determined to enjoin upon man for
          the obtainment of salvation, but the latter what God himself has
          decreed to do. But these two are not at variance: to will to call to
          faith and salvation, and yet to nill to give that faith and salvation;
          to will (i.e., to command man to believe) and to nill (i.e., to decree
          not to give him faith in order that he may believe). XX. The will of
          sign which is set forth as extrinsic ought to correspond with some
          internal will in God that it may not be false and deceptive; but that
          internal will is not the decree concerning the gift of salvation to
          this or that one, but the decree concerning the command of faith and
          promise of salvation if the man does believe (which is founded both
          upon the connection established by God between faith and salvation and
          the internal disposition of God by which, as he loves himself, he
          cannot but love his image wherever he sees it shining and is so much
          pleased with the faith and repentance of the creature as to grant it
          salvation). XXI. The promised salvation set forth by the will of sign
          does not indeed properly and directly fall under the precept because
          in their formal nature promise and precept differ. The former
          indicates a blessing, the latter a duty. However reductively and
          secondarily it can belong to it inasmuch as it is added to the precept
          by way of stimulus as means and motive to excite the performance of
          that for which the precept is given. And although it is necessary that
          the promise should have some foundation as to the certainty of the
          event (in order to influence man), that must not be sought from the
          decree of God about particular persons (of bestowing salvation upon
          all which cannot consist with the decree of reprobation), but from his
          decree about the things themselves (i.e., from the ordination and
          inseparable connection established by God between faith and salvation
          as between the means and the end). Thus it happens that salvation is
          most surely in the gospel promised to all believers because so close
          is the connection between faith and salvation from the good pleasure
          of God that no one can have the former without being also possessed of
          the latter. XXII. To that external word which is a sign (for example,
          every believer in Christ shall be saved) some internal word or thing
          signified ought to answer (viz., the will of God to connect
          inseparably faith in Christ with salvation and to propose to man such
          an order and way of salvation). But it cannot be the conditional will
          to save each and every individual under that condition because God
          would testify that he wills what in reality he does not will towards
          those passed by (from whom he withholds the condition). XXIII.
          Although the will of sign signifies that God is merciful, it does not
          follow that he ought to be merciful with respect to each and every
          individual, but only with respect to those who are about to have the
          condition expressed by that will (viz., to believers), to whom alone
          (since they are no other than the elect) the mercy expressed by that
          will properly belongs. Besides, since that will of sign has never been
          universal with respect to each and every one (although universal and
          common with respect to all people and conditions), the mercy signified
          by it cannot be universal. XXIV. If God by this will had signified
          that he willed the salvation of all without exception, he would have
          signified that he willed what he least willed (since by passing over
          the greater part, he has not willed to give them Salvation). But when
          it signifies that he wills the salvation of all believers and
          penitents, it signifies that he wills that which he really wills and
          nothing is more true, nothing more sincere than such a declaration.
          The secret and revealed will. XXV. The fourth distinction of the will
          is into secret and revealed. The former is commonly applied to the
          decretive will, which for the most part lies concealed in God; but the
          latter to the preceptive will, which is revealed and manifested in the
          law and gospel. Its foundation springs from Dt. 29:29: “The secret
          things belong unto the Lord our God; but those things which are
          revealed belong unto us, and to our children, that we may do all the
          words of this law.” The former is called a profound and unfathomable
          abyss (Ps. 36:6; Rom. 11:33, 34); the latter is discovered to all, nor
          is it far from us (Dt. 30:14; Rom. 10:8). The former has for its
          object all those things which God wills either to effect or permit
          (and which he wills to do in particular concerning individuals and are
          therefore absolute and determined to one thing). The latter relates to
          those things which belong to our duty and are proposed conditionally.
          The former always takes place; the latter is often violated. XXVI. It
          is called a secret will, not because always concealed from us and
          never revealed (for frequently God in his word manifests to men
          certain secrets of his counsel and lays them bare by the event), but
          because they remain hidden in God (until he reveals them by some sign,
          as by a prophecy or by the event). XXVII. Although the secret will
          concerning our election remains concealed in God, it does not follow
          that we can have no certainty of salvation because although we cannot
          gain it a priori, yet we can a posteriori. XXVIII. Whatever Christ
          willed to be done in time by men (from duty according to the law and
          gospel), that he has also revealed in time; but not forthwith whatever
          he has decreed to be done by himself from good pleasure (which God for
          the most part keeps to himself and manifests to us only by the event,
          Acts 1:7; Mk. 13:32). XXIX. Although God is the best, it is not
          necessary that he should exercise a good will to all for salvation by
          an antecedent will because the exercise of his goodness depends upon
          his most wise will (which pities whom it wills and whom it wills
          hardens). Nor if he wills to pour out his goodness on the creature by
          the blessing of creation and of providence, ought he to exercise good
          will to it unto salvation.

          SIXTEENTH QUESTION May the will be properly distinguished into
          antecedent and consequent, efficacious and inefficacious, conditional
          and absolute? We deny I. Besides the previous distinctions of the
          divine will received by the orthodox, there are also others proposed
          by our adversaries. These are deservedly rejected because less proper
          and seeming to have in them something ulcerous (hypoulon ti). Whether
          the will may be properly distinguished into antecedent and consequent.
          II. Such is the distinction of the will into antecedent and consequent
          frequently met with among the Scholastics. John of Damascus appears to
          have introduced it first, saying that one will is leading
          (pro€goumenén), but the other is following (hepomenén) (Exposition of
          the Orthodox Faith 2.29 [NPNF2, 9:42; PG 94.968-69]). It was
          afterwards eagerly seized by the Scholastics and employed by the
          Novatorians, Arminians, Socinians and other patrons of universal grace
          to help their cause. In what sense it ts admitted by some. III. There
          are some even of our theologians who think it may be retained after
          the fathers, but yet in a most different sense from the Neopelagian
          (namely both with respect to the commands and with respect to the
          decrees). Indeed, as to the commands they wish the antecedent will to
          have place in precepts, but the consequent in promises and threats
          added to the precepts by way of sanction (and in the blessings or
          punishments following man’s obedience or rebellion). As to the
          decrees, they wish the antecedent will to have place with regard to
          order and our manner of conception, so that it is termed that which is
          conceived to go before (for example, the will to create man, which
          precedes the will to redeem him); but the consequent is that which is
          conceived to follow another act of the will. In what sense to be
          rejected. IV. But our men constantly reject it in the sense of the
          Scholastics and Neopelagians who understand by antecedent will the
          purpose of God concerning the saving of all men universally, but by
          consequent will the decree concerning the salvation of believers and
          the damnation of unbelievers. The former is so called because it
          precedes the act (whether good or bad) of the human will; the latter
          is so called because it is posterior to the human will and depends
          upon its good or bad acts. V. Thus the Arminians wish that to be the
          antecedent will by which God wills something to the rational creature
          before every or any act of that creature, but the consequent that by
          which he wills something to the rational creature after some act (or
          after many acts of the creature). So by the antecedent will God willed
          to establish the kingdom of Saul and by the consequent will he willed
          to hurl him from his kingdom; by the former he willed to gather the
          Jews together as a hen gathers her brood, but by the latter he willed
          to disperse them through all nations. The former can be resisted, but
          the latter can be resisted by no means (so Arminius, “Examination of a
          Treatise Concerning ... Predestination ... by William Perkins,” The
          Writings of James Arminius [1956], 3:281; Corvinus, Petri Molinaei
          novi anatomici [1622}). VI. This distinction is in many ways injurious
          to God: (1) because it attributes to him contrary wills (viz., that
          God wills the salvation of all and wills the salvation only of some);
          that from eternity he seriously willed the salvation of Judas and yet,
          at the same time and in the same moment, knew that Judas never would
          believe; and that he did not will to give faith to Judas by which he
          might infallibly have been converted; yea, would permit him to remain
          in his unbelief and to perish. Who would dare to attribute such wills
          to a man of sound mind, as to say that he willed seriously and
          ardently what he knew never would happen, and indeed would not happen
          because he nilled to effect it, on whom alone the effect depends? Nor
          can the examples adduced here by Arminius effect this. For example,
          the father who desires and seriously wills his son to obey him, but
          does not violently draw him to obedience; and the merchant who wills
          his merchandise to be saved, but driven by necessity throws it into
          the sea. Thus God (says he), forced by the wickedness of men, condemns
          those whom he had willed to save if obedient. Things altogether
          dissimilar are compared here. It is one thing to speak of men, who
          although very seriously wishing something, yet cannot obtain their
          desire (unless through the appropriate means, which are not in their
          hands, and they are therefore frequently disappointed in their hope
          and frustrated in their intention); but another thing to speak of God,
          who is never without the just and appropriate means for accomplishing
          what he intends. In order to make the example pertinent, it ought to
          be stated thus—can the father, who knows that his son will not be
          obedient (unless he furnishes him with such a mind and disposition and
          yet does not will it) be said to seriously will his son to obey him?
          Or can the merchant, who knows that his goods cannot be preserved
          (unless the storm is appeased by himself and yet does not will it) be
          said seriously to desire the safety of his goods? If such examples
          were brought forward, evidencing that a rational creature can
          seriously and ardently will that which he knows he never will do
          (although having the power to do it and when upon it alone the event
          certainly depends), the fraud would easily be detected, and that would
          be attributed to God by the adversaries which cannot be ascribed to
          creatures using right reason. VII. Second, this distinction cannot
          have place in God without ascribing to him not only folly and
          impotence (by making him intend seriously and desire with natural
          affection that which is not performed and cannot be performed through
          man because he himself does not will it); but also mutability because
          there can be no place for the consequent will until the antecedent is
          first rescinded. For how could God at the same time, by the same act
          of will, will to save all men and to damn the greater part of them?
          VIII. Third, the antecedent will is not so much a will as a velleity,
          an empty and void desire incapable of accomplishment which cannot
          apply to God (the most wise and powerful). For how can he be called
          the most perfect and happy who cannot carry out the design and object
          truly intended, on account of the intervention and obstacle of the
          creature determining itself otherwise independently. IX. Fourth, God
          in this way would be subjected to man since the consequent will is
          said to depend upon the determination of the human will so that no one
          is elected by God who does not first choose God by his faith and
          repentance. X. Fifth, it is repugnant to the gospel which constantly
          teaches that God wills to save not all simply, but only the elect and
          believers in Christ and that the means of salvation are not offered or
          conferred upon all, but only upon some. In fine, it overthrows the
          eternal election of God because it leaves it uncertain, founded not
          upon the good pleasure (eudokia) of God, but upon the human will (than
          which nothing is more uncertain and changeable). It makes it such as
          that no execution can answer to it (Le., makes it void and
          inefficacious). Sources of explanation. XI. In 1 S. 13:13, the
          antecedent will is not set forth by which he willed to establish the
          kingdom of Saul forever. For how could he have willed this which he
          knew never would happen and the contrary of which he had already
          decreed? But when it is said “now would the Lord have established thy
          kingdom forever,” it implies only that the sin and rebellion of Saul
          would be the cause of the speedy discontinuance and of the
          transference of his kingdom to another (which would not happen if he
          had remained in duty according to the promises made to piety). XII.
          This twofold will cannot be proved from Mt. 23:37: (1) because it is
          not said that God willed to scatter those whom he willed to gather
          together, but only that Christ willed to gather together those whom
          Jerusalem (i.e., the chiefs of the people) nilled to be gathered
          together, but notwithstanding their opposition Christ did not fail in
          gathering together those whom he willed. Hence Augustine says, “She
          indeed was unwilling that her sons should be gathered together by him,
          but notwithstanding her unwillingness he gathered together his sons
          whom he willed” (Enchiridion 24 [97] [FC 2:450; PL 40.277]).
          Therefore, Jerusalem is here to be distinguished from her sons as the
          words themselves prove (and the design of the chapter, in which from
          v. 13 to v. 37, he addresses the scribes and Pharisees and rebukes
          them because “they neither went into the kingdom of heaven themselves,
          nor suffered those that were entering, to go in’); (2) the will here
          alluded to is not the decretive, which is one only and simple, but the
          preceptive, which is referred to calling and is often repeated by the
          preaching of the word—“How often would I?” (and so Christ here speaks
          as the minister of circumcision). XIII. If God in the first world
          granted the space of 120 years to invite them to repentance, an
          antecedent will cannot be thence inferred (as if he had decreed to
          spare it) because it would be opposed to the eternal decree of sending
          a deluge upon it. But the preceptive will only is indicated which
          prescribed to it the duty of repentance so as to render it inexcusable
          on the supposition of its contumacy. XIV. In vain is it said that the
          distinction into antecedent and consequent will was invented to
          reconcile the various passages of Scripture which would otherwise seem
          contradictory (asystata) (as that he had promised to introduce the
          people into Canaan and yet he willed to destroy them in the desert
          [Ex. 32 and Num. 14]; that he wills to save all and yet to damn the
          many; to call many to the marriage whom nevertheless he determined to
          exclude from it). For there is a far more certain and truer method of
          reconciliation. The promise of introducing the people is not repugnant
          to the will of punishing them because it was made under a condition
          (Ex. 32:34) and was literally fulfilled, if not with respect to the
          individuals themselves who fell in the desert on account of their
          unbelief (Dt. 1:35; Heb. 4:6), yet with respect to the nation itself
          in general, which at length reached it. The will of saving all men
          does not overthrow the decree of reprobation of passing by many
          because it is neither the decretive will, but only the preceptive and
          approving will; nor the universal, which respects all and individuals,
          but only general, which is indiscriminately extended to any. So they
          can be called to the marriage by the preceptive will who nevertheless
          were excluded from it from eternity by the will of good pleasure.
          Effectual and ineffectual will. XV. The second distinction usually
          brought forward by the adversaries is that of effectual and
          ineffectual will, which is understood to mean that the effectual will
          corresponds with the decretive (and is so called because it is always
          fulfilled and cannot be resisted); but that the ineffectual will
          coincides with the preceptive (and is so termed because it often
          remains void on account of man’s rebellion). Both can be tolerated
          (although the locution is less fit and capable of being abused
          [eudiablétos]). If it is referred to the decretive will alone (as
          understood by the adversaries who maintain that there are in God
          velleities and fruitless desires in which he fails of this purpose and
          does not accomplish his intentions as the conditional decrees
          attributed to him), it cannot be admitted. Scripture testifies that
          the counsel of God is immutable and that his will cannot be resisted
          (Is. 46:10; Rom. 9:19). If it cannot be resisted, it must also
          accomplish what he intended. Second, the ineffectual will cannot be
          attributed to God without convicting him either of ignorance (as not
          knowing that the event will not take place) or of impotence (as not
          able to give effect to what he intended). Nor ought it to be said that
          this happens not from want of power, but from his good pleasure
          because he willed to use such a force as would infallibly carry the
          thing into effect; for that very circumstance would prove that God had
          not seriously willed it, for he who seriously intends anything uses
          all the means in his power to accomplish it. In fine, the same reasons
          which teach that there is no antecedent will prove there is no
          ineffectual will. XVI. Although every will of God is effectual because
          the event intended is always brought about, it ought not immediately
          to be efficient for efficiency is only in good things, but efficacy
          also in evil. XVII. The passages which attribute a desire or wish to
          God do not immediately prove any ineffectual will in him, but things
          spoken after the manner of men must be understood in a manner becoming
          to God (theoprepos), unless we wish to adopt the deliriums of the
          Anthropomorphites. If referred to the past, these passages mean
          nothing else than a serious disapprobation of committed sins with a
          strong rebuke to the ingratitude of men and a declaration of the
          benefits lost and the evils incurred by their sins. Thus the following
          passages are to be understood: “O that my people had hearkened unto
          me, and Israel had walked in my ways” (Ps. 81:13*); “O that thou hadst
          hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river” (Is.
          48:18). But if they relate to the future as “O that they were wise,
          that they would fear me and keep my commands, that it might be well
          with them” (Dt. 32:29), they imply only a serious command supported by
          promises and threatenings (by which he declares what he approves as
          honest and holy and the great delight he takes in those who obey him).
          XVIII. When God testifies that “he has no pleasure at all in the death
          of the sinner, but that he should return from his ways, and live”
          (Ezk. 18:23), this does not favor the inefficacious will or the feeble
          velleity of God because the word chpts (which occurs there) does not
          denote desire so much as delight and complacency. Thus God may be said
          not to delight in the punishment of the wicked inasmuch as it is the
          destruction of the creature, although he wills it as an exercise of
          his justice. So he is said to will the repentance of sinners
          approvingly and preceptively as a thing most pleasing to himself and
          expressed in his commands, although with respect to all of them he
          nills it decretively and effectively. The absolute and conditional
          will. XIX. The third distinction is in the absolute and conditional
          will. The former is that which depends upon nothing out of himself,
          especially an external condition; the latter is that which is
          suspended upon a condition out of God (for example, when God is
          conceived to will to save Judas if he believes). Although this is
          admitted by some less properly with respect to the preceptive will
          because promises and threatenings are proposed conditionally, yet if
          understood of the will of decree and good pleasure (as by the
          adversaries), it is deservedly rejected because it is unworthy of God
          as repugnant to his independence and wisdom and power (because it
          would remain doubtful and uncertain, viz., suspended on the mutable
          will of man and so ineffectual and frustrated, making God often to
          fail in his purpose). XX. Again the condition upon which God is
          conceived to will anything, will either be certainly future from the
          decree of God or certainly not future, nor even possible. If the
          former, it will no longer be conditional, but absolute (since God is
          supposed to will the condition not as conditional, because then there
          might be an infinite series, but absolutely). If the latter, God would
          be made to seriously intend something under a condition never to take
          place (and even impossible), which God himself (who alone can) does
          not will to grant. If this cannot be said of a wise man, it cannot be
          attributed to God without the greatest detriment to his most wise and
          powerful divine majesty. XXI. To avoid error in the meantime, the
          conditional will ought to be regarded in two ways: either a priori and
          antecedently, suspended upon a condition; or a posteriori and
          consequently, viz., whose execution depends upon the intervention of
          some condition in the creature. In the latter sense, the will less
          accurately can be called conditional because the decrees of God ordain
          with the end the means also for carrying it into execution. He who
          decrees us to salvation, decrees also faith and repentance as the
          means of obtaining it. But in the former sense (of which we here
          speak), it cannot be admitted because thus every good pleasure of God
          is absolute. XXII. It is one thing for the condition to be such on the
          part of the internal act or of the volition itself; another to be such
          on the part of the external object or of the thing willed. In the
          latter sense, we grant the things willed to be conditional, but not in
          the former (i.e., that the volition itself depends on a condition).
          For example, the salvation decreed to us by God can be called
          conditional because not granted without the intervention of faith.
          However the decree of salvation itself is absolute, as much with
          respect to the end (i.e., salvation) as to the means (which God has
          absolutely and unconditionally determined to bestow upon all his
          elect). XXIII. Thus this proposition that God wills the salvation of
          men, provided they believe, may have a twofold sense. It may signify
          either that God wills or determines salvation to come to us under the
          condition of faith (i.e., provided we believe), which is certainly
          true. But here our salvation only is conditional and not the will of
          God; yea, the will of God has determined the condition as much as the
          salvation. Or it may signify that from the condition of faith posited
          (or at least foreseen), there arises in God the will of conferring
          salvation upon men. In this sense, the proposition is false because
          nothing temporal can be the cause of that which is eternal. The will
          in God is not to be conceived of as suspended upon a condition
          antecedently, but as imposing the condition itself consequently as the
          means. He does not will to save men if they believe, but he wills them
          to believe in order to salvation (or he wills to save them through the
          faith which he has determined to give them). But we will treat of
          these things more at large when we come to the decrees.

          SEVENTEENTH QUESTION Can any cause be assigned for the will of God? We
          deny I. This question depends upon those preceding and is rendered
          necessary by the Pelagians who, in the matter of predestination, seek
          in the foresight of faith or of the good use of free will the causes
          of the divine will out of God. But with the orthodox, we think that no
          cause (properly so called) of the divine will is to be sought out of
          God. Statement of the question. II. On the state of the question,
          observe that it is one thing to seek for the reason of the will of
          God; another for the cause. The question here is not whether any
          reason of the will of God can be given; for the will of God (who made
          all things most wisely) cannot be without reason (alogos) (although
          for the most part that reason is concealed from us). Augustine says,
          “The cause of the will of God can be secret, it cannot be unjust”
          (Letter 149 [59], “To Paulinus” [FC 20:256; PL 33.639]). Here he takes
          cause for reason because elsewhere he maintains that it is absurd to
          seek for a cause of the will of God: “They uselessly seek the causes
          of the will of God, since his will is itself the cause of all things
          which are” (De Genesi contra Manichaeos 1.2 [PL 34.175]). Rather the
          question concerns a cause properly so called, moving the will of God
          to will this or that (which the adversaries maintain can be granted;
          we deny). III. As the will of God is the cause of all things, so it
          can have no cause of itself. It is as certain that there can be no
          cause of the will of God out of himself, as it is that nothing can be
          prior to him. For if his will has a cause, there is something which
          preceded it. Thus it would be the second cause, not the first; the
          thing ruled, not the rule. Hence Lombard says, “He that seeks a cause
          of the divine will, seeks something greater than it, while there is
          nothing greater” (Sententiarum 1, Dist. 45.4 [PL 192/2.642]). Besides,
          since the will of God is eternal, it can have no cause out of itself
          not eternal. IV. It is one thing to grant a cause on the part of the
          act of willing, another on the part of the thing willed. In the former
          sense, no cause of the will of God can be granted, but in the latter
          sense there can because among the things willed by him, some may be
          the causes of others. Thus Christ can be said to be the cause of the
          salvation decreed because it is given to us on account of Christ; but
          not of the decree of salvation because this flows from the sole good
          pleasure of God. The Scholastics mean this when they say that God
          wills this on account of that, but not on account of that, wills this;
          for example, that he wills salvation on account of Christ, but not on
          account of Christ wills salvation. Thus Christ, the meritorious cause
          of salvation, holds himself on the part of the salvation he acquired
          for us, but not on the part of the decree itself by which it is
          assigned to us. So there is an order and causality among the things
          willed by God (so that one may be for another), but not in the divine
          volition which recognizes no cause out of itself. V. Some of the
          properties of God are absolute, founded upon his absolute right and
          supreme dominion (such as his autocratic [autokratorike] potency and
          power); others are relative, founded upon right modified by virtues
          and requiring for their exercise some condition or quality in the
          object about which they ought to exert themselves (such as justice,
          which supposes sin, and mercy, which supposes misery). Thus we must
          reason concerning the acts of the will operating according to them.
          For when he operates from the absolute properties as supreme Lord and
          arbiter of all things (for example, when he wills to create or elect
          one in preference to another, not only is there no cause of his will
          besides his good pleasure, but neither any condition or quality in the
          object to move it; for potency indeed does not suppose its object but
          constitutes it; and since election is among equals, it sees nothing in
          one preferable to another, as mutually distinguishing them, and
          therefore acts from mere good pleasure). But when it acts from the
          relative properties (as from justice to punishing or from mercy to
          saving) although some quality is always supposed in the object (viz.,
          either sin or misery), it cannot have the place of a cause properly so
          called (because then either all would be damned because they are
          sinners, or all would be saved because they are miserable), but only
          the place of a quality in the object required for the exercise of
          these properties. If some cause or motive must be sought, it is not to
          be sought out of God, but only in his justice and mercy by which the
          will is incited to action. VI. Although among the effects of the
          divine will some have the relation of causes with respect to others
          (as God has willed that there should be an order both in nature and in
          grace by which they should be mutually connected), yet their power is
          not such that they can move the divine will to elicit its own act,
          since they are the effects of it as the first cause. No other cause
          can be assigned why the Lord has done this or that than this—because
          he so willed. If you ask further, why he so willed, you seek something
          greater and more sublime than the will of God (which cannot be found).
          Therefore human temerity ought to restrain itself and not to seek what
          is not, lest perchance it fail to find that which is.

          EIGHTEENTH QUESTION Is the will of God the primary rule of justice? We
          distinguish I. This question not only was agitated among the
          Scholastics (who differed about it), but is also mooted among the
          orthodox themselves. Some hold the affirmative—that all moral good and
          evil depend upon the free will of God and nothing is good and just
          unless God wills it. Others contend for the negative and recognize
          some essential goodness and justice in moral acts antecedently to the
          will of God, so that the things are not good and just because God
          wills them, but God wills them because they are good and just.
          Statement of the question. II. We follow the latter opinion with these
          distinctions. (1) The will can be called the primary rule of justice
          either intrinsically or extrinsically (i.e., either with respect to
          God or with respect to all things out of him). In the former sense,
          his will is regulated by his justice; in the latter sense, the justice
          in us is regulated by nothing else than his will. (2) As the law of
          God is either natural and indispensable (founded on his nature and
          holiness) or free and positive (depending only upon his will), so the
          goodness or the badness of things can be referred either to the
          natural or to the positive law. III. This being posited, I say that
          the will can be called and in reality is the first rule of justice
          extrinsically and in reference to us, but not intrinsically and in
          reference to God. This is so with respect to us because the fount of
          justice ought to be sought nowhere else than in the will of God which,
          as it is most perfectly just in itself, so it is the rule of all
          recititude and justice; for the first in every genus is the rule of
          all the rest. In this sense, theologians say that the will of God is
          the supreme rule of justice, and consequently whatever God wills is
          therefore just and good because he wills it. But with respect to God,
          the will cannot always be called the first rule of justice. It is a
          rule in those things which have only a free and positive goodness, but
          not in those which have essential goodness (i.e., in ceremonial, not
          in moral). For in the latter, God’s will is regulated, not indeed
          extrinsically but intrinsically (viz., by his most holy nature). Hence
          it has been well said that certain things are good because God wills
          them (such as the observance of ceremonies and all positive commands),
          but that God wills others because they are just and good per se and in
          their own nature (such as the love of God and our neighbor). If (which
          is impossible) God had not commanded them, they would not cease to be
          just and therefore to be attended by us. IV. The reasons are: (1) As
          there is granted in God natural justice and holiness antecedently to
          his free will, so the moral goodness and justice founded upon the
          justice and holiness of God and bearing his image, must be natural.
          And as God cannot deny himself or hate his own holiness, so he cannot
          but love his image and prescribe it to the creature as the most
          perfect rule of justice and holiness. V. (2) There is in God an
          eternal and indispensable right (antecedent to every free act of will)
          by which as Creator he has dominion over the creature. Thus the
          creature ought to depend upon God not only in relation to being as to
          conservation, but in relation to morals as to worship and obedience;
          and that obligation is such and so close that its contrary is absurd
          (asystaton) and cannot be maintained without repugnance. God can no
          more be conceived to absolve the creature from this duty than to deny
          himself. Therefore since there is such a right in God antecedently to
          his will, there must be some rule of justice independent of his will.
          VI. (3) If the will of God was the first rule of justice even
          intrinsically so that nothing would be good and just unless God wills
          it, it would follow that there would be no atheism, magic,
          Epicureanism, hatred and blasphemy of God and other crimes of like
          kind which he cannot command (and by it render them morally good as
          commands). Whatever can fall under the precept of God can also be made
          honest and just. Thus God could dispense with all the precepts of the
          decalogue and command the creature to believe that he is not good and
          holy, ought not to be adored, but rather ought to be regarded with
          hatred; yea, that he even does not exist—at which the mind revolts.
          Thus God, if he willed, might be the author and approver of man’s
          disobedience for he might command him not to obey his precepts or
          prohibitions; for there is supposed to be no obligation in man or
          right of obligation in God antecedently to the will of God. Thus there
          would be no essential vindicative justice in God or any necessity of
          satisfaction to be pressed against Socinus (which nevertheless they do
          who embrace this opinion). Sources of explanation. VII. God is not
          under any moral duty outwardly because he is a debtor to no one, and
          there is no cause out of him which can place him under obligation. Yet
          he can be under obligation inwardly because he is a debtor to himself
          and cannot deny himself. As the Son, in divine things, is obliged to
          work by the Father, and the Father is obliged to love the Son, so in
          external acts (supposing the creature to be produced), God cannot but
          command him and give just and holy precepts. VIII. The law is called
          the rule of all good and bad actions as to us and our knowledge
          because the relation of good and evil becomes known to us from no
          other source than the law. But with respect to God and his right of
          obliging or commanding, it exists antecedently to the will of God
          because founded on this very majesty and holiness. IX. It is absurd to
          say that God depends upon something out of himself, but not that he
          depends upon himself (provided this is understood in a manner becoming
          to God [theoprepos], i.e., that he wills nothing unless according to
          his own holiness and justice). X. God is not bound to the law which he
          imposes on man (viz., formally, by taking the law as a law), but he is
          not free and absolved from all the matter of the law, so that he can
          either command or himself do the opposite of it (for example, believe
          that he is not God and command others to believe so—which sounds
          horrible to pious ears). XI. Although the divine will is simply free
          outwardly, yet from the supposition of one free act it can be
          necessitated to another (as if he wills to promise absolutely, he must
          fulfill the promise; if he wills to speak or reveal himself, he must
          necessarily make a true revelation; if he wills to govern, he is bound
          to govern justly). So the divine will cannot be determined from itself
          to willing that something should be or not be, but can well be
          determined with respect to complexities to the rectitude of those
          things which are or which he wills to be. XII. Man sins immediately
          against the revealed law of God, but also mediately and consequently
          against God, the author of the law, and the supreme Lord who imposed
          it. Thus sin remains always as transgression (anomia) as much with
          respect to the revealed external law as to the eternal (which is based
          on the holiness of God).

        <p>
          NINTEENTH QUESTION: THE JUSTICE OF GOD Is vindictive justice natural
          to God? We affirm against the Socinians I. To the will of God belong
          the virtues which are usually ascribed to him not under the relation
          of habit after the manner of human virtues, but inasmuch as they
          denote that perfection which resides in habit and the promptness of
          acting (although otherwise they do not differ from the essence).
          However these can be referred to two principal ones, which embrace the
          others under them: justice and goodness. The former is that by which
          God is in himself holy and just and has the constant will of giving to
          each his due. The latter is that by which he is conceived as the
          supreme good and the giver of all good. Justice is either universal or
          particular. II. The word “justice” (to speak of it first) is generally
          used in two senses: either for the universal comprehension of all
          virtues (as injustice is taken for every kind of sin) and is called
          universal justice (justitia universalis) by which, as God is in
          himself perfectly holy and just, so in all his works he preserves an
          incorruptible rectitude and justice. To this belongs in a higher sense
          what the poet says of human justice: “In justice is all virtue found
          in sum” (En de dikaiosyné syllebdén pas’ aret’ esti, Theognis, Elegy
          and Iambus 146 [Loeb, 244—45]). To this pertain, in particular,
          benignity and beneficence, constancy and fidelity in fulfilling
          promises (which very frequently in Scripture come under the name of
          justice). Or justice is taken for particular justice, which gives to
          each his due, is occupied with the distribution of rewards or
          punishments and is called distributive (distributiva), although in
          reference to the rewards of the pious (as will be shown hereafter) it
          does not crown their merits, but its own gifts and “gives what is its
          own, rather than restores what is ours” (as the Concil. Araus. Cap.
          Xxii.+ expresses it). Hence it is ascribed to God not so much properly
          as analogically. As to commutative justice, which preserves an
          arithmetical proportion (being based upon an equality of what is given
          and received and through which authority may be transferred, neither
          of which can be said of God—for “who hath first given to him, and it
          shall be recompensed to him again?” Rom. 11:35), we (with the sounder
          Scholastics) think this should be removed from God. III. Again, divine
          justice can be considered either absolutely in itself (as nothing else
          than the rectitude and perfection of the divine nature; called by us
          universal justice and by others the justice of God; belonging to him
          as God) or relatively (with respect to its egress and exercise through
          the divine will according to the rule of his supreme right and eternal
          wisdom). It may be regarded as twofold: either in the rule and
          government of creatures (called Lordly justice, belonging to him as
          Lord and supreme arbiter of things who does with his own what he wills
          and directs all his actions in governing and administering created
          things according to the rule of his own rectitude and wisdom; for that
          which in the administration of affairs is to us a law, is in God his
          own right, conjoined with his perfectly wise and just will); or in
          judgments, and these either “premiative” (praemiantibus) (granting
          rewards) or vindictive (and this latter either for chastisement or for
          punishment) which is called justitia vindicatrix or punitive justice
          concerning which the proposed question treats. To understand this,
          certain things must be premised. Statement of the question. IV. The
          rational creature and his moral dependence upon God being supposed,
          the first egress of this justice is in the constitution of the penal
          law; not simply as a law (for this properly depends upon the justice
          of rule), but as penal. The second egress is in the infliction of
          punishment; but this again can be regarded either as to the thing and
          substance of punishment in general or as to the mode and circumstances
          attending it; either in time or degree or persons. Again, the right of
          God with regard to punishment is either supreme and rigorous (called
          accurate right, akribodikaion) or it is a right tempered by a certain
          moderation (epieikeia). As to the former, punishment is imposed not
          only on sin but also on the very person of the sinner. As to the
          latter, there is granted a manifold moderation in the exercise of
          justice either in time (by delay) or in persons (by transfer) or in
          degree (by mitigation). Hence arises a twofold right with regard to
          the infliction of punishment: one necessary and indispensable with
          respect to sin iteslf; the other free and positive with respect to the
          sinner. Justice demands necessarily that all sin should be punished,
          but does not equally demand that it should be punished in the very
          person sinning or at such a time and in such a degree. The Scholastics
          expressed this properly when they said that impersonally punishment is
          necessarily inflicted upon every sin, but not personally upon every
          sinner. V. Now although we hold the egress of justice to be necessary,
          yet we do not deny that God exercises it freely. This necessity is not
          exclusive of concomitant liberty, but only of antecedent indifference
          according to which we Say that on the hypothesis of the sinful
          creature God is inclined to inflict punishment freely indeed (i.e.,
          spontaneously and without coaction), but not indifferently (as if he
          might or might not punish at pleasure). VI. Hence it is evident in
          what sense this justice may be called natural; not as if it drew with
          it a physical necessity, but because it is founded in the very nature
          of God and even identified with it (although it cannot exert itself
          outwardly, unless by means of an act of the intellect and will, in the
          same way in which the other attributes, as goodness, wisdom, etc.,
          although natural, are not exercised except by means of the free will).
          VII. This justice can be regarded in three ways: as a dynameos or
          potentiality, in which sense it is the will of God itself turning away
          from and willing to punish sinners; or as an actuality (energeia)
          itself and the act of judgment or punishment by which it carries out
          its judgments towards sinners; or for its effect or the punishment
          inflicted by justice. Here we treat not the third signification, but
          the first and second, which are seen joined together in Ps. 119:137:
          “Righteous art thou, O Lord, and upright are thy judgments.” VIII. A
          question is agitated here with us by the Socinians concerning
          vindictive justice. The more easily to destroy the satisfaction of
          Christ, they deny that vindictive justice is natural to God, but is
          only the effect of his most free will (which can be and not be in the
          same way, as it was free to God to create the world and not to
          create). Socinus indeed confesses that such a justice belongs to God,
          which if he willed to use perpetually, it would be right to destroy
          all sinners without waiting for their repentance and thus to leave no
          sin unpunished (De Jesu Christo Servatore, Pt. 1.1 [1594], pp. 1-11).
          He concedes also that God willed to pardon sin save only upon
          repentance. He does not deny that God constituted the punishment of
          sin according to the rule of his right and wisdom, but denies that
          there is any attribute in God necessarily demanding a satisfaction for
          sin. If he punishes sin, this is the perfectly free effect of his will
          from which he might abstain. Thus Socinus: “Nor is there any justice
          in God obliging him to punish sin altogether, from which he cannot
          abstain. There is indeed in God perpetual justice, but this is nothing
          else than equity and rectitude” (Praelectionis theologicae 16 [1627],
          p. 87). And a little after: “That which is commonly called justice as
          opposed to mercy is not a quality of God, but only the effect of his
          will” (ibid., p. 88). Confirmations of this occur in Socinus, De Iesu
          Christo Servatore, Pt. I.1 (1594), pp. 1-11 and Pt. III.1, pp. 221-28;
          Ostorodt, Unterrichtung ... hauptpuncten der Christlichen Religion 31
          (1612), pp. 229-45; Crellius, “De Deo et Ejus Attributis,” 1.23 in
          Opera (1656), 4:45-64. IX. On the other hand, the orthodox maintain
          that this justice is an essential property of God and not merely the
          effect of his free will. Nevertheless it must be confessed that there
          is among them some diversity of opinion about the exercise of this
          justice—some holding it to be necessary, others that it is free and
          indifferent (viz., such that God can abstain from it if he will).
          Hence they think diversely concerning the necessity of the
          satisfaction. Some maintain that it is only hypothetical (viz., from
          the hypothesis of the divine will and decree) so that God could not
          remit sins without a satisfaction; not that his justice would demand
          this absolutely and necessarily, but because he so decreed (which
          opinion Twisse follows walking in the footsteps of some of our
          teachers who spoke with more freedom before Socinus arose). But others
          make it absolute, not only depending on the decree, but also taking
          its rise from the divine justice. But although both agree as to the
          hinge of the question against the Socinians (who deny the necessity of
          a satisfaction), still it is certain that the latter opinion (now the
          most commonly held) is far more efficacious to the strangling of that
          most pestilent heresy and more in accordance with the nature of God
          and the words of Scripture. Statement of the question. X. Therefore
          the question comes to this—whether the vindictive justice of God is so
          natural to him that he cannot but exercise it (the sinning creature
          being granted); and to leave sin unpunished would be repugnant to it;
          or whether it is so free in God that its exercise depends upon his
          will and good pleasure alone. They with whom we treat maintain the
          latter; we defend the former. Vindictive justice is proved from
          Scripture. XI. That vindictive justice is essential to God, these four
          arguments especially prove: (1) the voice of Scripture; (2) the
          dictates of conscience and the consent of nations; (3) the sanction of
          the law with the whole Levitical priesthood; (4) our redemption
          through the death of Christ. Scripture frequently ascribes this
          justice to God. First, in those places in which the praise of perfect
          holiness and justice is given to God by which he is said to utterly
          detest and turn away from sin: “Thou art a God that will by no means
          clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
          children” (Ex. 34:7); “Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil”
          (Hab. 1:13); “Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
          neither shall evil dwell with thee” (Ps. 5:4*); and frequently
          elsewhere. Hence we conclude, if the hatred of sin is necessary in
          God, justice is equally necessary because the hatred of sin is the
          constant will of punishing it, which cannot fail in him who is not
          destitute of power. In us indeed there can often be an abhorrence
          without punishment either from want of power or because vengeance does
          not belong to private persons, but to the rulers and magistrates. In
          God the case is different as he is furnished with both the highest
          power and authority. Therefore if he hates sin necessarily, he must
          necessarily punish it. Now that he does necessarily hate sin is
          manifest from his love of justice opposed to it. As he necessarily
          loves justice so that he cannot but love it, so he must necessarily
          from the nature of contraries abhor sin and abhorring, punish. For as
          he who loves a person or thing wishes well and, if he can, does well
          to it, so true hatred and abhorrence cannot exist without drawing
          after them the removal and destruction of the contrary. Otherwise if
          he cannot punish, he cannot hate; if he cannot hate, he can love it,
          which is absurd (asystaton). Nor, if he does not punish the sins of
          the elect, does it follow that he leaves them unavenged because he has
          punished them in Christ. XII. Second, in those places which speak of
          God as a just Judge: “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
          (Gen. 18:25); “Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? God forbid:
          for then how shall God judge the world?” (Rom 3:5*, 6); “The wrath of
          God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
          unrighteousness of men ... who know the judgment of God, that they
          which commit such things are worthy of death” (Rom. 1:18, 32); “It is
          a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that
          trouble you” (2 Thess. 1:6). For since the office of judge and ruler
          belongs naturally to God, the rectifying right (epanorthdotikon)
          concerning punishment which depends upon it must be essential; and so
          also avenging justice founded on that. From the sense of conscience
          and the consent of people. XIII. Second, the dictates of conscience
          and the consent of nations confirm the testimony of Scripture: the
          former when it places man before the tribunal of God and either
          accuses or excuses him in good or evil deeds (Rom 2:14, 15); the
          latter by which among all people (even the most savage) this
          persuasion has prevailed that God is the just Judge of crimes, and if
          he did not exercise this justice, he would not be God. Hence they
          feigned Dikén to be the daughter of Jupiter and held that she was set
          over human affairs to avenge injuries and inflict punishment upon
          those who transgressed against the gods. But whence that public voice
          of conscience convicting and striking terror into men? Whence those
          secret lashes by which they are tormented after a crime committed
          (even unknown to anyone) unless from the most firm persuasion of
          avenging justice (by which, as it is known to them that God has a
          vindictive eye [theon echein ekdikon omma], so they tremble and are
          terrified at his vengeance)? They prove this public consent, testified
          in various ways, especially by sacrifices (concerning which Pliny
          affirms that the whole world agreed in them), although discordant and
          unknown to itself. For since sacrifices were instituted for this end
          most especially, that by them the wrath of the deity might be averted,
          it is evident that this notion (prolépsin) was implanted in them—that
          the just God could not but be the avenger of crimes. And such deep
          roots has this notion struck in their minds that they were driven to
          the horrible wickedness of human sacrifices (anthropothysias) that
          (namely by a more excellent sacrifice) they might the more happily
          appease an angry deity. From the law. XIV. Third, the moral and
          ceremonial law itself establishes the same thing. Since the precepts
          of the former (as to a great part) are indispensable and founded upon
          the eternal and natural right of God, it is necessary that the penal
          sanction added to them should be of the same nature; also because (as
          has been shown before) there is a natural and necessary connection
          between sin and punishment, moral and physical evil, just as moral and
          physical good are mutually connected by an indissoluble bond. The same
          is true of the tendency of the ceremonial law since the whole
          apparatus of legal sacrifices were designed for no other purpose than
          to show the necessity of the expiation of sins in order to satisfy
          divine justice. Paul would not so often have insisted that these
          sacrifices could not take away the guilt of sin if it could be taken
          away without the necessity of justice by the mere will of God. For
          that which depends on the free will of God could be accomplished by
          the intervention of legal victims as well as by the blood of another.
          Therefore since it was impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats
          should take away sins (Heb. 10:3, 4), not only from the will of God,
          but also from the nature of the thing itself (because sin is so foul a
          thing that it cannot be wiped away by the blood of goats), it follows
          so to speak that the necessity of such sacrifices depended not on the
          mere will, but on the very essential justice of God. From the death of
          Christ. XV. Fourth, the death of Christ no less plainly demonstrates
          this. For if it was free and indifferent to God to punish or not to
          punish sin without compromising his justice so that no reason besides
          the mere will impelled God to send his Son into the world to die for
          us, what lawful reason can be devised to account for God’s willing to
          subject his most beloved and holy Son to an accursed and most cruel
          death? Will the supreme goodness and wisdom of God suffer us to
          believe that this was done gratuitously and without the highest
          necessity? Was God, who delights not in the death of the sinner,
          delighted in the death of his most innocent Son (if this depended
          absolutely on his mere pleasure and he was moved by no other reason to
          devote him to destruction)? Thus his offering himself for us was not a
          work of bare will, but of justice, which demanded this sacrifice for
          its own satisfaction. Hence he is said “to have been set forth by God
          to be a propitiation to declare his righteousness” (Rom. 3:25*) and
          “to have reconciled us to God through his blood” (Col. 1:20). Sources
          of explanation. XVI. It is not always lawful to dispense with one’s
          right. It is lawful indeed as to positive and free right, but not as
          to natural. It is lawful as to the private right of a creditor (which
          regards his own interest), not as to the public right of a ruler and
          judge (which regards the majesty of the laws and rectitude and the
          performance of duty). Thus a magistrate would err, if by a too great
          indulgence he would dispense with the right of punishment as this
          would give impunity to crimes. Now the penal right of which we speak
          is not a positive but a natural right, founded on the very holiness
          and justice of God. It springs from the essential dependence of the
          creature (subjecting it to its Creator) both as to obedience by reason
          of precepts and as to punishment by reason of their sanction. It is
          not the private right of a creditor; for although sins are sometimes
          compared to debts, yet they are also crimes which cannot remain
          unpunished without prejudice to the laws. Rather it is the public
          right of a ruler because God does not punish as the offended part, but
          as Judge and the supreme ruler of the world. XVII. Now although by not
          punishing sin God would do injury to no one out of himself, he would
          do it to his own justice, which ought not to be offended with
          impunity. He would do injury to the laws enacted by him, whose majesty
          ought to be unimpaired. He would do injury to the public good whose
          guard and administrator he is. He cannot deny himself or divest
          himself of the natural dominion which he exercises over creatures
          (which however if he would do, he would injure no one). XVIII.
          Although the effects of justice depend upon the free will of God, it
          does not follow that justice itself (as it is conceived in the first
          act) is equally a free act of will. Rather it is an essential property
          requiring in its exercise and egress the intervention of free will, to
          determine the mode, the time, the degree and the persons upon whom it
          wills to inflict punishment. XIX. It is one thing to punish sins from
          a physical necessity (such as exists in fire to burn); another to do
          so from moral and rational necessity. If God would punish sin
          according to the first, it is true that he would always act in the
          same manner, would punish equally and as much as he could. But this
          does not hold good of the moral necessity because the exercise of this
          attribute depends on the most wise will of God (which in the
          infliction of punishment can, according to moderation [epieikeian],
          use various modifications without detriment). This is true of justice
          which indeed necessarily demands that every sin should be punished,
          but not that every sinner should be punished immediately (or in this
          or that degree). XX. Although the effects of justice and mercy may be
          contrary on account of the diversity of their objects, still it does
          not follow that these attributes are contrary in themselves any more
          than the sun is contrary to itself when it melts wax and hardens clay.
          XXI. The justice and mercy of God differ in their exercise. Mercy
          indeed is perfectly free, able to exert or not exert itself without
          injury to anyone because it consists in a merely gratuitous act which
          it is not bound to exercise towards anyone. For whether he had pitied
          us or not, he would have done injury to no one because he owed this to
          no one. But the act of justice, although most free, is nevertheless
          necessary because due. It consists in rendering to each one his own.
          Although nothing is properly due to the creature (and properly
          speaking there is here no right of the creature in him), yet this is
          due to himself and to the preservation of the laws enacted by him.
          Thus if he would not do this, he would not be just. XXII. If there
          were no sinful or miserable creature, there would be no justice or
          mercy as to relative being and in the exercised act. Still there would
          always be justice as to absolute being and in the signified act (just
          as omnipotence was in God from eternity, although he had created
          nothing). XXIII. Although God can exercise some forbearance
          (epieikeian) as to the degree of punishment, it does not follow that
          he can equally take away all degrees of punishment because justice has
          a certain latitude of degrees beyond which, if it should go, it would
          not be justice; but although such a degree cannot be defined by us,
          yet God has it in the best manner defined and perfect. XXIV. The
          question here is not simply whether God can through his potency not
          punish sin; but whether he can through his justice, which is properly
          exercised about punishment (which, because repugnant to it, it is
          therefore well said that God cannot do). But although it is not a
          formal contradiction in terms to say that sin is not punished, yet it
          is in reality because this would imply that God does not hate sin and
          is able to love it. XXV. Although from his absolute right God is able
          to annihilate creatures, he cannot equally inflict upon an innocent
          person infernal and everlasting torment. For the former is an effect
          of supreme dominion, but the latter necessarily involves a relation
          (schesin) to justice (which does not allow the infliction of such
          torment upon the undeserving, as it cannot bear that the whole
          punishment should be taken away notwithstanding whatever demerit). See
          the “Disputation on the Necessity of Christ’s Satisfaction,” Parts I
          and II (Turretin, Opera 4:385—435).

          TWENTIETH QUESTION: THE GOODNESS, LOVE, GRACE AND MERcy OF GOD How do
          they differ from each other? I. As vindictive justice (treated of in
          the preceding question) and hatred, wrath and severity (pertaining to
          it) are concerned with the infliction of physical evil or of
          punishment, so goodness and the qualities contained under it (viz.,
          love, grace and mercy) are occupied with the communication of good,
          but diversely. II. The goodness of God is that by which he is
          conceived not only absolutely and in himself as supremely good and
          perfect (as it were) and the only good (autoagathon, Mk. 10:18)
          because he is such originally, perfectly and immutably; but also
          relatively and extrinsically as beneficent towards creatures (which is
          called benignity) because it is of the reason of good to be
          communicative of itself. What is the goodness of God? Ill. Although
          the goodness of God extends itself to all creatures, yet not equally,
          but exhibits the greatest diversity in the communication of good.
          Hence one is general (by which he follows all creatures, Ps. 36:6, 7);
          another special (which has respect to men, Acts 14:17) and another
          most special (relating to the elect and referred to in Ps. 73:1: “God
          is good to Israel”). If you seek the causes of this diversity, various
          ones can be assigned besides his will. (1) It was in accordance with
          his supreme dominion to show the most free power in diffusing his
          gifts (which in this inequality is exhibited in the highest manner).
          (2) The wisdom of God demanded that a certain order should exist in
          things (which is beheld in the connection of superiors and inferiors).
          (3) It conduced to the beauty of the universe (which creatures
          differing in form, actions and qualities render perfect). (4) It
          afforded a better demonstration of the inexhaustible fountain of
          divine goodness, since one creature could not receive the full
          communication of good (thus it should be imparted to more). What is
          the love of God? IV. From goodness flows love by which he communicates
          himself to the creature and (as it were) wills to unite himself with
          and do good to it, but in diverse ways and degrees according to the
          diversity of the objects. Hence is usually made a threefold
          distinction in the divine love: the first, that by which he follows
          creatures, called “love of the creature” (philoktisia); the second,
          that by which he embraces men, called “love of man” (philoanthropia);
          the third, which is specially exercised towards the elect and is
          called “the love of the elect” (eklektophilia). For in proportion as
          the creature is more perfect and more excellent, so also does it share
          in a greater effluence and outpouring (aporroén) of divine love. Hence
          although love considered affectively and on the part of the internal
          act is equal in God (because it does not admit of increase and
          diminution), yet regarded effectively (or on the part of the good
          which he wills to anyone) it is unequal because some effects of love
          are greater than others. It is threefold: benevolence, _beneficence,
          complacency. V. A threefold love of God is commonly held; or rather
          there are three degrees of one and the same love. First, there is the
          love of benevolence by which God willed good to the creature from
          eternity; second, the love of beneficence by which he does good to the
          creature in time according to his good will; third, the love of
          complacency by which he delights himself in the creature on account of
          the rays of his image seen in them. The two former precede every act
          of the creature; the latter follows (not as an effect its cause, but
          as a consequent its antecedent). By the love of benevolence, he loved
          us before we were; by the love of beneficence, he loves us as we are;
          and by the love of complacency, he loves us when we are (viz., renewed
          after his image). By the first, he elects us; by the second, he
          redeems and sanctifies us; but by the third, he gratuitously rewards
          us as holy and just. Jn. 3:16 refers to the first; Eph. 5:25 and Rev.
          1:5 to the second; Is. 62:3 and Heb. 11:6 to the third. VI. These four
          things in the highest manner commend the love of God towards us: (1)
          the majesty of the lover; (2) the poverty and unworthiness of the
          loved; (3) the worth of him in whom we are loved; (4) the multitude
          and excellence of the gifts which flow out from that love to us. (a)
          God loves us (who, constituted in the highest preeminence [hyperoche]
          and happiness, needs us not and is not bound to love us; indeed can
          most justly hate and destroy us if he so willed). (b) Men are beloved,
          not only as empty and weak creatures, but as sinners and guilty,
          rebellious servants, who so far from deserving it, are on the other
          hand most worthy of hatred and punishment (viz., enemies and covenant
          breakers). (c) He in whom they are beloved is Christ (Eph. 1:5, 6*),
          the delight of his heavenly Father and the “express image of his
          person” (Heb. 1:3*), than whom he could have given nothing more
          excellent, nothing dearer, even if he had given the whole universe.
          (d) The effects of his love are both many in number and great in value
          (viz., all the benefits by which salvation is begun in this life and
          perfected in the other and, what is the crown and sum of all
          blessings, the gift of God himself, who imparts himself to us as an
          object of fruition both in grace and in glory). Grace may be taken
          either affectively or effectively. VII. Grace succeeds love from which
          it is called chnvn (“gracious,” Ex. 34:6) by which God is conceived as
          willing to communicate himself to the creature from gratuitous love
          without any merit in the creature and notwithstanding its demerit. Now
          it is usual to understand it principally in two ways: either
          affectively (as they say), i.e., with respect to the “internal act” in
          God; or effectively, with regard to the effects which it produces
          outwardly in creatures. The former is towards us, and we stand
          objectively related to it; the latter is in us, and we stand
          subjectively related to it. In the former sense, it denotes the favor
          and benevolence of God (or his benignant and disposed will) bestowing
          all things liberally and gratuitously, not from our merit or desert.
          Again, this implies either the favor by which he loved and elected us
          to life from eternity (in which sense election is called “the election
          of grace” [Rom. 11:5], and we are said to be “predestinated to the
          praise of the glory of his grace” [Eph. 1:6], i.e., of his glorious
          grace) or that by which he regards us as graceful and accepted in the
          Son of his love (in which sense, most especially, the apostle often
          invokes “grace and peace” upon the believers to whom he writes, i.e.,
          both the favor and benevolence of God and its effects of every kind,
          which are signified by the word “peace,” according to the Hebrew
          idiom). In the same sense, mention is made of the grace of God in Rom.
          3:24, Lk. 1:30 and Tit. 3:7. VIII. In the latter sense, grace (taken
          effectively) indicates all the gifts (charismata) of the Holy Spirit
          gratuitously given to us by God: whether ordinary—of faith, hope and
          love—for each one’s salvation bestowed upon us in calling, conversion
          and sanctification (in which sense the word “grace” is used in 1 Cor.
          15:10 and Eph. 2:7, 8); or extraordinary and miraculous—for the common
          edification of the whole church (which are designated by the name of
          grace in 1 Cor. 12:4, 7, 8 and Eph. 4:7). The Scholastics were
          accustomed to calling the latter gifts by the name of grace
          gratuitously given (gratiae gratis datae), but the others by the name
          of grace making acceptable (gratiae gratum facientis). But this is
          false both because the ordinary gifts no less than the others are
          gratuitously given and because they cannot make us acceptable to God
          (since this is the effect of the sole grace and righteousness of
          Christ imputed to us). Therefore grace making acceptable with more
          propriety implies the benevolence of God towards us by which (not from
          our merit, but by his gratuitous love) he makes us acceptable in
          Christ. By grace gratuitously given are indicated all the gifts
          gratuitously conferred on us through the Holy Spirit. And this grace
          in reference to the variety of its acts is distinguished into
          operating or preventing (which moves the will to will) and cooperating
          and subsequent (which effects the performance of the volition). We
          will treat the latter in the proper place. IX. Again, grace is
          distributed into decretive and executive. The former denotes the
          eternal purpose of God concerning the electing of us before the
          foundations of the world were laid. The latter embraces the universal
          dispensation of that wonderful mystery (according to the variety of
          degrees and times) which exercised itself towards the elect in
          redemption and in calling, justification, sanctification and other
          salutary effects (which Paul alludes to in Eph. 1 and 2 Tim. 1:9, 10).
          How mercy ts to be ascribed to God. X. Mercy attends upon the grace of
          God. For as the latter exercises itself about man as a sinner
          (granting the pardon of his sin) so the former is exercised about man
          as miserable (relieving his misery). This is properly ascribed to God
          not as signifying grief arising from the misery of another (as it is
          in men), but as indicating a prompt and disposed will to succor the
          miserable without any anguish or perturbation of mind. XI. It does not
          spring from any external cause which usually excites this effect in
          men (as the tie of blood, of friendship, the company of misery,
          imbecility of age, sex, etc.). Rather it springs from his goodness
          alone (as he loves to communicate himself to the creature and as he
          does not refrain from succoring the miserable). Indeed it requires
          misery in the object, but only as holding the relation of condition
          and quality and not of a cause. So freely is it occupied about it,
          that it can exert or not exert itself without injury to anyone. Hence
          it is said “he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy” (Rom. 9:18).
          General and special. XII. Mercy is commonly considered as twofold: the
          one general by which God succors all creatures subjected to any misery
          (Ps. 104:27); the other special by which he has compassion on his own,
          electing out of the mass of fallen men certain ones to be saved
          through Christ (who are, therefore, called “vessels of mercy”). The
          former is temporal, occupied only with secular things (ta bidtika) and
          the good of this life; but the latter is saving and eternal, blessing
          us with the possession of salvation and of eternal life. XIII. The
          magnitude of his mercy may be collected from various sources: (1) with
          regard to the principle of pitying, (viz., God who, perfectly happy in
          himself and in want of nothing, yet moved by his good pleasure
          [eudokia] alone, condescended to have mercy upon us); (2) with regard
          to the objects (i.e., men upon whom he takes pity who not only
          deserved nothing, but are totally unworthy of this favor as sinners
          and enemies of God); (3) with regard to the mode and effects because
          he pardons our innumerable sins, removes eternal misery from us and
          bestows an infinite and eternal good (to wit, life and salvation); (4)
          with regard to duration because it is eternal (chmd ‘vlm, Is. 54:8;
          Hos. 2:19; Lam. 3:22; Lk. 1:55*). Hence it is to be opposed: (a) to
          the severity of the divine justice, in which sense it is said “to
          rejoice against judgment” (Jam. 2:13); (b) to the number and
          heinousness of sins (Mic. 7:18); “For where sin abounded, grace did
          much more abound” (Rom. 5:20), and “God hath concluded all in sin,
          that he might have mercy upon all” (Rom. 11:32*); (c) to the multitude
          of miseries and temptations because there is not one so great from
          which the supreme mercy of God, according to his inexpressible riches,
          does not free us (Ps. 103:8; Eph. 2:4, 5); (d) to the terror of death
          and the divine judgment because in that decisive day all the pious
          will obtain mercy (2 Tim. 1:18). XIV. Although the mercy of God is
          most ample and manifold with regard to the effects which are
          innumerable (in which sense he is called “abundantly merciful”
          [polyeleos, Ps. 51:1; 1 Pet. 1:3], oiktirmoi [i.e., commiseration and
          bowels of compassion are ascribed to God, Rom. 12:1)), yet it has its
          own objects and vessels into which it is poured out (viz., the elect
          and believers upon whom he determined to have mercy from eternity, who
          are distinguished from others whom he decreed to pass by and are
          therefore called “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction,” Rom. 9:22).
          It is an asylum for the penitent and pious, but not a refuge for the
          impenitent and impious. TWENTY-FIRST QUESTION: THE POWER OF GOD What
          is the omnipotence of God, and does it extend to those things which
          imply a contradiction? We deny I. The power of God (the executing
          principle of the divine operations) is nothing other than the divine
          essence itself productive outwardly (through which he is conceived as
          able to do whatsoever he wills or can will). Here (before all things)
          this comes to be distinguished from such a power or exousia as implies
          the right and authority to do anything, while the power of which we
          speak indicates in its conception only the force and faculty of
          acting. Statement of the question. II. It is not queried whether
          passive power (which is the principle of suffering from another) may
          be granted in God. Since this cannot be supposed without imperfection
          and change, it is evident that it should be removed far from him. Nor
          if the generation of the Son or the spiration of the Spirit is
          expressed in passive terms, does it immediately follow that there is
          in God passive power (since this denotes a mere relation [schesin] to
          the persons generating and spirating). But we treat only of the active
          power, the principle of acting on another. Ill. The question does not
          concern the actual and ordinate power according to which God actually
          and irresistibly does whatsoever he wills to do, yet in the time and
          manner which seems best to him: “Our God is in the heavens; he hath
          done whatsoever he pleased” (Ps. 115:3). With regard to this, it is
          well said that from the actual power to the work or effect the
          consequence holds good, but concerning the absolute (through which he
          is conceived as able to do more than he really does, viz., those
          things which are not repugnant to his most perfect nature or imply no
          contradiction, through which God could have raised up from stones
          children to Abraham [Mt. 3:9] and sent twelve legions of angels to
          Christ [Mt. 26:53]). With regard to the latter, we must remark that
          from the absolute power to the work, the consequence does not hold
          good because God can do many more things than he actually does. IV.
          Although power and will do not really differ, it does not follow that
          the power is not more extended than the actual volition itself. As the
          actual volition answers to the actual power (through which he does
          whatsoever he wills), so the faculty or possibility of willing ought
          to answer to the absolute power (through which God is conceived to be
          able to do whatsoever he can will). V. Some of our theologians appear
          to reject the absolute power as a profane and detestable invention (as
          Calvin, ICR 3.23.2, p. 950). They understand this not absolutely, but
          relatively, with regard to the abuse of the Scholastics who deduced
          from it many monstrous doctrines. The latter suggested the nature of
          absolute power consisted in this—that God can do whatever can be
          imagined by us whether good or evil, contradictory or not: for
          instance, that he could lie and sin; that he could do what would be
          repugnant to the nature of things. Calvin rightly denies this absolute
          power because it would not belong to power and virtue, but to
          impotency and imperfection. But he was unwilling to deny that God (by
          absolute power) can do more things than he really does by his actual
          power. In how many senses “possible” and “impossible” are used. VI.
          The object of God’s power is nothing other than the possible, i.e.,
          whatever is not repugnant to be done (as the object of his omniscience
          is the knowable). But the impossible falls not under the omnipotence
          of God, not from a defect in his power, but from a defect in the
          possibility of the thing because it involves in its conception
          contradictory predicates (as vision, although it might be infinite,
          could be extended only to visibles, not to audibles). VII. Impossible
          and possible are used in three ways: (1) supernaturally; (2)
          naturally; (3) morally. The impossible supernaturally is what cannot
          be made even by the divine power (as a Sensitive stone, an irrational
          man). The possible supernaturally is what can take place at least
          divinely (as the resurrection of the dead). The naturally impossible
          is what cannot be done by the powers of nature and second causes, but
          yet can be done by supernatural power (as the creation of a world, the
          conception of a virgin, etc.). But the naturally possible is that
          which does not exceed the powers of finite nature. The morally
          impossible is what cannot be done according to the laws of holiness;
          but the morally possible is what is agreeable to the laws of virtue.
          God can indeed do the naturally impossible, but not what is said to be
          such either morally or supernaturally. VIII. The impossible to nature
          with respect to second causes, i.e., which surpasses the usual and
          customary course of nature (as for the sun to stand still, for fire
          not to burn) differs from the impossible by nature, i.e., which is
          repugnant to the nature of a thing with respect to all causes. When it
          is said that the impossible does not fall under the power of God, it
          is understood in the second sense not in the first; for otherwise what
          is impossible with men is possible with God. IX. The impossible is so
          either on the part of the thing (repugnant to its nature) or on the
          part of God (because he cannot do it). Not that it is absolutely
          impossible in itself because it can be done by others (and often is
          done), but because it cannot fall on God (for example, to lie, to sin,
          to die— things not impossible absolutely in themselves, but with
          respect to God). Whatever implies any defect or imperfection (whether
          moral—such as a lie, sin, the denial of himself [Heb. 6:18; 2 Tim.
          2:13; Jam. 1:13, 14]; or physical—such as death or corruption) cannot
          fall on him because he is omnipotent. As Augustine excellently notes:
          “God is omnipotent and since he is omnipotent he cannot die, nor be
          deceived, nor deny himself. He cannot do many things, and yet he is
          omnipotent; and he is therefore omnipotent because he cannot do these
          things, for if he could die he would not be omnipotent” (The Creed [De
          symbolo: sermo ad catechumenos] 1 [FC 27:290; PL 40.627]). “The power
          of God is not diminished when it is said that he cannot die and be
          deceived; for so he cannot do it that if he could, he would have
          rather the less power. Rightly, indeed, is he called omnipotent who
          yet cannot die and be deceived for he is called omnipotent by doing
          what he wills, not by suffering what he does not will” (CG 5.10 [FC
          8:263; PL 41.152]). X. Hence is evident what must be determined
          concerning the object of God’s power (viz., that it is not all which
          can in any way be conceived or imagined; since many false things and
          evil things and things which cannot be are conceived of; nor even only
          that which God wills, for that God can do many more things than he
          wills, the thing itself exclaims and Scripture expressly teaches [Mt.
          26:53; Mt. 3:9]). Rather it is all that which is not repugnant, both
          on the part of the thing and on the part of God (i.e., what can be
          done and what God can do). XI. Hence we gather what must be judged
          concerning contradictories; for that is said to be contradictory which
          is logically impossible, i.e., which has a repugnancy and includes
          contradictory predicates (for example, a corporeal God, an irrational
          man). Now a repugnance may be immediate and explicit when the terms
          are explicitly contradictory (for example, a deed undone, a man not
          man). Or it may be mediate and implicit when the repugnant terms only
          virtually and implicitly include a contradiction (for example, when
          inseparable properties are denied or contrary predicates are affirmed
          of the subject—as God corporeal and mortal, man not risible, the body
          not extended, accident not inherent). For such things involve
          contradictory predicates which strike against this first principle of
          indubitable truth (i.e., “it is impossible for the same thing to be
          and not to be at the same time”). Contradictories do not fall under
          the power of God. XII. That such things do not fall under God’s power
          is evident: (1) because impossibilities cannot be done by him and
          contradictories are impossible because they are incompossible; for a
          contradiction is of eternal disjunction and to affirm and to deny, to
          be and not to be are eternally opposed; (2) the power of God is
          concerned with being (i.e., what can be); but a contradiction is a
          non-entity; (3) if he could perform contradictories, he could make the
          same thing to be and not be at the same time so that two contradictory
          propositions might be true at the same time; (4) then evidently
          nothing would be impossible any more because there would be nothing
          greater than that which contradicts. Sources of explanation. XII. Now
          although his power is not extended to contradictories, its infinity
          must not therefore be considered as limited. The power of every agent
          must be estimated from its proper object. Now the proper object of
          divine power is that which is not repugnant. Therefore when he is said
          to be omnipotent or able to do all things, the word “all things”
          distributes only entities, under which impossible and contradictory
          things are not contained. XIV. God can indeed do things which are
          above man’s reason because he is able to do above all that we ask or
          think (Eph. 3:20), but not things contrary to reason. If he can do
          things which are impossible to men (i.e., surpassing human strength),
          it does not immediately follow that he can do things impossible with
          the reason (i.e., repugnant to reason). Indeed it is true that the
          divine surpasses our logical and ratiocinative intellect, but it
          cannot be thence inferred that God can do those things which in our
          logic imply a contradiction. For although our right reason may fail in
          an equalizing (adaequatione) of divine truth (so as not to take in the
          whole), yet it contains nothing contrary to that truth. XV. It is one
          thing to say that God can do more than we can understand and our mind
          conceive. It is another to say that he can do things which imply a
          contradiction. The former our theologians have taught in accordance
          with Scripture, but not the latter (which they have constantly denied
          without any fear of limiting the divine power). XVI. With God no word
          or thing (which can have the relation of true being) is impossible
          (Lk. 1:37). But that which is contradictory is not such; rather it is
          a nothing and a non-entity. XVII. To do contraries is one thing; to do
          contradictories another. God can do the former, but not the latter. If
          God had constituted the nature of things differently and had implanted
          in us other ideas of things, he might indeed do things diverse and
          contrary, but not contradictory. Nor would that first principle be
          false, for it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be at
          the same time (which is the true foundation of contradiction). XVIII.
          God could have made the past not to be the past in the divided sense
          and before it was past; but in the compound sense, he cannot make what
          is past to be not past because it is no less impossible for a thing to
          have been and not to have been at the same time than for it to be and
          not to be. XIX. Although we assert that God cannot do certain things,
          we ought not therefore to be considered as denying his omnipotence (as
          we are charged by the papists and Lutherans). For we understand this
          only of those things implying a contradiction and arguing some fault
          or imperfection in the first cause; to do such things would be a proof
          of impotence, not of power. Nor can the power of God be convicted of
          impotence for not being able to do things impossible anymore than the
          vision because it cannot see sounds or the hearing because it cannot
          hear colors. Now we reckon those things to be contradictory which we
          deny that God can do (as that accidents can subsist without subjects,
          that any body can be illocal or everywhere [polytopon]). XX. What John
          says (that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
          Abraham, Mt. 3:9) does not prove that God can do contradictories. It
          only rebukes the vainglory of the Jews and the hope of impunity on
          account of the holiness of their ancestors and the supposed dignity of
          the nation by declaring that if they were destroyed God could
          miraculously father another people to himself from stones to be the
          sons of Abraham (not by generation but by imitation). Now this
          locution can be understood either figuratively of stones, not
          physically but ethically (i.e., of the foreign nations which
          worshipped stones and are compared with them in Scripture); or
          literally in this sense—if you should all miserably perish, yet God
          will not be false to his promises, nor will a posterity be wanting to
          Abraham. As he formed Adam from the earth, so from these stones he is
          able to raise up unto Abraham children, not camal, but spiritual; or
          proverbially and hyperbolically—as it is said that the stones would
          cry out (Lk. 19:40) to intimate that God could, by extraordinary means
          and beyond the course of nature, collect a people for himself. Thus
          absolute power is here intimated (to wit, a power surpassing the
          constituted order in nature), but not actual power which observes and
          follows that order. XXI. Although all the works of God are finite (nor
          can anything infinite in act and properly so called be done by him),
          the omnipotence of God is not therefore limited because it does not
          cease to be infinite (both with respect to essence, with which it is
          interchangable, and with respect to the mode of operation, which ought
          to be infinite in finite works—whether on account of the infinite
          distance between being and nothing or because an infinite agent ought
          necessarily to be concluded, to which nothing upon which it may act is
          presupposed; and with respect to the objects which can be called
          infinite, not in act, but in power). XXII. God exercises this infinite
          power either mediately (by the intervention of second causes, which he
          uses as instruments of operation) or immediately (when he operates
          through himself without other causes). In the former sense, he exerts
          his power in a finite degree because he cannot communicate his virtue
          to a creature unless in a finite degree of which the creature is
          capable (for example, when God exerts his power in the nourishment of
          man by food). In the latter sense, he exerts it in an infinite manner
          because he alone operates (as when he exerts his power in the
          conversion of man). XXIII. Although the impossibility of a thing
          arises more on the part of the thing (on account of the repugnancy of
          terms) than on the part of God (in which not any impotence, but rather
          the highest power and perfection is indicated), yet nothing is
          impossible on the part of the thing which is not also so on the part
          of God (as whatever is said to be possible is not so called simply on
          the part of the thing, as if it had an intrinsic entity in itself from
          eternity [according to the erroneous opinion of some], but on the part
          of God and with respect to the power of the agent, inasmuch as that is
          said to be possible which the first agent can produce). XXIV. If God
          could make an infinite in actual extension and number, it would be
          such as to have an infinite actual extension or a really infinite
          number. Thus would be granted more infinites in act and reality; yea,
          something of so great extension or of such a number, as that God could
          not add to it either a unit or one cubit, since nothing can be added
          to that which is actually infinite (which strikes everyone as most
          absurd). Indeed, to suppose any creature to be infinite in act or
          extension or number is as great a contradiction as for a creature to
          be eternal and not made. XXV. This proposition that God can deceive if
          he will (although he neither will nor can will it), by whatever
          interpretation softened, is deservedly rejected as too crude and
          dangerous. Yea it is openly repugnant also to the truth delivered in
          Scripture concerning God. For if God can deceive, he can also lie and
          sin if he so willed (which is opposed to his most perfect truth and
          holiness). For a long time, this concept was condemned therefore as
          blasphemous among the Scholastics. To deceive another by words, what
          else is it than to lie or to speak falsely? Therefore if God can
          deceive by words, he can also lie (which is expressly repugnant to
          Scripture [Tit. 1:2; Heb. 6:18] and to the nature of God, in which
          there can be neither ignorance nor error of judgment nor malice nor
          any such thing from which a lie could take its origin). Yea, if we
          could say this, I shudder to relate, we could also say that God could
          be made not God; if God can deceive, he can sin; if he can sin, he can
          become not God because he who sins (or can sin) is not God. (2) God
          through his own goodness, holiness and justice cannot be said to be
          able to do what is evil, unjust and impure, even if he willed.
          Therefore by the same consequence, he cannot be said to be able to
          deceive (on account of his immutable truth, which must be ascribed to
          God even before every conception of the will). (3) God cannot do that
          which he cannot will; for he cannot do anything without his will,
          since the will deduces power into act and whatever God can do, that he
          can also will to be done (unless we maintain that a thing may be said
          to be possible and impossible at the same time, to the same most
          simple and most true God— which is absurd [asystaton]). Now no one but
          an atheist will deny that God cannot will to deceive. (4) If God can
          deceive if he will, he could oblige us, if he willed, to believe a lie
          and that too with divine faith on account of his authority. (5) God
          cannot perform contradictions. Therefore he cannot deceive if he will.
          For that God can deceive is that he can be untrue and so not God. (6)
          If he can deceive, our faith in the Scriptures would always be
          wavering. If the Scriptures were given by a God who can deceive, how
          could we persuade an atheist that he had not deceived? To no purpose
          would you say that he did not will to deceive, for how could he be
          assured of this? Not from Scripture (which expressly says this)
          because he could immediately reply, this was said by that God who can
          deceive, and how do we know that he has not here given the effect
          which he is said to be able to give? Not from the nature of God
          because it is not repugnant to God’s nature to give that effect which
          he has the power to give. In vain also would you say that it is
          repugnant to his nature to will to effect it because if it is not
          repugnant to his nature to be able to perform it, neither will it be
          repugnant to his nature to be able to will to perform it. XXVI.
          Although the power of God extends itself to more things than his will
          in the exercised act (because he can do many more things than those
          which he actually wills are future); yet it is not more widely
          extended than the will in the signified act (i.e., God cannot do more
          than he can will since both his power and will form the law to himself
          from his nature). XXVII. It is one thing for God to decree the
          commission of an error by a creature and to permit a creature to be
          deceived, but another for him to be able immediately by himself to
          deceive anyone. The former can justly be done and is in fact done by
          God, but not the latter, which involves the relation of sin. XXVIII.
          Although it may with propriety be said that God can do anything if he
          wills (with respect to those things which he cannot will from the
          hypothesis of his immutable decree because such an operation does not
          involve any repugnancy to the nature of God), this cannot be said with
          the same truth in relation to those things which he cannot will
          through his goodness and justice because such things are not only
          impossible from hypothesis with respect to the decree, but absolutely
          and in themselves on account of the repugnance which they bespeak to
          the nature of God.

          TWENTY-SECOND QUESTION: THE DOMINION AND SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD What is
          the dominion of God, and of how many kinds? May an absolute and
          ordinate right be granted? The foundation of God’s dominion. I. With
          the power of God (treated of in the preceding question) ought always
          to be connected his sovereignty from which the right and authority of
          doing what he does belongs to him. But sovereignty arises from his
          dominion, concerning which this question is now taken up. II. That God
          is Lord of heaven and of earth (if the Scriptures themselves did not
          so often testify), the very nature of God (which is independent, most
          perfect and the cause of all things) would evince. Its foundation is
          considered to be twofold: (1) preeminence (hyperoché) and eminence of
          nature; (2) amplitude and excellence of beneficence. As among men,
          there are two foundations of lawful dominion. First, eminence of power
          above others, for it is in accordance with the nature of things that
          the superior and more excellent should have dominion over the inferior
          and more ignoble (whence Aristotle expressly asserts if anyone could
          be found far surpassing other mortals in all virtues, he should be
          constituted king over all the rest). Second is beneficence by which
          one man acquires a right over another. He is therefore lord because he
          is kind. Since, then, God is established in the highest preeminence
          (hyperoché) and has bestowed (and every day bestows) upon his
          creatures as his work innumerable blessings, he is most justly called
          the Lord of all, as the artificer is lord of his own work. How the
          natural and economical dominion differ. III. That dominion is called
          natural and essential to distinguish it from the economical which
          belongs to Christ (Phil. 2:9) and differs from it in many respects:
          (1) with regard to principle and origin the former is called natural,
          kata physin (because given by no one), but the latter is called
          economical and kata thesin (because given by another, viz., by the
          Father—“All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,” Mt.
          28:18*); (2) with regard to the foundation. The former is founded upon
          the decree of providence by which he predetermined all things and
          events; but the latter upon the decree of predestination according to
          which he predestinated us to adoption through Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:5).
          (3) With regard to the objects—the kingdom of nature is universal,
          embracing all creatures; the kingdom of grace is especially terminated
          on the church, whence by a peculiar reason he may be called the King
          and Lord of the church (for although he exercises his power and
          justice also over the wicked themselves who are in subjection to him
          and whom he rules and breaks with a rod of iron [Ps. 2:9], yet he
          especially reigns in the elect and believers through grace). (4) With
          regard to their effects; for the effects of divine providence in the
          natural kingdom are common and diffused over all creatures although in
          different ways; but the effects of the kingdom of grace are saving
          benefits peculiar to the elect alone—calling, adoption, justification,
          sanctification, etc. (5) With regard to administration; that is,
          exercised by Christ as God together with the Father and the Holy
          Spirit—whence it is called essential because common to the whole
          divine essence; but this is exercised by him as Mediator and God- man
          (theanthropo)—whence it is called personal because it pertains to the
          person of the Son and is appointed to his economy. (6) With regard to
          duration; that is eternal and immutable (Ps. 145:13). But this will
          have an end, at least as to mode, because he will deliver up the
          kingdom to God the Father (1 Cor. 15:24). IV. The principal property
          of God’s dominion is that it is not only universal, but also absolute
          and unlimited. For as God is an independent and truly self-powerful
          (autexousios) being, so he is evidently not accountable
          (anypeuthynos), liable to no censure or judgment (Job 9:12; Dan. 4:25)
          who can do with his own what he will (Mt. 20:15) and with whom no one
          can contend or say to him, why hast thou done this? although the
          reason of his works and judgments may be hidden from us (Job 33:13):
          “Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made
          me thus?” (Rom. 9:20, 21). Absolute and ordinate right. V. Hence arose
          the distinction of God’s right into absolute and ordinate; that is,
          the dominion and sovereignty which God holds over all his creatures of
          determining concerning them at pleasure without injustice. Its
          foundation is double. The first is the excellence of his nature above
          all creatures, for that Supreme preeminence (hyperché) which he
          possesses over all things conciliates for him the highest sovereignty.
          The other is the dependence of all creatures upon him, both in being
          and in operation (Act 17:24), through which, as he is the first from
          whom all things proceed, so he must also be the last to whom they
          should be referred (Rom. 11:36). VI. The ordinate right is the order
          or reason of justice which God has declared to us by the word of the
          law and gospel, both as to the duty of man in both covenants (viz.,
          works and faith), and as to the promise and threat annexed to it in
          life and death, in salvation and condemnation. Its foundation is the
          covenant entered into with the creature or the will of God manifested
          to us by the external word of the law and gospel. Hence it has place
          in the ordinary dispensation of God towards men; but the other in the
          extraordinary (which God can indeed exercise without impairing his
          justice, but which nevertheless he very rarely does exercise). VII.
          The proof of both occurs in predestination. For in election it belongs
          to the absolute right that God, according to his most free good
          pleasure, destines sinful and guilty men to salvation; and although
          all are equal, yet he elects this one instead of another, as in the
          case with Esau and Jacob, concerning which the apostle says: “the
          children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil,
          that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
          works, but of him that calleth; it was said the elder shall serve the
          younger” (Rom. 9:11, 12*). Hence it is immediately added, “He hath
          mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth” (Rom. 9:18). But
          it favors the ordinate, both that he is gracious to sinners and saves
          them not without the satisfaction of Christ (Rom. 3:25), and that he
          rewards faith and works graciously according to his promise (2 Thess.
          1:5—7). In reprobation, the absolute right is beheld in this—that
          although all men are equal, yet he passes by this one instead of
          another, acting from his good pleasure (eudokia) alone; not as Judge,
          but as an autocrat (autokrator) and Lord who has the power to make a
          vessel unto honor and unto dishonor (Rom. 9:21; Mt. 11:26). But the
          ordinate is found in this—that he reprobates and condemns no one
          except on account of sin (Rom. 1:32). VIII. Although the absolute
          right is not revealed by the law, it must not therefore be held as
          contrary to the law. It is above and beyond the law, but not against
          it; nor moreover can it be called unjust, inasmuch as it is not
          conformed to the law because (as was proved before) the adequate rule
          of justice is not the law alone, but partly the nature of God and
          partly his will. Thus it is one thing to act from the rule of ordinary
          justice, but another from a superior order (viz., from an autocratic
          right, to which justice is not repugnant but subordinated). So a
          prince in pardoning crimes, acts not from justice as a judge, but from
          clemency as lord and prince (who can dispense with the law instituted
          by himself). So God in the exercise of this absolute right, although
          he can do nothing opposed to his justice, yet does not act from it,
          but from the most free good pleasure belonging to him as supreme Lord.
          IX. The extent of the absolute right of God must not be curiously
          searched into, much less rashly defined; nor is it in our power or
          place to put any limits either to the power or the sovereignty of God.
          If no one could endure a little worm disputing the authority of men
          and setting bounds to it, how much less is this to be suffered in a
          man who, compared with God, is far more insignificant than a worm?
          Therefore, it becomes us to dismiss the curious and useless questions
          of the Scholastics, who by a rash presumption undertake to define the
          incomprehensible secrets of God’s majesty. Only two things are
          important for us to remember here: on the one hand, that the right of
          God is supreme and absolute, and above what we can either think or
          speak, and that he can do with his own what he pleases; and on the
          other, that it is always holy and agreeable to the most perfect nature
          of God, so that in its use he does nothing in opposition to his
          wisdom, goodness and holiness. X. When the Scriptures speak of the
          absolute right (as Rom. 9 and Job 33, 42*), they do not so much mean
          what God actually does as what he can do in order that thus the mouth
          of the obstinate and impudent (who jeer at the liberty of God) may be
          stopped. Natural and free right. XI. Here belongs the distinction of
          the right of God into natural and free. The former is founded on the
          very nature of God, but this depends upon his pleasure and will; that
          is eternal and indispensable (whose contrary he cannot will without a
          contradiction), but this is positive and dispensable (whose opposite
          he could will without repugnancy). Thus it belongs to the natural
          right that God cannot deny himself and give his glory to another; that
          the rational creature should obey and be under the law of God or pay
          its penalty; that God cannot but govern the world as long as it is a
          world and prescribe to the creature holy and just commands. For all
          these things are such that God cannot will their contraries without
          repugnancy. But to the free right belongs the permissions of sin, the
          bestowal of distinguishing grace, the institution of the symbolical
          and ceremonial law; for these are of such a nature that God could have
          willed or nilled them without detriment to his justice.
