            <b>1.</b> Those whom God effectually calls, he also freely justifies,<sup>1</sup> not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous;<sup>2</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone;<sup>3</sup> not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing Christ's active obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in his death for their whole and sole righteousness by faith,<sup>4</sup> which faith they have not of themselves; it is the gift of God.<sup>5</sup> (<sup>1</sup>Rom 3:24, 8:30; <sup>2</sup>Rom 4:5-8, Eph 1:7; <sup>3</sup>1Cor 1:30-31, Rom 5:17-19; <sup>4</sup>Phil 3:8-9; Eph 2:8-10; <sup>5</sup>Jhn 1:12, Rom 5:17;)
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            <b>2.</b> Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification;<sup>6</sup> yet is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but works by love.<sup>7</sup> (<sup>6</sup> Rom 3:28; <sup>7</sup> Gal 5:6, James 2:17, 22, 26;)
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            <b>3.</b> Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those who are justified; and did, by the sacrifice of himself in the blood of his cross, undergoing in their stead the penalty due to them, make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in their behalf;<sup>8</sup> yet, in as much as he was given by the Father for them, and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both freely, not for anything in them,<sup>9</sup> their justification is only of free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justification of sinners.<sup>10</sup> (<sup>8</sup>Heb 10:14, 1 Pet 1:18-19, Isaiah 53:5-6; <sup>9</sup>Rom 8:32, 2 Cor 5:21; <sup>10</sup>Rom 3:26, Eph 1:6-7, 2:7;)
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            <b>4.</b> God did from all eternity decree to justify all the elect,<sup>11</sup> and Christ did in the fullness of time die for their sins, and rise again for their justification;<sup>12</sup> nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the Holy Spirit in time does actually apply Christ to them.<sup>13</sup> (<sup>11</sup>Gal 3:8, 1 Pet 1:2, 1 Tim 2:6; <sup>12</sup>Rom 4:25; <sup>13</sup>Col 1:21-22, Titus 3:4-7;)
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            <b>5.</b> God continues to forgive the sins of those that are justified,<sup>14</sup> and although they can never fall from the state of justification,<sup>15</sup> yet they may, by their sins, fall under God's fatherly displeasure;<sup>16</sup> and in that condition they usually do not have the light of his countenance restored to them, until they humble themselves, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.<sup>17</sup> (<sup>14</sup>Mat 6:12, 1 Jhn 1:7, 9; <sup>15</sup>Jhn 10:28; <sup>16</sup>Ps 89:31-33; <sup>17</sup>Ps 32:5, Ps 51, Mat 26:75;)
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            <b>6.</b> The justification of believers under the Old Testament was, in all these respects, one and the same with the justification of believers under the New Testament.<sup>18</sup> (<sup>18</sup>Gal 3:9, Rom 4:22-24;)

        <h2><a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.261902/page/n40/mode/1up" target="_blank"><span>Westminster Larger Catechism</span></a>:</h2>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 70. What is justification? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justification is an act of God's free grace unto sinners,<sup>i</sup> in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight;<sup>k</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by them,<sup>l</sup> but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them,<sup>m</sup> and received by faith alone.<sup>n</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 71. How is justification an act of God's free grace? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup>o</sup> yet inasmuch as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son,<sup>p</sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup>q</sup> and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,<sup>r</sup> which also is his gift,<sup>s</sup> their justification is to them of free grace.<sup>t</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 72. What is justifying faith? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justifying faith is a saving grace,<sup>u</sup> wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit<sup>w</sup> and Word of God,<sup>x</sup> whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,<sup>y</sup> not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,<sup>z</sup> but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,<sup>a</sup> and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.<sup>b</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup>c</sup> nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;<sup>d</sup> but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup>e</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>i</sup>Rom. 3:22, 24-25. … even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.… being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. Rom. 4:5. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>l</sup>Titus 3:5, 7. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.… that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>n</sup>Acts 10:43. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. Gal. 2:16. … knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>q</sup>2 Cor. 5:21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Rom. 4:6, 11. Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works.… And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>r</sup>Rom. 3:24–25. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>s</sup>Eph. 2:8. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>t</sup>Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. Rom. 3:24–25. … being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>u</sup>Heb. 10:39. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>x</sup>Rom. 10:14–17. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 1 Cor. 1:21. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>z</sup>Eph. 1:13. … in whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise. Heb. 11:13. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>a</sup>John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Acts 16:31. And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. Acts 10:43. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. Zech. 3:8–9. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>b</sup>Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Acts 15:11. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>c</sup>Gal. 3:11. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. Rom. 3:28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          <sup>e</sup>John 1:12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Gal. 2:16. … knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
