            <b>3.</b> Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those who are justified; and did, by the sacrifice of himself in the blood of his cross, undergoing in their stead the penalty due to them, make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in their behalf;<sup>8</sup> yet, in as much as he was given by the Father for them, and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both freely, not for anything in them,<sup>9</sup> their justification is only of free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justification of sinners.<sup>10</sup> (<sup>8</sup>Heb 10:14, 1 Pet 1:18-19, Isaiah 53:5-6; <sup>9</sup>Rom 8:32, 2 Cor 5:21; <sup>10</sup>Rom 3:26, Eph 1:6-7, 2:7;)

          Q. 70. What is justification? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justification is an act of God's free grace unto sinners,<sup>i</sup> in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight;<sup>k</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by them,<sup>l</sup> but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them,<sup>m</sup> and received by faith alone.<sup>n</sup>

          <sup>i</sup>Rom. 3:22, 24-25. … even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.… being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. Rom. 4:5. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness

          <sup>l</sup>Titus 3:5, 7. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.… that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. Eph. 1:7. … in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.

Phil. 3:9. … and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.
          </p>

        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 71. How is justification an act of God's free grace? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup>o</sup> yet inasmuch as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son,<sup>p</sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup>q</sup> and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,<sup>r</sup> which also is his gift,<sup>s</sup> their justification is to them of free grace.<sup>t</sup>

Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works.… And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also.

        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 72. What is justifying faith? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justifying faith is a saving grace,<sup>u</sup> wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit<sup>w</sup> and Word of God,<sup>x</sup> whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,<sup>y</sup> not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,<sup>z</sup> but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,<sup>a</sup> and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.<sup>b</sup>

How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 1 Cor. 1:21. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

          Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup>c</sup> nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;<sup>d</sup> but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup>e</sup>

            11.2. But that we may not stumble at the threshold, (which would be the case were we to enter on a disputation concerning a subject not understood by us,) let us first explain the meaning of these expressions. To be justified in the sight of God, To be justified by faith or by works. He is said to be justified in the sight of God who in the Divine judgment is reputed righteous, and accepted on account of his righteousness; for as iniquity is abominable to God, so no sinner can find favour in his sight, as a sinner, or so long as he is considered as such. Wherever sin is, therefore, it is accompanied with the wrath and vengeance of God. He is justified who is considered not as a sinner, but as a righteous person, and on that account stands in safety before the tribunal of God, where all sinners are confounded and ruined. As, if an innocent man be brought under an accusation before the tribunal of a just judge, when judgment is passed according to his innocence, he is said to be justified or acquitted before the judge, so he is justified before God, who, not being numbered among sinners, has God for a witness and asserter of his righteousness. Thus he must be said, therefore, to be justified by works, whose life discovers such purity and holiness, as to deserve the character of righteousness before the throne of God; or who, by the integrity of his works, can answer and satisfy the divine judgment. On the other hand, he will be justified by faith, who, being excluded from the righteousness of works, apprehends by faith the righteousness of Christ, invested in which, he appears, in the sight of God, not as a sinner, but as a righteous man. Thus we simply explain justification to be an acceptance, by which God receives us into his favour, and esteems us as righteous persons; and we say that it consists in the remission of sins and the imputation of the righteousness of Christ.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.3. For the confirmation of this point there are many plain testimonies of Scripture... I will only produce a few places, where this justification, which we speak of, is expressly handled... when Christ reprehends the Pharisees for “justifying themselves,” he does not mean that they attained righteousness by doing what was right, but that they ostentatiously endeavoured to gain the character of righteousness, of which they were destitute... But with respect to the present subject, where Paul says, “The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the heathen through faith,” what can we understand, but that God imputes righteousness through faith? Again, when he says that God “justifieth the ungodly which believeth in Jesus,” what can be the meaning, but that he delivers him by the blessing of faith from the condemnation deserved by his ungodliness? He speaks still more plainly in the conclusion, when he thus exclaims: “Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who also maketh intercession for us.” For it is just as if he had said, Who shall accuse them whom God absolves? Who shall condemn those for whom Christ intercedes? Justification, therefore, is no other than an acquittal from guilt of him who was accused, as though his innocence had been proved. Since God, therefore, justifies us through the mediation of Christ, he acquits us, not by an admission of our personal innocence, but by an imputation of righteousness; so that we, who are unrighteous in ourselves, are considered as righteous in Christ.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.14. The sophists, who amuse and delight themselves with perversion of the Scripture and vain cavils, think they have found a most excellent subterfuge, when they explain works, in these passages, to mean those which men yet unregenerate perform without the grace of Christ, merely through the unassisted efforts of their own free-will; and deny that they relate to spiritual works. Thus, according to them, a man is justified both by faith and by works, only the works are not properly his own, but the gifts of Christ and the fruits of regeneration. For they say that Paul spoke in this manner, only that the Jews, who relied on their own strength, might be convinced of their folly in arrogating righteousness to themselves, whereas it is conferred on us solely by the Spirit of Christ, not by any exertion properly our own. But they do not observe, that in the contrast of legal and evangelical righteousness, which Paul introduces in another place, all works are excluded, by what title soever they may be distinguished. For he teaches that this is the righteousness of the law, that he who has fulfilled the command of the law shall obtain salvation; but that the righteousness of faith consists in believing that Christ has died and is risen again. Besides, we shall see, as we proceed, in its proper place, that sanctification and righteousness are separate blessings of Christ. Whence it follows, that even spiritual works are not taken into the account, when the power of justifying is attributed to faith. And the assertion of Paul, in the place just cited, that Abraham has not whereof to glory before God, since he was not justified by works, ought not to be restricted to any literal appearance or external display of virtue, or to any efforts of free-will; but though the life of the patriarch was spiritual, and almost angelic, yet his works did not possess sufficient merit to justify him before God.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.15. The errors of the schoolmen, who mingle their preparations, are rather more gross; but they instil into the simple and incautious a doctrine equally corrupt, while under the pretext of the Spirit and of grace, they conceal the mercy of God, which alone can calm the terrors of the conscience. We confess, indeed, with Paul, that “the doers of the law are justified before God;” but since we are all far from being observers of the law, we conclude, that those works which should be principally available to justification, afford us no assistance, because we are destitute of them. With respect to the common Papists, or schoolmen, they are in this matter doubly deceived; both in denominating faith a certainty of conscience in expecting from God a reward of merit, and in explaining the grace of God to be, not an imputation of gratuitous righteousness, but the Spirit assisting to the pursuit of holiness. They read in the apostle, “He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” But they do not consider the manner of seeking him. And that they mistake the sense of the word “grace,” is evident from their writings. For Lombard represents justification by Christ as given us in two ways. He says, “The death of Christ justifies us, first, because it excites charity in our hearts, by which we are made actually righteous; secondly, because it destroys sin, by which the devil held us in captivity, so that now it cannot condemn us.” We see how he considers the grace of God in justification to consist in our being directed to good works by the grace of the Holy Spirit. He wished, indeed, to follow the opinion of Augustine; but he follows him at a great distance, and even deviates considerably from a close imitation of him; for whatever he finds clearly stated by him, he obscures, and whatever he finds pure in him, he corrupts. The schools have always been running into worse and worse errors, till at length they have precipitated themselves into a kind of Pelagianism. Nor, indeed, is the opinion of Augustine, or at least his manner of expression, to be altogether admitted. For though he excellently despoils man of all the praise of righteousness, and ascribes the whole to the grace of God, yet he refers grace to sanctification, in which we are regenerated by the Spirit to newness of life.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.18. The other passage is as follows: “That no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident; for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith; but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.” How could this argument be supported, unless it were certain that works do not come into the account of faith, but are to be entirely separated from it? The law, he says, differs from faith. Why? Because works are required to the righteousness of the law. It follows, therefore, that works are not required to the righteousness of faith. From this statement it appears, that they who are justified by faith, are justified without the merit of works, and beyond the merit of works; for faith receives that righteousness which the gospel bestows; and the gospel differs from the law in this respect, that it does not confine righteousness to works, but rests it entirely on the mercy of God. He argues in a similar manner to the Romans, that “Abraham had not whereof to glory; for he believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness;” and by way of confirmation he subjoins, that then there is room for the righteousness of faith when there are no works which merit any reward. He tells us, that where there are works, they receive a reward “of debt,” but that what is given to faith is “of grace;” for this is the clear import of the language which he there uses. When he adds, a little after, “Therefore it is of faith” that we obtain the inheritance, in order “that it might be by grace,” he infers that the inheritance is gratuitous, because it is received by faith: and why is this, but because faith, without any assistance of works, depends wholly on the Divine mercy? And in the same sense undoubtedly he elsewhere teaches us, that “the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;” because, by excluding the law, he denies that righteousness is assisted by works, or that we obtain it by working, but asserts that we come empty in order to receive it.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.23. Hence, also, it is evident, that we obtain justification before God, solely by the intervention of the righteousness of Christ. Which is equivalent to saying, that a man is righteous, not in himself, but because the righteousness of Christ is communicated to him by imputation; and this is a point which deserves an attentive consideration. For it supersedes that idle notion, that a man is justified by faith, because faith receives the Spirit of God by whom he is made righteous; which is too repugnant to the foregoing doctrine, ever to be reconcilable to it. For he must certainly be destitute of all righteousness of his own, who is taught to seek a righteousness out of himself. This is most clearly asserted by the apostle, when he says, “He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” We see that our righteousness is not in ourselves, but in Christ; and that all our title to it rests solely on our being partakers of Christ; for in possessing him, we possess all his riches with him. Nor does any objection arise from what he states in another place, that “God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us;” where he intends no other fulfilment than what we obtain by imputation. For the Lord Christ so communicates his righteousness to us, that, with reference to the Divine judgment, he transfuses its virtue into us in a most wonderful manner. That the apostle intended no other, abundantly appears from another declaration, which he had made just before: “As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.” What is placing our righteousness in the obedience of Christ, but asserting, that we are accounted righteous only because his obedience is accepted for us as if it were our own? Wherefore Ambrose appears to me to have very beautifully exemplified this righteousness in the benediction of Jacob; that as he, who had on his own account no claim to the privileges of primogeniture, being concealed in his brother's habit, and invested with his garment, which diffused a most excellent odour, insinuated himself into the favour of his father, that he might receive the benediction to his own advantage, under the character of another; so we shelter ourselves under the precious purity of Christ our elder brother, that we may obtain the testimony of righteousness in the sight of God. The words of Ambrose are, “That Isaac smelled the odour of the garments, perhaps indicates, that we are justified not by works, but by faith; since the infirmity of the flesh is an impediment to works, but the brightness of faith, which merits the pardon of sin, conceals the error of our actions.” And such is indeed the real fact; for that we may appear before the face of God to salvation, it is necessary for us to be perfumed with his fragrance, and to have all our deformities concealed and absorbed in his perfection.

            16.2 <em>Is the impulsive and meritorious cause (on account of which man is justified in the judgment of God) inherent righteousness infused into us or good works ? We deny against the Romanists</em>
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            I. Since it is evident from the preceding question that the word “justification” is forensic and is taken judicially here because it relates to the manner in which sinful man can stand before the bar of God and obtain the pardon of sin with a right to life, we must inquire before all things what is the foundation of this justification or what is the true and proper meritorious cause in view of which he is absolved by God from sin and adjudged to life. Concerning this we must first treat negatively (<em>kat’ arsin</em>) according to the Pauline method in order that we may see in what it does not consist; second, we must treat affirmatively (<em>kata thesin</em>) to see in what it does consist.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            III. This being established, the question does not concern legal justification. For we confess that in it inherent righteousness is _ its meritorious cause, nor can it be obtained except by the perfect obedience of man. But because the law has now become weak by sin, this method of justification is impossible (<em>ek ton adynaton</em>). Thus we treat of the evangelical justification proposed to us in the covenant of grace, which we deny to be founded in inherent righteousness.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            IX. That inherent righteousness cannot be the meritorious cause of our justification, we prove: (1) because no one is justified by an imperfect righteousness, since the judgment of God is according to truth and in it there is no room for a gracious acceptation; nor can deception consist with his law and justice. But inherent righteousness is not perfect, nor actual, nor habitual. Not actual because in many things we all offend (Jam. 3:2) and there is no one that sinneth not (1 K. 8:46), which Bellarmine himself does not deny (“De Justificatione,” 2.16 Opera [1858], 4:530—32). Not habitual because the perfection and imperfection of an act depend upon the perfection or imperfection of the habit and our regeneration is always imperfect here (1 Cor. 13:12; Gal. 5:17). Nor ought it to be objected “that this absolute perfection was required under the law, but is not required under the gospel.” The relaxation made under the gospel does not extend so far that an imperfect righteousness can be accepted for a_ perfect righteousness; for God cannot be satisfied except by a perfect righteousness. Rather it consists in this—that the vicarious and the alien righteousness of a surety is admitted for our own. Nor ought it to be objected “that righteousness is properly said to be perfect because it belongs to the works of God, which must be perfect because the work of the Rock is perfect” (Dt. 32:4). For the works which God does immediately by himself (which are rightly called perfect absolutely and simply) and the mediate works (which are performed by the intervention of creatures—such as the work of regeneration—which are not at once perfect because God operating according to our capacity promotes and perfects them little by little) differ.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            X. Second, our justification takes place without works; therefore also without inherent righteousness, which consists wholly in works or in habits from which works spring. The passages are obvious. Scarcely anything has been said more often and asserted more constantly; nothing certainly more fully argued: “By the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified” (Rom. 3:20); “We conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law” (v. 28). This the apostle confirms in Rom. 4:6 and Gal. 2:16 and in many other places. Nor should it be replied here that all works are not absolutely excluded, but certain ones only (to wit, ceremonial); or if moral works are excluded, those only are meant which precede faith and grace and which are done by the strength of free will, not those which are done from faith and grace. Since the apostle absolutely and simply excludes all works without any exception, it does not become us to limit what he does not limit. The thing itself proves this also for he antithetically opposes faith to works in this matter. Hence it appears that all works entirely of whatsoever kind and not some particular ones are excluded. Otherwise he could not have simply opposed “one working” and “one believing,” “to do” and “to believe,” but a certain kind of working to other kinds.

          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            XVII. Seventh, remission of sin requires the removal of guilt by the payment of the ransom (<em>lytrou</em>) due. And yet inherent righteousness can neither remove the offense to God or the guilt springing from it, nor compensate for the injury to the divine majesty. For besides the fact that it looks to the future (that man may perform his duty), not to the past (that he may compensate for the defect of duty by giving a satisfaction), it is impossible by a quality of finite virtue and worth for an offense of infinite indignity to be blotted out and compensated for.

          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            XVIII. Eight, we cannot omit here the remarkable testimonies of two cardinals, who, overcome by the power of the truth, agree with us. The first is Cardinal Contarini, who thus expresses himself: “Since we reach a twofold righteousness by faith, a righteousness inherent in us, and the love and grace by which we are made partakers of the divine nature; and the righteousness of Christ given and imputed to us, since we are planted in Christ and put on Christ: it remains to inquire, on which of these we ought to rest, and to think ourselves justified before God (i.e., reckoned holy and righteous). I truly think it to be said piously and religiously that we ought to rest, I say rest as upon a stable thing, which can certainly sustain us, upon the righteousness of Christ bestowed upon us, and not upon the holiness and grace inherent in us. For this our righteousness is inchoate and imperfect which cannot keep us from offending and from constantly sinning in many things. Therefore we cannot in the sight of God on account of this our righteousness be esteemed righteous and good, as it becomes the sons of God to be good and holy. But the righteousness of Christ given to us is a true and perfect righteousness. It is altogether pleasing in the sight of God. In it there is nothing that offends him; that does not in the highest degree please him. We must therefore rest upon this alone (sure and stable) and on account of it alone we must believe that we are justified before God, that is, considered righteous and called righteous” (“De Justificatione,” <em>Casparis Contareni Cardinalis Opera</em> [1571], p. 592). From him Bellarmine does not differ much, who, after exerting all his strength in a defense of human merit, pressed by the consciousness of the truth, at length is brought to say “that on account of the uncertainty of personal righteousness, and the danger of vain glory, it is the safest to place our entire confidence in the mercy and kindness of God alone” (“De Justificatione,” 5.7 <em>Opera</em> [1858], 4:615). To this proposition answers this clause of his will: “And I pray him to admit me among his saints and elect, not as an estimator of merit, but as a bestower of pardon.”

            4.4.1. THE OLD TESTAMENT TERM. The Hebrew term for “to justify” is <em>hitsdik</em>, which in the great majority of cases means “to declare judicially that one’s state is in harmony with the demands of the law, Ex. 23:7; Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Isa. 5:23. The <em>piel tsiddek</em> occasionally has the same meaning, Jer. 3:11; Ezek. 16:50,51. The meaning of these words is therefore strictly forensic or legal. Since Roman Catholics, such representatives of the moral influence theory of the atonement as John Young of Edinburgh and Horace Bushnell, and also the Unitarians and modern liberal theologians, deny the legal meaning of the term “to justify,” and ascribe to it the moral sense of “to make just or righteous,” it becomes important to take careful notice of the considerations that may be urged in favor of the legal meaning. That this is the proper denotation of the word appears (a) from the terms placed in contrast with it, as, for instance “condemnation,” Deut. 25:1; Prov. 17:15; Isa. 5:23; (b) from the correlative terms placed in juxtaposition with it and which often imply a process of judgment, Gen. 18:25; Ps. 143:2; (c) from the equivalent expressions that are sometimes used, Gen. 15:6; Ps. 32:1,2; and (d) from the fact that a passage like Prov. 17:15 would yield an impossible sense, if the word meant “to make just.” The meaning would then be: He who morally improves the life of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. There are a couple of passages, however, in which the word means more than simply “to declare righteous,” namely, Isa. 53:11; Dan. 12:3. But even in these cases the sense is not “to make good or holy,” but rather “to alter the condition so that man can be considered righteous.”

          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            4.4.2. THE NEW TESTAMENT TERMS AND THEIR USE. Here we have: 
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            a. The verb <em>dikaio-o</em>. This verb means in general “to declare a person to be just. Occasionally it refers to a personal declaration that one’s moral character is in conformity with the law, Matt. 12:37; Luke 7:29; Rom. 3:4. In the Epistles of Paul the soteriological meaning of the term is clearly in the foreground. It is “to declare forensically that the demands of the law as a condition of life are fully satisfied with regard to a person, Acts 13:39; Rom. 5:1,9; 8:30-33; I Cor. 6:11; Gal. 2:16; 3:11. In the case of this word, just as in that of <em>hitsdik</em>, the forensic meaning of the term is proved by the following facts: (a) in many instances it can bear no other sense, Rom. 3:20-28; 4:5-7; 5:1; Gal. 2:16; 3:11; 5:4; (b) it is placed in antithetic relation to “condemnation” in Rom. 8:33,34; (c) equivalent and interchangeable expressions convey a judicial or legal idea, John 3:18; 5:24; Rom. 4:6,7; II Cor. 5:19; and (d) if it does not bear this meaning, there is no distinction between justification and sanctification. 
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            b. The word <em>dikaios</em>. This word, connected with the verb just discussed, is peculiar in that it never expresses what a thing is in itself, but always what it is in relation to something else, to some standard outside of it, to which it ought to correspond. In that respect it differs from <em>agathos</em>. In classical Greek, for instance, <em>dikaios</em> is applied to a wagon, a horse, or something else to indicate that it is fit for its intended use. <em>Agathos</em> expresses the idea that a thing in itself 379 answers to the ideal. In Scripture a man is called <em>dikaios</em> when, in the judgment of God, his relation to the law is what it ought to be, or when his life is such as is required by his judicial relation to God. This may include the idea that he is good, but only from a certain point of view, namely, that of his judicial relation to God. 
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            c. The noun <em>dikaiosis</em>, justification. This is found in only two places in the New Testament, namely, Rom. 4:25; 5:18. It denotes the act of God’s declaring men free from guilt and acceptable to Him. The resulting state is denoted by the word <em>dikaiosune</em>. 
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            4.4.3. The resulting idea of justification. Our word <em>justification</em> (from the Latin <em>justificare</em>, composed of <em>justus</em> and <em>facere</em>, and therefore meaning “to make righteous”), just as the Holland <em>rechtvaardigmaking</em>, is apt to give the impression that justification denotes a change that is brought about in man, which is not the case. In the use of the English word the danger is not so great, because the people in general do not understand its derivation, and in the Holland language the danger may be averted by employing the related words <em>rechtvaardigen</em> and <em>rechtvaardiging</em>. “To justify” in the Scriptural sense of the word, is to effect an objective relation, the state of righteousness, by a judicial sentence. This can be done in a twofold way: (a) by bringing into account the actual subjective condition of a person (to justify the just or the righteous), Jas. 2:21; or (b) by imputing to a person the righteousness of another, that is, by accounting him righteous though he is inwardly unrighteous. The latter is the usual sense of justification in the New Testament.
