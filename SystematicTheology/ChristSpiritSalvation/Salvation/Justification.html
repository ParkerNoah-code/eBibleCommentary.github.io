            <b>1.</b> Those whom God effectually calls, he also freely justifies,<sup>1</sup> not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous;<sup>2</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone;<sup>3</sup> not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing Christ's active obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in his death for their whole and sole righteousness by faith,<sup>4</sup> which faith they have not of themselves; it is the gift of God.<sup>5</sup> (<sup>1</sup>Rom 3:24, 8:30; <sup>2</sup>Rom 4:5-8, Eph 1:7; <sup>3</sup>1Cor 1:30-31, Rom 5:17-19; <sup>4</sup>Phil 3:8-9; Eph 2:8-10; <sup>5</sup>Jhn 1:12, Rom 5:17;)

            <b>3.</b> Christ, by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all those who are justified; and did, by the sacrifice of himself in the blood of his cross, undergoing in their stead the penalty due to them, make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in their behalf;<sup>8</sup> yet, in as much as he was given by the Father for them, and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both freely, not for anything in them,<sup>9</sup> their justification is only of free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justification of sinners.<sup>10</sup> (<sup>8</sup>Heb 10:14, 1 Pet 1:18-19, Isaiah 53:5-6; <sup>9</sup>Rom 8:32, 2 Cor 5:21; <sup>10</sup>Rom 3:26, Eph 1:6-7, 2:7;)

          Q. 70. What is justification? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justification is an act of God's free grace unto sinners,<sup>i</sup> in which he pardoneth all their sins, accepteth and accounteth their persons righteous in his sight;<sup>k</sup> not for anything wrought in them, or done by them,<sup>l</sup> but only for the perfect obedience and full satisfaction of Christ, by God imputed to them,<sup>m</sup> and received by faith alone.<sup>n</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 71. How is justification an act of God's free grace? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Although Christ, by his obedience and death, did make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to God's justice in the behalf of them that are justified;<sup>o</sup> yet inasmuch as God accepteth the satisfaction from a surety, which he might have demanded of them, and did provide this surety, his own only Son,<sup>p</sup> imputing his righteousness to them,<sup>q</sup> and requiring nothing of them for their justification but faith,<sup>r</sup> which also is his gift,<sup>s</sup> their justification is to them of free grace.<sup>t</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 72. What is justifying faith? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Justifying faith is a saving grace,<sup>u</sup> wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit<sup>w</sup> and Word of God,<sup>x</sup> whereby he, being convinced of his sin and misery, and of the disability in himself and all other creatures to recover him out of his lost condition,<sup>y</sup> not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the gospel,<sup>z</sup> but receiveth and resteth upon Christ and his righteousness, therein held forth, for pardon of sin,<sup>a</sup> and for the accepting and accounting of his person righteous in the sight of God for salvation.<sup>b</sup>
          </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>
          Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God? 
          <br><span class="tab"></span>A. Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, not because of those other graces which do always accompany it, or of good works that are the fruits of it,<sup>c</sup> nor as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him for his justification;<sup>d</sup> but only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness.<sup>e</sup>

            11.2. But that we may not stumble at the threshold, (which would be the case were we to enter on a disputation concerning a subject not understood by us,) let us first explain the meaning of these expressions. To be justified in the sight of God, To be justified by faith or by works. He is said to be justified in the sight of God who in the Divine judgment is reputed righteous, and accepted on account of his righteousness; for as iniquity is abominable to God, so no sinner can find favour in his sight, as a sinner, or so long as he is considered as such. Wherever sin is, therefore, it is accompanied with the wrath and vengeance of God. He is justified who is considered not as a sinner, but as a righteous person, and on that account stands in safety before the tribunal of God, where all sinners are confounded and ruined. As, if an innocent man be brought under an accusation before the tribunal of a just judge, when judgment is passed according to his innocence, he is said to be justified or acquitted before the judge, so he is justified before God, who, not being numbered among sinners, has God for a witness and asserter of his righteousness. Thus he must be said, therefore, to be justified by works, whose life discovers such purity and holiness, as to deserve the character of righteousness before the throne of God; or who, by the integrity of his works, can answer and satisfy the divine judgment. On the other hand, he will be justified by faith, who, being excluded from the righteousness of works, apprehends by faith the righteousness of Christ, invested in which, he appears, in the sight of God, not as a sinner, but as a righteous man. Thus we simply explain justification to be an acceptance, by which God receives us into his favour, and esteems us as righteous persons; and we say that it consists in the remission of sins and the imputation of the righteousness of Christ.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.3. For the confirmation of this point there are many plain testimonies of Scripture... I will only produce a few places, where this justification, which we speak of, is expressly handled... when Christ reprehends the Pharisees for “justifying themselves,” he does not mean that they attained righteousness by doing what was right, but that they ostentatiously endeavoured to gain the character of righteousness, of which they were destitute... But with respect to the present subject, where Paul says, “The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the heathen through faith,” what can we understand, but that God imputes righteousness through faith? Again, when he says that God “justifieth the ungodly which believeth in Jesus,” what can be the meaning, but that he delivers him by the blessing of faith from the condemnation deserved by his ungodliness? He speaks still more plainly in the conclusion, when he thus exclaims: “Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who also maketh intercession for us.” For it is just as if he had said, Who shall accuse them whom God absolves? Who shall condemn those for whom Christ intercedes? Justification, therefore, is no other than an acquittal from guilt of him who was accused, as though his innocence had been proved. Since God, therefore, justifies us through the mediation of Christ, he acquits us, not by an admission of our personal innocence, but by an imputation of righteousness; so that we, who are unrighteous in ourselves, are considered as righteous in Christ.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.14. The sophists, who amuse and delight themselves with perversion of the Scripture and vain cavils, think they have found a most excellent subterfuge, when they explain works, in these passages, to mean those which men yet unregenerate perform without the grace of Christ, merely through the unassisted efforts of their own free-will; and deny that they relate to spiritual works. Thus, according to them, a man is justified both by faith and by works, only the works are not properly his own, but the gifts of Christ and the fruits of regeneration. For they say that Paul spoke in this manner, only that the Jews, who relied on their own strength, might be convinced of their folly in arrogating righteousness to themselves, whereas it is conferred on us solely by the Spirit of Christ, not by any exertion properly our own. But they do not observe, that in the contrast of legal and evangelical righteousness, which Paul introduces in another place, all works are excluded, by what title soever they may be distinguished. For he teaches that this is the righteousness of the law, that he who has fulfilled the command of the law shall obtain salvation; but that the righteousness of faith consists in believing that Christ has died and is risen again. Besides, we shall see, as we proceed, in its proper place, that sanctification and righteousness are separate blessings of Christ. Whence it follows, that even spiritual works are not taken into the account, when the power of justifying is attributed to faith. And the assertion of Paul, in the place just cited, that Abraham has not whereof to glory before God, since he was not justified by works, ought not to be restricted to any literal appearance or external display of virtue, or to any efforts of free-will; but though the life of the patriarch was spiritual, and almost angelic, yet his works did not possess sufficient merit to justify him before God.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.15. The errors of the schoolmen, who mingle their preparations, are rather more gross; but they instil into the simple and incautious a doctrine equally corrupt, while under the pretext of the Spirit and of grace, they conceal the mercy of God, which alone can calm the terrors of the conscience. We confess, indeed, with Paul, that “the doers of the law are justified before God;” but since we are all far from being observers of the law, we conclude, that those works which should be principally available to justification, afford us no assistance, because we are destitute of them. With respect to the common Papists, or schoolmen, they are in this matter doubly deceived; both in denominating faith a certainty of conscience in expecting from God a reward of merit, and in explaining the grace of God to be, not an imputation of gratuitous righteousness, but the Spirit assisting to the pursuit of holiness. They read in the apostle, “He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” But they do not consider the manner of seeking him. And that they mistake the sense of the word “grace,” is evident from their writings. For Lombard represents justification by Christ as given us in two ways. He says, “The death of Christ justifies us, first, because it excites charity in our hearts, by which we are made actually righteous; secondly, because it destroys sin, by which the devil held us in captivity, so that now it cannot condemn us.” We see how he considers the grace of God in justification to consist in our being directed to good works by the grace of the Holy Spirit. He wished, indeed, to follow the opinion of Augustine; but he follows him at a great distance, and even deviates considerably from a close imitation of him; for whatever he finds clearly stated by him, he obscures, and whatever he finds pure in him, he corrupts. The schools have always been running into worse and worse errors, till at length they have precipitated themselves into a kind of Pelagianism. Nor, indeed, is the opinion of Augustine, or at least his manner of expression, to be altogether admitted. For though he excellently despoils man of all the praise of righteousness, and ascribes the whole to the grace of God, yet he refers grace to sanctification, in which we are regenerated by the Spirit to newness of life.
            </p>
          <p><span class="tab"></span>
            11.18. The other passage is as follows: “That no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident; for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith; but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.” How could this argument be supported, unless it were certain that works do not come into the account of faith, but are to be entirely separated [pg 670]from it? The law, he says, differs from faith. Why? Because works are required to the righteousness of the law. It follows, therefore, that works are not required to the righteousness of faith. From this statement it appears, that they who are justified by faith, are justified without the merit of works, and beyond the merit of works; for faith receives that righteousness which the gospel bestows; and the gospel differs from the law in this respect, that it does not confine righteousness to works, but rests it entirely on the mercy of God. He argues in a similar manner to the Romans, that “Abraham had not whereof to glory; for he believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness;” and by way of confirmation he subjoins, that then there is room for the righteousness of faith when there are no works which merit any reward. He tells us, that where there are works, they receive a reward “of debt,” but that what is given to faith is “of grace;” for this is the clear import of the language which he there uses. When he adds, a little after, “Therefore it is of faith” that we obtain the inheritance, in order “that it might be by grace,”1940 he infers that the inheritance is gratuitous, because it is received by faith: and why is this, but because faith, without any assistance of works, depends wholly on the Divine mercy? And in the same sense undoubtedly he elsewhere teaches us, that “the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;” because, by excluding the law, he denies that righteousness is assisted by works, or that we obtain it by working, but asserts that we come empty in order to receive it.
