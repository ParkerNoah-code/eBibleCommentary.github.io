        <p>III. Relation of the Being and Attributes of God</p>
        <p>
          Some dogmaticians devote a separate chapter or chapters to the Being
          of God, before taking up the discussion of His attributes. This is
          done, for instance, in the works of Mastricht, Ebrard, Kuyper, and
          Shedd. Others prefer to consider the Being of God in connection with
          His attributes in view of the fact that it is in these that He has
          revealed Himself. This is the more common method, which is followed in
          the Synopsis Purioris Theologiae, and in the works of Turretin, Ã 
          Marck, Brakel, Bavinck, Hodge, and Honig. This difference of treatment
          is not indicative of any serious fundamental disagreement between
          them. They are all agreed that the attributes are not mere names to
          which no reality corresponds, nor separate parts of a composite God,
          but essential qualities in which the Being of God is revealed and with
          which it can be identified. The only difference would seem to be that
          some seek to distinguish between the Being and the attributes of God
          more than others do.
        </p>
        <p>A.THE BEING OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          It is quite evident that the Being of God does not admit of any
          scientific definition. In order to give a logical definition of God,
          we would have to begin by going in search of some higher concept,
          under which God could be co-ordinated with other concepts; and would
          then have to point out the characteristics that would be applicable to
          God only. Such a genetic-synthetic definition cannot be given of God,
          since God is not one of several species of gods, which can be subsumed
          under a single genus. At most only an analytical-descriptive
          definition is possible. This merely names the characteristics of a
          person or thing, but leaves the essential being unexplained. And even
          such a definition cannot be complete but only partial, because it is
          impossible to give an exhaustive positive (as opposed to negative)
          description of God. It would consist in an enumeration of all the
          known attributes of God, and these are to a great extent negative in
          character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible never operates with an abstract concept of God, but always
          describes Him as the Living God, who enters into various relations
          with His creatures, relations which are indicative of several
          different attributes. In Kuyper's Dictaten Dogmatiek12we are told that
          God, personified as Wisdom, speaks of His essence in Pro_8:14, when He
          ascribes to Himself tushiyyach, a Hebrew word rendered "wezen" in the
          Holland translation. But this rendering is very doubtful, and the
          English rendering "counsel" deserves preference. It has also been
          pointed out that the Bible speaks of the nature of God in 2Pe_1:4, but
          this can hardly refer to the essential Being of God, for we are not
          made partakers of the divine essence. An indication of the very
          essence of God has been found in the name Jehovah, as interpreted by
          God Himself, "I am that I am." On the basis of this passage the
          essence of God was found in being itself, abstract being. And this has
          been interpreted to mean self-existence or self-contained permanence
          or absolute independence. Another passage is repeatedly quoted as
          containing an indication of the essence of God, and as the closest
          approach to a definition that is found in the Bible, namely, Joh_4:24,
          "God is Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship in spirit and
          truth." This statement of Christ is clearly indicative of the
          spirituality of God. The two ideas derived from these passages occur
          repeatedly in theology as designations of the very Being of God. On
          the whole it may be said that Scripture does not exalt one attribute
          of God at the expense of the others, but represents them as existing
          in perfect harmony in the Divine Being. It may be true that now one,
          and then another attribute is stressed, but Scripture clearly intends
          to give due emphasis to every one of them. The Being of God is
          characterized by a depth, a fullness, a variety, and a glory far
          beyond our comprehension, and the Bible represents it as a glorious
          harmonious whole, without any inherent contradictions. And this
          fullness of life finds expression in no other way than in the
          perfections of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the early Church Fathers were clearly under the influence of
          Greek philosophy in their doctrine of God and, as Seeberg expresses
          it, did not advance "beyond the mere abstract conception that the
          Divine Being is absolute attributeless Existence." For some time
          theologians were rather generally inclined to emphasize the
          transcendence of God, and to assume the impossibility of any adequate
          knowledge or definition of the divine essence. During the trinitarian
          controversy the distinction between the one essence and the three
          persons in the Godhead was strongly emphasized, but the essence was
          generally felt to be beyond human comprehension. Gregory of Nazianze,
          however, ventures to say: "So far as we can discern, ho on and ho
          theos are somehow more than other terms the names of the (divine)
          essence, and of these ho on is the preferable." He regards this as a
          description of absolute being. Augustine's conception of the essence
          of God was closely akin to that of Gregory. In the Middle Ages too
          there was a tendency, either to deny that man has any knowledge of the
          essence of God, or to reduce such knowledge to a minimum. In some
          cases one attribute was singled out as most expressive of the essence
          of God. Thus Thomas Aquinas spoke of His aseity or self-existence, and
          Duns Scotus, of His infinity. It became quite common also to speak of
          God as actus purus in view of His simplicity. The Reformers and their
          successors also spoke of the essence of God as incomprehensible, but
          they did not exclude all knowledge of it, though Luther used very
          strong language on this point. They stressed the unity, simplicity,
          and spirituality of God. The words of the Belgic Confession are quite
          characteristic: "We all believe with the heart, and confess with the
          mouth, that there is one only simple and spiritual Being, which we
          call God."13 Later on philosophers and theologians found the essence
          of God in abstract being, in universal substance, in pure thought, in
          absolute causality, in love, in personality, and in majestic holiness
          or the numinous.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOWING THE BEING OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          From the preceding it already appears that the question as to the
          possibility of knowing God in His essential Being engaged the best
          minds of the Church from the earliest centuries. And the consensus of
          opinion in the early Church, during the Middle Ages, and at the time
          of the Reformation, was that God in His inmost Being is the
          Incomprehensible One. And in some cases the language used is so strong
          that it seemingly allows of no knowledge of the Being of God
          whatsoever. At the same time they who use it, at least in some cases,
          seem to have considerable knowledge of the Being of God.
          Misunderstanding can easily result from a failure to understand the
          exact question under consideration, and from neglecting to
          discriminate between "knowing" and "comprehending." The Scholastics
          spoke of three questions to which all the speculations respecting the
          Divine Being could be reduced, namely: An sit Deus? Quid sit Deus? and
          Qualis sit Deus?The first question concerns the existence of God, the
          second, His nature or essence, and the third, His attributes. In this
          paragraph it is particularly the second question that calls for
          attention. The question then is, What is God? What is the nature of
          His inner constitution? What makes Him to be what He is? In order to
          answer that question adequately, we would have to be able to
          comprehend God and to offer a satisfactory explanation of His Divine
          Being, and this is utterly impossible. The finite cannot comprehend
          the Infinite. The question of Zophar, "Canst thou by searching find
          out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?" (Job_11:7)
          has the force of a strong negative. And if we consider the second
          question entirely apart from the third, our negative answer becomes
          even more inclusive. Apart from the revelation of God in His
          attributes, we have no knowledge of the Being of God whatsoever. But
          in so far as God reveals Himself in His attributes, we also have some
          knowledge of His Divine Being, though even so our knowledge is subject
          to human limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luther uses some very strong expressions respecting our inability to
          know something of the Being or essence of God. On the one hand he
          distinguishes between the Deus absconditus (hidden God) and the Deus
          revelatus (revealed God); but on the other hand he also asserts that
          in knowing the Deus revelatus, we only know Him in his hiddenness. By
          this he means that even in His revelation God has not manifested
          Himself entirely as He is essentially but as to His essence still
          remains shrouded in impenetrable darkness. We know God only in so far
          as He enters into relations with us. Calvin too speaks of the Divine
          essence as incomprehensible. He holds that God in the depths of His
          Being is past finding out. Speaking of the knowledge of the quid and
          of the qualis of God, he says that it is rather useless to speculate
          about the former, while our practical interest lies in the latter.
          Says he: "They are merely toying with frigid speculations whose mind
          is set on the question of what God is (quid sit Deus), when what it
          really concerns us to know is rather what kind of a person He is
          (qualis sit) and what is appropriate to His nature."14 While he feels
          that God cannot be known to perfection, he does not deny that we can
          know something of His Being or nature. But this knowledge cannot be
          obtained by a priori methods, but only in an a posteriori manner
          through the attributes, which he regards as real determinations of the
          nature of God. They convey to us at least some knowledge of what God
          is, but especially of what He is in relation to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          In dealing with our knowledge of the Being of God we must certainly
          avoid the position of Cousin, rather rare in the history of
          philosophy, that God even in the depths of His Being is not at all
          incomprehensible but essentially intelligible; but we must also steer
          clear of the agnosticism of Hamilton and Mansel, according to which we
          can have no knowledge whatsoever of the Being of God. We cannot
          comprehend God, cannot have an absolute and exhaustive knowledge of
          Him, but we can undoubtedly have a relative or partial knowledge of
          the Divine Being. It is perfectly true that this knowledge of God is
          possible only, because He has placed Himself in certain relations to
          His moral creatures and has revealed Himself to them, and that even
          this knowledge is humanly conditioned; but it is nevertheless real and
          true knowledge, and is at least a partial knowledge of the absolute
          nature of God. There is a difference between an absolute knowledge,
          and a relative or partial knowledge of an absolute being. It will not
          do at all to say that man knows only the relations in which God stands
          to His creatures. It would not even be possible to have a proper
          conception of these relations without knowing something of both God
          and man. To say that we can know nothing of the Being of God, but can
          know only relations, is equivalent to saying that we cannot know Him
          at all and cannot make Him the object of our religion. Dr. Orr says:
          "We may not know God in the depths of His absolute being. But we can
          at least know Him in so far as He reveals Himself in His relation to
          us. The question, therefore, is not as to the possibility of a
          knowledge of God in the unfathomableness of His being, but is: Can we
          know God as He enters into relations with the world and with
          ourselves? God has entered into relations with us in His revelations
          of Himself, and supremely in Jesus Christ; and we Christians humbly
          claim that through this Self-revelation we do know God to be the true
          God, and have real acquaintance with His character and will. Neither
          is it correct to say that this knowledge which we have of God is only
          a relative knowledge. It is in part a knowledge of the absolute nature
          of God as well."15 The last statements are probably intended to ward
          off the idea that all our knowledge of God is merely relative to the
          human mind, so that we have no assurance that it corresponds with the
          reality as it exists in God.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE BEING OF GOD REVEALED IN HIS ATTRIBUTES</p>
        <p>
          From the simplicity of God it follows that God and His attributes are
          one. The attributes cannot be considered as so many parts that enter
          into the composition of God, for God is not, like men, composed of
          different parts. Neither can they be regarded as something added to
          the Being of God, though the name, derived from ad and tribuere, might
          seem to point in that direction, for no addition was ever made to the
          Being of God, who is eternally perfect. It is commonly said in
          theology that God's attributes are God Himself, as He has revealed
          Himself to us. The Scholastics stressed the fact that God is all that
          He has. He has life, light, wisdom, love, righteousness, and it may be
          said on the basis of Scripture that He is life, light, wisdom, love,
          and righteousness. It was further asserted by the Scholastics that the
          whole essence of God is identical with each one of the attributes, so
          that God's knowing is God, God's willing is God, and so on. Some of
          them even went so far as to say that each attribute is identical with
          every other attribute, and that there are no logical distinctions in
          God. This is a very dangerous extreme. While it may be said that there
          is an interpenetration of the attributes in God, and that they form a
          harmonious whole, we are moving in the direction of Pantheism, when we
          rule out all distinctions in God, and say that His self-existence is
          His infinity, His knowing is His willing, His love is His
          righteousness, and vice versa. It was characteristic of the
          Nominalists that they obliterated all real distinctions in God. They
          were afraid that by assuming real distinctions in Him, corresponding
          to the attributes ascribed to God, they would endanger the unity and
          simplicity of God, and were therefore motivated by a laudable purpose.
          According to them the perfections of the Divine Being exist only in
          our thoughts, without any corresponding reality in the Divine Being.
          The Realists, on the other hand, asserted the reality of the divine
          perfections. They realized that the theory of the Nominalists,
          consistently carried out, would lead in the direction of a pantheistic
          denial of a personal God, and therefore considered it of the utmost
          importance to maintain the objective reality of the attributes in God.
          At the same time they sought to safeguard the unity and simplicity of
          God by maintaining that the whole essence is in each attribute: God is
          All in all, All in each. Thomas Aquinas had the same purpose in mind,
          when he asserted that the attributes do not reveal what God is in
          Himself, in the depths of His Being, but only what He is in relation
          to His creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, we should guard against separating the divine essence and
          the divine attributes or perfections, and also against a false
          conception of the relation in which they stand to each other. The
          attributes are real determinations of the Divine Being or, in other
          words, qualities that inhere in the Being of God. Shedd speaks of them
          as "an analytical and closer description of the essence."16 In a sense
          they are identical, so that it can be said that God's perfections are
          God Himself as He has revealed Himself to us. It is possible to go
          even farther and say with Shedd, "The whole essence is in each
          attribute, and the attribute in the essence."17 And because of the
          close relation in which the two stand to each other, it can be said
          that knowledge of the attributes carries with it knowledge of the
          Divine Essence. It would be a mistake to conceive of the essence of
          God as existing by itself and prior to the attributes, and of the
          attributes as additive and accidental characteristics of the Divine
          Being. They are essential qualities of God, which inhere in His very
          Being and are co-existent with it. These qualities cannot be altered
          without altering the essential Being of God. And since they are
          essential qualities, each one of them reveals to us some aspect of the
          Being of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: How can we distinguish between the being,
          the nature, and the essence of God? How do the philosophical views of
          the essential Being of God generally differ from the theological
          views? How about the tendency to find the essence of God in the
          absolute, in love, or in personality? What does Otto mean when he
          characterizes it as "the Holy" or "the Numinous"? Why is it impossible
          for man to comprehend God? Has sin in any way affected man's ability
          to know God? Is there any difference between Luther's and Barth's
          conception of the "hidden God"? Does Calvin differ from them on this
          point? Did Luther share the Nominalist views of Occam, by whom he was
          influenced in other respects? How did the Reformers, in distinction
          from the Scholastics, consider the problem of the existence of God?
          Could we have any knowledge of God, if He were pure attributeless
          being? What erroneous views of the attributes should be avoided? What
          is the proper view?
