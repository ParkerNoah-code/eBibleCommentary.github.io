        <p>I. Soteriology in General</p>
        <p>A. CONNECTION BETWEEN SOTERIOLOGY AND THE PRECEDING LOCI.</p>
        <p>
          SOTERIOLOGY deals with the communication of the blessings of salvation
          to the sinner and his restoration to divine favor and to a life in
          intimate communion with God. It presupposes knowledge of God as the
          all-sufficient source of the life, the strength, and the happiness of
          mankind, and of man's utter dependence on Him for the present and the
          future. Since it deals with restoration, redemption, and renewal, it
          can only be understood properly in the light of the original condition
          of man as created in the image of God, and of the subsequent
          disturbance of the proper relationship between man and his God by the
          entrance of sin into the world. Moreover, since it treats of the
          salvation of the sinner wholly as a work of God, known to Him from all
          eternity, it naturally carries our thoughts back to the eternal
          counsel of peace and the covenant of grace, in which provision was
          made for the redemption of fallen men. It proceeds on the assumption
          of the completed work of Christ as the Mediator of redemption. There
          is the closest possible connection between Christology and
          Soteriology. Some, as, for instance, Hodge, treat of both under the
          common heading "Soteriology." Christology then becomes objective, as
          distinguished from subjective, Soteriology. In defining the contents
          of Soteriology, it is better to say that it deals with the application
          of the work of redemption than to say that it treats of the
          appropriation of salvation. The matter should be studied theologically
          rather than anthropologically. The work of God rather than the work of
          man is definitely in the foreground. Pope objects to the use of the
          former term, since in using it "we are in danger of the predestinarian
          error which assumes that the finished work of Christ is applied to the
          individual according to the fixed purpose of an election of grace."
          This is the very reason why a Calvinist prefers to use that term. To
          do Pope justice, however, it should be added that he also objects to
          the other term, because it "tends to the other and Pelagian extreme,
          too obviously making the atoning provision of Christ a matter of
          individual free acceptance or rejection." He prefers to speak of " the
          administration of redemption," which is indeed a very good term.1
        </p>
        <p>B. THE ORDO SALUTIS, (ORDER OF SALVATION).</p>
        <p>
          The Germans speak of "Heilsaneignung," the Dutch, of "Heilsweg" and
          "Orde des Heils," and the English, of the "Way of Salvation." The ordo
          salutis describes the process by which the work of salvation, wrought
          in Christ, is subjectively realized in the hearts and lives of
          sinners. It aims at describing in their logical order, and also in
          their interrelations, the various movements of the Holy Spirit in the
          application of the work of redemption. The emphasis is not on what man
          does in appropriating the grace of God, but on what God does in
          applying it. It is but natural that Pelagians should object to this
          view. The desire to simplify the ordo salutis often led to unwarranted
          limitations. Weizsaecker would include in it only the operations of
          the Holy Spirit wrought in the heart of man, and holds that neither
          calling nor justification can properly be included under this
          category.2 Kaftan, the most prominent Ritschlian dogmatician, is of
          the opinion that the traditional ordo salutis does not constitute an
          inner unity and therefore ought to be dissolved. He treats of calling
          under the Word as a means of grace; of regeneration, justification,
          and the mystical union, under the redemptive work of Christ; and
          relegates conversion and sanctification to the domain of Christian
          ethics. The result is that only faith is left, and this constitutes
          the ordo salutis.3 According to him the ordo salutis should include
          only what is required on the part of man unto salvation, and this is
          faith, faith only, â€” a purely anthropological point of view, which
          probably finds its explanation in the tremendous emphasis of Lutheran
          theology on active faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we speak of an ordo salutis we do not forget that the work of
          applying the grace of God to the individual sinner is a unitary
          process, but simply stress the fact that various movements can be
          distinguished in the process, that the work of the application of
          redemption proceeds in a definite and reasonable order, and that God
          does not impart the fulness of His salvation to the sinner in a single
          act. Had He done this, the work of redemption would not have come to
          the consciousness of God's children in all its aspects and in all its
          divine fulness. Neither do we lose sight of the fact that we often use
          the terms employed to describe the various movements in a more limited
          sense than the Bible does.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question may be raised, whether the Bible ever indicates a
          definite ordo salutis. The answer to that question is that, while it
          does not explicitly furnish us with a complete order of salvation, it
          offers us a sufficient basis for such an order. The nearest approach
          found in Scripture to anything like an ordo salutis, is the statement
          of Paul in Rom_8:29-30. Some of the Lutheran theologians based their
          enumeration of the various movements in the application of redemption
          rather artificially on Act_26:17-18. But while the Bible does not give
          us a clear-cut ordo salutis, it does do two things which enable us to
          construe such an order. (1) It furnishes us with a very full and rich
          enumeration of the operations of the Holy Spirit in applying the work
          of Christ to individual sinners, and of the blessings of salvation
          imparted to them. In doing this, it does not always use the very terms
          employed in Dogmatics, but frequently resorts to the use of other
          names and to figures of speech. Moreover, it often employs terms which
          have now acquired a very definite technical meaning in Dogmatics, in a
          far wider sense. Such words as regeneration, calling, conversion, and
          renewal repeatedly serve to designate the whole change that is brought
          about in the inner life of man. (2) It indicates in many passages and
          in various ways the relation in which the different movements in the
          work of redemption stand to each other. It teaches that we are
          justified by faith and not by works, Rom_3:30; Rom_5:1; Gal_2:16-20;
          that, being justified, we have peace with God and access to Him,
          Rom_5:1-2; that we are set free from sin to become servants of
          righteousness, and to reap the fruit of sanctification, Rom_6:18;
          Rom_6:22; that when we are adopted as children, we receive the Spirit
          who gives us assurance, and also become co- heirs with Christ,
          Rom_8:15-17; Gal_4:4-6; that faith comes by the hearing of the word of
          God, Rom_10:17; that death unto the law results in life unto God,
          Gal_2:19-20; that when we believe, we are sealed with the Spirit of
          God, Eph_1:13-14; that it is necessary to walk worthily of the calling
          with which we are called, Eph_4:1-2; that having obtained the
          righteousness of God by faith, we share the sufferings of Christ, and
          also the power of His resurrection, Php_3:9-10; and that we are
          begotten again through the Word of God, 1Pe_1:23. These and similar
          passages indicate the relation of the various movements of the
          redemptive work to one another, and thus afford a basis for the
          construction of an ordo salutis.
        </p>
        <p>
          In view of the fact that the Bible does not specify the exact order
          that applies in the application of the work of redemption, there is
          naturally considerable room for a difference of opinion. And as a
          matter of fact the Churches are not all agreed as to the ordo salutis.
          The doctrine of the order of salvation is a fruit of the Reformation.
          Hardly any semblance of it is found in the works of the Scholastics.
          In pre-Reformation theology scant justice is done to soteriology in
          general. It does not constitute a separate locus, and its constituent
          parts are discussed under other rubrics, more or less as disjecta
          membra. Even the greatest of the Schoolmen, such as Peter the Lombard
          and Thomas Aquinas, pass on at once from the discussion of the
          incarnation to that of the Church and the sacraments. What may be
          called their soteriology consists of only two chapters, de Fide et de
          Poenitentia. The bona opera also receive considerable attention. Since
          Protestantism took its start from the criticism and displacement of
          the Roman Catholic conception of faith, repentance, and good works, it
          was but natural that the interest of the Reformers should center on
          the origin and development of the new life in Christ. Calvin was the
          first to group the various parts of the order of salvation in a
          systematic way, but even his representation, says Kuyper, is rather
          subjective, since it formally stresses the human activity rather than
          the divine.4 Later Reformed theologians corrected this defect. The
          following representations of the order of salvation reflect the
          fundamental conceptions of the way of salvation that characterize the
          various Churches since the Reformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE REFORMED VIEW. Proceeding on the assumption that man's
          spiritual condition depends on his state, that is, on his relation to
          the law; and that it is only on the basis of the imputed righteousness
          of Jesus Christ that the sinner can be delivered from the corrupting
          and destructive influence of sin, â€” Reformed Soteriology takes its
          starting point in the union established in the pactum salutis between
          Christ and those whom the Father has given Him, in virtue of which
          there is an eternal imputation of the righteousness of Christ to those
          who are His. In view of this precedence of the legal over the moral
          some theologians, such as Maccovius, Comrie, A. Kuyper Sr., and A.
          Kuyper Jr., begin the ordo salutis with justification rather than
          regeneration. In doing this they apply the name "justification" also
          to the ideal imputation of the righteousness of Christ to the elect in
          the eternal counsel of God. Dr. Kuyper further says that the Reformed
          differ from the Lutherans in that the former teach justification per
          justitiam Christi, while the latter represent the justification per
          fidem as completing the work of Christ.5 The great majority of
          Reformed theologians, however, while presupposing the imputation of
          the righteousness of Christ in the pactum salutis discuss only
          justification by faith in the order of salvation, and naturally take
          up its discussion in connection with or immediately after that of
          faith. They begin the ordo salutis with regeneration or with calling,
          and thus emphasize the fact that the application of the redemptive
          work of Christ is in its incipiency a work of God. This is followed by
          a discussion of conversion, in which the work of regeneration
          penetrates to the conscious life of the sinner, and he turns from
          self, the world, and Satan, to God. Conversion includes repentance and
          faith, but because of its great importance the latter is generally
          treated separately. The discussion of faith naturally leads to that of
          justification, inasmuch as this is mediated to us by faith. And
          because justification places man in a new relation to God, which
          carries with it the gift of the Spirit of adoption, and which obliges
          man to a new obedience and also enables him to do the will of God from
          the heart, the work of sanctification next comes into consideration.
          Finally, the order of salvation is concluded with the doctrine of the
          perseverance of the saints and their final glorification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bavinck distinguishes three groups in the blessings of salvation. He
          starts out by saying that sin is guilt, pollution, and misery, for it
          involves a breaking of the covenant of works, a loss of the image of
          God, and a subjection to the power of corruption. Christ delivered us
          from these three by His suffering, His meeting the demands of the law,
          and His victory over death. Consequently, the blessings of Christ
          consist in the following: (a) He restores the right relation of man to
          God and to all creatures by justification, including the forgiveness
          of sins, the adoption of children, peace with God, and glorious
          liberty. (b) He renews man in the image of God by regeneration,
          internal calling, conversion, renewal, and sanctification. (c) He
          preserves man for his eternal inheritance, delivers him from suffering
          and death, and puts him in possession of eternal salvation by
          preservation, perseverance, and glorification. The first group of
          blessings is granted unto us by the illumination of the Holy Spirit,
          is accepted by faith, and sets our conscience free. The second is
          imparted to us by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, renews us,
          and redeems us from the power of sin. And the third flows to us by the
          preserving, guiding, and sealing work of the Holy Spirit as the
          earnest of our complete redemption, and delivers us, body and soul,
          from the dominion of misery and death. The first group anoints us as
          prophets, the second, as priests, and the third, as kings. In
          connection with the first we look back to the completed work of Christ
          on the cross, where our sins were atoned; in connection with the
          second we look up to the living Lord in heaven, who as High Priest is
          seated at the right hand of the Father; and in connection with the
          third we look forward to the future coming of Jesus Christ, in which
          He will subject all enemies and will surrender the kingdom to the
          Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some things that should be borne in mind in connection with
          the ordo salutis, as it appears in Reformed theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Some of the terms are not always used in the same sense. The term
          justification is generally limited to what is called justification by
          faith, but is sometimes made to cover an objective justification of
          the elect in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the imputation of
          the righteousness of Christ to them in the pactum salutis. Again, the
          word regeneration, which now generally designates that act of God by
          which He imparts the principle of the new life to man, is also used to
          designate the new birth or the first manifestation of the new life,
          and in the theology of the seventeenth century frequently occurs as
          synonymous with conversion or even sanctification. Some speak of it as
          passive conversion in distinction from conversion proper, which is
          then called active conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Several other distinctions also deserve attention. We should
          carefully distinguish between the judicial and the recreative acts of
          God, the former (as justification) altering the state, and the latter
          (as regeneration, conversion), the condition of the sinner; â€”
          between the work of the Holy Spirit in the subconscious
          (regeneration), and that in the conscious life (conversion); â€”
          between that which pertains to the putting away of the old man
          (repentance, crucifying of the old man), and that which constitutes
          the putting on of the new man (regeneration and in part
          sanctification); â€” and between the beginning of the application of
          the work of redemption (in regeneration and conversion proper), and
          the continuation of it (in daily conversion and sanctification).
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In connection with the various movements in the work of application
          we should bear in mind that the judicial acts of God constitute the
          basis for His recreative acts, so that justification, though not
          temporally, is yet logically prior to all the rest; â€” that the work
          of God's grace in the subconscious, precedes that in the conscious
          life, so that regeneration precedes conversion; â€” and that the
          judicial acts of God (justification, including the forgiveness of sins
          and the adoption of children) always address themselves to the
          consciousness, while of the recreative acts one, namely, regeneration,
          takes place in the subconscious life.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE LUTHERAN VIEW. The Lutherans, while not denying the doctrines
          of election, the mystical union, and the imputation of the
          righteousness of Christ, do not take their starting point in any one
          of these. They fully recognize the fact that the subjective
          realization of the work of redemption in the hearts and lives of
          sinners is a work of divine grace, but at the same time give a
          representation of the ordo salutis which places the main emphasis on
          what is done a parte hominis (on the part of man) rather than on what
          is done a parte Dei (on the part of God). They see in faith first of
          all a gift of God, but at the same time make faith, regarded more
          particularly as an active principle in man and as an activity of man,
          the all-determining factor in their order of salvation. Says Pieper:
          "So kommt denn hinsichtlich der Heilsaneignung alles darauf an, dass
          im Menschen der Glaube an das Evangelium entstehe."6 Attention was
          already called to the fact that Kaftan regards faith as the whole of
          the ordo salutis. This emphasis on faith as an active principle is
          undoubtedly due to the fact that in the Lutheran Reformation the
          doctrine of justification by faith â€” often called the material
          principle of the Reformation â€” was very much in the foreground.
          According to Pieper the Lutheran takes his starting point in the fact
          that in Christ God is reconciled to the world of humanity. God
          announces this fact to man in the gospel and offers to put man
          subjectively in possession of that forgiveness of sins or
          justification which was objectively wrought in Christ. This calling is
          always accompanied with a certain measure of illumination and of
          quickening, so that man receives the power to not-resist the saving
          operation of the Holy Spirit. It frequently results in repentance, and
          this may issue in regeneration, by which the Holy Spirit endows the
          sinner with saving grace. Now all these, namely, calling,
          illumination, repentance, and regeneration, are really only
          preparatory, and are strictly speaking not yet blessings of the
          covenant of grace. They are experienced apart from any living relation
          to Christ, and merely serve to lead the sinner to Christ.
          "Regeneration is conditioned by the conduct of man with regard to the
          influence exerted upon him," and therefore "will take place at once or
          gradually, as man's resistance is greater or less."7 In it man is
          endowed with a saving faith by which he appropriates the forgiveness
          or justification that is objectively given in Christ, is adopted as a
          child of God, is united to Christ in a mystical union, and receives
          the spirit of renewal and sanctification, the living principle of a
          life of obedience. The permanent possession of all these blessings
          depends on the continuance of faith, â€” on an active faith on the
          part of man. If man continues to believe, he has peace and joy, life
          and salvation; but if he ceases to exercise faith, all this becomes
          doubtful, uncertain, and amissible. There is always a possibility that
          the believer will lose all that he possesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC VIEW. In Roman Catholic theology the doctrine of
          the Church precedes the discussion of the ordo salutis. Children are
          regenerated by baptism, but they who first become acquainted with the
          gospel in later life receive a gratia sufficiens, consisting in an
          illumination of the mind and a strengthening of the will. Man can
          resist this grace, but can also assent to it. If he assents to it, it
          turns into a gratia co- operans, in which man co-operates to prepare
          himself for justification. This preparation consists of seven parts:
          (a) a believing acceptance of the Word of God, (b) an insight into
          one's sinful condition, (c) hope in the mercy of God, (d) the
          beginning of love to God, (e) an abhorrence of sin, (f) a resolve to
          obey the commandments of God, and (g) a desire for baptism. It is
          quite evident that faith does not occupy a central place here, but is
          simply co-ordinated with the other preparations. It is merely an
          intellectual assent to the doctrines of the Church (fides informis)
          and acquires its justifying power only through the love that is
          imparted in the gratia infusa (fides caritate formata). It can be
          called justifying faith only in the sense that it is the basis and
          root of all justification as the first of the preparations named
          above. After this preparation justification itself follows in baptism.
          This consists in the infusion of grace, of supernatural virtues,
          followed by the forgiveness of sins. The measure of this forgiveness
          is commensurate with the degree in which sin is actually overcome. It
          should be borne in mind that justification is given freely, and is not
          merited by the preceding preparations. The gift of justification is
          preserved by obeying the commandments and by doing good works. In the
          gratia infusa man receives the supernatural strength to do good works
          and thus to merit (with a merit de condigno that is, real merit) all
          following grace and even everlasting life. The grace of God thus
          serves the purpose of enabling man once more to merit salvation. But
          it is not certain that man will retain the forgiveness of sins. The
          grace of justification may be lost, not only through unbelief, but
          through any mortal sin. It may be regained, however, by the sacrament
          of penance, consisting of contrition (or, attrition) and confession,
          together with absolution and works of satisfaction. Both the guilt of
          sin and eternal punishment are removed by absolution, but temporal
          penalties can be canceled only by works of satisfaction.

          4. THE ARMINIAN VIEW. The Arminian order of salvation, while
          ostensibly ascribing the work of salvation to God, really makes it
          contingent on the attitude and the work of man. God opens up the
          possibility of salvation for man, but it is up to man to improve the
          opportunity. The Arminian regards the atonement of Christ "as an
          oblation and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world" (Pope),
          that is, for the sins of every individual of the human race. He denies
          that the guilt of Adam's sin is imputed to all his descendants, and
          that man is by nature totally depraved, and therefore unable to do any
          spiritual good; and believes that, while human nature is undoubtedly
          injured and deteriorated as the result of the fall, man is still able,
          by nature, to do that which is spiritually good and to turn to God.
          But because of the evil bias, the perverseness, and the sluggishness
          of sinful human nature, God imparts to it gracious assistance. He
          bestows sufficient grace upon all men to enable them, if they choose,
          to attain to the full possession of spiritual blessings, and
          ultimately to salvation. The gospel offer comes to all men
          indiscriminately and exerts a merely moral influence on them, while
          they have it in their power to resist it or to yield to it. If they
          yield to it, they will turn to Christ in repentance and faith. These
          movements of the soul are not (as in Calvinism) the results of
          regeneration, but are merely introductory to the state of grace
          properly so called. When their faith really terminates in Christ, this
          faith is, for the sake of the merits of Christ, imputed to them for
          righteousness. This does not mean that the righteousness of Christ is
          imputed to them as their very own, but that, in view of what Christ
          did for sinners, their faith, which involves the principle of
          obedience, honesty of heart, and good dispositions, is accepted in
          lieu of a perfect obedience and is reckoned to them for righteousness.
          On this basis, then, they are justified, which in the Arminian scheme
          generally simply means that their sins are pardoned, and not that they
          are accepted as righteous. Arminians often put it in this form: The
          forgiveness of sins is based on the merits of Christ, but acceptance
          with God rests on man's obedience to the law or evangelical obedience.
          Faith not only serves to justify, but also to regenerate sinners. It
          insures to man the grace of evangelical obedience and this, if allowed
          to function through life, issues in the grace of perseverance.
          However, the grace of God is always resistible and amissible.

          The so-called Wesleyan or Evangelical Arminian does not entirely agree
          with the Arminianism of the seventeenth century. While his position
          shows greater affinity with Calvinism than the original Arminianism
          does, it is also more inconsistent. It admits that the guilt of Adam's
          sin is imputed to all his descendants, but at the same time holds that
          all men are justified in Christ, and that therefore this guilt is at
          once removed, at birth. It also admits the entire moral depravity of
          man in the state of nature, but goes on to stress the fact that no man
          exists in that state of nature, since there is a universal application
          of the work of Christ through the Holy Spirit, by which the sinner is
          enabled to co-operate with the grace of God. It emphasizes the
          necessity of a supernatural (hyper- physical) work of grace to effect
          the sinner's renovation and sanctification. Moreover, it teaches the
          doctrine of Christian perfection or entire sanctification in the
          present life. It may be added that, while Arminius made the bestowal
          on man of an ability to co- operate with God a matter of justice,
          Wesley regarded this as a matter of pure grace. This is the type of
          Arminianism with which we mostly come in contact. We meet with it, not
          only in the Methodist Church, but also in large sections of other
          Churches, and especially in the many undenominational Churches of the
          present day.
