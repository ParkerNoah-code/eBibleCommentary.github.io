        <p>IV. The Names of God</p>
        <p>A. THE NAMES OF GOD IN GENERAL</p>
        <p>
          While the Bible records several names of God, it also speaks of the
          name of God in the singular as, for instance in the following
          statements: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
          vain," Exo_20:7; "How excellent is thy name in all the earth,"
          Psa_8:1; "As is thy name, O God, so is thy praise," Psa_48:10; "His
          name is great in Israel," Psa_76:2; "The name of Jehovah is a strong
          tower; the righteous runneth into it and is safe," Pro_18:10. In such
          cases "the name" stands for the whole manifestation of God in His
          relation to His people, or simply for the person, so that it becomes
          synonymous with God. This usage is due to the fact that in oriental
          thought a name was never regarded as a mere vocable, but as an
          expression of the nature of the thing designated. To know the name of
          a person was to have power over him, and the names of the various gods
          were used in incantations to exercise power over them. In the most
          general sense of the word, then, the name of God is His
          self-revelation. It is a designation of Him, not as He exists in the
          depths of His divine Being, but as He reveals Himself especially in
          His relations to man. For us the one general name of God is split up
          into many names, expressive of the many-sided Being of God. It is only
          because God has revealed Himself in His name (nomen editum), that we
          can now designate Him by that name in various forms (nomina indita).
          The names of God are not of human invention, but of divine origin,
          though they are all borrowed from human language, and derived from
          human and earthly relations. They are anthropomorphic and mark a
          condescending approach of God to man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The names of God constitute a difficulty for human thought. God is the
          Incomprehensible One, infinitely exalted above all that is temporal;
          but in His names He descends to all that is finite and becomes like
          unto man. On the one hand we cannot name Him, and on the other hand He
          has many names. How can this be explained? On what grounds are these
          names applied to the infinite and incomprehensible God? It should be
          borne in mind that they are not of man's invention, and do not testify
          to his insight into the very Being of God. They are given by God
          Himself with the assurance that they contain in a measure a revelation
          of the Divine Being. This was made possible by the fact that the world
          and all its relations is and was meant to be a revelation of God.
          Because the Incomprehensible One revealed Himself in His creatures, it
          is possible for man to name Him after the fashion of a creature. In
          order to make Himself known to man, God had to condescend to the level
          of man, to accommodate Himself to the limited and finite human
          consciousness, and to speak in human language. If the naming of God
          with anthropomorphic names involves a limitation of God, as some say,
          then this must be true to an even greater degree of the revelation of
          God in creation. Then the world does not reveal, but rather conceals,
          God; then man is not related to God, but simply forms an antithesis to
          Him; and then we are shut up to a hopeless agnosticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what was said about the name of God in general it follows that we
          can include under the names of God not only the appellatives by which
          He is indicated as an independent personal Being and by which He is
          addressed, but also the attributes of God; and then not merely the
          attributes of the Divine Being in general, but also those that qualify
          the separate Persons of the Trinity. Dr. Bavinck bases his division of
          the names of God on that broad conception of them, and distinguishes
          between nomina propria (proper names), nomina essentialia (essential
          names, or attributes), and nomina personalia (personal names, as
          Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). In the present chapter we limit
          ourselves to the discussion of the first class.
        </p>
        <p>B. THE OLD TESTAMENT NAMES AND THEIR MEANING</p>
        <p>
          1. 'EL 'ELOHIM, and 'ELYON. The most simple name by which God is
          designated in the Old Testament, is the name 'El which is possibly
          derived from 'ul, either in the sense of being first, being lord, or
          in that of being strong and mighty. The name ' Elohim (sing. 'Eloah)
          is probably derived from the same root, or from 'alah, to be smitten
          with fear; and therefore points to God as the strong and mighty One,
          or as the object of fear. The name seldom occurs in the singular,
          except in poetry. The plural is to be regarded as intensive, and
          therefore serves to indicate a fulness of power. The name 'Elyon is
          derived from ' alah, to go up, to be elevated, and designates God as
          the high and exalted One, Gen_14:19-20; Num_24:16; Isa_14:14. It is
          found especially in poetry. These names are not yet nomina propria in
          the strict sense of the word, for they are also used of idols,
          Psa_95:3; Psa_96:5, of men, Gen_33:10; Exo_7:1, and of rulers,
          Jdg_5:8; Exo_21:6; Exo_22:8-10; Psa_82:1
        </p>
        <p>
          'ADONAI. This name is related in meaning to the preceding ones. It is
          derived from either dun (din) or 'adan, both of which mean to judge,
          to rule, and thus points to God as the almighty Ruler, to whom
          everything is subject, and to whom man is related as a servant. In
          earlier times it was the usual name by which the people of Israel
          addressed God. Later on it was largely supplanted by the name Jehovah
          (Yahweh). All the names so far mentioned describe God as the high and
          exalted One, the transcendent God. The following names point to the
          fact that this exalted Being condescended to enter into relations with
          His creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. SHADDAI and 'EL SHADDAI. The name Shaddai is derived from shadad,
          to be powerful, and points to God as possessing all power in heaven
          and on earth. Others, however, derive it from shad lord. It differs in
          an important point from 'Elohim, the God of creation and nature, in
          that it contemplates God as subjecting all the powers of nature and
          making them subservient to the work of divine grace. While it stresses
          the greatness of God, it does not represent Him as an object of fear
          and terror, but as a source of blessing and comfort. It is the name
          with which God appeared unto Abraham, the father of the faithful,
          Exo_6:22.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. YAHWEH and YAHWEH TSEBHAOTH. It is especially in the name Yahweh,
          which gradually supplanted earlier names, that God reveals Himself as
          the God of grace. It has always been regarded as the most sacred and
          the most distinctive name of God, the incommunicable name. The Jews
          had a superstitious dread of using it, since they read Lev_24:16 as
          follows: "He that nameth the name of Yahweh shall surely be put to
          death." And therefore in reading the Scriptures they substituted for
          it either 'Adonai or ' Elohim; and the Massoretes, while leaving the
          consonants intact, attached to them the vowels of one of these names,
          usually those of ' Adonai. The real derivation of the name and its
          original pronunciation and meaning are more or less lost in obscurity.
          The Pentateuch connects the name with the Hebrew verb hayah to be,
          Exo_3:13-14. On the strength of that passage we may assume that the
          name is in all probability derived from an archaic form of that verb,
          namely, hawah. As far as the form is concerned, it may be regarded as
          a third person imperfect qal or hiphil. Most likely, however, it is
          the former. The meaning is explained in Exo_3:14, which is rendered "I
          am that I am," or "I shall be what I shall be." Thus interpreted, the
          name points to the unchangeableness of God. Yet it is not so much the
          unchangeableness of His essential Being that is in view, as the
          unchangeableness of His relation to His people. The name contains the
          assurance that God will be for the people of Moses' day what He was
          for their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It stresses the covenant
          faithfulness of God, is His proper name par excellence, Exo_15:3;
          Hos_12:6; Isa_42:8, and is therefore used of no one but Israel's God.
          The exclusive character of the name appears from the fact that it
          never occurs in the plural or with a suffix. Abbreviated forms of it,
          found especially in composite names, are Yah and Yahu.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name Yahweh is often strengthened by the addition of tsebhaoth.
          Origen and Jerome regard this as an apposition, because Yahweh does
          not admit of a construct state. But this interpretation is not
          sufficiently warranted and hardly yields an intelligible sense. It is
          rather hard to determine to what the wordtsebhaothrefers. There are
          especially three opinions:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The armies of Israel. But the correctness of this view may well be
          doubted. Most of the passages quoted to support this idea do not prove
          the point; only three of them contain a semblance of proof, namely,
          1Sa_4:4; 1Sa_17:45; 2Sa_6:2, while one of them, 2Ki_19:31, is rather
          unfavorable to this view. While the plural tsebhaoth is used for the
          hosts of the people of Israel, the army is regularly indicated by the
          singular. This militates against the notion, inherent in this view,
          that in the name under consideration the term refers to the army of
          Israel. Moreover, it is clear that in the Prophets at least the name
          "Jehovah of hosts" does not refer to Jehovah as the God of war. And if
          the meaning of the name changed, what caused the change?
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The stars. But in speaking of the host of heaven Scripture always
          uses the singular, and never the plural. Moreover, while the stars are
          called the host of heaven, they are never designated the host of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The angels. This interpretation deserves preference. The name Yahweh
          tsebhaoth is often found in connections in which angels are mentioned:
          1Sa_4:4; 2Sa_6:2; Isa_37:16; Hos_12:4-5; Psa_80:1; Psa_80:4 f.;
          Psa_89:1-52; Psa_6:1-10, Psa_7:1-17, Psa_8:1-9. The angels are
          repeatedly represented as a host that surrounds the throne of God,
          Gen_28:12; Gen_32:2; Jos_5:14; 1Ki_22:19; Psa_68:17; Psa_103:21;
          Psa_148:2; Isa_6:2. It is true that in this case also the singular is
          generally used, but this is no serious objection, since the Bible also
          indicates that there were several divisions of angels Gen_32:2;
          Deu_33:2; Psa_68:17. Moreover, this interpretation is in harmony with
          the meaning of the name, which has no martial flavor, but is
          expressive of the glory of God as King, Deu_33:2; 1Ki_22:19;
          Psa_24:10; Isa_6:3; Isa_24:23; Zec_14:16. Jehovah of hosts, then, is
          God as the King of glory, who is surrounded by angelic hosts, who
          rules heaven and earth in the interest of His people, and who receives
          glory from all His creatures.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE NEW TESTAMENT NAMES AND THEIR INTERPRETATION</p>
        <p>
          1. THEOS. The New Testament has the Greek equivalents of the Old
          Testament names. For ' El, ' Elohim, and ' Elyon it has Theos , which
          is the most common name applied to God. Like ' Elohim, it may by
          accommodation be used of heathen gods, though strictly speaking it
          expresses essential deity. ' Elyon is rendered Hupsistos Theos,
          Mar_5:7; Luk_1:32; Luk_1:35; Luk_1:75; Act_7:48; Act_16:17; Heb_7:1.
          The names Shaddai and 'El-Shaddai are rendered Pantokrator and Theos
          Pantokrator, 2Co_6:18; Rev_1:8; Rev_4:8; Rev_11:17; Rev_15:3;
          Rev_16:7; Rev_16:14. More generally, however, Theos is found with a
          genitive of possession, such as mou, sou, hemon, humon, because in
          Christ God may be regarded as the God of all and of each one of His
          children. The national idea of the Old Testament has made place for
          the individual in religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. KURIOS. The name Yahweh is explicated a few times by variations of
          a descriptive kind, such as "the Alpha and the Omega," "who is and who
          was and who is to come," "the beginning and the end," "the first and
          the last," Rev_1:4; Rev_1:8; Rev_1:17; Rev_2:8; Rev_21:6; Rev_22:13.
          For the rest, however the New Testament follows the Septuagint, which
          substituted 'Adonai for it, and rendered this by Kurios derived from
          kuros , power. This name does not have exactly the same connotation as
          Yahweh but designates God as the Mighty One, the Lord, the Possessor,
          the Ruler who has legal power and authority. It is used not only of
          God, but also of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. PATER. It is often said that the New Testament introduced a new
          name of God, namely,Pater (Father). But this is hardly correct. The
          name Father is used of the Godhead even in heathen religions. It is
          used repeatedly in the Old Testament to designate the relation of God
          to Israel, Deu_32:6; Psa_103:13; Isa_63:16; Isa_64:8; Jer_3:4;
          Jer_3:19; Jer_31:9; Mal_1:6; Mal_2:10, while Israel is called the son
          of God, Exo_4:22; Deu_14:1; Deu_32:19; Isa_1:2; Jer_31:20; Hos_1:10;
          Hos_11:1. In such cases the name is expressive of the special
          theocratic relation in which God stands to Israel. In the general
          sense of originator or creator it is used in the following New
          Testament passages: 1Co_8:6; Eph_3:15; Heb_12:9; Jas_1:18. In all
          other places it serves to express either the special relation in which
          the first Person of the Trinity stands to Christ, as the Son of God
          either in a metaphysical or a mediatorial sense, or the ethical
          relation in which God stands to all believers as His spiritual
          children.
