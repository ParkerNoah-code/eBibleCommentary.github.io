        <p>VIII. Faith</p>
        <p>
          The preceding chapter dealt with conversion in general, and also gave
          a brief description of the negative element of conversion, namely,
          repentance. The present chapter will be devoted to a discussion of the
          positive element, which is faith. This is of such central significance
          in soteriology that it calls for separate treatment. It is best taken
          up at this point, not only because faith is a part of conversion, but
          also because it is instrumentally related to justification. Its
          discussion forms a natural transition to the doctrine of justification
          by faith.
        </p>
        <p>A. SCRIPTURAL TERMS FOR FAITH</p>
        <p>
          1. THE OLD TESTAMENT TERMS AND THEIR MEANING. The Old Testament
          contains no noun for faith, unless emunah be so considered in Hab_2:4.
          This word ordinarily means "faithfulness," Deu_32:4; Psa_36:5;
          Psa_37:3; Psa_40:11, but the way in which the statement of Habakkuk is
          applied in the New Testament, Rom_1:17; Gal_3:11; Heb_10:38, would
          seem to indicate that the prophet used the term in the sense of faith.
          The most common Old Testament word for "to believe" is he'emin, the
          hiphil form of ' aman. In qal it means "to nurse" or "to nourish"; in;
          niphal, "to be firm" or "established," "steadfast"; and in hiphil, "to
          consider established," "to regard as true," or "to believe." The word
          is construed with the prepositions beth and lamedh. Construed with the
          former, it evidently refers to a confident resting on a person or
          thing or testimony; while, with the latter, it signifies the assent
          given to a testimony, which is accepted as true. â€” The word next in
          importance is batach, which is construed with beth and means "to
          confide in," "to lean upon," or "to trust." It does not emphasize the
          element of intellectual assent, but rather that of confident reliance.
          In distinction from he'emin, which is generally rendered by pisteuo in
          the Septuagint, this word is usually translated by elpizo or
          peithomai. The man who trusts in God is one who fixes all his hope for
          the present and for the future on Him. â€” There is still another
          word, namely, chasah, which is used less frequently, and means "to
          hide one's self," or "to flee for refuge." In this, too, the element
          of trust is clearly in the foreground.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE NEW TESTAMENT TERMS AND THEIR MEANING. Two words are used
          throughout the New Testament, namely, pistis and the cognate verb
          pisteuein. These do not always have exactly the same connotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The different meanings of pistis. (1) In classical Greek. The word
          pistis has two meanings in classical Greek. It denotes: (a) a
          conviction based on confidence in a person and in his testimony, which
          as such is distinguished from knowledge resting on personal
          investigation; and (b) the confidence itself on which such a
          conviction rests. This is more than a mere intellectual conviction
          that a person is reliable; it presupposes a personal relation to the
          object of confidence, a going out of one's self, to rest in another.
          The Greeks did not ordinarily use the word in this sense, to express
          their relation to the gods, since they regarded these as hostile to
          men, and therefore as objects of fear rather than of trust.â€”(2) In
          the Septuagint. The transition from the use of the word pistis in
          classical Greek to the New Testament usage, in which the meaning
          "confidence" or "trust" is all-important, is found in the Septuagint
          use of the verb pisteuein rather than in that of the noun pistis which
          occurs in it but once with anything like its New Testament meaning.
          The verb pisteuein generally serves as a rendering of the word
          he'emin, and thus expresses the idea of faith both in the sense of
          assent to the Word of God and of confident trusting in Him. â€” (3) In
          the New Testament. There are a few instances in which the word has a
          passive meaning, namely, that of "fidelity" or "faithfulness," which
          is its usual meaning in the Old Testament, Rom_3:3; Gal_5:22;
          Tit_2:10. It is generally used in an active sense. The following
          special meanings should be distinguished: (a) an intellectual belief
          or conviction, resting on the testimony of another, and therefore
          based on trust in this other rather than on personal investigation,
          Php_1:27; 2Co_4:13; 2Ti_2:13, and especially in the writings of John;
          and (b) a confiding trust or confidence in God or, more particularly,
          in Christ with a view to redemption from sin and to future
          blessedness. So especially in the Epistles of Paul, Rom_3:22;
          Rom_3:25; Rom_5:1-2; Rom_9:30; Rom_9:32; Gal_2:16; Eph_2:8; Eph_3:12,
          and many other passages. This trust must be distinguished from that on
          which the intellectual trust mentioned under (a) above, rests. The
          order in the successive stages of faith is as follows: (a) general
          confidence in God and Christ; (b) acceptance of their testimony on the
          basis of that trust; and (c) yielding to Christ and trusting in Him
          for the salvation of the soul. The last is specifically called saving
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The different constructions of pisteuein and their meaning. We have
          the following constructions: (1) Pisteuein with the dative. This
          generally denotes believing assent. If the object is a person, it is
          ordinarily employed in a somewhat pregnant sense, including the deeply
          religious idea of a devoted, believing trust. When the object is a
          thing, it is usually the Word of God, and when it is a person, it is
          generally either God or Christ, Joh_4:50; Joh_5:47; Act_16:34;
          Rom_4:3; 2Ti_1:12. â€” (2) Pisteuein followed by hoti. In this
          construction the conjunction generally serves to introduce what is
          believed. On the whole this construction is weaker than the preceding.
          Of the twenty passages in which it is found, fourteen occur in the
          writings of John. In a couple of cases the matter believed hardly
          rises into the religious sphere, Joh_9:18; Act_9:26, while in some of
          the others it is decidedly of soteriological import, Mat_9:28;
          Rom_10:9; 1Th_4:14. â€” (3) Pisteuein with prepositions. Here the
          deeper meaning of the word, that of firm trustful reliance, comes to
          its full rights. The following constructions come into consideration:
          (a) Construction with en. This is the most frequent construction in
          the Septuagint, though it is all but absent from the New Testament.
          The only certain case is Mar_1:15, where the object is the gospel.
          Other possible instances are Joh_3:15; Eph_1:13, where the object
          would be Christ. The implication of this construction seems to be that
          of a firmly fixed confidence in its object. (b) Construction with epi
          and the dative. It is found only in the quotation from Isa_28:16,
          which appears in three passages, namely, Rom_9:33; Rom_10:11; 1Pe_2:6,
          and in Luk_24:25; 1Ti_1:16. It expresses the idea of a steady and
          restful repose, a reliance on its object. (c) Construction with epi
          and the accusative. This is used seven times in the New Testament. In
          a couple of cases the object is God, as He operates in the saving of
          the soul in Christ; in all the others it is Christ. This construction
          includes the idea of moral motion, of mental direction towards the
          object. The main idea is that of turning with confident trust to Jesus
          Christ. (d) Construction with eis. This is the most characteristic
          construction of the New Testament. It occurs forty-nine times. About
          fourteen of these instances are Johannine, and the remainder Pauline.
          Except in one case, the object is always a person, rarely God, and
          most commonly Christ. This construction has a very pregnant meaning,
          expressing, as it does, "an absolute transference of trust from
          ourselves to another, a complete self-surrender to God." Cf. Joh_2:11;
          Joh_3:16; Joh_3:18; Joh_3:36; Joh_4:39; Joh_14:1; Rom_10:14; Gal_2:16;
          Php_1:29.
        </p>
        <p>B. FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS USED TO DESCRIBE THE ACTIVITY OF FAITH</p>
        <p>
          There are several figurative expressions of the activity of faith in
          Scripture. The following are some of the most important.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is spoken of as a looking to Jesus, Joh_3:14-15 (comp.
          Num_21:9). This is a very appropriate figure, because it comprises the
          various elements of faith, especially when it refers to a steadfast
          looking to anyone, as in the passage indicated. There is in it an act
          of perception (intellectual element), a deliberate fixing of the eye
          on the object (volitional element), and a certain satisfaction to
          which this concentration testifies (emotional element).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is also represented as a hungering and thirsting, an eating and
          drinking, Mat_5:6; Joh_6:50-58; Joh_4:14. When men really hunger and
          thirst spiritually, they feel that something is wanting, are conscious
          of the indispensable character of that which is lacking, and endeavor
          to obtain it. All this is characteristic of the activity of faith. In
          eating and drinking we not only have the conviction that the necessary
          food and drink is present, but also the confident expectation that it
          will satisfy us, just as in appropriating Christ by faith we have a
          certain measure of confidence that He will save us.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Finally, there are also the figures of coming to Christ and
          receiving Him, Joh_5:40; Joh_7:37 (cf. Joh_7:38); Joh_6:44, Joh_6:65;
          Joh_1:12. The figure of coming to Christ pictures faith as an action
          in which man looks away from himself and his own merits, to be clothed
          with the righteousness of Jesus Christ; and that of receiving Christ
          stresses the fact that faith is an appropriating organ.
        </p>
        <p>C. THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH IN HISTORY.</p>
        <p>
          1. BEFORE THE REFORMATION. From the very earliest times of the
          Christian Church faith stood out in the minds of the leaders as the
          one great condition of salvation. Alongside of it repentance also soon
          became rather prominent. At the same time there was little reflection
          at first on the nature of faith and but little understanding of the
          relation of faith to the other parts of the ordo salutis. There was no
          current definition of faith. While there was a tendency to use the
          word "faith" to denote the acceptance of the truth on testimony, it
          was also in some cases employed in a deeper sense, so as to include
          the idea of self-surrender to the truth intellectually received. The
          Alexandrians contrasted pistis and gnosis, and regarded the former
          primarily as initial and imperfect knowledge. Tertullian stressed the
          fact that faith accepts a thing on authority, and not because it is
          warranted by human reason. He also used the term in an objective
          sense, as a designation of that which must be believed, â€” the regula
          fidei. Even up to the time of Augustine little attention was devoted
          to the nature of faith, though it was always acknowledged to be the
          pre-eminent means in the appropriation of salvation. Augustine,
          however, gave the matter a greater measure of consideration. He spoke
          of faith in more than one sense. Sometimes he regarded it as nothing
          more than intellectual assent to the truth. But he conceived of
          evangelical or justifying faith as including also the elements of
          self-surrender and love. This faith is perfected in love and thus
          becomes the principle of good works. He did not have a proper
          conception, however, of the relation between faith and justification.
          This is partly due to the fact that he did not carefully distinguish
          between justification and sanctification. The deeper conception of
          faith that is found in Augustine was not shared by the Church in
          general. There was a tendency to confound faith with orthodoxy, that
          is, with the holding of an orthodox faith. The Scholastics
          distinguished between a fides informis, that is, a mere intellectual
          assent to the truth taught by the Church, and a fides formata
          (charitate), that is, a faith informed (given a characteristic form)
          by love, and regarded the latter as the only faith that justifies,
          since it involves an infusion of grace. It is only as fides formata
          that faith becomes active for good and becomes the first of the
          theological virtues by which man is placed in the right relation to
          God. Strictly speaking it is the love by which faith is perfected that
          justifies. Thus in faith itself a foundation was laid for human merit.
          Man is justified, not exclusively by the imputation of the merits of
          Christ, but also by inherent grace. Thomas Aquinas defines the virtue
          of faith as a "habit of the mind, by reason of which eternal life has
          its inception in us, inasmuch as it causes the intellect to give its
          assent to things that are not seen."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. AFTER THE REFORMATION. While the Roman Catholics stressed the fact
          that justifying faith is merely assent and has its seat in the
          understanding, the Reformers generally regarded it as fiducia (trust),
          having its seat in the will. On the relative importance of the
          elements in faith there have been differences, however, even among
          Protestants. Some regard the definition of Calvin as superior to that
          of the Heidelberg Catechism. Says Calvin: "We shall now have a full
          definition of faith if we say that it is a firm and sure knowledge of
          the divine favour toward us, founded on the truth of a free promise in
          Christ, and revealed to our minds, and sealed in our hearts, by the
          Holy Spirit."71 The Heidelberg Catechism, on the other hand, also
          brings in the element of confidence when it answers the question,
          "What is true faith?" as follows: "True faith is not only a sure
          knowledge whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in
          His Word, but also a firm confidence which the Holy Spirit works in my
          heart by the gospel, that not only to others, but to me also,
          remission of sins, everlasting righteousness and salvation are freely
          given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's
          merits."72 But it is quite evident from the connection that Calvin
          means to include the element of confidence in the "firm and sure
          knowledge" of which he speaks. Speaking of the boldness with which we
          may approach God in prayer, he even says: "Such boldness springs only
          from confidence in the divine favour and salvation. So true is this,
          that the term faith is often used as equivalent to confidence. "73 He
          absolutely rejects the fiction of the Schoolmen who insist "that faith
          is an assent with which any despiser of God may receive what is
          delivered in Scripture."74 But there is an even more important point
          of difference between the Reformers' conception of faith and that of
          the Scholastics. The latter recognized in faith itself some real and
          even meritorious efficacy (meritum ex congruo) in disposing to, and in
          procuring or obtaining justification. The Reformers, on the other
          hand, were unanimous and explicit in teaching that justifying faith
          does not justify by any meritorious or inherent efficacy of its own,
          but only as the instrument for receiving or laying hold on what God
          has provided in the merits of Christ. They regarded this faith
          primarily as a gift of God and only secondarily as an activity of man
          in dependence on God. The Arminians revealed a Romanizing tendency,
          when they conceived of faith as a meritorious work of man, on the
          basis of which he is accepted in favor by God. Schleiermacher, the
          father of modern theology, hardly mentions saving faith and knows
          absolutely nothing of faith as childlike trust in God. He says that
          faith "is nothing but the incipient experience of the satisfaction of
          our spiritual need by Christ." It is a new psychological experience, a
          new consciousness, rooted in a feeling, not of Christ, nor of any
          doctrine, but of the harmony of the Infinite, of the Whole of things,
          in which the soul finds God. Ritschl agreed with Schleiermacher in
          holding that faith springs up as the result of contact with the divine
          reality, but finds its object, not in any idea or doctrine, nor in the
          whole of things, but in the Person of Christ, as the supreme
          revelation of God. It is not a passive assent, but an active
          principle. In it man makes God's self-end, that is, the kingdom of
          God, his own, begins to work for the kingdom, and in doing this finds
          salvation. The views of Schleiermacher and Ritschl characterize a
          great deal of modern liberal theology. Faith, in this theology, is not
          a heaven-wrought experience, but a human achievement; not the mere
          receiving of a gift, but a meritorious action; not the acceptance of a
          doctrine, but a "making Christ Master" in an attempt to pattern one's
          life after the example of Christ. This view met with strong
          opposition, however, in the theology of crisis, which stresses the
          fact that saving faith is never a merely natural psychological
          experience, is strictly speaking an act of God rather than of man,
          never constitutes a permanent possession of man, and is in itself
          merely a hohlraum (empty space), quite incapable of effecting
          salvation. Barth and Brunner regard faith simply as the divine
          response, wrought in man by God, to the Word of God in Christ, that
          is, not so much to any doctrine, as to the divine command or the
          divine act in the work of redemption. It is the affirmative answer,
          the "yes" to the call of God, a "yes" that is elicited by God Himself.
        </p>
        <p>D. THE IDEA OF FAITH IN SCRIPTURE.</p>
        <p>
          1. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. Evidently the New Testament writers, in
          stressing faith as the fundamental principle of the religious life,
          were not conscious of shifting ground and of departing from the Old
          Testament representation. They regard Abraham as the type of all true
          believers (Rom_4:1-25; Gal_3:1-29; Heb_11:1-40; Jas_2:1-26), and those
          who are of faith as the true sons of Abraham (Rom_2:28-29; Rom_4:12;
          Rom_4:16; Gal_3:9). Faith is never treated as a novelty of the new
          covenant, nor is any distinction drawn between the faith of the two
          covenants. There is a sense of continuity, and the proclamation of
          faith is regarded as the same in both dispensations, Joh_5:46;
          Joh_12:38-39; Hab_2:4; Rom_1:17; Rom_10:16; Gal_3:11; Heb_10:38. In
          both Testaments faith is the same radical self-commitment to God, not
          merely as the highest good of the soul, but as the gracious Saviour of
          the sinner. The only difference that is apparent, is due to the
          progressive work of redemption, and this is more or less evident even
          within the confines of the Old Testament itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In the patriarchal period. In the earlier portions of the Old
          Testament there is but little in the line of abstract statement
          respecting the way of salvation. The essence of the religion of the
          patriarchs is exhibited to us in action. The promise of God is in the
          foreground, and the case of Abraham is designed to set forth the idea
          that the proper response to it is that of faith. The whole life of
          Noah was determined by trust in God and in His promises, but it is
          especially Abraham that is set before us as the typical believer, who
          commits himself to God with unwavering trust in His promises and is
          justified by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the period of the law. The giving of the law did not effect a
          fundamental change in the religion of Israel, but merely introduced a
          change in its external form. The law was not substituted for the
          promise; neither was faith supplanted by works. Many of the
          Israelites, indeed, looked upon the law in a purely legalistic spirit
          and sought to base their claim to salvation on a scrupulous fulfilment
          of it as a body of external precepts. But in the case of those who
          understood its real nature, who felt the inwardness and spirituality
          of the law, it served to deepen the sense of sin and to sharpen the
          conviction that salvation could be expected only from the grace of
          God. The essence of real piety was ever-increasingly seen to consist
          in a confident trust in the God of salvation. While the Old Testament
          clearly stresses the fear of the Lord, a large number of expressions,
          such as hoping, trusting, seeking refuge in God, looking to Him,
          relying on Him, fixing the heart on Him, and cleaving to Him â€” make
          it abundantly evident that this fear is not a craven but a child-like,
          reverent fear, and emphasize the necessity of that loving
          self-commitment to God which is the essence of saving faith. Even in
          the period of the law faith is distinctly soteriological, looking to
          the Messianic salvation. It is a trusting in the God of salvation, and
          a firm reliance on His promises for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. When the Messiah came in fulfilment of the
          prophecies, bringing the hoped-for salvation, it became necessary for
          the vehicles of God's revelation to direct God's people to the person
          of their Redeemer. This was all the more necessary in view of the fact
          that the fulfilment came in a form which many did not expect, and
          which apparently did not correspond with the promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In the Gospels. The demand for faith in Jesus as the Redeemer,
          promised and hoped for, appeared as something characteristic of the
          new age. "To believe" meant to become a Christian. This demand seemed
          to create a gulf between the old dispensation and the new. The
          beginning of the latter is even called "the coming of faith,"
          Gal_3:23; Gal_3:25. It is the characteristic thing of the Gospels that
          in them Jesus is constantly offering Himself as the object of faith,
          and that in connection with the highest concerns of the soul. The
          Gospel of John stresses the higher aspects of this faith more than the
          Synoptics.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. In the Acts. In the Acts of the Apostles faith is required in the
          same general sense. By the preaching of the apostles men are brought
          to the obedience of faith in Christ; and this faith becomes the
          formative principle of the new community. Different tendencies
          developed in the Church and gave rise to the different modes of
          dealing with faith that became apparent in the writings of the New
          Testament.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. In the Epistle of James. James had to rebuke the Jewish tendency to
          conceive of the faith that was well pleasing to God as a mere
          intellectual assent to the truth, a faith that did not yield
          appropriate fruit. His idea of the faith that justifies does not
          differ from that of Paul, but he stresses the fact that this faith
          must manifest itself in good works. If it does not, it is a dead
          faith, and is, in fact, non-existent.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. In the Epistles of Paul. Paul had to contend particularly with the
          ingrained legalism of Jewish thought. The Jew boasted of the
          righteousness of the law. Consequently, the apostle had to vindicate
          the place of faith as the only instrument of salvation. In doing this,
          he naturally dwelt a great deal on Christ as the object of faith,
          since it is from this object only that faith derives its efficacy.
          Faith justifies and saves only because it lays hold on Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. In the Epistle to the Hebrews. The writer of Hebrews also regards
          Christ as the proper object of saving faith, and teaches that there is
          no right-eousness except through faith, Heb_10:38; Heb_11:7. But the
          danger against which the writer of this letter had to guard was not
          that of falling from faith into works, but rather that of falling from
          faith into despair. He speaks of faith as "the assurance of things
          hoped for, the conviction of things not seen," Heb_11:1. He exhorts
          the readers to an attitude of faith, which will enable them to rise
          from the seen to the unseen, from the present to the future, from the
          temporal to the eternal, and which will enable them to be patient in
          the midst of sufferings.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. In the Epistles of Peter. Peter also writes to readers that were in
          danger of becoming discouraged, though not of falling back into
          Judaism. The circumstances in which they found themselves prompted him
          to lay special emphasis on the relation of faith to the consummated
          salvation, in order to quicken within their hearts the hope that would
          sustain them in their present trials, the hope of an unseen and
          eternal glory. The Second Epistle stresses the importance of the
          knowledge of faith as a safeguard against prevailing errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          g. In the Writings of John. John had to contend with an incipient
          Gnosticism, which falsely emphasized knowledge (gnosis) and despised
          simple faith. The former was supposed to carry with it a far greater
          degree of blessedness than the latter. Hence John makes it a point to
          magnify the blessings of faith. He insists, not so much on the
          certainty and glory of the future inheritance which faith secures, as
          on the fulness of the present enjoyment of salvation which it brings.
          Faith embraces knowledge as a firm conviction and makes believers at
          once possessors of the new life and of eternal salvation. Meanwhile
          John does not neglect the fact that it also reaches out into the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>E. FAITH IN GENERAL.</p>
        <p>
          The word "faith" is not exclusively a religious and theological term.
          It is often used in a general and non-religious sense, and even so has
          more than one connotation. The following uses of the term deserve
          particular attention. It may denote:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. FAITH AS LITTLE MORE THAN MERE OPINION. The word "faith" is
          sometimes used in a rather loose and popular sense, to denote a
          persuasion of the truth which is stronger than mere opinion, and yet
          weaker than knowledge. Even Locke defined faith as "the assent of the
          mind to propositions which are probably, but not certainly, true." In
          popular language we often say of that of which we are not absolutely
          sure, but which we at the same time feel constrained to recognize as
          true: "I believe that, but I am not sure of it." Consequently some
          philosophers have found the distinguishing characteristic of faith in
          the lesser degree of certainty which it yieldsâ€”Locke, Hume, Kant,
          and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. FAITH AS IMMEDIATE CERTAINTY. In connection with science faith is
          often spoken of as immediate certainty. There is a certainty which man
          obtains by means of perception, experience, and logical deduction, but
          there is also an intuitive certainty. In every science there are
          axioms that cannot be demonstrated and intuitive convictions that are
          not acquired by perception or logical deduction. Dr. Bavinck says "Het
          gebied der onmiddelijke zekerheid is veel grooter dan dat der
          demonstratieve, en deze laatste is altijd weer op de eerste gebouwd,
          en staat en valt met deze. Ook is deze intuitieve zekerheid niet
          minder maar grooter dan die, welke langs den weg van waarneming en
          logische demonstratie verkregen wordt." The sphere of immediate
          certainty is greater than that of demonstrative certainty. In both
          cases now mentioned faith is regarded exclusively as an activity of
          the intellect.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. FAITH AS A CONVICTION BASED ON TESTIMONY AND INCLUDING TRUST. In
          common parlance the word "faith" is often used to denote the
          conviction that the testimony of another is true, and that what he
          promises will be done; a conviction based only on his recognized
          veracity and fidelity. It is really a believing acceptance of what
          another says on the basis of the confidence which he inspires. And
          this faith, this conviction based on confidence, often leads to a
          further confidence: trust in a friend in time of need, in the ability
          of a doctor to give aid in times of sickness, and in that of a pilot
          to guide the vessel into the harbor, and so on. In this case faith is
          more than a mere matter of the intellect. The will is brought into
          play, and the element of trust comes to the foreground.
        </p>
        <p>F. FAITH IN THE RELIGIOUS SENSE AND PARTICULARLY SAVING FAITH.</p>
        <p>
          The distinguishing characteristics of faith in the theological sense
          have not always been stated in the same way. This will become evident,
          when we consider the concept, the elements, the object, and the ground
          of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. THE CONCEPT OF FAITH: FOUR KINDS OF FAITH DISTINGUISHED. As a
          psychological phenomenon faith in the religious sense does not differ
          from faith in general. If faith in general is a persuasion of the
          truth founded on the testimony of one in whom we have confidence and
          on whom we rely, and therefore rests on authority, Christian faith in
          the most comprehensive sense is man's persuasion of the truth of
          Scripture on the basis of the authority of God. The Bible does not
          always speak of religious faith in the same sense, and this gave rise
          to the following distinctions in theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Historical faith. This is a purely intellectual apprehension of the
          truth, devoid of any moral or spiritual purpose. The name does not
          imply that it embraces only historical facts and events to the
          exclusion of moral and spiritual truths; nor that it is based on the
          testimony of history, for it may have reference to contemporaneous
          facts or events, Joh_3:2. It is rather expressive of the idea that
          this faith accepts the truths of Scripture as one might accept a
          history in which one is not personally interested. This faith may be
          the result of tradition, of education, of public opinion, of an
          insight into the moral grandeur of Scripture, and so on, accompanied
          with the general operations of the Holy Spirit. It may be very
          orthodox and Scriptural, but is not rooted in the heart, Mat_7:26;
          Act_26:27-28; Jas_2:19. It is a fides humana and not a fides divina.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Miraculous faith. The so-called miraculous faith is a persuasion
          wrought in the mind of a person that a miracle will be performed by
          him or in his behalf. God can give a person a work to do that
          transcends his natural powers and enable him to do it. Every attempt
          to perform a work of that kind requires faith. This is very clear in
          cases in which man appears merely as the instrument of God or as the
          one who announces that God will work a miracle, for such a man must
          have full confidence that God will not put him to shame. In the last
          analysis God only works miracles, though He may do it through human
          instrumentality. This is faith of miracles in the active sense,
          Mat_17:20; Mar_16:17-18. It is not necessarily, but may be,
          accompanied with saving faith. The faith of miracles may also be
          passive, namely, the persuasion that God will work a miracle in one's
          behalf. It, too, may or may not be accompanied with saving faith,
          Mat_8:10-13; Joh_11:22 (comp. Joh_11:25-27); Joh_11:40; Act_14:9. The
          question is often raised, whether such a faith has a legitimate place
          in the life of man to-day. Roman Catholics answer this question
          affirmatively, while Protestants are inclined to give a negative
          answer. They point out that there is no Scriptural basis for such a
          faith, but do not deny that miracles may still occur. God is entirely
          sovereign also in this respect, and the Word of God leads us to expect
          another cycle of miracles in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. Temporal faith. This is a persuasion of the truths of religion
          which is accompanied with some promptings of the conscience and a
          stirring of the affections, but is not rooted in a regenerate heart.
          The name is derived from Mat_13:20-21. It is called a temporary faith,
          because it is not permanent and fails to maintain itself in days of
          trial and persecution. This does not mean that it may not last as long
          as life lasts. It is quite possible that it will perish only at death,
          but then it surely ceases. This faith is sometimes called a
          hypocritical faith, but that is not entirely correct, for it does not
          necessarily involve conscious hypocrisy. They who possess this faith
          usually believe that they have the true faith. It might better be
          called an imaginary faith, seemingly genuine, but evanescent in
          character. It differs from historical faith in the personal interest
          it shows in the truth and in the reaction of the feelings upon it.
          Great difficulty may be experienced in attempting to distinguish it
          from true saving faith. Christ says of the one who so believes: "He
          hath no root in himself," Mat_13:21. It is a faith that does not
          spring from the root implanted in regeneration, and therefore is not
          an expression of the new life that is embedded in the depths of the
          soul. In general it may be said that temporal faith is grounded in the
          emotional life and seeks personal enjoyment rather than the glory of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. True Saving faith. True saving faith is a faith that has its seat
          in the heart and is rooted in the regenerate life. A distinction is
          often made between the habitus and the actus of faith. Back of both of
          these, however, lies the semen fidei. This faith is not first of all
          an activity of man, but a potentiality wrought by God in the heart of
          the sinner. The seed of faith is implanted in man in regeneration.
          Some theologians speak of this as the habitus of faith, but others
          more correctly call it the semen fidei. It is only after God has
          implanted the seed of faith in the heart that man can exercise faith.
          This is apparently what Barth has in mind also, when he, in his desire
          to stress the fact that salvation is exclusively a work of God, says
          that God rather than man is the subject of faith. The conscious
          exercise of faith gradually forms a habitus, and this acquires a
          fundamental and determining significance for the further exercise of
          faith. When the Bible speaks of faith, it generally refers to faith as
          an activity of man, though born of the work of the Holy Spirit. Saving
          faith may be defined as a certain conviction, wrought in the heart by
          the Holy Spirit, as to the truth of the gospel, and a hearty reliance
          (trust) on the promises of God in Christ. In the last analysis, it is
          true, Christ is the object of saving faith, but He is offered to us
          only in the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. THE ELEMENTS OF FAITH. In speaking of the different elements of
          faith we should not lose sight of the fact that faith is an activity
          of man as a whole, and not of any part of man. Moreover, the soul
          functions in faith through its ordinary faculties, and not through any
          special faculty. It is an exercise of the soul which has this in
          common with all similar exercises, that it appears simple, and yet on
          closer scrutiny is found to be complex and intricate. And therefore,
          in order to obtain a proper conception of faith, it is necessary to
          distinguish between the various elements which it comprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. An intellectual element (notitia). There is an element of knowledge
          in faith, in connection with which the following points should be
          considered:
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) The character of this knowledge. The knowledge of faith consists
          in a positive recognition of the truth, in which man accepts as true
          whatsoever God says in His Word, and especially what He says
          respecting the deep depravity of man and the redemption which is in
          Christ Jesus. Over against Rome the position must be maintained that
          this sure knowledge belongs to the essence of faith; and in opposition
          to such theologians as Sandeman, Wardlaw, Alexander, Chalmers, and
          others, that a mere intellectual acceptance of the truth is not the
          whole of faith. On the one hand it would be an over-estimation of the
          knowledge of faith, if it were regarded as a complete comprehension of
          the objects of faith. But on the other hand it would also be an under-
          estimation of it, if it were considered as a mere taking notice of the
          things believed, without the conviction that they are true. Some
          modern liberals take this view and consequently like to speak of faith
          as a venture. It is a spiritual insight into the truths of the
          Christian religion that find response in the heart of the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2) The certainty of this knowledge. The knowledge of faith should not
          be regarded as less certain than other knowledge. Our Heidelberg
          Catechism assures us that true faith is among other things also "a
          certain (sure, incontestable) knowledge."75 This is in harmony with
          Heb_11:1, which speaks of it as "the assurance of things hoped for, a
          conviction of things not seen" It makes future and unseen things
          subjectively real and certain for the believer. The knowledge of faith
          is mediated for, and imparted to, us by the testimony of God in His
          Word, and is accepted by us as certain and reliable on the basis of
          the veracity of God. The certainty of this knowledge has its warrant
          in God Himself, and consequently nothing can be more certain. And it
          is quite essential that this should be so, for faith is concerned with
          spiritual and eternal things, in which certainty is needed, if
          anywhere. There must be certainty as to the reality of the object of
          faith; if there is not, faith is in vain. Machen deplores the fact
          that many lose sight of this fact in the present day. Says he: "The
          whole trouble is that faith is being considered as a beneficent
          quality of the soul without respect to the reality or unreality of its
          object; and the moment faith comes to be considered in that way, in
          that moment it is destroyed."76
        </p>
        <p>
          (3) The measure of this knowledge. It is impossible to determine with
          precision just how much knowledge is absolutely required in saving
          faith. If saving faith is the acceptance of Christ as He is offered in
          the gospel, the question naturally arises, How much of the gospel must
          a man know, in order to be saved? Or, to put it in the words of Dr.
          Machen: "What, to put it baldly, are the minimum doctrinal
          requirements, in order that a man may be a Christian?"77 In general it
          may be said that it must be sufficient to give the believer some idea
          of the object of faith. All true saving faith must contain at least a
          minimum of knowledge, not so much of the divine revelation in general
          as of the Mediator and His gracious operations. The more real
          knowledge one has of the truths of redemption, the richer and fuller
          one's faith will be, if all other things are equal. Naturally one who
          accepts Christ by a true faith, will also be ready and willing to
          accept God's testimony as a whole. It is of the utmost importance,
          especially in our day, that the churches should see to it that their
          members have a fairly good, and not merely a hazy, understanding of
          the truth. Particularly in this undogmatic age, they should be far
          more diligent than they are in the indoctrination of their youth.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. An emotional element (assensus). Barth calls attention to the fact
          that the time when man accepts Christ by faith is the existential
          moment of his life, in which he ceases to consider the object of faith
          in a detached and disinterested way, and begins to feel a lively
          interest in it. It is not necessary to adopt Barth's peculiar
          construction of the doctrine of faith, to admit the truth of what he
          says on this point. When one embraces Christ by faith, he has a deep
          conviction of the truth and reality of the object of faith, feels that
          it meets an important need in his life, and is conscious of an
          absorbing interest in it, â€” and this is assent. It is very difficult
          to distinguish this assent from the knowledge of faith just described,
          because, as we have seen, it is exactly the distinguishing
          characteristic of the knowledge of saving faith, that it carries with
          it a conviction of the truth and reality of its object. Hence some
          theologians have shown an inclination to limit the knowledge of faith
          to a mere taking cognizance of the object of faith; but (1) this is
          contrary to experience, for in true faith there is no knowledge that
          does not include a hearty conviction of the truth and reality of its
          object and an interest in it; and (2) this would make the knowledge in
          saving faith identical with that which is found in a purely historical
          faith, while the difference between historical and saving faith lies
          in part exactly at this point. Because it is so difficult to make a
          clear distinction, some theologians prefer to speak of only two
          elements in saving faith, namely, knowledge and personal trust. These
          are the two elements mentioned in the Heidelberg Catechism when it
          says that true faith "is not only a certain knowledge whereby I hold
          for true all that God has revealed to us in His Word, but also a
          hearty trust which the Holy Ghost works in me by the gospel."78 It
          probably deserves preference to regard knowledge and assent simply as
          two aspects of the same element in faith. Knowledge may then be
          regarded as its more passive and receptive side, and assent as its
          more active and transitive side.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. A volitional element (fiducia). This is the crowning element of
          faith. Faith is not merely a matter of the intellect, nor of the
          intellect and the emotions combined; it is also a matter of the will,
          determining the direction of the soul, an act of the soul going out
          towards its object and appropriating this. Without this activity the
          object of faith, which the sinner recognizes as true and real and
          entirely applicable to his present needs, remains outside of him. And
          in saving faith it is a matter of life and death that the object be
          appropriated. This third element consists in a personal trust in
          Christ as Saviour and Lord, including a surrender of the soul as
          guilty and defiled to Christ, and a reception and appropriation of
          Christ as the source of pardon and of spiritual life. Taking all these
          elements in consideration, it is quite evident that the seat of faith
          cannot be placed in the intellect, nor in the feelings, nor in the
          will exclusively, but only in the heart, the central organ of man's
          spiritual being, out of which are the issues of life. In answer to the
          question whether this fiducia (trust) necessarily includes an element
          of personal assurance, it may be said, in opposition to the Roman
          Catholics and Arminians, that this is undoubtedly the case. It
          naturally carries with it a certain feeling of safety and security, of
          gratitude and joy. Faith, which is in itself certainty, tends to
          awaken a sense of security and a feeling of assurance in the soul. In
          the majority of cases this is at first more implicit and hardly
          penetrates into the sphere of conscious thought; it is something
          vaguely felt rather than clearly perceived. But in the measure in
          which faith grows and the activities of faith increase, the
          consciousness of the security and safety which it brings also becomes
          greater. Even what theologians generally call "refuge- seeking trust"
          (toevluchtnemend vertrouwen) conveys to the soul a certain measure of
          security. This is quite different from the position of Barth, who
          stresses the fact that faith is a constantly repeated act, is ever
          anew a leap of despair and a leap in the dark, and never becomes a
          continuous possession of man; and who therefore rules out the
          possibility of any subjective assurance of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. THE OBJECT OF FAITH. In giving an answer to the question as to what
          is the object of true saving faith, we shall have to speak with
          discrimination, since it is possible to speak of this faith in a
          general and in a special sense. There is:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. A fides generalis. By this is meant saving faith in the more
          general sense of the word. Its object is the whole divine revelation
          as contained in the Word of God. Everything that is explicitly taught
          in Scripture or can be deduced from it by good and necessary
          inference, belongs to the object of faith in this general sense.
          According to the Church of Rome it is incumbent on its members to
          believe whatsoever the ecclesia docens declares to be a part of God's
          revelation, and this includes the so-called apostolic tradition. It is
          true that the "teaching church" does not claim the right to make new
          articles of faith, but it does claim the right to determine
          authoritatively what the Bible teaches and what, according to
          tradition, belongs to the teachings of Christ and His apostles. And
          this affords a great deal of latitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. A fides specialis. This is saving faith in the more limited sense
          of the word. While true faith in the Bible as the Word of God is
          absolutely necessary, that is not yet the specific act of faith which
          justifies and therefore saves directly. It must and as a matter of
          fact does lead on to a more special faith. There are certain doctrines
          concerning Christ and His work, and certain promises made in Him to
          sinful men, which the sinner must receive and which must lead him to
          put his trust in Christ. The object of special faith, then, is Jesus
          Christ and the promise of salvation through Him. The special act of
          faith consists in receiving Christ and resting on Him as He is
          presented in the gospel, Joh_3:15-16; Joh_3:18; Joh_6:40. Strictly
          speaking, it is not the act of faith as such, but rather that which is
          received by faith, which justifies and therefore saves the sinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. THE GROUND OF FAITH. The ultimate ground on which faith rests, lies
          in the veracity and faithfulness of God, in connection with the
          promises of the gospel. But because we have no knowledge of this apart
          from the Word of God, this can also be, and frequently is, called the
          ultimate ground of faith. In distinction from the former, however, it
          might be called the proximate ground. The means by which we recognize
          the revelation embodied in Scripture as the very Word of God is, in
          the last analysis, the testimony of the Holy Spirit, 1Jn_5:7 (Am. Rev.
          Version): "And it is the Spirit which beareth witness because the
          Spirit is the truth." Cf. also Rom_4:20-21; Rom_8:16; Eph_1:13;
          1Jn_4:13; 1Jn_5:10. Roman Catholics find the ultimate ground of faith
          in the Church; Rationalists acknowledge only reason as such;
          Schleiermacher seeks it in Christian experience; and Kant, Ritschl,
          and many modern liberals place it in the moral needs of human nature.
        </p>
        <p>G. FAITH AND ASSURANCE.</p>
        <p>
          A very important question arises here, namely, whether assurance
          belongs to the essence of faith, or is something additional that is
          not included in faith. Because the expression "assurance of faith" is
          not always used in the same sense, it is necessary to discriminate
          carefully. There is a twofold assurance, namely, (1) The objective
          assurance of faith, which is "the certain and undoubting conviction
          that Christ is all He professes to be, and will do all He promises."
          It is generally agreed that this assurance is of the essence of faith.
          (2) The subjective assurance of faith, or the assurance of grace and
          salvation, which consists in a sense of security and safety, rising in
          many instances to the height of an "assured conviction that the
          individual believer has had his sins pardoned and his soul saved." As
          to the relation of this assurance to the essence of faith opinions
          differ.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The Roman Catholic Church denies, not only that personal assurance
          belongs to the essence of faith, but even that this is an actus
          reflexus or fruit of faith. It teaches that believers cannot be sure
          of their salvation, except in those rare cases in which assurance is
          given by special revelation. This is a natural result of the
          Semi-Pelagianism and of the confessional system of Rome. The early
          Arminians, who shared the Semi-Pelagian position of Rome, took a very
          similar stand. Their view was condemned by the Synod of Dort.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The Reformers reacted against the unsound and pernicious position
          of the Church of Rome. In their protest they occasionally stressed
          assurance one-sidedly as the most important element of faith. They
          sometimes spoke as if one who lacks the assurance of salvation, the
          positive conviction that his sins are forgiven, did not possess true
          faith. The fiducia of faith was sometimes represented by them as the
          assured trust of the sinner that all his sins are pardoned for the
          sake of Christ. Yet it is quite evident from their writings, (a) that
          they did not mean to teach that this fiducia did not include other
          elements; and (b) that they did not intend to deny that true children
          of God must frequently struggle with all kinds of doubts and
          uncertainties.79
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The Reformed confessional standards vary somewhat. The Heidelberg
          Catechism teaches, also in reaction to Rome, that the fiducia of faith
          consists in the assurance of the forgiveness of sins. It places itself
          entirely on the standpoint of the Reformers, and conceives of the
          assurance of salvation as belonging to the essence of faith. The
          Canons of Dort take the position that this assurance in the elect is
          not the fruit of a special revelation, but springs from faith in God's
          promises, from the testimony of the Holy Spirit, and from the exercise
          of a good conscience and the doing of good works, and is enjoyed
          according to the measure of faith. This certainly implies that it
          belongs in some measure to the essence of faith. It is explicitly
          stated, however, that believers frequently have to struggle with
          carnal doubts, so that they are not always sensible of the assurance
          of faith. The Westminster Confession, speaking of the full assurance
          of faith, asserts that this does not so belong to the essence of faith
          that a true believer may not have to wait for it a long time. This has
          given some Presbyterian theologians occasion to deny that personal
          assurance belongs to the essence of faith. Yet the Confession does not
          say this, and there are reasons to think that it did not intend to
          teach this. The Marrowmen in Scotland certainly gave a different
          interpretation of its position.80
        </p>
        <p>
          4. After the confessional period there were several departures from
          this position.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Antinomians considered this assurance to be the whole of the
          essence of faith. They ignored all other activities of faith, and
          regarded faith simply as an intellectual acceptance of the
          proposition: Thy sins are forgiven thee. De Labadie (Dutch theologian)
          recognized no one as a member of the Church who was not fully
          assured.81
        </p>
        <p>
          b. On the other hand a pietistic Nomism asserted that assurance does
          not belong to the very being, but only to the well-being of faith; and
          that it can be secured, except by special revelation, only by
          continuous and conscientious introspection. All kinds of "marks of the
          spiritual life," derived not from Scripture but from the lives of
          approved Christians, became the standard of self-examination. The
          outcome proved, however, that this method was not calculated to
          produce assurance, but rather tended to lead to ever-increasing doubt,
          confusion, and uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The Methodists aim at a methodical conversion that carries
          immediate certainty with it. They place men before the law, cause them
          to see their utter sinfulness and terrible guilt, and frighten them
          with the terrors of the Lord. And after they have thus brought them
          under the terrifying influence of the law, they at once introduce them
          to the full and free gospel of redemption, which merely calls for a
          willing acceptance of Christ as their Saviour. In a single moment
          sinners are transported on waves of emotion from the deepest sorrow
          into the most exalted joy. And this sudden change carries with it an
          immediate assurance of redemption. He who believes, is also sure that
          he is redeemed. This does not mean, however, that he is also certain
          of ultimate salvation. This is a certainty to which the consistent
          Methodist cannot attain since he believes in a falling away of the
          saints.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Among Reformed theologians there is a difference of opinion. Many
          Presbyterians deny that faith itself includes assurance; and in
          Reformed circles some share this denial. Kuyper, Bavinck, and Vos,
          however, correctly hold that true faith, as including trust, carries
          with it a sense of security, which may vary in degree. There is also
          an assurance of faith, however, that is the fruit of reflection. It is
          possible to make faith itself an object of reflection, and thus to
          arrive at a subjective assurance that does not belong to the essence
          of faith. In that case we conclude from what we experience in our own
          life to the presence of the work of the Holy Spirit within us, cf.
          1Jn_2:9-11; 1Jn_3:9-10; 1Jn_3:18-19; 1Jn_4:7; 1Jn_4:20. 82
        </p>
        <p>H. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CONCEPTION OF FAITH.</p>
        <p>Three points deserve our attention here:</p>
        <p>
          1. The Church of Rome obliterates the distinction between historical
          and saving faith by teaching that faith consists in a mere assent to
          the doctrines of the Church. This faith is one of the seven
          preparations for justification in baptism, and therefore necessarily
          precedes this; but as a purely intellectual activity it naturally does
          not lead to salvation. A man may have true, that is, Biblical faith,
          and yet be lost. In so far the Church of Rome applies her principle of
          externalization also to faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It has also virtually removed the element of knowledge from faith.
          One may be considered a true believer, if one is but ready to believe
          what the Church teaches, without really knowing what this is. Such a
          faith is called a fides implicita in distinction from the fides
          explicita, which includes knowledge. By teaching that it is sufficient
          to believe what the ecclesia docens teaches, the Roman Catholic Church
          applies the principle of clericalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is still another point which characterizes the Roman Catholic
          doctrine of faith, namely, the distinction between a fides informis
          and a fides formata. The former is the mere assent to the doctrine of
          the Church, while the other is a faith which includes love as a
          formative principle and is perfected in love. This is the faith that
          really justifies.
        </p>
        <p>
          QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY: What was the conception of faith in the
          early Church? Did Augustine's view differ from that of the earlier
          fathers? How did the distinction between a fides informis and a fides
          formata arise? How did Luther and Calvin differ as to the order of
          faith and repentance? Do the Lutherans and the Reformed agree as to
          the order of faith and regeneration? Why is it important to maintain
          the proper order? How did the distinction between the actus and the
          habitus of faith arise, and why is it important? Can the proposition,
          "I am saved," ever be the object of saving faith? What conception of
          faith is found in Schleiermacher and Ritschl? Why is it very
          appropriate that salvation should be contingent on faith? How does the
          excessive activism of Barth affect his doctrine of faith? What does he
          mean when he says that man is never a believer or a Christian, but
          always a sinner? How do you account for his denial that faith includes
          assurance?
