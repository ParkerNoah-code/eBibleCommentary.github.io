        <h2>LIFE AND CHARACTER OF CHARNOCK,</h2>
        <p>BY WM. SYMINGTON, D.D.</p>
        <p>
          Stephen Charnock, B.D., was born in the year 1628, in the parish of
          St. Katharine Cree, London. His father, Mr. Richard Charnock,
          practised as a solicitor in the Court of Chancery, and was descended
          from a family of some antiquity in Lancashire. Stephen, after a course
          of preparatory study, entered himself, at an early period of life, a
          student in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was placed under the
          immediate tuition of the celebrated Dr. William Sancroft, who became
          afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. Although there is too much reason
          to fear that colleges seldom prove the spiritual birthplaces of the
          youth that attend them, it was otherwise in this case. The Sovereign
          Spirit, who worketh where and how he wills, had determined that this
          young man, while prosecuting his early studies, should undergo that
          essential change of heart which, besides yielding an amount of
          personal comfort, could not fail to exert a salutary influence on all
          his future inquiries, sanctify whatever learning he might hereafter
          acquire, and fit him for being eminently useful to thousands of his
          fellow‑creatures. To this all‑important event we may safely trace the
          eminence to which, both as a Preacher and as a Divine, he afterwards
          attained,—as he had thus a stimulus to exertion, a motive to vigorous
          and unremitting application, which could not otherwise have existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          On his leaving the University he spent some time in a private family,
          either as a preceptor or for the purpose of qualifying himself the
          better for discharging the solemn and arduous duties of public life,
          on which he was about to enter. Soon after this, just as the Civil War
          broke out in England, he commenced his official labors as a minister
          of the gospel of peace, somewhere in Southwark. He does not appear to
          have held this situation long; but short as was his ministry there, it
          was not altogether without fruit. He who had made the student himself,
          while yet young, the subject of saving operations, was pleased also to
          give efficacy to the first efforts of the youthful pastor to win souls
          to Christ. Several individuals in this his first charge were led to
          own him as their spiritual father. Nor is this a solitary instance of
          the early ministry of an individual receiving that countenance from on
          high which has been withheld from the labors of his riper years. A
          circumstance this, full of encouragement to those who, in the days of
          youth, are entering with much fear and trembling on service in the
          Lord’s vineyard. At the time when they may feel impelled to exclaim
          with most vehemence, Who is sufficient for these things? God may cheer
          them with practical confirmations of the truth, that their sufficiency
          is of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1649, Charnock removed from Southwark to Oxford, where, through
          favor of the Parliamentary Visitors, he obtained a fellowship in New
          College; and, not long afterwards, in consequence of his own merits,
          was incorporated Master of Arts. His singular gifts, and unwearied
          exertions, so attracted the notice and gained the approbation of the
          learned and pious members of the University, that, in 1652, he was
          elevated to the dignity of Senior Proctor,—an office which he
          continued to hold till 1656, and the duties of which he discharged in
          a way which brought equal honor to himself and benefit to the
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the period of his proctorship expired, he went to Ireland, where
          he resided in the family of Mr. Henry Cromwell, who had been appointed
          by his father, the Protector, to the government of that country. It is
          remarkable how many of the eminent divines, both of England and
          Scotland, have spent some part of their time in Ireland, either as
          chaplains to the army or as refugees from persecuting bigotry.
          Charnock seems to have gone thither in the capacity of chaplain to the
          Governor, an office which, in his case at least, proved no sinecure.
          During his residence in Dublin, he appears to have exercised his
          ministry with great regularity and zeal. He preached, we are told,
          every Lord’s day, with much acceptance, to an audience composed of
          persons of different religious denominations, and of opposite grades
          in society. His talents and worth attracted the members of other
          churches, and his connection with the family of the Governor secured
          the attendance of persons of rank. By these his ministrations were
          greatly esteemed and applauded; and it is hoped that to some of them
          they were also blessed. But even many who had no respect for his
          piety, and who reaped no saving benefits from his preaching, were
          unable to withhold their admiration of his learning and his gifts.
          Studying at once to be an “ensample to the flock,” and to “walk within
          his house with a perfect heart,” his qualities, both public and
          private, his appearances, whether in the pulpit or the domestic
          circle, commanded the esteem of all who were privileged to form his
          acquaintance. It is understood that the honorary degree of Bachelor in
          Divinity, which he held, was the gift of Trinity College, Dublin,
          conferred during his residence in that city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The restoration of Charles, in 1660, put an end to Charnock’s ministry
          in Ireland, and hindered his resuming it elsewhere for a considerable
          time. That event, leading, as it could not but do, to the
          re‑establishment of arbitrary power, was followed, as a natural
          consequence, by the ejectment of many of the most godly ministers that
          ever lived. Among these was the excellent individual of whom we are
          now speaking. Accordingly, although on his return to England he took
          up his residence in London, he was not permitted to hold any pastoral
          charge there. Nevertheless, he continued to prosecute his studies with
          ardor, and occasionally exercised his gifts in a private way for
          fifteen years, during which time he paid some visits to the continent,
          especially to France and Holland.
        </p>
        <p>
          At length, in 1675, when the restrictions of the government were so
          far relaxed, he accepted a call from a congregation in Crosby Square,
          to become co‑pastor with the Rev. Thomas Watson, the ejected minister
          of St. Stephen’s, Walbrook, who, soon after the Act of Uniformity, had
          collected a church in that place. Mr. Watson was an eminent
          Presbyterian divine, and the society which he was instrumental in
          founding became afterwards, under the ministry of Dr. Grosvenor, one
          of the most flourishing in the city, in respect both of numbers and of
          wealth. It may not be uninteresting here to insert a few brief notices
          respecting the place of worship which this congregation occupied,
          being the scene of Charnock’s labors during a principal part of his
          ministry, and that in connection with which he closed his official
          career.
        </p>
        <p>
          The place in which this humble Presbyterian congregation1 assembled
          was a large hall of Crosby House, an ancient mansion on the east side
          of Bishopgate Street, erected by Sir John Crosby, Sheriff and Alderman
          of London, in 1470. After passing through the hands of several
          occupants, and, among others, those of Richard III., who thought it
          not unfit for being a royal residence, it became, about the year 1640,
          the property of Alderman Sir John Langham, a staunch Presbyterian and
          Loyalist. A calamitous fire afterwards so injured the building, as to
          render it unsuitable for a family residence; but the hall, celebrated
          for its magnificent oaken ceiling, happily escaped the conflagration,
          and was converted into a meeting‑house for Mr. Watson’s congregation,
          of which the proprietor is supposed to have been a member. The
          structure, though greatly dilapidated, still exists, and is said to be
          regarded as one of the most perfect specimens of the domestic
          architecture of the fifteenth century now remaining in the metropolis.
          But, as an illustration of the vicissitudes such edifices are destined
          to undergo, it may be stated that Crosby Hall, after having witnessed
          the splendors of royalty, and been consecrated to the solemnities of
          divine worship, was lately—perhaps it is still—dedicated to the
          inferior, if not ignoble, uses of a wool‑packer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After saying so much about the building, a word or two respecting the
          congregation which assembled for years under its vaulted roof, may not
          be deemed inappropriate. It was formed, as we have already said, by
          the Rev. Thomas Watson, the ejected minister of St. Stephen’s,
          Walbrook. This took place in 1662, and Charnock was Mr. Watson’s
          colleague for five years. Mr. Watson was succeeded by the son of an
          ejected minister, the Rev. Samuel Slater, who discharged the pastoral
          duties with great ability and faithfulness for twenty‑four years, and
          closed his ministry and life with this solemn patriarchal sentence
          addressed to his people:—“I charge you before God, that you prepare to
          meet me at the day of judgment, as my crown of joy; and that not one
          of you be wanting at the right hand of God.” Dr. Benjamin Grosvenor
          succeeded Mr. Slater. His singular acumen, graceful utterance, lively
          imagination, and fervid devotion, are said to have secured for the
          congregation a greater degree of prosperity than it had ever before
          enjoyed. A pleasing recollection has been preserved, of perhaps one of
          the most touching discourses ever composed, having been delivered by
          him in this Hall, on The Temper of Christ. In this discourse the
          Saviour is introduced, by way of illustrating his own command that
          “repentance and remission of sins should be preached unto all nations,
          beginning at Jerusalem,” as giving the Apostles directions how they
          are to proceed in carrying out this requirement. Amongst other things,
          he is represented as saying to them:—“Go into all nations and offer
          this salvation as you go; but lest the poor house of Israel should
          think themselves abandoned to despair, the seed of Abraham, mine
          ancient friend; as cruel and unkind as they have been, go, make them
          the first offer of grace; let them that struck the rock, drink first
          of its refreshing streams; and they that drew my blood, be welcome to
          its healing virtue. Tell them, that as I was sent to the lost sheep of
          the house of Israel, so, if they will be gathered, I will be their
          shepherd still. Though they despised my tears which I shed over them,
          and imprecated my blood to be upon them, tell them ’twas for their
          sakes I shed both; that by my tears I might soften their hearts
          towards God, and by my blood I might reconcile God to them.... Tell
          them, you have seen the prints of the nails upon my hands and feet,
          and the wounds of the spear in my side; and that those marks of their
          cruelty are so far from giving me vindictive thoughts, that, if they
          will but repent, every wound they have given me speaks in their
          behalf, pleads with the Father for the remission of their sins, and
          enables me to bestow it.... Nay, if you meet that poor wretch that
          thrust the spear into my side, tell him there is another way, a better
          way, of coming at my heart. If he will repent, and look upon him whom
          he has pierced, and will mourn, I will cherish him in that very bosom
          he has wounded; he shall find the blood he shed an ample atonement for
          the sin of shedding it. And tell him from me, he will put me to more
          pain and displeasure by refusing this offer of my blood, than when he
          first drew it forth.” In Dr. Grosvenor’s old age, notwithstanding that
          he was assisted, from time to time, by eminent divines, the
          congregation began to decline. After his death, the pastoral charge
          was held by Dr. Hodge and Mr. Jones successively, but, under the
          ministry of the latter, the church had become so enfeebled, that, on
          the expiration of the lease in 1769, the members agreed to dissolve,
          and were gradually absorbed in other societies.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this digression we return, only to record the last circumstance
          necessary to complete this brief sketch. The death of Charnock took
          place July 27, 1680, when he was in the fifty‑third year of his age.
          The particulars that have come down to us of this event, like those of
          the other parts of his history, are scanty, yet they warrant us to
          remark that he died in a frame of mind every way worthy of his
          excellent character and holy life. He was engaged, at the time, in
          delivering to his people, at Crosby Hall, that series of Discourses on
          the Existence and Attributes of God, on which his fame as a writer
          chiefly rests. The intense interest which he was observed to take in
          the subjects of which he treated, was regarded as an indication that
          he was nearly approaching that state in which he was to be “filled
          with all the fulness of God.” Not unfrequently was he heard to give
          utterance to a longing desire for that region for which he gave
          evidence of his being so well prepared. These circumstances were,
          naturally enough, looked upon as proofs that his mighty mind, though
          yet on earth, had begun to “put off its mortality,” and was fast
          ripening for the paradise of God. From his death taking place in the
          house of Mr. Richard Tymns, in the parish of Whitechapel, London, it
          may be inferred that his departure was sudden. The body was
          immediately after taken to the meeting‑house at Crosby Square, which
          had been so often the scene of his prayers and preaching. From thence,
          accompanied by a long train of mourners, it was conveyed to St.
          Michael’s Church, Cornhill, where it was deposited hard by the Tower
          under the belfrey. The funeral sermon was preached by his early friend
          and fellow‑student at Cambridge, Mr. John Johnson, from these apposite
          words:—“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
          of their Father.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Such is an outline of the facts, as far as they are known, of the life
          of this great man. There are none, it is true, of those striking
          occurrences and marvellous incidents in the narrative, which attract
          the notice of the multitude, and which are so gratifying to those who
          are in quest of excitement more than of edification. But, let it not
          be thought that, for this reason, the narrative must be destitute of
          the materials of personal improvement. If the advantages to be derived
          from a piece of biography are at all proportioned to the degree in
          which the character and circumstances of the subject resemble those of
          the reader, a greater number, at least, may be expected to obtain
          benefit from a life, the incidents of which are more common, inasmuch
          as there are but comparatively few, the events of whose history are of
          an extraordinary and dazzling description. “When a character,” to use
          the language of a profound judge of human nature,2 “selected from the
          ordinary ranks of life, is faithfully and minutely delineated, no
          effort is requisite to enable us to place ourselves in the same
          situation; we accompany the subject of the narrative, with an interest
          undiminished by distance, unimpaired by dissimilarity of
          circumstances; and, from the efforts by which he surmounted
          difficulties and vanquished temptations, we derive the most useful
          practical lessons. He who desires to strengthen his virtue and purify
          his principles, will always prefer the solid to the specious; will be
          more disposed to contemplate an example of the unostentatious piety
          and goodness which all men may obtain, than of those extraordinary
          achievements to which few can aspire; nor is it the mark of a
          superior, but rather a vulgar and superficial taste, to consider
          nothing as great or excellent but that which glitters with titles, or
          is elevated by rank.”
        </p>
        <p>Let us endeavor to portray the character of Charnock.</p>
        <p>
          The mental qualities by which he was most distinguished as a man, were
          judgment and imagination. The reasoning faculty, naturally strong, was
          improved by diligent training and habitual exercise. In tracing the
          relations and tendencies of things, he greatly excelled; he could
          compare and contrast with admirable ease and beautiful discrimination;
          and his deductions, as was to be expected, were usually sound and
          logical. Judgment was, indeed, the presiding faculty in his, as it
          ought to be in all minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more weighty qualities of intellect were in him united to a
          brilliant fancy. By this means he was enabled to adorn the more solid
          materials of thought with the attractive hues of inventive genius. His
          fine and teeming imagination, ever under the strict control of reason
          and virtue, was uniformly turned to the most important purposes. This
          department of mental phenomena, from the abuses to which it is liable,
          is apt to be undervalued; yet, were this the proper place, it would
          not be difficult to show that imagination is one of the noblest
          faculties with which man has been endowed—a faculty, indeed, the sound
          and proper use of which is not only necessary to the existence of
          sympathy and other social affections, but also intimately connected
          with those higher exercises of soul, by which men are enabled to
          realize the things that are not seen and eternal. Charnock’s
          imagination was under the most cautious and skilful management—the
          handmaid, not the mistress of his reason—and, doubtless, it tended, in
          no small degree, to free his character from that cold and contracted
          selfishness which is apt to predominate in those who are deficient in
          this quality; to impart a generous warmth to his intercourse with
          others; and to throw over his compositions as an author an animating
          and delightful glow.
        </p>
        <p>
          These qualities of mind were associated with habits of intense
          application and persevering diligence, which alike tended to
          invigorate his original powers, and enabled him to turn them all to
          the best account. To the original vigor of his powers must be added
          that which culture supplied. Charnock was a highly educated man. As
          remarked by the first editors of his works, he was not only “a person
          of excellent parts, strong reason, great judgment, and curious fancy,”
          but “of high improvements and general learning, as having been all his
          days a most diligent and methodical student.” An alumnus of both the
          English universities, he may be said to have drawn nourishment from
          each of these generous mothers. He had the reputation of being a
          general scholar; his acquisitions being by no means limited to the
          literature of his profession. Not only was his acquaintance with the
          original languages of Scripture great, but he had made considerable
          attainments in the study of medicine; and, indeed, there was scarcely
          any branch of learning with which he was unacquainted. All his mental
          powers were thus strengthened and refined by judicious discipline,
          and, as we shall see presently, he knew well how to devote his
          treasures, whether original or acquired, to the service of the
          Redeemer; and to consecrate the richest stores of natural genius and
          educational attainment, by laying them all at the foot of the Cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that which gave the finish to Charnock’s intellectual character,
          was not the predominance of any one quality so much as the harmonious
          and nicely balanced union of all. Acute perception, sound judgment,
          masculine sense, brilliant imagination, habits of reflection, and a
          complete mastery over the succession of his thoughts, were all
          combined in that comely order and that due proportion which go to
          constitute a well‑regulated mind. There was, in his case, none of that
          disproportionate development of any one particular faculty, which, in
          some cases, serves, like an overpowering glare, to dim, if not almost
          to quench the splendor of the rest. The various faculties of his soul,
          to make use of a figure, rather shone forth like so many glittering
          stars, from the calm and clear firmament of his mind, each supplying
          its allotted tribute of light, and contributing to the serene and
          solemn lustre of the whole. As has been said of another, so may it be
          said of him—“If it be rare to meet with an individual whose mental
          faculties are thus admirably balanced, in whom no tyrant faculty
          usurps dominion over the rest, or erects a despotism on the ruins of
          the intellectual republic; still more rare is it to meet with such a
          mind in union with the far higher qualities of religious and moral
          excellence.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor were Charnock’s moral qualities less estimable than his
          intellectual. He was a pre‑eminently holy man, distinguished at once
          by personal purity, social equity, and habitual devotion. Early the
          subject of saving grace, he was in his own person an excellent example
          of the harmony of faith, with the philosophy of the moral feelings.
          Strongly he felt that while “not without law to God,” he was
          nevertheless “under law to Christ.” The motives from which he acted in
          every department of moral duty were evangelical motives; and so
          entirely was he imbued with the spirit, so completely under the power
          of the gospel, that whatever he did, no matter how humble in the scale
          of moral duty, he “served the Lord Christ.” The regulating principle
          of his whole life is embodied in the apostolical
          injunction:—“Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not
          unto men.” The various talents with which he was gifted by the God of
          nature, were all presided over by an enlightened and deep‑toned piety,
          for which he was indebted to the sovereign grace of God in the Lord
          Jesus Christ. It was this that struck the key‑note of the intellectual
          and moral harmony to which we have adverted as a prominent feature in
          his character. This at once directed each faculty to its proper
          object, and regulated the measure of its exercise. Devotion was the
          very element in which he lived and breathed, and had his being. Devout
          communion with Supreme Excellence, the contemplation of celestial
          themes, and preparation for a higher state of being, constituted the
          truest pleasures of his existence, elevated him far above the control
          of merely sentient and animal nature, and secured for him an
          undisturbed repose of mind, which was itself but an antepast of what
          awaited him in the unclouded region of glory. Nor was his devotion
          transient or occasional merely; it was habitual as it was deep,
          extending its plastic and sanctifying influence to every feature of
          character, and every event of life; dictating at once ceaseless
          efforts for the welfare of man, and intensest desires for the glory of
          God; and securing that rarest perhaps of all combinations, close
          communion with the future and the eternal, and the busy and
          conscientious discharge of the ordinary duties of everyday life.

          His natural temper appears to have been reserved, and his manners
          grave. Regarding the advantages to be derived from general society as
          insufficient to compensate for the loss of those to be acquired by
          retirement, he cultivated the acquaintance of few, and these few the
          more intelligent and godly, with whom, however, putting aside his
          natural backwardness, he was wont to be perfectly affable and
          communicative. But his best and most highly cherished companions were
          his books, of which he had contrived to secure a valuable though
          select collection. With these he held frequent and familiar
          intercourse. Great part of his time, indeed, was spent in his study;
          and when the calls of unavoidable duty compelled him to leave it, so
          bent was he on redeeming time, that, not content with appropriating
          the hours usually devoted to sleep, he cultivated the habit of
          thinking while walking along the streets. So successful was he in his
          efforts of abstraction, that, amid the most crowded and attractive
          scenes, he could withdraw his mind easily from the vanities which
          solicited his attention, and give himself up to close thinking and
          useful meditation. The productions of his pen, and the character of
          his pulpit services, bore ample evidence that the hours of retirement
          were given neither to frivolous vacuity nor to self‑indulgent sloth,
          but to the industrious cultivation of his powers, and to conscientious
          preparation for public duty. He was not content, like many, with the
          mere reputation of being a recluse; on the contrary, he was set on
          bringing forth the fruits of a hard student. There was always one day
          in the week in which he made it to appear that the others were not
          misspent. His Sabbath ministrations were not the loose vapid effusions
          of a few hours’ careless preparation, but were rather the substantial,
          well‑arranged, well‑compacted products of much intense thought and
          deep cogitation. “Had he been less in his study,” says his editors
          quaintly, “he would have been less liked in the pulpit.”
        </p>
        <p>
          To a person of these studious habits it may easily be conceived what
          distress it must have occasioned to have his library swept away from
          him. In that dreadful misfortune which befell the metropolis in 1666,
          ever since known as “the fire of London,” the whole of Charnock’s
          books were destroyed. The amount of calamity involved in such an
          occurrence can be estimated aright only by those who know from
          experience the strength and sacredness of that endearment with which
          the real student regards those silent but instructive friends which he
          has drawn around him by slow degrees; with which he has cultivated a
          long and intimate acquaintance; which are ever at hand with their
          valuable assistance, counsel and consolation, when these are needed;
          which, unlike some less judicious companions, never intrude upon him
          against his will; and with whose very looks and positions, as they
          repose in their places around him, he has become so familiarized, that
          it is no difficult thing for him to call up their appearance when
          absent, or to go directly to them in the dark without the risk of a
          mistake. Some may be disposed to smile at this love of books. But
          where is the scholar who will do so? Where is the man of letters who,
          for a single moment, would place the stately mansions and large
          estates of the “sons of earth” in comparison with his own well‑loaded
          shelves? Where the student who, on looking round upon the walls of his
          study, is not conscious of a satisfaction greater and better far than
          landed proprietor ever felt on surveying his fields and lawns—a
          satisfaction which almost unconsciously seeks vent in the exclamation,
          “My library! a dukedom large enough!” Such, and such only, can judge
          what must have been Charnock’s feelings, when he found that his much
          cherished volumes had become a heap of smouldering ashes. The
          sympathetic regret is only rendered the more intense, when it is
          thought that, in all probability, much valuable manuscript perished in
          the conflagration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charnock excelled as a Preacher. This is an office which, whether as
          regards its origin, nature, design, or effects, it will be difficult
          to overrate. The relation in which it stands to the salvation of
          immortal souls, invests it with an interest overwhelmingly momentous.
          Our former remarks will serve to show how well he of whom we now speak
          was qualified for acting in this highest of all the capacities in
          which man is required to serve. His mental and moral endowments, his
          educational acquirements, his habitual seriousness, his sanctified
          imagination, and his vigorous faith, pre‑eminently fitted him for
          discharging with ability and effect the duties of a herald of the
          Cross. Of his style of preaching we may form a pretty accurate idea
          from the writings he has left, which were all of them transcribed from
          the notes of his sermons. We hence infer that his discourses, while
          excelling in solid divinity and argumentative power, were not by any
          means deficient in their practical bearing, being addressed not more
          to the understandings than to the hearts of his hearers. “Nothing,” it
          has been justly remarked, “can be more nervous than his reasoning,
          nothing more affecting than his applications.” While able to unravel
          with great acuteness and judgment the intricacies of a nice question
          in polemics, he could with no less dexterity and skill address himself
          to the business of the Christian life, or to the casuistry of
          religious experience. Perspicuous plainness, convincing cogency, great
          wisdom, fearless honesty, and affectionate earnestness, are the chief
          characteristics of his sermons.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this it must be added that his preaching was eminently evangelical.
          So deeply imbued with gospel truth were his discourses, that, like the
          Book of the Law of old, they might be said to be sprinkled with blood,
          even the blood of atonement. The Cross was at once the basis on which
          he rested his doctrinal statements, and the armory from which he drew
          his most forcible and pointed appeals to the conscience. His aim seems
          never once to have been to catch applause to himself by the enticing
          words of man’s wisdom, by arraying his thoughts in the motley garb of
          an affected and gorgeous style, or by having recourse to the tricks of
          an inflated and meretricious oratory. His sole ambition appears to
          have been to “turn sinners from the error of their ways;” and for this
          end he wisely judged nothing to be so well adapted as “holding forth
          the words of eternal life” in their native simplicity and power, and
          in a spirit of sincere and ardent devotion. His object was to move his
          hearers, not towards himself, but towards his Master; not to elicit
          expressions of admiration for the messenger, but to make the message
          bear on the salvation of those to whom it was delivered; not to
          please, so much as to convert, his hearers; not to tickle their fancy,
          but to save the soul from death, and thus to hide a multitude of sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The character of his preaching, it is true, was adapted to the higher
          and more intelligent classes; yet was it not altogether unsuited to
          those of humbler rank and pretensions. He could handle the mysteries
          of the gospel with great perspicuity and plainness, using his profound
          learning for the purpose, not of mystifying, but of making things
          clear, so that persons even in the ordinary walks of life felt him to
          be not beyond their capacity. The energy, gravity, and earnestness of
          his manner, especially when young, contributed to render him a great
          favorite with the public, and accordingly he drew after him large and
          deeply interested audiences—a circumstance which, we can suppose, was
          valued by him, not because of the incense which it ministered to a
          spirit of vanity, but of the opportunity it afforded him of winning
          souls to the Redeemer. When more advanced in life, this kind of
          popularity, we are told, declined, in consequence of his being
          compelled from an infirmity of memory to read his sermons, with the
          additional disadvantage of requiring to supply defect of sight by the
          use of a glass. But an increasing weight and importance in the matter,
          fully compensated for any deficiency in the manner of his preaching.
          If the more flighty of his hearers retired, others—among whom were
          many of his brethren in the ministry—who knew how to prefer solidity
          to show, crowded to supply their places. Reckoning it no ordinary
          privilege to be permitted to sit devoutly at the feet of one so well
          qualified to initiate them into the knowledge of the deep things of
          God, they continued to listen to his instructions with as much
          admiration and profit as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is as a Writer, however, that Charnock is best known, and this,
          indeed, is the only character in which we can now come into contact
          with him. His works are extensive, but, with a single exception,
          posthumous. The only thing published by himself was the piece on “The
          Sinfulness and Cure of Thoughts,” which appeared originally in the
          Supplement to the Morning Exercise at Cripplegate. Yet such was the
          quantity of manuscript left behind him at his death, that two large
          folio volumes were soon transcribed, and published by his friends, Mr.
          Adams and Mr. Veal, to whom he had committed his papers. The Discourse
          on Providence was the first published; it appeared in 1680. The
          Discourses on the Existence and Attributes of God came next, in 1682.
          There followed in succession the treatises on Regeneration,
          Reconciliation, The Lord’s Supper, &amp;c. A second edition of the
          whole works, in two volumes, folio, came out in 1684, and a third in
          1702—no slight proof of the estimation in which they were held.
          Several of the treatises have appeared from time to time in a separate
          form, especially those on Divine Providence, on Man’s Enmity to God,
          and on Mercy for the Chief of Sinners. The best edition of Charnock’s
          works is that published in 1815, in nine volumes, royal 8vo; with a
          prefatory Dedication, and a Memoir of the Author, by the Rev. Edward
          Parsons of Leeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Charnock’s writings are distinguished for sound theology, profound
          thinking, and lively imagination. They partake of that massive
          divinity for which the Puritan Divines were in general remarkable, and
          are of course orthodox in their doctrinal statements and reasonings.
          Everywhere the reader meets with the evidences and fruits of deep
          thought, of a mind, indeed, of unusual comprehension and energy of
          grasp, that could penetrate with ease into the very core, and fathom
          at pleasure the profoundest depths of the most abstruse and obscure
          subjects; while, from the rich stores of an exuberant and hallowed
          fancy, he was enabled to throw over his compositions the most
          attractive ornaments, and to supply spontaneously such illustrations
          as were necessary to render his meaning more clear, or his lessons
          more impressive. In a word, for weight of matter, for energy of
          thought, for copiousness of improving reflection, for grandeur and
          force of illustration, and for accuracy and felicitousness of
          expression, Charnock is equalled by few, and surpassed by none of the
          writers of the age to which he belonged. The eulogy pronounced by a
          competent judge on the Treatise on the Attributes, applies with equal
          justice to all his other writings:—“Perspicuity and depth;
          metaphysical subtlety and evangelical simplicity; immense learning,
          and plain but irrefragable reasoning, conspire to render that work one
          of the most inestimable productions that ever did honor to the
          sanctified judgment and genius of a human being.”3
        </p>
        <p>
          The correctness of the composition, in these works, is remarkable,
          considering that they were not prepared for the press by the author
          himself, and that they must have been originally written amid scenes
          of distraction and turmoil, arising out of the events of the times.
          The latter circumstance may account for the manly vigor by which they
          are characterized, but it only renders their accuracy and polish the
          more wonderful. Refinement of taste and extensive scholarship can
          alone explain the chasteness, ease, and elegance of style, so free
          from all verbosity and clumsiness, which mark these productions. There
          were giants in literature in those days, and Stephen Charnock was not
          the least of the noble fraternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charnock may not have all the brilliancy of Bunyan, nor all the
          metaphysical acumen and subtle analysis of Howe, nor all the awful
          earnestness of Baxter; but he is not less argumentative, while he is
          more theological than any of them, and his theology, too, is more
          sound than that of some. “He was not,” say the original editors of his
          works, “for that modern divinity which is so much in vogue with some,
          who would be counted the only sound divines; having tasted the old, he
          did not desire the new, but said the old is better.” There is,
          therefore, not one of all the Puritan Divines whose writings can with
          more safety be recommended to the attention of students of divinity
          and young ministers. It is one of the happy signs of the times in
          which we live, that a taste for reading such works is beginning to
          revive; and we can conceive no better wish for the interests of
          mankind in general, and of our country in particular, than that the
          minds of our young divines were thoroughly impregnated with the good
          old theology to be found in such writings as those which we now take
          the liberty to introduce and recommend. “If a preacher wishes to
          recommend himself by the weight of his doctrines,” to use the language
          of Mr. Parsons, “he will find in the writings of Charnock the great
          truths of Scripture illustrated and explained in the most lucid and
          masterly manner. If he wishes to be distinguished by the evangelical
          strain of his discourses, and by the continual exhibition of Christ
          and him crucified, he will here find the characters of Christ, and the
          adaptation of the gospel to the circumstances and wants of man as a
          fallen creature, invariably kept in view. If he wishes for usefulness
          in the Church of God, here he has the brightest example of forcible
          appeals to the conscience, and of the most impressive applications of
          Scripture truth, to the various conditions of mankind. And, finally,
          if he reads for his own advantage as a Christian, his mind will be
          delighted with the inexhaustible variety here provided for the
          employment of his enlightened faculties, and his improvement in every
          divine attainment.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy shall we be, if what we have written shall, by the blessing of
          God, prove the means of producing or reviving a taste for reading the
          works of our author, being fully convinced with a former editor, that,
          “while talent is respected, or virtue revered—while holiness of
          conversation, consistency of character, or elevation of mind, are
          considered as worthy of imitation—while uniform and strenuous exertion
          for the welfare of man is honored, and constant devotedness to the
          glory of God admired, the memory of Charnock shall be held in grateful
          remembrance.”
