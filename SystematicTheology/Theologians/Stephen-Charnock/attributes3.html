        <h2>DISCOURSE III.</h2>
        <p>ON GOD’S BEING A SPIRIT.</p>
        <p>
          John iv. 24—God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
          him in spirit and in truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words are part of the dialogue between our Saviour and the
          Samaritan woman.312 Christ, intending to return from Judea to Galilee,
          passed through the country of Samaria, a place inhabited not by Jews,
          but a mixed company of several nations, and some remainders of the
          posterity of Israel, who escaped the captivity, and were returned from
          Assyria; and being weary with his journey, arrived about the sixth
          hour or noon (according to the Jews’ reckoning the time of the day),
          at a well that Jacob had digged, which was of great account among the
          inhabitants for the antiquity of it, as well as the usefulness of it,
          in supplying their necessities: he being thirsty, and having none to
          furnish him wherewith to draw water, at last comes a woman from the
          city, whom he desires to give him some water to drink. The woman,
          perceiving him by his language or habit to be a Jew, wonders at the
          question, since the hatred the Jews bore the Samaritans was so great,
          that they would not vouchsafe to have any commerce with them, not only
          in religious, but civil affairs, and common offices belonging to
          mankind. Hence our Saviour takes occasion to publish to her the
          doctrine of the gospel; and excuseth her rude answer by her ignorance
          of him; and tells her, that if she had asked him a greater matter,
          even that which concerned her eternal salvation, he would readily have
          granted it, notwithstanding the rooted hatred between the Jews and
          Samaritans; and bestowed a water of a greater virtue, the “water of
          life.”313 The woman is no less astonished at his reply than she was at
          his first demand. It was strange to hear a man speak of giving living
          water to one of whom he had begged the water of that spring, and had
          no vessel to draw any to quench his own thirst. She therefore demands
          whence he could have this water that he speaks of,314 since she
          conceived him not greater than Jacob, who had digged that well and
          drank of it. Our Saviour, desirous to make a progress in that work he
          had begun, extols the water he spake of, above this of the well, from
          its particular virtue fully to refresh those that drank of it, and be
          as a cooling and comforting fountain within them, of more efficacy
          than that without.315 The woman, conceiving a good opinion of our
          Saviour, desires to partake of this water, to save her pains in coming
          daily to the well, not apprehending the spirituality of Christ’s
          discourse to her:316 Christ finding her to take some pleasure in his
          discourse, partly to bring her to a sense of her sin, before he did
          communicate the excellency of his grace, bids her return back to the
          city and bring her husband with her to him.317 She freely acknowledges
          that she had no husband; whether having some check of conscience at
          present for the unclean life she led, or loth to lose so much time in
          the gaining this water so much desired by her:318 our Saviour takes an
          occasion from this to lay open her sin before her, and to make her
          sensible of her own wicked life and the prophetic excellency of
          himself; and tells her she had had five husbands, to whom she had been
          false, and by whom she was divorced, and the person she now dwelt with
          was not her lawful husband, and in living with him she violated the
          rights of marriage, and increased guilt upon her conscience.319 The
          woman being affected with this discourse, and knowing him to be a
          stranger that could not be certified of those things but in an
          extraordinary way, begins to have a high esteem of him as a
          prophet.320 And upon this opinion she esteems him able to decide a
          question, which had been canvassed between them and the Jews, about
          the place of worship.321 Their fathers worshipping in that mountain,
          and the Jews affirming Jerusalem to be a place of worship, she pleads
          the antiquity of the worship in this place, Abraham having built an
          altar there (Gen. xii. 7), and Jacob, upon his return from Syria. And,
          surely, had the place been capable of an exception, such persons as
          they, and so well acquainted with the will of God, would not have
          pitched upon that place to celebrate their worship. Antiquity hath,
          too, too often bewitched the minds of men, and drawn them from the
          revealed will of God. Men are more willing to imitate the outward
          actions of their famous ancestors, than conform themselves to the
          revealed will of their Creator. The Samaritans would imitate the
          patriarchs in the place of worship, but not in the faith of the
          worshippers. Christ answers her, that this question would quickly be
          resolved by a new state of the church, which was near at hand; and
          neither Jerusalem, which had now the precedency, nor that mountain,
          should be of any more value in that concern, than any other place in
          the world:322 but yet, to make her sensible of her sin and that of her
          countrymen, tells her, that their worship in that mountain was not
          according to the will of God, he having long after the altars built in
          this place, fixed Jerusalem as the place of sacrifices; besides, they
          had not the knowledge of that God which ought to be worshipped by
          them, but the Jews had the “true object of worship,” and the “true
          manner of worship, according to the declaration God had made of
          himself to them.”323 But all that service shall vanish, the veil of
          the temple shall be rent in twain, and that carnal worship give place
          to one more spiritual; shadows shall fly before substance, and truth
          advance itself above figures; and the worship of God shall be with the
          strength of the Spirit: such a worship, and such worshippers doth the
          Father seek;324 for “God is a Spirit: and those that worship him must
          worship him in spirit and in truth.” The design of our Saviour is to
          declare, that God is not taken with external worship invented by men,
          no, nor commanded by himself; and that upon this reason, because he is
          a spiritual essence, infinitely above gross and corporeal matter, and
          is not taken with that pomp which is a pleasure to our earthly
          imaginations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Πνεῦμα ὁ Θεός. Some translate it just as the words lie: “Spirit is
          God.”325 But it is not unusual, both in the Old and New Testament
          languages, to put the predicate before the subject, as Psalm v. 9,
          “Their throat is an open sepulchre;” in the Hebrew, “A sepulchre open
          their throat;” so Psalm cxi. 3, “His work is honorable and glorious;”
          Heb. “Honor and glory is his work;” and there wants not one example in
          the same evangelist (John i. 1), “And the Word was God;” Greek, “And
          God was the Word:” in all, the predicate, or what is ascribed, is put
          before the subject to which it is ascribed. One tells us, and he, a
          head of a party that hath made a disturbance in the church of God,326
          that this place is not aptly brought to prove God to be a Spirit; and
          the reason of Christ runs not thus,—God is of a spiritual essence, and
          therefore must be worshipped with a spiritual worship; for the essence
          of God is not the foundation of his worship, but his will; for then we
          were not to worship him with a corporeal worship, because he is not a
          body; but with an invisible and eternal worship, because he is
          invisible and eternal. But the nature of God is the foundation of
          worship; the will of God is the rule of worship; the matter and manner
          is to be performed according to the will of God. But is the nature of
          the object of worship to be excluded? No; as the object is, so ought
          our devotion to be, spiritual as he is spiritual. God, in his commands
          for worship, respected the discovery of his own nature; in the law, he
          respected the discovery of his mercy and justice, and therefore
          commanded a worship by sacrifices; a spiritual worship without those
          institutions would not have declared those attributes which was God’s
          end to display to the world in Christ; and though the nature of God is
          to be respected in worship, yet the obligations of the creature are to
          be considered. God is a Spirit, therefore must have a spiritual
          worship; the creature hath a body as well as a soul, and both from
          God; and therefore ought to worship God with the one as well as the
          other, since one as well as the other is freely bestowed upon him. The
          spirituality of God was the foundation of the change from the Judaical
          carnal worship to a more spiritual and evangelical.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is a Spirit; that is, he hath nothing corporeal, no mixture of
          matter, not a visible substance, a bodily form.327 He is a Spirit, not
          a bare spiritual substance, but an understanding, willing Spirit,
          holy, wise, good, and just. Before, Christ spake of the Father,328 the
          first person in the Trinity; now he speaks of God essentially: the
          word Father is personal, the word God essential; so that our Saviour
          would render a reason, not from any one person in the blessed Trinity,
          but from the Divine nature, why we should worship in spirit, and
          therefore makes use of the word God, the being a Spirit being common
          to the other persons with the Father. This is the reason of the
          proposition (ver. 23), “Of a spiritual worship.” Every nature delights
          in that which is like it, and distastes that which is most different
          from it. If God were corporeal, he might be pleased with the victims
          of beasts, and the beautiful magnificence of temples, and the noise of
          music; but being a Spirit, he cannot be gratified with carnal things;
          he demands something better and greater than all those,—that soul
          which he made, that soul which he hath endowed, a spirit of a frame
          suitable to his nature. He indeed appointed sacrifices, and a temple,
          as shadows of those things which were to be most acceptable to him in
          the Messiah, but they were imposed only “till the time of
          reformation.”329
        </p>
        <p>
          Must worship him; not they may, or it would be more agreeable to God
          to have such a manner of worship; but they must. It is not exclusive
          of bodily worship; for this were to exclude all public worship in
          societies, which cannot be performed without reverential postures of
          the body.330 The gestures of the body are helps to worship, and
          declarations of spiritual acts. We can scarcely worship God with our
          spirits without some tincture upon the outward man; but he excludes
          all acts merely corporeal, all resting upon an external service and
          devotion, which was the crime of the Pharisees, and the general
          persuasion of the Jews as well as heathens, who used the outward
          ceremonies, not as signs of better things, but as if they did of
          themselves please God, and render the worshippers accepted with him,
          without any suitable frame of the inward man.331 It is as if he had
          said, Now you must separate yourselves from all carnal modes to which
          the service of God is now tied, and render a worship chiefly
          consisting in the affectionate motions of the heart, and accommodated
          more exactly to the condition of the object, who is a Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spirit and truth.332 The evangelical service now required has the
          advantage of the former; that was a shadow and figure, this the body
          and truth.333 Spirit, say some, is here opposed to the legal
          ceremonies; truth, to hypocritical services; or, rather truth is
          opposed to shadows,334 and an opinion of worth in the outward action;
          it is principally opposed to external rites, because our Saviour saith
          (ver. 23): “The hour comes, and now is,” &amp;c. Had it been opposed
          to hypocrisy, Christ had said no new thing; for God always required
          truth in the inward parts, and all true worshippers had served him
          with a sincere conscience and single heart. The old patriarchs did
          worship God in spirit and truth, as taken for sincerity; such a
          worship was always, and is perpetually due to God, because he always
          was, and eternally will be, a Spirit.335 And it is said, “The Father
          seeks such to worship him,” not, shall seek; he always sought it; it
          always was performed to him by one or other in the world: and the
          prophets had always rebuked them for resting upon their outward
          solemnities (Isa. lviii. 7, and Micah vi. 8): but a worship without
          legal rites was proper to an evangelical state and the times of the
          gospel, God having then exhibited Christ, and brought into the world
          the substance of those shadows, and the end of those institutions;
          there was no more need to continue them when the true reason of them
          was ceased. All laws do naturally expire when the true reason upon
          which they were first framed is changed. Or by spirit may be meant,
          such a worship as is kindled in the heart by the breath of the Holy
          Ghost. Since we are dead in sin, a spiritual light and flame in the
          heart, suitable to the nature of the object of our worship, cannot be
          raised in us without the operation of a supernatural grace; and though
          the fathers could not worship God without the Spirit, yet in the
          gospel‑times, there being a fuller effusion of the Spirit, the
          evangelical state is called, “the administration of the Spirit,” and
          “the newness of the Spirit,” in opposition to the legal economy,
          entitled the “oldness of the letter.”336 The evangelical state is more
          suited to the nature of God than any other; such a worship God must
          have, whereby he is acknowledged to be the true sanctifier and
          quickener of the soul. The nearer God doth approach to us, and the
          more full his manifestations are, the more spiritual is the worship we
          return to God. The gospel pares off the rugged parts of the law, and
          heaven shall remove what is material in the gospel, and change the
          ordinances of worship into that of a spiritual praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the words there is: 1. A proposition,—“God is a Spirit;” the
          foundation of all religion. 2. An inference,—“They that worship him,”
          &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          As God, a worship belongs to him; as a Spirit, a spiritual worship is
          due to him: in the inference we have, 1. The manner of worship, “in
          spirit and truth;” 2. The necessity of such a worship, “must.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposition declares the nature of God; the inference, the duty of
          man. The observations lie plain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obs. 1. God is a pure spiritual being: “he is a Spirit.” 2. The
          worship due from the creature to God must be agreeable to the nature
          of God, and purely spiritual. 3. The evangelical state is suited to
          the nature of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. For the first: “God is a pure spiritual being.” It is the
          observation of one,337 that the plain assertion of God’s being a
          Spirit is found but once in the whole Bible, and that is in this
          place; which may well be wondered at, because God is so often
          described with hands, feet, eyes, and ears, in the form and figure of
          a man. The spiritual nature of God is deducible from many places; but
          not anywhere, as I remember, asserted totidem verbis, but in this
          text: some allege that place (2 Cor. iii. 17), “The Lord is that
          Spirit,” for the proof of it; but that seems to have a different
          sense: in the text, the nature of God is described; in that place, the
          operations of God in the gospel. “It is not the ministry of Moses, or
          that old covenant, which communicates to you that Spirit it speaks of;
          but it is the Lord Jesus, and the doctrine of the gospel delivered by
          him, whereby this Spirit and liberty is dispensed to you; he opposes
          here the liberty of the gospel to the servitude of the law;”338 it is
          from Christ that a divine virtue diffuseth itself by the gospel; it is
          by him, not by the law, that we partake of that Spirit. The
          spirituality of God is as evident as his being.339 If we grant that
          God is, we must necessarily grant that he cannot be corporeal, because
          a body is of an imperfect nature. It will appear incredible to any
          that acknowledge God the first Being and Creator of all things, that
          he should be a massy, heavy body, and have eyes and ears, feet and
          hands, as we have.—For the explication of it,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Spirit is taken various ways in Scripture. It signifies sometimes
          an aërial substance, as Psalm xi. 6; a horrible tempest (Heb. a spirit
          of tempest); sometimes the breath, which is a thin substance (Gen. vi.
          17): “All flesh, wherein is the breath of life” (Heb. spirit of life).
          A thin substance, though it be material and corporeal, is called
          spirit; and in the bodies of living creatures, that which is the
          principle of their actions is called spirits, the animal and vital
          spirits. And the finer parts extracted from plants and minerals we
          call spirits, those volatile parts separated from that gross matter
          wherein they were immersed, because they come nearest to the nature of
          an incorporeal substance; and from this notion of the word, it is
          translated to signify those substances that are purely immaterial, as
          angels and the souls of men. Angels are called spirits (Psalm civ. 4):
          “Who makes his angels spirits;”340 and not only good angels are so
          called, but evil angels (Mark i. 27); souls of men are called spirits
          (Eccles. xii.); and the soul of Christ is called so (John xix. 30);
          whence God is called “the God of the spirits of all flesh” (Numb.
          xxii. 16). And spirit is opposed to flesh (Isa. xxxi. 3): “The
          Egyptians are flesh, and not spirit.” And our Saviour gives us the
          notion of a spirit to be something above the nature of a body (Luke
          xxiv. 39), “not having flesh and bones,” extended parts, loads of
          gross matter. It is also taken for those things which are active and
          efficacious; because activity is of the nature of a spirit: Caleb had
          another spirit (Numb. xiv. 24), an active affection. The vehement
          motions of sin are called spirit (Hos. iv. 12): “the spirit of
          whoredoms,” in that sense that Prov. xxix. 11, “a fool utters all his
          mind,” all his spirit; he knows not how to restrain the vehement
          motions of his mind. So that the notion of a spirit is, that it is a
          fine, immaterial substance, an active being, that acts itself and
          other things. A mere body cannot act itself; as the body of man cannot
          move without the soul, no more than a ship can move itself without
          wind and waves. So God is called a Spirit, as being not a body, not
          having the greatness, figure, thickness, or length of a body, wholly
          separate from anything of flesh and matter. We find a principle within
          us nobler than that of our bodies; and, therefore, we conceive the
          nature of God, according to that which is more worthy in us, and not
          according to that which is the vilest part of our natures. God is a
          most spiritual Spirit, more spiritual than all angels, all souls.341
          As he exceeds all in the nature of being, so he exceeds all in the
          nature of spirit: he hath nothing gross, heavy, material, in his
          essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. When we say God is a Spirit, it is to be understood by way of
          negation. There are two ways of knowing or describing God: by way of
          affirmation, affirming that of him by way of eminency, which is
          excellent in the creature, as when we say God is wise, good; the
          other, by way of negation, when we remove from God in our conceptions
          what is tainted with imperfection in the creature.342 The first
          ascribes to him whatsoever is excellent; the other separates from him
          whatsoever is imperfect. The first is like a limning, which adds one
          color to another to make a comely picture; the other is like a
          carving, which pares and cuts away whatsoever is superfluous, to make
          a complete statue. This way of negation is more easy; we better
          understand what God is not, than what he is; and most of our knowledge
          of God is by this way; as when we say God is infinite, immense,
          immutable, they are negatives; he hath no limits, is confined to no
          place, admits of no change.343 When we remove from him what is
          inconsistent with his being, we do more strongly assert his being, and
          know more of him when we elevate him above all, and above our own
          capacity. And when we say God is a Spirit, it is a negation; he is not
          a body; he consists not of various parts, extended one without and
          beyond another. He is not a spirit, so as our souls are, to be the
          form of any body; a spirit, not as angels and souls are, but
          infinitely higher. We call him so, because, in regard of our weakness,
          we have not any other term of excellency to express or conceive of him
          by; we transfer it to God in honor, because spirit is the highest
          excellency in our nature: yet we must apprehend God above any spirit,
          since his nature is so great that he cannot be declared by human
          speech, perceived by human sense, or conceived by human understanding.

          II. The second thing, that “God is a Spirit.” Some among the heathens
          imagined God to have a body;344 some thought him to have a body of
          air; some a heavenly body; some a human body;345 and many of them
          ascribed bodies to their gods, but bodies without blood, without
          corruption, bodies made up of the finest and thinnest atoms; such
          bodies, which, if compared with ours, were as no bodies. The Sadducees
          also, who denied all spirits, and yet acknowledged a God, must
          conclude him to be a body, and no spirit. Some among Christians have
          been of that opinion. Tertullian is charged by some, and excused by
          others; and some monks of Egypt were so fierce for this error, that
          they attempted to kill one Theophilus, a bishop, for not being of that
          judgment. But the wiser heathens were of another mind,346 and esteemed
          it an unholy thing to have such imaginations of God.347 And some
          Christians have thought God only to be free from anything of body,
          because he is omnipresent, immutable, he is only incorporeal and
          spiritual; all things else, even the angels, are clothed with bodies,
          though of a neater matter, and a more active frame than ours; a pure
          spiritual nature they allowed to no being but God. Scripture and
          reason meet together to assert the spirituality of God. Had God had
          the lineaments of a body, the Gentiles had not fallen under that
          accusation of changing his glory into that of a corruptible man.348
          This is signified by the name God gives himself (Exod. iii. 14): “I am
          that I am;” a simple, pure, uncompounded being, without any created
          mixture; as infinitely above the being of creatures as above the
          conceptions of creatures (Job xxxvii. 23): “Touching the Almighty, we
          cannot find him out.” He is so much a Spirit, that he is the “Father
          of spirits” (Heb. xii. 9). The Almighty Father is not of a nature
          inferior to his children. The soul is a spirit; it could not else
          exert actions without the assistance of the body, as the act of
          understanding itself, and its own nature, the act of willing, and
          willing things against the incitements and interest of the body. It
          could not else conceive of God, angels, and immaterial substances; it
          could not else be so active, as with one glance to fetch a compass
          from earth to heaven, and by a sudden motion, to elevate the
          understanding from an earthly thought, to the thinking of things as
          high as the highest heavens. If we have this opinion of our souls,
          which, in the nobleness of their acts, surmount the body, without
          which the body is but a dull inactive piece of clay, we must needs
          have a higher conception of God, than to clog him with any matter,
          though of a finer temper than ours: we must conceive of him by the
          perfections of our souls, without the vileness of our bodies. If God
          made man according to his image, we must raise our thoughts of God
          according to the noblest part of that image, and imagine the exemplar
          or copy not to come short, but to exceed the thing copied by it. God
          were not the most excellent substance if he were not a Spirit.
          Spiritual substances are more excellent than bodily; the soul of man
          more excellent than other animals; angels more excellent than men.
          They contain, in their own nature, whatsoever dignity there is in the
          inferior creatures; God must have, therefore, an excellency above all
          those, and, therefore, is entirely remote from the conditions of a
          body. It is a gross conceit, therefore, to think that God is such a
          spirit as the air is; for that is to be a body as the air is, though
          it be a thin one; and if God were no more a spirit than that, or than
          angels, he would not be the most simple being.349 Yet some think that
          the spiritual Deity was represented by the air in the ark of the
          testament.350 It was unlawful to represent him by any image that God
          had prohibited. Everything about the ark had a particular
          signification. The gold and other ornaments about it signified
          something of Christ, but were unfit to represent the nature of God: a
          thing purely invisible, and falling under nothing of sense, could not
          represent him to the mind of man. The air in the ark was the fittest;
          it represented the invisibility of God, air being imperceptible to our
          eyes. Air diffuseth itself through all parts of the world; it glides
          through secret passages into all creatures; it fills the space between
          heaven and earth. There is no place wherein God is not present. To
          evidence this,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be Creator. All multitude
          begins in, and is reduced to unity. As above multitude there is an
          absolute unity, so above mixed creatures there is an absolute
          simplicity. You cannot conceive number without conceiving the
          beginning of it in that which was not number, viz. a unit. You cannot
          conceive any mixture, but you must conceive some simple thing to be
          the original and basis of it. The works of art done by rational
          creatures have their foundation in something spiritual. Every
          artificer, watchmaker, carpenter, hath a model in his own mind of the
          work he designs to frame: the material and outward fabric is squared
          according to an inward and spiritual idea. A spiritual idea speaks a
          spiritual faculty as the subject of it. God could not have an idea of
          that vast number of creatures he brought into being, if he had not had
          a spiritual nature.351 The wisdom whereby the world was created could
          never be the fruit of a corporeal nature; such natures are not capable
          of understanding and comprehending the things which are within the
          compass of their nature, much less of producing them; and therefore
          beasts which have only corporeal faculties move to objects by the
          force of their sense, and have no knowledge of things as they are
          comprehended by the understanding of man. All acts of wisdom speak an
          intelligent and spiritual agent. The effects of wisdom, goodness,
          power, are so great and admirable, that they bespeak him a more
          perfect and eminent being than can possibly be beheld under a bodily
          shape. Can a corporeal substance put “wisdom in the inward parts, and
          give understanding to the heart?”352
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If God were not a pure Spirit, he could not be one. If God had a
          body, consisting of distinct members, as ours; or all of one nature,
          as the water and air are, yet he were then capable of division, and
          therefore could not be entirely one. Either those parts would be
          finite or infinite: if finite, they are not parts of God; for to be
          God and finite is a contradiction; if infinite, then there are as many
          infinite as distinct members, and therefore as many Deities. Suppose
          this body had all parts of the same nature, as air and water hath,
          every little part of air is as much air as the greatest, and every
          little part of water is as much water as the ocean; so every little
          part of God would be as much God as the whole; as many particular
          Deities to make up God, as little atoms to compose a body. What can be
          more absurd? If God had a body like a human body, and were compounded
          of body and soul, of substance and quality, he could not be the most
          perfect unity; he would be made up of distinct parts, and those of a
          distinct nature, as the members of a human body are. Where there is
          the greatest unity, there must be the greatest simplicity; but God is
          one. As he is free from any change, so he is void of any multitude
          (Deut. vi. 4): “The Lord our God is one Lord.”
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If God had a body as we have, he would not be invisible. Every
          material thing is not visible: the air is a body yet invisible, but it
          is sensible; the cooling quality of it is felt by us at every breath,
          and we know it by our touch, which is the most material sense.
          Everybody that hath members like to bodies, is visible; but God is
          invisible.353 The apostle reckons it amongst his other perfections (1
          Tim. i. 17): “Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible.” He is
          invisible to our sense, which beholds nothing but material and colored
          things; and incomprehensible to our understanding, that conceives
          nothing but what is finite. God is therefore a Spirit incapable of
          being seen, and infinitely incapable of being understood. If he be
          invisible, he is also spiritual. If he had a body, and hid it from our
          eyes, he might be said not to be seen, but could not be said to be
          invisible. When we say a thing is visible, we understand that it hath
          such qualities which are the objects of sense, though we may never see
          that which is in its own nature to be seen. God hath no such qualities
          as fall under the perception of our sense. His works are visible to
          us, but not his Godhead.354 The nature of a human body is to be seen
          and handled; Christ gives us such a description of it (Luke xxiv. 39):
          “Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you see
          me have;” but man hath been so far from seeing God, “that it is
          impossible he can see him” (1 Tim. vi. 16). There is such a
          disproportion between an infinite object and a finite sense and
          understanding, that it is utterly impossible either to behold or
          comprehend him. But if God had a body more luminous and glorious than
          that of the sun, he would be as well visible to us as the sun, though
          the immensity of that light would dazzle our eyes, and forbid any
          close inspection into him by the virtue of our sense. We have seen the
          shape and figure of the sun, but “no man hath ever seen the shape of
          God.”355 If God had a body, he were visible, though he might not
          perfectly and fully be seen by us;356 as we see the heavens, though we
          see not the extension, latitude, and greatness of them. Though God
          hath manifested himself in a bodily shape (Gen. xviii. 1), and
          elsewhere Jehovah appeared to Abraham, yet the substance of God was
          not seen, no more than the substance of angels was seen in their
          apparitions to men. A body was formed to be made visible by them, and
          such actions done in that body, that spake the person that did them to
          be of a higher eminency than a bare corporeal creature. Sometimes a
          representation is made to the inward sense and imagination, as to
          Micaiah,357 and to Isaiah (vi. 1); but they saw not the essence of
          God, but some images and figures of him proportioned to their sense or
          imagination. The essence of God no man ever saw, nor can see. John i.
          18. Nor doth it follow that God hath a body,358 because Jacob is said
          to “see God face to face” (Gen. xxxii. 30); and Moses had the like
          privilege (Deut. xxxiv. 10). This only signifies a fuller and clearer
          manifestation of God by some representations offered to the bodily
          sense, or rather to the inward spirit. For God tells Moses he could
          not see his face (Exod. xxxiii. 20); and that none ever saw the
          similitude of God (Deut. iv. 15). Were God a corporeal substance, he
          might in some measure be seen by corporeal eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be infinite. All bodies are
          of a finite nature; everybody is material, and every material thing is
          terminated. The sun, a vast body, hath a bounded greatness; the
          heavens, of a mighty bulk, yet have their limits. If God had a body he
          must consist of parts, those parts would be bounded and limited, and
          whatsoever is limited is of a finite virtue, and therefore below an
          infinite nature. Reason therefore tells us, that the most excellent
          nature, as God is, cannot be of a corporeal condition; because of the
          limitation and other actions which belong to every body. God is
          infinite, “for the heaven of heavens cannot contain him” (2 Chron. ii.
          6). The largest heavens, and those imaginary spaces beyond the world,
          are no bounds to him. He hath an essence beyond the bounds of the
          world, and cannot be included in the vastness of the heavens. If God
          be infinite, then he can have no parts in him; if he had, they must be
          finite or infinite: finite parts can never make up an infinite being.
          A vessel of gold, of a pound weight, cannot be made of the quantity of
          an ounce. Infinite parts they cannot be, because then every part would
          be equal to the whole, as infinite as the whole, which is
          contradictory. We see in all things every part is less than the whole
          bulk that is composed of it; as every member of a man is less than the
          whole body of man. If all the parts were finite, then God in his
          essence were finite; and a finite God is not more excellent than a
          creature: so that if God were not a Spirit, he could not be infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be an independent being.
          Whatsoever is compounded of many parts depends either essentially or
          integrally upon those parts; as the essence of a man depends upon the
          conjunction and union of his two main parts, his soul and body; when
          they are separated, the essence of a man ceaseth: and the perfection
          of a man depends upon every member of the body; so that if one be
          wanting the perfection of the whole is wanting: as if a man hath lost
          a limb, you call him not a perfect man, because that part is gone upon
          which his perfection as an entire man did depend. If God therefore had
          a body, the perfection of the Deity would depend upon every part of
          that body; and the more parts he were compounded of, the more his
          dependency would be multiplied according to the number of those parts
          of the body: for that which is compounded of many parts is more
          dependent than that which is compounded of fewer. And because God
          would be a dependent being if he had a body, he could not be the first
          being; for the compounding parts are in order of nature before that
          which is compounded by them; as the soul and body are before the man
          which results from the union of them. If God had parts and bodily
          members as we have, or any composition, the essence of God would
          result from those parts, and those parts be supposed to be before God.
          For that which is a part, is before that whose part it is. As in
          artificial things you may conceive it: all the parts of a watch or
          clock are in time before that watch which is made by setting those
          parts together. In natural things you must suppose the members of a
          body framed before you can call it a man; so that the parts of this
          body are before that which is constituted by them. We can conceive no
          other of God, if he were not a pure, entire, unmixed Spirit. If he had
          distinct parts, he would depend upon them; those parts would be before
          him; his essence would be the effect of those distinct parts, and so
          he would not be absolutely and entirely the first being; but he is so
          (Isa. xliv. 6): “I am the first, and I am the last.” He is the first;
          nothing is before him. Whereas, if he had bodily parts, and those
          finite, it would follow, God is made up of those parts which are not
          God; and that which is not God, is in order of nature before that
          which is God. So that we see if God were not a Spirit he could not be
          independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. If God were not a Spirit, he were not immutable and unchangeable.
          His immutability depends upon his simplicity. He is unchangeable in
          his essence, because he is a pure and unmixed spiritual Being.
          Whatsoever is compounded of parts may be divided into those parts, and
          resolved into those distinct parts which make up and constitute the
          nature. Whatsoever is compounded is changeable in its own nature,
          though it should never be changed. Adam, who was constituted of body
          and soul, had he stood in innocence, had not died; there had been no
          separation made between his soul and body whereof he was constituted,
          and his body had not resolved into those principles of dust from
          whence it was extracted. Yet in his own nature he was dissoluble into
          those distinct parts whereof he was compounded; and so the glorified
          saints in heaven, after the resurrection, and the happy meeting of
          their souls and bodies in a new marriage knot, shall never be
          dissolved; yet in their own nature they are mutable and dissoluble,
          and cannot be otherwise, because they are made up of such distinct
          parts that may be separated in their own nature, unless sustained by
          the grace of God: they are immutable by will, the will of God, not by
          nature. God is immutable by nature as well as will: as he hath a
          necessary existence, so he hath a necessary unchangeableness (Mal.
          iii. 6), “I, the Lord, change not.” He is as unchangeable in his
          essence as in his veracity and faithfulness: they are perfections
          belonging to his nature. But if he were not a pure Spirit, he could
          not be immutable by nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. If God were not a pure Spirit, he could not be omnipresent. He is
          in heaven above, and the earth below;359 he fills heaven and earth.360
          The divine essence is at once in heaven and earth; but it is
          impossible a body can be in two places at one and the same time. Since
          God is everywhere, he must be spiritual. Had he a body, he could not
          penetrate all things; he would be circumscribed in place. He could not
          be everywhere but in parts, not in the whole; one member in one place,
          and another in another; for to be confined to a particular place, is
          the property of a body: but, since he is diffused through the whole
          world, higher than heaven, deeper than hell, longer than the earth,
          broader than the sea,361 he hath not any corporeal matter. If he had a
          body wherewith to fill heaven and earth, there could be no body
          besides his own: it is the nature of bodies to bound one another, and
          hinder the extending of one another. Two bodies cannot be in the same
          place in the same point of earth: one excludes the other; and it will
          follow hence that we are nothing, no substances, mere illusions; there
          could be no place for anybody else.362 If his body were as big as the
          world, as it must be if with that he filled heaven and earth, there
          would not be room for him to move a hand or a foot, or extend a
          finger; for there would be no place remaining for the motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. If God were not a Spirit, he could not be the most perfect being.
          The more perfect anything is in the rank of creatures, the more
          spiritual and simple it is, as gold is the more pure and perfect that
          hath least mixture of other metals. If God were not a Spirit, there
          would be creatures of a more excellent nature than God, as angels and
          souls, which the Scripture call spirits, in opposition to bodies.
          There is more of perfection in the first notion of a spirit than in
          the notion of a body. God cannot be less perfect than his creatures,
          and contribute an excellency of being to them which he wants himself.
          If angels and souls possess such an excellency, and God want that
          excellency, he would be less than his creatures, and the excellency of
          the effect would exceed the excellency of the cause. But every
          creature, even the highest creature, is infinitely short of the
          perfection of God; for whatsoever excellency they have is finite and
          limited; it is but a spark from the sun—a drop from the ocean; but God
          is unboundedly perfect, in the highest manner, without any limitation;
          and therefore above spirits, angels, the highest creatures that were
          made by him: an infinite sublimity, a pure act, to which nothing can
          be added, from which nothing can be taken. “In him there is light and
          no darkness,”363 spirituality without any matter, perfection without
          any shadow or taint of imperfection. Light pierceth into all things,
          preserves its own purity, and admits of no mixture of anything else
          with it.

          Question. It may be said, If God be a Spirit, and it is impossible he
          can be otherwise than a Spirit, how comes God so often to have such
          members as we have in our bodies ascribed to him, not only a soul, but
          particular bodily parts, as heart, arms, hands, eyes, ears, face, and
          back parts? And how is it that he is never called a Spirit in plain
          words, but in this text by our Saviour?
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer. It is true, many parts of the body, and natural affections of
          the human nature, are reported of God in Scripture. Head,364 eyes, and
          eye‑lids,365 apple of the eye, mouth, &amp;c.; our affections also,
          grief, joy, anger, &amp;c. But it is to be considered,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. That this is in condescension to our weakness. God being desirous
          to make himself known to man, whom he created for his glory, humbles,
          as it were, his own nature to such representations as may suit and
          assist the capacity of the creature; since by the condition of our
          nature nothing erects a notion of itself in our understanding, but as
          it is conducted in by our sense.366 God hath served himself of those
          things which are most exposed to our sense, most obvious to our
          understandings, to give us some acquaintance with his own nature, and
          those things which otherwise we were not capable of having any notion
          of. As our souls are linked with our bodies, so our knowledge is
          linked with our sense; that we can scarce imagine anything, at first,
          but under a corporeal form and figure, till we come, by great
          attention to the object, to make, by the help of reason, a separation
          of the spiritual substance from the corporeal fancy, and consider it
          in its own nature. We are not able to conceive a spirit, without some
          kind of resemblance to something below it, nor understand the actions
          of a spirit, without considering the operations of a human body in its
          several members. As the glories of another life are signified to us by
          the pleasures of this; so the nature of God, by a gracious
          condescension to our capacities, is signified to us by a likeness to
          our own. The more familiar the things are to us which God uses to this
          purpose, the more proper they are to teach us what he intends by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. All such representations are to signify the acts of God, as they
          bear some likeness to those which we perform by those members he
          ascribes to himself. So that those members ascribed to him rather note
          his visible operations to us, than his invisible nature; and signify
          that God doth some works like to those which men do by the assistance
          of those organs of their bodies. So the wisdom of God is called his
          eye, because he knows that with his mind which we see with our
          eyes.367 The efficiency of God is called his hand and arm; because as
          we act with our hands, so doth God with his power. The divine
          efficacies are signified:—by his eyes and ears, we understand his
          omniscience; by his face, the manifestation of his favor; by his
          mouth, the revelation of his will; by his nostrils, the acceptation of
          our prayers; by his bowels, the tenderness of his compassion; by his
          heart, the sincerity of his affections; by his hand, the strength of
          his power; by his feet, the ubiquity of his presence. And in this, he
          intends instruction and comfort: by his eyes, he signifies his
          watchfulness over us; by his ears, his readiness to hear the cries of
          the oppressed;368 by his arm, his power—an arm to destroy his enemies,
          and an arm to relieve his people.369 All those are attributed to God
          to signify divine actions, which he doth without bodily organs as we
          do with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Consider also, that only those members which are the instruments of
          the noblest actions, and under that consideration, are used by him to
          represent a notion of him to our minds. Whatsoever is perfect and
          excellent is ascribed to him, but nothing that savors of
          imperfection.370 The heart is ascribed to him, it being the principle
          of vital actions, to signify the life that he hath in himself;
          watchful and discerning eyes, not sleepy and lazy ones; a mouth to
          reveal his will, not to take in food. To eat and sleep are never
          ascribed to him, nor those parts that belong to the preparing or
          transmitting nourishment to the several parts of the body, as stomach,
          liver, reins, nor bowels under that consideration, but as they are
          significant of compassion; but only those parts are ascribed to him
          whereby we acquire knowledge, as eyes and ears, the organs of learning
          and wisdom; or to communicate it to others, as the mouth, lips,
          tongue, as they are instruments of speaking, not of tasting; or those
          parts which signify strength and power, or whereby we perform the
          actions of charity for the relief of others; taste and touch, senses
          that extend no farther than to corporeal things, and are the grossest
          of all the senses, are never ascribed to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It were worth consideration, “whether this describing God by the
          members of a human body were so much figuratively to be understood, as
          with respect to the incarnation of our Saviour, who was to assume the
          human nature, and all the members of a human body?”371 Asaph, speaking
          in the person of God (Psalm lxxviii. 1), “I will open my mouth in
          parables;” in regard of God it is to be understood figuratively, but
          in regard of Christ literally, to whom it is applied (Matt. xiii. 34,
          35); and that apparition (Isa. vi.) which was the appearance of
          Jehovah, is applied to Christ (John xii. 40, 41). After the report of
          the creation, and the forming of man, we read of God’s speaking to
          him, but not of God’s appearing to him in any visible shape.372 A
          voice might be formed in the air to give man notice of his duty; some
          way of information he must have what positive laws he was to observe,
          besides that law which was engraven in his nature, which we call the
          law of nature; and without a voice the knowledge of the divine will
          could not be so conveniently communicated to man. Though God was heard
          in a voice, he was not seen in a shape; but after the fall we several
          times read of his appearing in such a form; though we read of his
          speaking before man’s committing of sin, yet not of his walking, which
          is more corporeal, till afterwards.373 “Though God would not have man
          believe him to be corporeal, yet he judged it expedient to give some
          pre‑notices of that divine incarnation which he had promised.”374
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Therefore, we must not conceive of the visible Deity according to
          the letter of such expressions, but the true intent of them. Though
          the Scripture speaks of his eyes and arm, yet it denies them to be
          “arms of flesh.”375 We must not conceive of God according to the
          letter, but the design of the metaphor. When we hear things described
          by metaphorical expressions, for the clearing them up to our fancy, we
          conceive not of them under that garb, but remove the veil by an act of
          our reason. When Christ is called a sun, a vine, bread, is any so
          stupid as to conceive him to be a vine with material branches, and
          clusters, or be of the same nature with a loaf? But the things
          designed by such metaphors are obvious to the conception of a mean
          understanding. If we would conceive God to have a body like a man,
          because he describes himself so, we may conceit him to be like a bird,
          because he is mentioned with wings;376 or like a lion, or leopard,
          because he likens himself to them in the acts of his strength and
          fury.377 He is called a rock, a horn, fire, to note his strength and
          wrath; if any be so stupid as to think God to be really such, they
          would make him not only a man but worse than a monster. Onkelos, the
          Chaldee paraphrast upon parts of the Scripture, was so tender of
          expressing the notion of any corporeity in God, that when he meets
          with any expressions of that nature, he translates them according to
          the true intent of them; as when God is said to descend (Gen. xi. 5),
          which implies a local motion, a motion from one place to another, he
          translates it, “And God revealed himself.”378 We should conceive of
          God according to the design of the expressions; when we read of his
          eyes, we should conceive his omniscience; of his hand, his power; of
          his sitting, his immutability; of his throne, his majesty; and
          conceive of him as surmounting, not only the grossness of bodies, but
          the spiritual excellency of the most dignified creatures; something so
          perfect, great, spiritual, as nothing can be conceived higher and
          purer. “Christ,” saith one, “is truly Deus figuratus; and for his
          sake, was it more easily permitted to the Jews to think of God in the
          shape of a man.”379
        </p>
        <p>Use. If God be a pure spiritual being, then</p>
        <p>
          1. Man is not the image of God, according to his external bodily form
          and figure. The image of God in man consisted not in what is seen, but
          in what is not seen; not in the conformation of the members, but
          rather in the spiritual faculties of the soul; or, most of all, in the
          holy endowments of those faculties (Eph. iv. 24): “That ye put on the
          new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
          holiness.”380 The image which is restored by redeeming grace, was the
          image of God by original nature. The image of God cannot be in that
          part which is common to us with beasts, but rather in that wherein we
          excel all living creatures, in reason, understanding, and an immortal
          spirit. God expressly saith, that none “saw a similitude” of him
          (Deut. iv. 15, 16); which had not been true, if man, in regard of his
          body, had been the image and similitude of God, for then a figure of
          God had been seen every day, as often as we saw a man or beheld
          ourselves. Nor would the apostle’s argument stand good (Acts xvii.
          29), “That the Godhead is not like to stone graven by art,” if we were
          not the offspring of God, and bore the stamp of his nature in our
          spirits rather than our bodies.381 It was a fancy of Eugubinus, that
          when God set upon the actual creation of man, he took a bodily form
          for an exemplar of that which he would express in his work, and
          therefore that the words of Moses382 are to be understood of the body
          of man; because there was in man such a shape which God had then
          assumed. To let alone God’s forming himself a body for that work as a
          groundless fancy, man can in no wise be said to be the image of God,
          in regard of the substance of his body; but beasts may as well be said
          to be made in the image of God, whose bodies have the same members as
          the body of man for the most part, and excel men in the acuteness of
          the senses and swiftness of their motion, agility of body, greatness
          of strength, and in some kind of ingenuities also, wherein man hath
          been a scholar to the brutes, and beholden to their skill. The soul
          comes nearest the nature of God, as being a spiritual substance; yet
          considered singly, in regard of its spiritual substance, cannot well
          be said to be the image of God; a beast, because of its corporeity,
          may as well be called the image of a man, for there is a greater
          similitude between man and a brute, in the rank of bodies, than there
          can be between God and the highest angels in the rank of spirits. If
          it doth not consist in the substance of the soul, much less can it in
          any similitude of the body. This image consisted partly in the state
          of man, as he had dominion over the creatures; partly in the nature of
          man, as he was an intelligent being, and thereby was capable of having
          a grant of that dominion; but principally in the conformity of the
          soul with God, in the frame of his spirit, and the holiness of his
          actions; not at all in the figure and form of his body, physically,
          though morally there might be, as there was a rectitude in the body as
          an instrument to conform to the holy motions of the soul, as the
          holiness of the soul sparkled in the actions and members of the body.
          If man were like God because he hath a body, whatsoever hath a body
          hath some resemblance to God, and may be said to be in part his image;
          but the truth is, the essence of all creatures cannot be an image of
          the immense essence of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If God be a pure Spirit, “it is unreasonable to frame any image or
          picture of God.”383 Some heathens have been wiser in this than some
          Christians; Pythagoras forbade his scholars to engrave any shape of
          him upon a ring, because he was not to be comprehended by sense, but
          conceived only in our minds: our hands are as unable to fashion him,
          as our eyes to see him.384 The ancient Romans worshipped their gods
          one hundred and seventy years before any material representations of
          them;385 and the ancient idolatrous Germans thought it a wicked thing
          to represent God in a human shape; yet some, and those no Romanists,
          labor to defend the making images of God in the resemblance of man,
          because he is so represented in Scripture: “He may be,” saith one,386
          “conceived so in our minds, and figured so to our sense.” If this were
          a good reason, why may he not be pictured as a lion, horn, eagle,
          rock, since he is under such metaphors shadowed to us? The same ground
          there is for the one as for the other. What though man be a nobler
          creature, God hath no more the body of a man than that of an eagle;
          and some perfections in other creatures represent some excellencies in
          his nature and actions which cannot be figured by a human shape, as
          strength by the lion, swiftness and readiness by the wings of the
          bird. But God hath absolutely prohibited the making “any image”
          whatsoever of him, and that with terrible threatenings (Exod. xx. 5):
          “I, the Lord, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers
          upon their children,” and Deut. v. 8, 9. After God had given the
          Israelites the commandment wherein he forbade them to have any other
          gods before him, be forbids all figuring of him by the hand of man;387
          not only images, but any likeness of him, either by things in heaven,
          in the earth, or in the water. How often doth he discover his
          indignation by the prophets, against them that offer to mould him in a
          creature form! This law was not to serve a particular dispensation, or
          to endure a particular time, but it was a declaration of his will,
          invariable in all places and all times; being founded upon the
          immutable nature of his being, and therefore agreeable to the law of
          nature, otherwise not chargeable upon the heathens; and therefore when
          God had declared his nature and his works in a stately and majestic
          eloquence, he demands of them, “To whom they would liken him, or what
          likeness they would compare unto him?” (Isa. xl. 18); where they could
          find anything that would be a lively image and resemblance of his
          infinite excellency? founding it upon the infiniteness of his nature,
          which necessarily implies the spirituality of it, God is infinitely
          above any statue: and those that think to draw God by a stroke of a
          pencil, or form him by the engravings of art, are more stupid than the
          statues themselves. To show the unreasonableness of it, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is impossible to fashion any image of God. If our more capacious
          souls cannot grasp his nature, our weaker sense cannot frame his
          image; it is more possible, of the two, to comprehend him in our
          minds, than to frame him in an image to our sense. He inhabits
          inaccessible light; as it is impossible for the eye of man to see him,
          it is impossible for the art of man to paint him upon walls, and carve
          him out of wood. None knows him but himself, none can describe him but
          himself.388 Can we draw a figure of our own souls, and express that
          part of ourselves, wherein we are most like to God? Can we extend this
          to any bodily figure, and divide it into parts? How can we deal so
          with the original copy, whence the first draught of our souls was
          taken, and which is infinitely more spiritual than men or angels? No
          corporeal thing can represent a spiritual substance; there is no
          proportion in nature between them. God is a simple, infinite, immense,
          eternal, invisible, incorruptible being; a statue is a compounded,
          finite, limited, temporal, visible, and corruptible body. God is a
          living spirit; but a statue nor sees, nor hears, nor perceives
          anything. But suppose God had a body, it is impossible to mould an
          image of it in the true glory of that body; can the statue of an
          excellent monarch represent the majesty and air of his countenance,
          though made by the skilfullest workman in the world? If God had a body
          in some measure suited to his excellency, were it possible for man to
          make an exact image of him, who cannot picture the light, heat,
          motion, magnitude, and dazzling property of the sun? The excellency of
          any corporeal nature of the least creature, the temper, instinct,
          artifice, are beyond the power of a carving tool; much more is God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To make any corporeal representations of God is unworthy of God. It
          is a disgrace to his nature. Whosoever thinks a carnal corruptible
          image to be fit for a representation of God, renders God no better
          than a carnal and a corporeal being. It is a kind of debasing an
          angel, who is a spiritual nature, to represent him in a bodily shape,
          who is as far removed from any fleshliness as heaven from earth; much
          more to degrade the glory of the divine nature to the lineaments of a
          man. The whole stock of images is but a lie of God (Jer. x. 8, 14); a
          doctrine of vanities and falsehood; it represents him in a false garb
          to the world, and sinks his glory into that of a corruptible
          creature.389 It impairs the reverence of God in the minds of men, and
          by degrees may debase men’s apprehensions of God, and be a means to
          make them believe he is such a one as themselves; and that not being
          free from the figure, he is not also free from the imperfections of
          the bodies.390 Corporeal images of God were the fruits of base
          imaginations of him; and as they sprung from them, so they contribute
          to a greater corruption of the notions of the divine nature: the
          heathens begun their first representations of him by the image of a
          corruptible man, then of birds, till they descended not only to
          four‑footed beasts but creeping things, even serpents, as the apostle
          seems to intimate in his enumeration (Rom. i. 23): it had been more
          honorable to have continued in human representations of him, than have
          sunk so low as beasts and serpents, the baser images; though the first
          had been infinitely unworthy of him, he being more above a man, though
          the noblest creature, than man is above a worm, a toad, or the most
          despicable creeping thing upon the earth. To think we can make an
          image of God of a piece of marble, or an ingot of gold, is a greater
          debasing of him, than it would be of a great prince, if you should
          represent him in the statue of a frog. When the Israelites represented
          God by a calf, it is said “they sinned a great sin” (Exod. xxxii. 31):
          and the sin of Jeroboam, who intended only a representation of God by
          the calves at Dan and Bethel, is called more emphatically,391 “the
          wickedness of your wickedness,” the very scum and dregs of wickedness.
          As men debased God by this, so God debased men for this; he degraded
          the Israelites into captivity, under the worst of their enemies, and
          punished the heathens with spiritual judgments, as uncleanness through
          the lusts of their own hearts (Rom. i. 24); which is repeated again in
          other expressions (ver. 26, 27), as a meet recompense for their
          disgracing the spiritual nature of God. Had God been like to man, they
          had not offended in it; but I mention this, to show a probable reason
          of those base lusts which are in the midst of us, that have scarce
          been exceeded by any nation, viz., the unworthy and unspiritual
          conceits of God, which are as much a debasing of him as material
          images were when they were more rife in the world; and may be as well
          the cause of spiritual judgments upon men, as the worshipping molten
          and carved images were the cause of the same upon the heathen.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Yet this is natural to man. Wherein we may see the contrariety of
          man to God. Though God be a Spirit, yet there is nothing man is more
          prone to, than to represent him under a corporeal form. The most
          famous guides of the heathen world have fashioned him, not only
          according to the more honorable images of men, but bestialized him in
          the form of a brute. The Egyptians, whose country was the school of
          learning to Greece, were notoriously guilty of this brutishness in
          worshipping an ox for an image of their God; and the Philistines their
          Dagon, in a figure composed of the image of a woman and a fish:392
          such representations were ancient in the oriental parts. The gods of
          Laban, that he accuseth Jacob of stealing from him, are supposed to be
          little figures of men.393 Such was the Israelites’ golden calf; their
          worship was not terminated on the image, but they worshipped the true
          God under that representation; they could not be so brutish as to call
          a calf their deliverer, and give him so great a title (“These be thy
          gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,” Exod.
          xxxii. 4): or that which they knew belonged to the true God, “the God
          of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”394 They knew the calf to be formed of
          their ear‑rings, but they had consecrated it to God as a
          representation of him; though they chose the form of the Egyptian
          idol, yet they knew that Apis, Osiris, and Isis, the gods of the
          Egyptians adored in that figure, had not wrought their redemption from
          bondage, but would have used their force, had they been possessed of
          any, to have kept them under the yoke, rather than have freed them
          from it; the feast also which they celebrated before that image, is
          called by Aaron the feast of the Lord (Exod. xxxii. 5); a feast to
          Jehovah, the incommunicable name of the creator of the world; it is
          therefore evident, that both the priest and the people pretended to
          serve the true God, not any false divinity of Egypt; that God who had
          rescued them from Egypt, with a mighty hand, divided the Red Sea
          before them, destroyed their enemies, conducted them, fed them by
          miracle, spoken to them from Mount Sinai, and amazed them by his
          thunderings and lightnings when he instructed them by his law; a God
          whom they could not so soon forget. And with this representing God by
          that image, they are charged by the Psalmist (Psalm cvi. 19, 20),
          “they made a calf in Horeb, and changed their glory into a similitude
          of an ox that eateth grass:” they changed their glory, that is, God,
          the glory of Israel; so that they took this figure for the image of
          the true God of Israel, their own God; not the God of any other nation
          in the world. Jeroboam intended no other by his calves, but symbols of
          the presence of the true God; instead of the ark and the propitiatory
          which remained among the Jews. We see the inclination of our natures
          in the practice of the Israelites; a people chosen out of the whole
          world to bear up God’s name, and preserve his glory; and in that the
          images of God were so soon set up in the Christian church; and to this
          day, the picture of God, in the shape of an old man, is visible in the
          temple of the Romanists. It is prone to the nature of man,
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To represent God by a corporeal image; and to worship him in and by
          that image, is idolatry. Though the Israelites did not acknowledge the
          calf to be God, nor intended a worship to any of the Egyptian deities
          by it; but worshipped that God in it, who had so lately and
          miraculously delivered them from a cruel servitude; and could not in
          natural reason judge him to be clothed with a bodily shape, much less
          to be like an ox that eateth grass; yet the apostle brings no less a
          charge against them than that of idolatry (1 Cor. x. 7); he calls them
          idolaters, who before that calf kept a feast to Jehovah, citing Exod.
          xxxii. 5. Suppose we could make such an image of God as might
          perfectly represent him; yet since God hath prohibited it, shall we be
          wiser than God? He hath sufficiently manifested himself in his works
          without images: He is seen in the creatures, more particularly in the
          heavens, which declare his glory. His works are more excellent
          representations of him, as being the works of his own hands, than
          anything that is the product of the art of man. His glory sparkles in
          the heavens, sun, moon, and stars, as being magnificent pieces of his
          wisdom and power; yet the kissing the hand to the sun or the heavens,
          as representatives of the excellency and majesty of God, is idolatry
          in Scripture account, and a denial of God;395 a prostituting the glory
          of God to a creature. Either the worship is terminated on the image
          itself, and then it is confessed by all to be idolatry, because it is
          a giving that worship to a creature which is the sole right of God, or
          not terminated in the image, but in the object represented by it; it
          is then a foolish thing; we may as well terminate our worship on the
          true object without, as with an image.396 An erected statue is no sign
          or symbol of God’s special presence, as the ark, tabernacle, temple
          were. It is no part of divine institution; has no authority of a
          command to support it; no cordial of a promise to encourage it; and
          the image being infinitely distant from, and below the majesty and
          spirituality of God, cannot constitute one object of worship with him.
          To put a religious character upon any image formed by the corrupt
          imagination of man, as a representation of the invisible and spiritual
          Deity, is to think the Godhead to be like silver and gold, or stone
          graven by art and man’s device.397
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This doctrine will direct us in our conceptions of God, as a pure
          perfect Spirit, than which nothing can be imagined more perfect, more
          pure, more spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We cannot have an adequate or suitable conception of God: He dwells
          in inaccessible light; inaccessible to the acuteness of our fancy, as
          well as the weakness of our sense. If we could have thoughts of him,
          as high and excellent as his nature, our conceptions must be as
          infinite as his nature. All our imaginations of him cannot represent
          him, because every created species is finite; it cannot therefore
          represent to us a full and substantial notion of an infinite Being. We
          cannot speak or think worthily enough of him, who is greater than our
          words, vaster than our understandings. Whatsoever we speak or think of
          God, is handed first to us by the notice we have of some perfection in
          the creature, and explains to us some particular excellency of God,
          rather than the fulness of his essence. No creature, nor all creatures
          together, can furnish us with such a magnificent notion of God, as can
          give us a clear view of him. Yet God in his word is pleased to step
          below his own excellency, and point us to those excellencies in his
          works, whereby we may ascend to the knowledge of those excellencies
          which are in his nature. But the creatures, whence we draw our
          lessons, being finite, and our understandings being finite, it is
          utterly impossible to have a notion of God commensurate to the
          immensity and spirituality of his being. “God is not like to visible
          creatures, nor is there any proportion between him and the most
          spiritual.”398 We cannot have a full notion of a spiritual nature,
          much less can we have of God, who is a Spirit above spirits. No spirit
          can clearly represent him: the angels, that are great spirits, are
          bounded in their extent, finite in their being, and of a mutable
          nature. Yet though we cannot have a suitable conception of God, we
          must not content ourselves without any conception of him. It is our
          sin not to endeavor after a true notion of him: it is our sin to rest
          in a mean and low notion of him, when our reason tells us we are
          capable of having higher: but if we ascend as high as we can, though
          we shall then come short of a suitable notion of him, this is not our
          sin, but our weakness. God is infinitely superior to the choicest
          conceptions, not only of a sinner, but of a creature. If all
          conceptions of God below the true nature of God were sin, there is not
          a holy angel in heaven free from sin; because, though they are the
          most capacious creatures, yet they cannot have such a notion of an
          infinite Being as is fully suitable to his nature, unless they were
          infinite as he himself is.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But, however, we must by no means conceive of God under a human or
          corporeal shape. Since we cannot have conceptions honorable enough for
          his nature, we must take heed we entertain not any which may debase
          his nature; though we cannot comprehend him as he is, we must be
          careful not to fancy him to be what he is not. It is a vain thing to
          conceive him with human lineaments: we must think higher of him than
          to ascribe to him so mean a shape: we deny his spirituality when we
          fancy him under such a form. He is spiritual, and between that which
          is spiritual and that which is corporeal, there is no resemblance.399
          Indeed, Daniel saw God in a human form (Dan. vii. 9): “The Ancient of
          days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hairs of his
          head like pure wool:” he is described as coming to judgment; it is not
          meant of Christ probably, because Christ (ver. 13) is called the Son
          of Man coming near to the Ancient of days. This is not the proper
          shape of God, for no man hath seen his shape. It was a vision wherein
          such representations were made, as were accommodated to the inward
          sense of Daniel; Daniel saw him in a rapture or ecstacy, wherein
          outward senses are of no use. God is described, not as he is in
          himself, of a human form, but in regard of his fitness to judge:
          “white,” notes the purity and simplicity of the Divine nature;
          “Ancient of days,” in regard of his eternity; “white hair,” in regard
          of his prudence and wisdom, which is more eminent in age than youth,
          and more fit to discern causes and to distinguish between right and
          wrong. Visions are riddles, and must not be understood in a literal
          sense. We are to watch against such determinate conceptions of God.
          Vain imaginations do easily infest us; tinder will not sooner take
          fire than our natures kindle into wrong notions of the Divine Majesty.
          We are very apt to fashion a god like ourselves; we must therefore
          look upon such representations of God, as accommodated to our
          weakness: and no more think them to be literal descriptions of God, as
          he is in himself, than we will think the image of the sun in the
          water, to be the true sun in the heavens. We may, indeed, conceive of
          Christ as man, who hath in heaven the vestment of our nature, and is
          Deus figuratus, though we cannot conceive the godhead under a human
          shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To have such a fancy is to disparage and wrong God. A corporeal
          fancy of God is as ridiculous in itself, and as injurious to God, as a
          wooden statue. The caprices of our imagination are often more
          mysterious than the images which are the works of art; it is as
          irreligious to measure God’s essence by our line, his perfections by
          our imperfections, as to measure his thoughts and actings by the
          weakness and unworthiness of our own. This is to limit an infinite
          essence, and pull him down to our scanty measures, and render that
          which is unconceivably above us, equal with us. It is impossible we
          can conceive God after the manner of a body, but we must bring him
          down to the proportion of a body, which is to diminish his glory, and
          stoop him below the dignity of his nature. God is a pure Spirit, he
          hath nothing of the nature and tincture of a body; whosoever,
          therefore, conceives of him as having a bodily form, though he fancy
          the most beautiful and comely body, instead of owning his dignity,
          detracts from the super‑eminent excellency of his nature and
          blessedness. When men fancy God like themselves in their corporeal
          nature, they will soon make a progress, and ascribe to him their
          corrupt nature; and while they clothe him with their bodies, invest
          him also in the infirmities of them. God is a jealous God, very
          sensible of any disgrace, and will be as much incensed against an
          inward idolatry as an outward: that command which forbade corporeal
          images,400 would not indulge carnal imaginations; since the nature of
          God is as much wronged by unworthy images, erected in the fancy, as by
          statues carved out of stone or metals: one as well as the other is a
          deserting of our true spouse, and committing adultery; one with a
          material image, and the other with a carnal notion of God. Since God
          humbles himself to our apprehensions, we should not debase him in
          thinking him to be that in his nature, which he makes only a
          resemblance of himself to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To have such fancies of God, will obstruct and pollute our worship
          of him. How is it possible to give him a right worship, of whom we
          have so debasing a notion? We shall never think a corporeal deity
          worthy of a dedication of our spirits. The hating instruction, and
          casting God’s word behind the back, is charged upon the imagination
          they had, that “God was such a one as themselves” (Psalm l. 17, 21).
          Many of the wiser heathens did not judge their statues to be their
          gods, or their gods to be like their statues; but suited them to their
          politic designs; and judged them a good invention to keep people
          within the bounds of obedience and devotion, by such visible figures
          of them, which might imprint a reverence and fear of those gods upon
          them; but these are false measures; a despised and undervalued God is
          not an object of petition or affection. Who would address seriously to
          a God he has low apprehensions of? The more raised thoughts we have of
          him, the viler sense we shall have of ourselves; they would make us
          humble and self‑abhorrent in our supplications to him (Job xlii. 6):
          “wherefore I abhor myself,” &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Though we must not conceive of God, as of a human or corporeal
          shape; yet we cannot think of God, without some reflection upon our
          own being. We cannot conceive him to be an intelligent being, but we
          must make some comparison between him and our own understanding nature
          to come to a knowledge of him. Since we are enclosed in bodies, we
          apprehend nothing but what comes in by sense, and what we in some sort
          measure by sensible objects. And in the consideration of those things
          which we desire to abstract from sense, we are fain to make use of the
          assistance of sense and visible things: and therefore when we frame
          the highest notion, there will be some similitude of some corporeal
          thing in our fancy; and though we would spiritualize our thoughts, and
          aim at a more abstracted and raised understanding, yet there will be
          some dregs of matter sticking to our conceptions; yet we still judge
          by argument and reasoning, what the thing is we think of under those
          material images. A corporeal image will follow us, as the shadow doth
          the body.401 While we are in the body, and surrounded with fleshly
          matter, we cannot think of things without some help from corporeal
          representations: something of sense will interpose itself in our
          purest conceptions of spiritual things;402 for the faculties which
          serve for contemplation, are either corporeal, as the sense and fancy,
          or so allied to them, that nothing passes into them but by the organs
          of the body; so that there is a natural inclination to figure nothing
          but under a corporeal notion, till by an attentive application of the
          mind and reason to the object thought upon, we separate that which is
          bodily from that which is spiritual, and by degrees ascend to that
          true notion of that we think upon, and would have a due conception of
          in our mind. Therefore God tempers the declaration of himself to our
          weakness, and the condition of our natures. He condescends to our
          littleness and narrowness, when he declares himself by the similitude
          of bodily members. As the light of the sun is tempered, and diffuseth
          itself to our sense through the air and vapors, that our weak eyes may
          not be too much dazzled with it; without it we could not know or judge
          of the sun, because we could have no use of our sense, which we must
          have before we can judge of it in our understanding; so we are not
          able to conceive of spiritual beings in the purity of their own
          nature, without such a temperament, and such shadows to usher them
          into our minds. And therefore we find the Spirit of God accommodates
          himself to our contracted and teddered capacities, and uses such
          expressions of God as are suited to us in this state of flesh wherein
          we are. And therefore because we cannot apprehend God in the
          simplicity of his own being, and his undivided essence, he draws the
          representations of himself from several creatures and several actions
          of those creatures: as sometimes he is said to be angry, to walk, to
          sit, to fly; not that we should rest in such conceptions of him, but
          take our rise from this foundation, and such perfections in the
          creatures, to mount up to a knowledge of God’s nature by those several
          steps, and conceive of him by those divided excellencies, because we
          cannot conceive of him in the purity of his own essence. We cannot
          possibly think or speak of God, unless we transfer the names of
          created perfections to him;403 yet we are to conceive of them in a
          higher manner when we apply them to the Divine nature, than when we
          consider them in the several creatures formally, exceeding those
          perfections and excellencies which are in the creature, and in a more
          excellent manner: “as one saith, though we cannot comprehend God
          without the help of such resemblances, yet we may, without making an
          image of him; so that inability of ours excuseth those apprehensions
          of him from any way offending against his Divine nature.”404 These are
          not notions so much suited to the nature of God as the weakness of
          man. They are helps to our meditations, but ought not to be formal
          conceptions of him. We may assist ourselves in our apprehensions of
          him, by considering the subtilty and spirituality of air; and
          considering the members of a body, without thinking him to be air, or
          to have any corporeal member. Our reason tells us, that whatsoever is
          a body, is limited and bounded; and the notion of infiniteness and
          bodiliness, cannot agree and consist together: and therefore what is
          offered by our fancy should be purified by our reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Therefore we are to elevate and refine all our notions of God, and
          spiritualize our conceptions of him. Every man is to have a conception
          of God; therefore he ought to have one of the highest elevation. Since
          we cannot have a full notion of him, we should endeavor to make it as
          high and as pure as we can. Though we cannot conceive of God, but some
          corporeal representations or images in our minds will be conversant
          with us, as motes in the air when we look upon the heavens, yet our
          conceptions may and must rise higher. As when we see the draught of
          the heavens and earth in a globe, or a kingdom in a map, it helps our
          conceptions, but doth not terminate them: we conceive them to be of a
          vast extent, far beyond that short description of them. So we should
          endeavor to refine every representation of God, to rise higher and
          higher, and have our apprehensions still more purified; separating the
          perfect from the imperfect, casting away the one, and greatening the
          other; conceive him to be a Spirit diffused through all, containing
          all, perceiving all. All the perfections of God are infinitely
          elevated above the excellencies of the creatures; above whatsoever can
          be conceived by the clearest and most piercing understanding. The
          nature of God as a Spirit is infinitely superior to whatsoever we can
          conceive perfect in the notion of a created spirit. Whatsoever God is,
          he is infinitely so: he is infinite Wisdom, infinite Goodness,
          infinite Knowledge, infinite Power, infinite Spirit; infinitely
          distant from the weakness of creatures, infinitely mounted above the
          excellencies of creatures: as easy to be known that he is, as
          impossible to be comprehended what he is. Conceive of him as
          excellent, without any imperfection; a Spirit without parts; great
          without quantity; perfect without quality; everywhere without place;
          powerful without members; understanding without ignorance; wise
          without reasoning; light without darkness; infinitely more excelling
          the beauty of all creatures, than the light in the sun, pure and
          unviolated, exceeds the splendor of the sun dispersed and divided
          through a cloudy and misty air: and when you have risen to the
          highest, conceive him yet infinitely above all you can conceive of
          spirit, and acknowledge the infirmity of your own minds. And
          whatsoever conception comes into your minds, say, This is not God; God
          is more than this: if I could conceive him, he were not God; for God
          is incomprehensibly above whatsoever I can say, whatsoever I can think
          and conceive of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 1. If God be a Spirit, no corporeal thing can defile him.
          Some bring an argument against the omnipresence of God, that it is a
          disparagement to the Divine essence to be everywhere, in nasty
          cottages as well as beautiful palaces and garnished temples. What
          place can defile a spirit? Is light, which approaches to the nature of
          spirit, polluted by shining upon a dunghill, or a sunbeam tainted by
          darting upon a quagmire? Doth an angel contract any soil, by stepping
          into a nasty prison to deliver Peter? What can steam from the most
          noisome body to pollute the spiritual nature of God? As he is “of
          purer eyes than to behold iniquity,”405 so he is of a more spiritual
          substance than to contract any physical pollution from the places
          where he doth diffuse himself. Did our Saviour, who had a true body,
          derive any taint from the lepers he touched, the diseases he cured, or
          the devils he expelled? God is a pure Spirit; plungeth himself into no
          filth; is dashed with no spot by being present with all bodies. Bodies
          only receive defilement from bodies.

          Inference 2. If God be a Spirit, he is active and communicative. He is
          not clogged with heavy and sluggish matter, which is cause of dulness
          and inactivity. The more subtle, thin, and approaching nearer the
          nature of a spirit anything is, the more diffusive it is. Air is a
          gliding substance; spreads itself through all regions, pierceth into
          all bodies; it fills the space between heaven and earth; there is
          nothing but partakes of the virtue of it. Light, which is an emblem of
          spirit, insinuates itself into all places, refresheth all things. As
          spirits are fuller, so they are more overflowing, more piercing, more
          operative than bodies. The Egyptian horses were weak things, because
          they were “flesh, and not spirit.”406 The soul being a spirit, conveys
          more to the body than the body can to it. What cannot so great a
          spirit do for us? What cannot so great a spirit work in us? God, being
          a spirit above all spirits, can pierce into the centre of all spirits;
          make his way into the most secret recesses; stamp what he pleases. It
          is no more to him to turn our spirits, than to make a wilderness
          become waters, and speak a chaos into a beautiful frame of heaven and
          earth. He can act our souls with infinite more ease than our souls can
          act our bodies; he can fix in us what motions, frames, inclinations he
          pleases; he can come and settle in our hearts with all his treasures.
          It is an encouragement to confide in him, when we petition him for
          spiritual blessings: as he is a spirit, he is possessed with
          “spiritual blessings.”407 A spirit delights to bestow things suitable
          to its nature, as bodies do to communicate what is agreeable to
          theirs. As he is a Father of spirits, we may go to him for the welfare
          of our spirits; he being a Spirit, is as able to repair our spirits as
          he was to create them. As he is a Spirit, he is indefatigable in
          acting. The members of the body tire and flag; but who ever heard of a
          soul wearied with being active? who ever heard of a weary angel? In
          the purest simplicity, there is the greatest power, the most
          efficacious goodness, the most reaching justice to affect the spirit,
          that can insinuate itself everywhere to punish wickedness without
          weariness, as well as to comfort goodness. God is active, because he
          is spirit; and if we be like to God, the more spiritual we are, the
          more active we shall be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 3. God being a Spirit, is immortal. His being immortal, and
          being invisible, are joined together.408 Spirits are in their nature
          incorruptible; they can only perish by that hand that framed them.
          Every compounded thing is subject to mutation; but God, being a pure
          and simple Spirit, is without corruption, without any shadow of
          change.409 Where there is composition, there is some kind of
          repugnancy of one part against the other; and where there is
          repugnancy, there is a capability of dissolution. God, in regard of
          his infinite spirituality, hath nothing in his own nature contrary to
          it; can have nothing in himself which is not himself. The world
          perishes; friends change and are dissolved; bodies moulder, because
          they are mutable. God is a Spirit in the highest excellency and glory
          of spirits; nothing is beyond him; nothing above him; no contrariety
          within him. This is our comfort, if we devote ourselves to him; this
          God is our God; this Spirit is our Spirit; this is our all, our
          immutable, our incorruptible support; a Spirit that cannot die and
          leave us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 4. If God be a Spirit, we see how we can only converse with
          him by our spirits. Bodies and spirits are not suitable to one
          another: we can only see, know, embrace a spirit with our spirits. He
          judges not of us by our corporeal actions, nor our external devotions
          by our masks and disguises: he fixes his eye upon the frame of the
          heart, bends his ear to the groans of our spirits. He is not pleased
          with outward pomp. He is not a body; therefore the beauty of temples,
          delicacy of sacrifices, fumes of incense, are not grateful to him; by
          those, or any external action, we have no communion with him. A
          spirit, when broken, is his delightful sacrifice;410 we must
          therefore, have our spirits fitted for him, “be renewed in the spirit
          of our minds,”411 that we may be in a posture to live with him, and
          have an intercourse with him. We can never be united to God but in our
          spirits: bodies unite with bodies, spirits with spirits. The more
          spiritual anything is, the more closely doth it unite. Air hath the
          closest union; nothing meets together sooner than that, when the parts
          are divided by the interposition of a body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 5. If God be a Spirit, he can only be the true satisfaction
          of our spirits: spirit can only be filled with spirit: content flows
          from likeness and suitableness. As we have a resemblance to God in
          regard of the spiritual nature of our soul, so we can have no
          satisfaction but in him. Spirit can no more be really satisfied with
          that which is corporeal, than a beast can delight in the company of an
          angel. Corporeal things can no more fill a hungry spirit, than pure
          spirit can feed an hungry body. God, the highest Spirit, can only
          reach out a full content to our spirits. Man is lord of the creation:
          nothing below him can be fit for his converse; nothing above him
          offers itself to his converse but God. We have no correspondence with
          angels. The influence they have upon us, the protection they afford
          us, is secret and undiscerned; but God, the highest Spirit, offers
          himself to us in his Son, in his ordinances, is visible in every
          creature, presents himself to us in every providence; to him we must
          seek; in him we must rest. God had no rest from the creation till he
          had made man; and man can have no rest in the creation till he rests
          in God. God only is our dwelling place;412 our souls should only long
          for him:413 our souls should only wait upon him. The spirit of man
          never riseth to its original glory, till it be carried up on the wings
          of faith and love to its original copy. The face of the soul looks
          most beautiful, when it is turned to the face of God, the Father of
          spirits; when the derived spirit is fixed upon the original Spirit,
          drawing from it life and glory. Spirit is only the receptacle of
          spirit. God, as Spirit, is our principle; we must therefore live upon
          him. God, as Spirit, hath some resemblance to us as his image; we
          must, therefore, only satisfy ourselves in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 6. If God be a Spirit, we should take most care of that
          wherein we are like to God. Spirit is nobler than body; we must,
          therefore, value our spirits above our bodies. The soul, as spirit,
          partakes more of the divine nature, and deserves more of our choicest
          cares. If we have any love to this Spirit, we should have a real
          affection to our own spirits, as bearing a stamp of the spiritual
          Divinity, the chiefest of all the works of God; as it is said of
          behemoth (Job xl. 19). That which is most the image of this immense
          spirit, should be our darling; so David calls his soul (Psalm xxxv.
          17). Shall we take care of that wherein we partake not of God, and not
          delight in the jewel which hath his own signature upon it? God was not
          only the Framer of spirits, and the End of spirits; but the Copy and
          Exemplar of spirits. God partakes of no corporeity; he is pure Spirit.
          But how do we act, as if we were only matter and body! We have but
          little kindness for this great Spirit as well as our own, if we take
          no care of his immediate offspring, since he is not only Spirit, but
          the Father of spirits.414
        </p>
        <p>
          Inference 7. If God be a Spirit, let us take heed of those sins which
          are spiritual. Paul distinguisheth between the filth of the flesh, and
          that of the spirit.415 By the one we defile the body; by the other we
          defile the spirit, which, in regard of its nature, is of kin to the
          Creator. To wrong one who is near of kin to a prince, is worse than to
          injure an inferior subject. When we make our spirits, which are most
          like to God in their nature, and framed according to his image, a
          stage to act vain imaginations, wicked desires, and unclean
          affections, we wrong God in the excellency of his work, and reflect
          upon the nobleness of the pattern; we wrong him in that part where he
          hath stamped the most signal character of his own spiritual nature; we
          defile that whereby we have only converse with him as a Spirit, which
          he hath ordered more immediately to represent him in this nature, than
          all corporeal things in the world can, and make that Spirit with whom
          we desire to be joined unfit for such a knot. God’s spirituality is
          the root of his other perfections. We have already heard he could not
          be infinite, omnipresent, immutable, without it. Spiritual sins are
          the greatest root of bitterness within us. As grace in our spirits
          renders us more like to a spiritual God, so spiritual sins bring us
          into a conformity to a degraded devil.416 Carnal sins change us from
          men to brutes, and spiritual sins divest us of the image of God for
          the image of Satan. We should by no means make our spirits a dunghill,
          which bear upon them the character of the spiritual nature of God, and
          were made for his residence. Let us, therefore, behave ourselves
          towards God in all those ways which the spiritual nature of God
          requires us.
