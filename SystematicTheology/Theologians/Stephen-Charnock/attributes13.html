        <h2>DISCOURSE XIII.</h2>
        <p>ON GOD’S DOMINION.</p>
        <p>
          Psalm ciii. 19.—The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens: and
          his kingdom ruleth over all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalm begins with the praise of God, wherein the penman excites
          his soul to a right and elevated management of so great a duty (ver.
          1): “Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his
          holy name:” and because himself and all men were insufficient to offer
          up a praise to God answerable to the greatness of his benefits, he
          summons in the end of the psalm the angels, and all creatures, to join
          in concert with him. Observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. As man is too shallow a creature to comprehend the excellency of
          God, so he is too dull and scanty a creature to offer up a due praise
          to God, both in regard of the excellency of his nature, and the
          multitude and greatness of his benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We are apt to forget Divine benefits: our souls must therefore be
          often jogged, and roused up. “All that is within me,” every power of
          my rational, and every affection of my sensitive part: all his
          faculties, all his thoughts. Our souls will hang back from God in
          every duty, much more in this, if we lay not a strict charge upon
          them. We are so void of a pure and entire love to God, that we have no
          mind to those duties. Wants will spur us on to prayer, but a pure love
          to God can only spirit us to praise. We are more ready to reach out a
          hand to receive his mercies, than to lift up our hearts to recognize
          them after the receipt. After the Psalmist had summoned his own soul
          to this task, he enumerates the Divine blessings received by him, to
          awaken his soul by a sense of them to so noble a work. He begins at
          the first and foundation mercy to himself, the pardon of his sin and
          justification of his person, the renewing of his sickly and
          languishing nature (ver. 3): “Who forgives all thy iniquities, and
          heals all thy diseases.” His redemption from death, or eternal
          destruction; his expected glorification thereupon, which he speaks of
          with that certainty, as if it were present (ver. 4): “Who redeems thy
          life from destruction, who crowns thee with loving‑kindness and tender
          mercies.” He makes his progress to the mercy manifested to the church
          in the protection of it against, or delivery of it from, oppressions
          (ver. 6): “The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that
          are oppressed.” In the discovery of his will and law, and the glory of
          his merciful name to it (ver. 7, 8): “He made known his ways unto
          Moses, and his acts unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful
          and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy:” which latter
          words may refer also to the free and unmerited spring of the benefits
          he had reckoned up: viz., the mercy of God, which he mentions also
          (ver. 10): “He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us
          according to our iniquities;” and then extols the perfection of Divine
          mercy, in the pardoning of sin (ver. 11, 12); the paternal tenderness
          of God (ver. 13); the eternity of his mercy (ver. 17); but restrains
          it to the proper object (ver. 11, 17), “to them that fear him;” i. e.
          to them that believe in him. Fear being the word commonly used for
          faith in the Old Testament, under the legal dispensation, wherein the
          spirit of bondage was more eminent than the spirit of adoption, and
          their fear more than their confidence. Observe,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. All true blessings grow up from the pardon of sin (ver. 3): “Who
          forgives all thine iniquities.” That is the first blessing, the top
          and crown of all other favors, which draws all other blessings after
          it, and sweetens all other blessings with it. The principal intent of
          Christ was expiation of sin, redemption from iniquity; the purchase of
          other blessings was consequent upon it. Pardon of sin is every
          blessing virtually, and in the root and spring it flows from the favor
          of God, and is such a gift as cannot be tainted with a curse, as
          outward things may.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Where sin is pardoned, the soul is renewed (ver. 3): “Who heals all
          thy diseases.” Where guilt is remitted, the deformity and sickness of
          the soul is cured. Forgiveness is a teeming mercy; it never goes
          single; when we have an interest in Christ, as bearing the
          chastisement of our peace, we receive also a balsam from his blood, to
          heal the wounds we feel in our nature. (Isa. liii. 5): “The
          chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are
          healed.” As there is a guilt in sin, which binds us over to
          punishment, so there is a contagion in sin, which fills us with
          pestilent diseases; when the one is removed, the other is cured. We
          should not know how to love the one without the other. The renewing
          the soul is necessary for a delightful relish of the other blessings
          of God. A condemned malefactor, infected with a leprosy, or any other
          loathsome distemper, if pardoned, could take little comfort in his
          freedom from the gibbet without a cure of his plague.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. God is the sole and sovereign Author of all spiritual blessings:
          “Who forgives all thy iniquities, and heals all thy diseases.” He
          refers all to God, nothing to himself in his own merit and strength.
          All, not the pardon of one sin merited by me, not the cure of one
          disease can I owe to my own power, and the strength of my freewill,
          and the operations of nature. He, and he alone is the Prince of
          pardon, the Physician that restores me, the Redeemer that delivers me;
          it is a sacrilege to divide the praise between God and ourselves. God
          only can knock off our fetters, expel our distempers, and restore a
          deformed soul to its decayed beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Gracious souls will bless God as much for sanctification as for
          justification. The initials of sanctification (and there are no more
          in this life) are worthy of solemn acknowledgment. It is a sign of
          growth in grace when our hymns are made up of acknowledgments of God’s
          sanctifying, as well as pardoning grace. In blessing God for the one,
          we rather show a love to ourselves; in blessing God for the other, we
          cast out a pure beam of love to God: because, by purifying grace, we
          are fitted to the service of our Maker, prepared to every good work
          which is delightful to him; by the other, we are eased in ourselves.
          Pardon fills us with inward peace, but sanctification fills us with an
          activity for God. Nothing is so capable of setting the soul in a
          heavenly tune, as the consideration of God as a pardoner and as a
          healer.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Where sin is pardoned, the punishment is remitted (ver. 3, 4): “Who
          forgives all thy iniquities, and redeems thy life from destruction.” A
          malefactor’s pardon puts an end to his chains, frees him from the
          stench of the dungeon, and fear of the gibbet. Pardon is nothing else
          but the remitting of guilt, and guilt is nothing else but an
          obligation to punishment as a penal debt for sin. A creditor’s tearing
          a bond frees the debtor from payment and rigor.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Growth in grace is always annexed to true sanctification. So that
          “thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (ver. 5). Interpreters trouble
          themselves much about the manner of the eagle’s renewing its youth,
          and regaining its vigor: he speaks best that saith, the Psalmist
          speaks only according to the opinion of the vulgar, and his design was
          not to write a natural history.993 Growth always accompanies grace, as
          well as it doth nature in the body; not that it is without its qualms
          and languishing fits, as children are not, but still their distempers
          make them grow. Grace is not an idle, but an active principle. It is
          not like the Psalmist means it of the strength of the body, or the
          prosperity and stability of his government, but the vigor of his grace
          and comfort, since they are spiritual blessings here that are the
          matter of his song. The healing the disease conduceth to the sprouting
          up and flourishing of the body. It is the nature of grace to go from
          strength to strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. When sin is pardoned, it is perfectly pardoned. “As far as the east
          is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us”
          (ver. 11, 12). The east and west are the greatest distance in the
          world; the terms can never meet together. When sin is pardoned, it is
          never charged again; the guilt of it can no more return, than east can
          become west, or west become east.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Obedience is necessary to an interest in the mercy of God. “The
          mercy of the Lord is to them that fear him, to them that remember his
          commandments, to do them” (ver. 17). Commands are to be remembered in
          order to practice; a vain speculation is not the intent of the
          publication of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Psalmist had enumerated the benefits of God, he reflects
          upon the greatness of God, and considers him on his throne encompassed
          with the angels, the ministers of his providence. “The Lord hath
          prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom rules over all”
          (ver. 19). He brings in this of his dominion just after he had largely
          treated of his mercy. Either,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. To signify, That God is not only to be praised for his mercy, but
          for his majesty, both for the height and extent of his authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. To extol the greatness of his mercy and pity. What I have said now,
          O my soul, of the mercy of God, and his paternal pity, is commended by
          his majesty; his grandeur hinders not his clemency: though his throne
          be high, his bowels are tender. He looks down upon his meanest
          servants from the height of his glory. Since his majesty is infinite,
          his mercy must be as great as his majesty. It must be a greater pity
          lodging in his breast, than what is in any creature, since it is not
          damped by the greatness of his sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To render his mercy more comfortable. The mercy I have spoken of, O
          my soul, is not the mercy of a subject, but of a sovereign. An
          executioner may torture a criminal, and strip him of his life, and a
          vulgar pity cannot relieve him, but the clemency of the prince can
          perfectly pardon him. It is that God who hath none above him to
          control him, none below him to resist him, that hath performed all the
          acts of grace to thee. If God by his supreme authority pardons us, who
          can reverse it? If all the subjects of God in the world should pardon
          us, and God withhold his grant, what will it profit us? Take comfort,
          O my soul, since God from his throne in the highest, and that God who
          rules over every particular of the creation, hath granted and sealed
          thy pardon to thee. What would his grace signify, if he were not a
          monarch, extending his royal empire over everything, and swaying all
          by his sceptre?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To render the Psalmist’s confidence more firm in any pressures.
          Ver. 15, 16. He had considered the misery of man in the shortness of
          his life; his place should know him no more; he should never return to
          his authority, employments, opportunities, that death would take from
          him; but, howsoever, the mercy and majesty of God were the ground of
          his confidence. He draws himself from poring upon any calamities which
          may assault him, to heaven, the place where God orders all things that
          are done on the earth. He is able to protect us from our dangers, and
          to deliver us from our distresses; whatsoever miseries thou mayest lie
          under, O my soul, cast thy eye up to heaven, and see a pitying God in
          a majestic authority: a God who can perform what he hath promised to
          them that fear him, since he hath a throne above the heavens, and
          bears sway over all that envy thy happiness, and would stain thy
          felicity: a God whose authority cannot be curtailed and dismembered by
          any. When the prophet solicits the sounding of the Divine bowels, he
          urgeth him by his dwelling in heaven, the habitation of his holiness
          (Isa. lxiii. 15). His kingdom ruleth over all: there is none therefore
          hath any authority to make him break his covenant, or violate his
          promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. As an incentive to obedience. The Lord is merciful, saith he, to
          them “that remember his commandments to do them” (ver. 17, 18): and
          then brings in the text as an encouragement to observe his precepts.
          He hath a majesty that deserves it from us, and an authority to
          protect us in it. If a king in a small spot of earth is to be obeyed
          by his subjects, how much more is God, who is more majestic than all
          the angels in heaven, and monarchs on earth; who hath a majesty to
          exact our obedience, and a mercy to allure it! We should not set upon
          the performance of any duty, without an eye lifted up to God as a
          great king. It would make us willing to serve him; the more noble the
          person, the more honorable and powerful the prince, the more glorious
          is his service. A view of God upon his throne will make us think his
          service our privilege, his precepts our ornaments, and obedience to
          him the greatest honor and nobility. It will make us weighty and
          serious in our performances: it would stake us down to any duty. The
          reason we are so loose and unmannerly in the carriage of our souls
          before God, is because we consider him not as a “great King” (Mal. i.
          14). “Our Father, which art in heaven,” in regard of his majesty, is
          the preface to prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now consider the words in themselves. “The Lord hath prepared
          his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord hath prepared.—The word signifies “established,” as well as
          “prepared,” and might so be rendered. Due preparation is a natural way
          to the establishment of a thing: hasty resolves break and moulder.
          This notes, 1. The infiniteness of his authority. He prepares it, none
          else for him. It is a dominion that originally resides in his nature,
          not derived from any by birth or commission; he alone prepared it. He
          is the sole cause of his own kingdom; his authority therefore is
          unbounded, as infinite as his nature: none can set laws to him,
          because none but himself prepared his throne for him. As he will not
          impair his own happiness, so he will not abridge himself of his own
          authority. 2. Readiness to exercise it upon due occasions. He hath
          prepared his throne: he is not at a loss; he needs not stay for a
          commission or instructions from any how to act. He hath all things
          ready for the assistance of his people; he hath rewards and
          punishments; his treasures and axes, the great marks of authority
          lying by him, the one for the good, the other for the wicked. His
          “mercy he keeps by him for thousands” (Exod. xxxiv. 7). His “arrows”
          he hath prepared by him for rebels (Ps. vii. 13). 3. Wise management
          of it. It is prepared; preparations imply prudence; the government of
          God is not a rash and heady authority. A prince upon his throne, a
          judge upon the bench, manages things with the greatest discretion, or
          should be supposed so to do. 4. Successfulness and duration of it. He
          hath prepared or established. It is fixed, not tottering; it is an
          immovable dominion; all the strugglings of men and devils cannot
          overturn it, nor so much as shake it. It is established above the
          reach of obstinate rebels; he cannot be deposed from it, he cannot be
          mated in it. His dominion, as himself, abides forever. And as his
          counsel, so his authority, shall stand, and “he will do all his
          pleasure” (Isa. xlvi. 10).
        </p>
        <p>
          His throne in the heavens.—This is an expression to signify the
          authority of God; for as God hath no member properly, though he be so
          represented to us, so he hath properly no throne. It signifies his
          power of reigning and judging. A throne is proper to royalty, the seat
          of majesty in its excellency, and the place where the deepest respect
          and homage of subjects is paid, and their petitions presented. That
          the throne of God is in the heavens, that there he sits as Sovereign,
          is the opinion of all that acknowledge a God; when they stand in need
          of his authority to assist them, their eyes are lifted up, and their
          heads stretched out to heaven; so his Son Christ prayed; he “lifted up
          his eyes to heaven,” as the place where his Father sat in majesty, as
          the most adorable object (John xvii. 1). Heaven hath the title of his
          “throne,” as the earth hath that of his “footstool” (Isa. lxvi. 1).
          And, therefore, heaven is sometimes put for the authority of God (Dan.
          iv. 26). “After that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule,”
          i. e. that God, who hath his throne in the heavens, orders earthly
          princes and sceptres as he pleases, and rules over the kingdoms of the
          world. His throne in the heavens notes, 1. The glory of his dominion.
          The heavens are the most stately and comely pieces of the creation.
          His majesty is there most visible, his glory most splendid (Ps. xix.
          1). The heavens speak out with a full mouth his glory. It is therefore
          called “the habitation” of his “holiness and of his glory” (Isa.
          lxiii. 15). There is the greater glister and brightness of his glory.
          The whole earth, indeed, is full of his glory, full of the beams of
          it; the heaven is full of the body of it; as the rays of the sun reach
          the earth, but the full glory of it is in the firmament. In heaven his
          dominion is more acknowledged by the angels standing at his beck, and
          by their readiness and swiftness obeying his commands, going and
          returning as a flash of lightning (Ezek. i. 14). His throne may well
          be said to be in the heavens, since his dominion is not disputed there
          by the angels that attend him, as it is on earth by the rebels that
          arm themselves against him. 2. The supremacy of his empire. The
          heavens are the loftiest part of the creation, and the only fit palace
          for him; it is in the heavens his majesty and dignity are so sublime,
          that they are elevated above all earthly empires. 3. Peculiarity of
          this dominion. He rules in the heavens alone. There is some shadow of
          empire in the world. Royalty is communicated to men as his
          substitutes. He hath disposed a vicarious dominion to men in his
          footstool, the earth; he gives them some share in his authority; and,
          therefore, the title of his name (Ps. lxxxii. 6): “I have said, ye are
          gods;” but in heaven he reigns alone without any substitutes; his
          throne is there. He gives out his orders to the angels himself; the
          marks of his immediate sovereignty are there most visible. He hath no
          vicars‑general of that empire. His authority is not delegated to any
          creature; he rules the blessed spirits by himself; but he rules men
          that are on his footstool by others of the same kind, men of their own
          nature. 4. The vastness of his empire. The earth is but a spot to the
          heavens; what is England in a map to the whole earth, but a spot you
          may cover with your finger? much less must the whole earth be to the
          extended heavens; it is but a little point or atom to what is visible;
          the sun is vastly bigger than it, and several stars are supposed to be
          of a greater bulk than the earth; and how many, and what heavens are
          beyond, the ignorance of man cannot understand. If the “throne” of God
          be there, it is a larger circuit he rules in than can well be
          conceived. You cannot conceive the many millions of little particles
          there are in the earth; and if all put together be but as one point to
          that place where the throne of God is seated, how vast must his empire
          be! He rules there over the angels, which “excel in strength” those
          “hosts” of his “which do his pleasure,” in comparison of whom all the
          men in the world, and the power of the greatest potentates, is no more
          than the strength of an ant or fly; multitudes of them encircle his
          throne, and listen to his orders without roving, and execute them
          without disputing. And since his throne is in the heavens, it will
          follow, that all things under the heaven are parts of his dominion;
          his throne being in the highest place, the inferior things of earth
          cannot but be subject to him; and it necessarily includes his
          influence on all things below: because the heavens are the cause of
          all the motion in the world, the immediate thing the earth doth
          naturally address to for corn, wine, and oil, above which there is no
          superior but the Lord (Hos. ii. 21, 22): “The earth hears the corn,
          wine, and oil; the heavens hear the earth, and the Lord hears the
          heavens.” 5. The easiness of managing this government. His throne
          being placed on high, he cannot but behold all things that are done
          below; the height of a place gives advantage to a pure and clear eye
          to behold things below it. Had the sun an eye, nothing could be done
          in the open air out of its ken. The “throne” of God being in heaven,
          he easily looks from thence upon all the children of men (Ps. xiv. 2):
          “The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
          there were any that did understand.” He looks not down from heaven as
          if he were in regard of his presence confined there: but he looks down
          majestically, and by way of authority, not as the look of a bare
          spectator, but the look of a governor, to pass a sentence upon them as
          a judge. His being in the heavens renders him capable of doing
          “whatsoever he pleases” (Ps. cxv. 3). His “throne” being there, he can
          by a word, in stopping the motions of the heavens, turn the whole
          earth into confusion. In this respect, it is said, “He rides upon the
          heaven in thy help” (Deut. xxxiii. 26); discharges his thunders upon
          men, and makes the influences of it serve his people’s interest. By
          one turn of a cock, as you see in grottoes, he can cause streams from
          several parts of the heavens to refresh, or ruin the world. 6.
          Duration of it. The heavens are incorruptible; his throne is placed
          there in an incorruptible state. Earthly empires have their decays and
          dissolutions. The throne of God outlives the dissolution of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          His kingdom rules over all.—He hath an absolute right over all things
          within the circuit of heaven and earth; though his throne be in
          heaven, as the place where his glory is most eminent and visible, his
          authority most exactly obeyed, yet his kingdom extends itself to the
          lower parts of the earth. He doth not muffle and cloud up himself in
          heaven, or confine his sovereignty to that place, his royal power
          extends to all visible, as well as invisible things: he is proprietor
          and possessor of all (Deut. x. 14): “The heaven and the heaven of
          heavens is the Lord’s thy God, the earth also, with all that is
          there.” He hath right to dispose of all as he pleases. He doth not
          say, his kingdom rules all that fear him, but, “over all;” so that it
          is not the kingdom of grace he here speaks of, but his natural and
          universal kingdom. Over angels and men; Jews and Gentiles; animate and
          inanimate things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psalmist considers God here as a great monarch and general, and
          all creatures as his hosts and regiments under him, and takes notice
          principally of two things. 1. The establishment of his throne together
          with the seat of it. He hath prepared his throne in the heavens. 2.
          The extent of his empire.—His kingdom rules over all. This text, in
          all the parts of it, is a fit basis for a discourse upon the dominion
          of God, and the observation will be this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctrine.—God is sovereign Lord and King, and exerciseth a dominion
          over the whole world, both heaven and earth. This is so clear, that
          nothing is more spoken of in Scripture. The very name, “Lord,” imports
          it; a name originally belonging to gods, and from them translated to
          others. And he is frequently called “the Lord of Hosts,” because all
          the troops and armies of spiritual and corporeal creatures are in his
          hands, and at his service: this is one of his principal titles. And
          the angels are called his “hosts” (ver. 21, following the text) his
          camp and militia: but more plainly (1 Kings, xxii. 19), God is
          presented upon his throne, encompassed with all the “hosts of heaven”
          standing on his right hand and on his left, which can be understood of
          no other than the angels, that wait for the commands of their
          Sovereign, and stand about, not to counsel him, but to receive his
          orders. The sun, moon, and stars, are called his “hosts” (Deut. iv.
          19); appointed by him for the government of inferior things: he hath
          an absolute authority over the greatest and the least creatures; over
          those that are most dreadful, and those that are most beneficial; over
          the good angels that willingly obey him, over the evil angels that
          seem most incapable of government. And as he is thus “Lord of hosts,”
          he is the “King of glory,” or a glorious King (Ps. xxiv. 10). You find
          him called a “great King,” the “Most High” (Ps. xcii. 1), the Supreme
          Monarch, there being no dignity in heaven or earth but what is dim
          before him, and infinitely inferior to him; yea, he hath the title of
          “Only King” (1 Tim. vi. 15). The title of royalty truly and properly
          only belongs to him: you may see it described very magnificently by
          David, at the free‑will offering for the building of the temple (1
          Chron. xxix. 11, 12): “Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power,
          and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; thine is the kingdom,
          O God, and thou art exalted as Head above all: both riches and honor
          come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thy hand is power and
          might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength to
          all.” He hath an eminency of power or authority above all: all earthly
          princes received their diadems from him, yea, even those that will not
          acknowledge him, and he hath a more absolute power over them than they
          can challenge over their meanest vassals: as God hath a knowledge
          infinitely above our knowledge, so he hath a dominion incomprehensibly
          above any dominion of man; and, by all the shadows drawn from the
          authority of one man over another, we can have but weak glimmerings of
          the authority and dominion of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a threefold dominion of God. 1. Natural, which is absolute
          over all creatures, and is founded in the nature of God as Creator. 2.
          Spiritual, or gracious, which is a dominion over his church as
          redeemed, and founded in the covenant of grace. 3. A glorious kingdom,
          at the winding up of all, wherein he shall reign over all, either in
          the glory of his mercy, as over the glorified saints, or in the glory
          of his justice, in the condemned devils and men. The first dominion is
          founded in nature; the second in grace; the third in regard of the
          blessed in grace; in regard of the damned, in demerit in them, and
          justice in him. He is Lord of all things, and always in regard of
          propriety (Ps. xxiv. 1): “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
          thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein.” The earth, with the
          riches and treasures in the bowels of it; the habitable world, with
          everything that moves upon it, are his; he hath the sole right, and
          what right soever any others have is derived from him. In regard also
          of possession (Gen. xiv. 22): “The Most High God, possessor of heaven
          and earth:” in respect of whom, man is not the proprietary nor
          possessor, but usufructuary at the will of this grand Lord.

        <p>
          In the prosecution of this, I. I shall lay down some general
          propositions for the clearing and confirming it. II. I shall show
          wherein this right of dominion is founded. III. What the nature of it
          is. IV. Wherein it consists; and how it is manifested.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Some general propositions for the clearing and confirming of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. We must know the difference between the might or power of God and
          his authority. We commonly mean by the power of God the strength of
          God, whereby he is able to effect all his purposes; by the authority
          of God, we mean the right he hath to act what he pleases: omnipotence
          is his physical power, whereby he is able to do what he will; dominion
          is his moral power, whereby it is lawful for him to do what he will.
          Among men, strength and authority are two distinct things; a subject
          may be a giant, and be stronger than his prince, but he hath not the
          same authority as his prince: worldly dominion may be seated, not in a
          brawny arm, but a sickly and infirm body. As knowledge and wisdom are
          distinguished; knowledge respects the matter, being, and nature of a
          thing; wisdom respects the harmony, order, and actual usefulness of a
          thing; knowledge searcheth the nature of a thing, and wisdom employs
          that thing to its proper use: a man may have much knowledge, and
          little wisdom; so a man may have much strength, and little or no
          authority; a greater strength may be settled in the servant, but a
          greater authority resides in the master; strength is the natural vigor
          of a man: God hath an infinite strength, he hath a strength to bring
          to pass whatsoever he decrees; he acts without fainting and weakness
          (Isa. xl. 28), and impairs not his strength by the exercise of it: as
          God is Lord, he hath a right to enact; as he is almighty, he hath a
          power to execute; his strength is the executive power belonging to his
          dominion: in regard of his sovereignty, he hath a right to command all
          creatures; in regard of his almightiness, he hath power to make his
          commands be obeyed, or to punish men for the violation of them: his
          power is that whereby he subdues all creatures under him; his dominion
          is that whereby he hath a right to subdue all creatures under him.
          This dominion is a right of making what he pleases, of possessing what
          he made, of disposing of what he doth possess; whereas his power is an
          ability to make what he hath a right to create, to hold what he doth
          possess, and to execute the manner wherein he resolves to dispose of
          his creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. All the other attributes of God refer to this perfection of
          dominion. They all bespeak him fit for it, and are discovered in the
          exercise of it (which hath been manifested in the discourses of those
          attributes we have passed through hitherto). His goodness fits him for
          it, because he can never use his authority but for the good of the
          creatures, and conducting them to their true end: his wisdom can never
          be mistaken in the exercise of it; his power can accomplish the
          decrees that flow from his absolute authority. What can be more
          rightful than the placing authority in such an infinite Goodness, that
          hath bowels to pity, as well as a sceptre to sway his subjects? that
          hath a mind to contrive, and a will to regulate his contrivances for
          his own glory and his creatures’ good, and an arm of power to bring to
          pass what he orders? Without this dominion, some perfections, as
          justice and mercy, would lie in obscurity, and much of his wisdom
          would be shrouded from our sight and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This of dominion, as well as that of power, hath been acknowledged
          by all. The high priest was to “waive the offering,” or shake it to
          and fro (Exod. xxix. 24), which the Jews say was customarily from east
          to west, and from north to south, the four quarters of the world, to
          signify God’s sovereignty over all the parts of the world; and some of
          the heathens, in their adorations, turned their bodies to all
          quarters, to signify the extensive dominion of God throughout the
          whole earth. That dominion did of right pertain to the Deity, was
          confessed by the heathen in the name “Baal,” given to their idols,
          which signifies Lord; and was not a name of one idol, adored for a
          god, but common to all the eastern idols. God hath interwoven the
          notion of his sovereignty in the nature and constitution of man, in
          the noblest and most inward acts of his soul, in that faculty or act
          which is most necessary for him, in his converse in this world, either
          with God or man: it is stamped upon the conscience of man, and flashes
          in his face in every act of self‑judgment conscience passes upon a
          man: every reflection of conscience implies an obligation of man to
          some law “written in his heart” (Rom. ii. 15). This law cannot be
          without a legislator, nor this legislator without a sovereign
          dominion; these are but natural and easy consequences in the mind of
          man from every act of conscience. The indelible authority of
          conscience in man, in the whole exercise of it, bears a respect to the
          sovereignty of God, clearly proclaims not only a supreme Being, but a
          supreme Governor, and points man directly to it, that a man may as
          soon deny his having such a reflecting principle within him, as deny
          God’s dominion over him, and consequently over the whole world of
          rational creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This notion of sovereignty is inseparable from the notion of a God.
          To acknowledge the existence of a God, and to acknowledge him a
          rewarder, are linked together (Heb. xi. 6). To acknowledge him a
          rewarder, is to acknowledge him a governor; rewards being the marks of
          dominion. The very name of God includes in it a supremacy and an
          actual rule. He cannot be conceived as God, but he must be conceived
          as the highest authority in the world. It is as possible for him not
          to be God as not to be supreme. Wherein can the exercise of his
          excellencies be apparent, but in his sovereign rule? To fancy an
          infinite power without a supreme dominion, is to fancy a mighty
          senseless statue, fit to be beheld, but not fit to be obeyed; as not
          being able or having no right to give out orders, or not caring for
          the exercise of it. God cannot be supposed to be the chief being, but
          he must be supposed to give laws to all, and receive laws from none.
          And if we suppose him with a perfection of justice and righteousness
          (which we must do, unless we would make a lame and imperfect God) we
          must suppose him to have an entire dominion, without which he could
          never be able to manifest his justice. And without a supreme dominion
          he could not manifest the supremacy and infiniteness of his
          righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) We cannot suppose God a Creator, without supposing a sovereign
          dominion in him. No creature can be made without some law in its
          nature; if it had not law, it would be created to no purpose, to no
          regular end. It would be utterly unbecoming an infinite wisdom to
          create a lawless creature, a creature wholly vain; much less can a
          rational creature be made without a law: if it had no law, it were not
          rational: for the very notion of a rational creature implies reason to
          be a law to it, and implies an acting by rule. If you could suppose
          rational creatures without a law, you might suppose that they might
          blaspheme their Creator, and murder their fellow‑creatures, and commit
          the most abominable villanies destructive to human society, without
          sin; for “where there is no law, there is no transgression.”994 But
          those things are accounted sins by all mankind, and sins against the
          Supreme Being: so that a dominion, and the exercise of it, is so fast
          linked to God, so entirely in him, so intrinsic in his nature, that it
          cannot be imagined that a rational creature can be made by him,
          without a stamp and mark of that dominion in his very nature and
          frame; it is so inseparable from God in his very act of creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It is such a dominion as cannot be renounced by God himself. It
          is so intrinsic and connatural to him, so inlaid in the nature of God,
          that he cannot strip himself of it, nor of the exercise of it, while
          any creature remains. It is preserved by him, for it could not subsist
          of itself; it is governed by him, it could not else answer its end. It
          is impossible there can be a creature, which hath not God for its
          Lord. Christ himself, though in regard of his Deity equal with God,
          yet in regard of his created state, and assuming our nature, was God’s
          servant, was governed by him in the whole of his office, acted
          according to his command and directions; God calls him his servant
          (Isa. xlii. 1): and Christ, in that prophetic psalm of him, calls God
          his Lord (Ps. xvi. 2): “O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou
          art my Lord.” It was impossible it should be otherwise; justice had
          been so far from being satisfied, that it had been highly incensed if
          the order of things in the due subjection to God had been broke, and
          his terms had not been complied with. It would be a judgment upon the
          world if God should give up the government to any else, as it is when
          he gives “children to be princes” (Isa. iii. 4); i. e. children in
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It is so inseparable, that it cannot be communicated to any
          creature. No creature is able to exercise it; every creature is unable
          to perform all the offices that belong to this dominion. No creature
          can impose laws upon the consciences of men: man knows not the inlets
          into the soul, his pen cannot reach the inwards of man. What laws he
          hath power to propose to conscience, he cannot see executed; because
          every creature wants omniscience; he is not able to perceive all those
          breaches of the law which may be committed at the same time in so many
          cities, so many chambers. Or, suppose an angel, in regard to the
          height of his standing, and the insufficiency of walls, and darkness,
          and distance to obstruct his view, can behold men’s actions, yet he
          cannot know the internal acts of men’s minds and wills, without some
          outward eruption and appearance of them. And if he be ignorant of
          them, how can he execute his laws? If he only understand the outward
          fact without the inward thought, how can he dispense a justice
          proportionable to the crime? he must needs be ignorant of that which
          adds the greatest aggravation sometimes to a sin, and inflicts a
          lighter punishment upon that which receives a deeper tincture from the
          inward posture of the mind, than another fact may do, which in the
          outward act may appear more base and unjust; and so while he intends
          righteousness, may act a degree of injustice. Besides, no creature can
          inflict a due punishment for sin; that which is due to sin, is a loss
          of the vision and sight of God; but none can deprive any of that but
          God himself; nor can a creature reward another with eternal life,
          which consists in communion with God, which none but God can
          bestow.995
        </p>
        <p>II. Wherein the dominion of God is founded.</p>
        <p>
          1. On the excellency of his nature. Indeed, a bare excellency of
          nature bespeaks a fitness for government, but doth not properly convey
          a right of government. Excellency speaks aptitude, not title: a
          subject may have more wisdom than the prince, and be fitter to hold
          the reins of government, but he hath not a title to royalty. A man of
          large capacity and strong virtue is fit to serve his country in
          parliament, but the election of the people conveys a title to him. Yet
          a strain of intellectual and moral abilities beyond others, is a
          foundation for dominion. And it is commonly seen that such eminences
          in men, though they do not invest them with a civil authority, or an
          authority of jurisdiction, yet they create a veneration in the minds
          of men; their virtue attracts reverence, and their advice is regarded
          as an oracle. Old men by their age, when stored with more wisdom and
          knowledge by reason of their long experience, acquire a kind of power
          over the younger in their dictates and councils, so that they gain, by
          the strength of that excellency, a real authority in the minds of
          those men they converse with, and possess themselves of a deep respect
          for them. God therefore being an incomprehensible ocean of all
          perfection, and possessing infinitely all those virtues that may lay a
          claim to dominion, hath the first foundation of it in his own nature.
          His incomparable and unparalleled excellency, as well as the greatness
          of his work, attracts the voluntary worship of him as a sovereign Lord
          (Ps. lxxxvi. 8): “Among the gods, there is none like unto thee;
          neither are there any works like unto thy work. All nations shall come
          and worship before thee.” Though his benefits are great engagements to
          our obedience and affection, yet his infinite majesty and perfection
          requires the first place in our acknowledgements and adorations. Upon
          this account God claims it (Isa. xlvi. 9): “I am God, and there is
          none like me; I will do all my pleasure:” and the prophet Jeremiah
          upon the same account acknowledgeth it (Jer. x. 6, 7): “Forasmuch as
          there is none like unto thee, O Lord, thou art great, and thy name is
          great in might: who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to
          thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as there is none like unto thee.”
          And this is a more noble title of dominion, it being an uncreated
          title, and more eminent than that of creation or preservation. This is
          the natural order God hath placed in his creatures, that the more
          excellent should rule the inferior.996 He committed not the government
          of lower creatures to lions and tigers, that have a delight in blood,
          but no knowledge of virtue; but to man, who had an eminence in his
          nature above other creatures, and was formed with a perfect rectitude,
          and a height of reason to guide the reins over them. In man, the soul
          being of a more sublime nature, is set of right to rule over the body;
          the mind, the most excellent faculty of the soul, to rule over the
          other powers of it: and wisdom, the most excellent habit of the mind,
          to guide and regulate that in its determinations; and when the body
          and sensitive appetite control the soul and mind, it is an usurpation
          against nature, not a rule according to nature. The excellency,
          thereof, of the Divine nature is the natural foundation for his
          dominion. He hath wisdom to know what is fit for him to do, and an
          immutable righteousness whereby he cannot do any thing base and
          unworthy: he hath a foreknowledge whereby he is able to order all
          things to answer his own glorious designs and the end of his
          government, that nothing can go awry, nothing put him to a stand, and
          constrain him to meditate new counsels. So that if it could be
          supposed that the world had not been created by him, that the parts of
          it had met together by chance, and been compacted into such a body,
          none but God, the supreme and most excellent Being in the world, could
          have merited, and deservedly challenged the government of it; because
          nothing had an excellency of nature to capacitate it for it, as he
          hath, or to enter into a contest with him for a sufficiency to
          govern.997
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is founded in his act of creation. He is the sovereign Lord, as
          he is the almighty Creator. The relation of an entire Creator induceth
          the relation of an absolute Lord; he that gives being, motion, that is
          the sole cause of the being of a thing, which was before nothing, that
          hath nothing to concur with him, nothing to assist him, but by his
          sole power commands it to stand up into being, is the unquestionable
          Lord and proprietor of that thing that hath no dependence but upon
          him; and by this act of creation, which extended to all things, he
          became universal Sovereign over all things: and those that waive the
          excellency of his nature as the foundation of his government, easily
          acknowledge the sufficiency of it upon his actual creation. His
          dominion of jurisdiction results from creation. When God himself makes
          an oration in defence of his sovereignty (Job xxxviii.), his chief
          arguments are drawn from creation; and (Ps. xcv. 3, 5), “The Lord is a
          great King above all gods; the sea is his, and he made it:” and so the
          apostle, in his sermon to the Athenians. As he “made the world, and
          all things therein,” he is styled, “Lord of heaven and earth” (Acts
          xvii. 24). His dominion, also, of property stands upon this basis:
          “The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world, and
          the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them” (Ps. lxxxix. 11). Upon
          this title of forming Israel as a creature, or rather as a church, he
          demands their service to him as their Sovereign: “O Jacob and Israel,
          thou art my servant, I have formed thee: thou art my servant, O
          Israel” (Isa. xliv. 21). The sovereignty of God naturally ariseth from
          the relation of all things to himself as their entire Creator, and
          their natural and inseparable dependence upon him in regard of their
          being and well‑being. It depends not upon the election of men; God
          hath a natural dominion over us as creatures, before he hath a
          dominion by consent over us as converts: as soon as ever anything
          began to be a creature, it was a vassal to God, as a Lord. Every man
          is acknowledged to have a right of possessing what he hath made, and a
          power of dominion over what he hath framed: he may either cherish his
          own work, or dash it in pieces; he may either add a greater comeliness
          to it, or deface what he hath already imparted. He hath a right of
          property in it: no other man can, without injury, pilfer his own work
          from him. The work hath no propriety in itself; the right must lie in
          the immediate framer, or in the person that employed him. The first
          cause of everything hath an unquestionable dominion of propriety in it
          upon the score of justice. By the law of nations, the first finder of
          a country is esteemed the rightful possessor and lord of that country,
          and the first inventor of an art hath a right of exercising it. If a
          man hath a just claim of dominion over that thing whose materials were
          not of his framing, but from only the addition of a new figure from
          his skill; as a limner over his picture, the cloth whereof he never
          made, nor the colors wherewith he draws it were never endued by him
          with their distinct qualities, but only he applies them by his art, to
          compose such a figure; much more hath God a rightful claim of dominion
          over his creatures, whose entire being, both in matter and form, and
          every particle of their excellency, was breathed out by the word of
          his mouth. He did not only give the matter a form, but bestowed upon
          the matter itself a being; it was formed by none to his hand, as the
          matter is on which an artist works. He had the being of all things in
          his own power, and it was at his choice whether he would impart it or
          no; there can be no juster and stronger ground of a claim than this. A
          man hath a right to a piece of brass or gold by his purchase, but when
          by his engraving he hath formed it into an excellent statue, there
          results an increase of his right upon the account of his artifice.
          God’s creation of the matter of man gave him a right over man; but his
          creation of him in so eminent an excellency, with reason to guide him,
          a clear eye of understanding to discern light from darkness, and truth
          from falsehood, a freedom of will to act accordingly, and an original
          righteousness as the varnish and beauty of all; here is the strongest
          foundation for a claim of authority over man, and the strongest
          obligation on man for subjection to God. If all those things had been
          past over to God by another hand, he could not be the supreme Lord,
          nor could have an absolute right to dispose of them at his pleasure:
          that would have been the invasion of another’s right. Besides,
          creation is the only first discovery of his dominion. Before the world
          was framed there was nothing but God himself, and, properly, nothing
          is said to have dominion over itself; this is a relative attribute,
          reflecting on the works of God.998 He had a right of dominion in his
          nature from eternity, but before creation he was actually Lord only of
          a nullity; where there is nothing it can have no relation; nothing is
          not the subject of possession nor of dominion. There could be no
          exercise of this dominion without creation: what exercise can a
          sovereign have without subjects? Sovereignty speaks a relation to
          subjects, and none is properly a sovereign without subjects. To
          conclude: from hence doth result God’s universal dominion; for being
          Maker of all, he is the ruler of all, and his perpetual dominion; for
          as long as God continues in the relation of Creator, the right of his
          sovereignty as Creator cannot be abolished.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. As God is the final cause, or end of all, he is Lord of all. The
          end hath a greater sovereignty in actions than the actor itself: the
          actor hath a sovereignty over others in action, but the end for which
          any one works hath a sovereignty over the agent himself: a limner hath
          a sovereignty over the picture he is framing, or hath framed, but the
          end for which he framed it, either his profit he designed from it, or
          the honor and credit of skill he aimed at in it, hath a dominion over
          the limner himself: the end moves and excites the artist to work; it
          spirits him in it, conducts him in his whole business, possesses his
          mind, and sits triumphant in him in all the progress of his work; it
          is the first cause for which the whole work is wrought.999 Now God, in
          his actual creation of all, is the sovereign end of all; “for thy
          pleasure they are and were created” (Rev. iv. 11); “The Lord hath made
          all things for himself” (Prov. xvi. 4). Man, indeed, is the
          subordinate and immediate end of the lower creation, and therefore had
          the dominion over other creatures granted to him: but God being the
          ultimate and principal end, hath the sovereign and principal dominion;
          all things as much refer to him, as the last end, as they flow from
          him as the first cause. So that, as I said before, if the world had
          been compacted together by a jumbling chance, without a wise hand, as
          some have foolishly imagined, none could have been an antagonist with
          God for the government of the world; but God, in regard of the
          excellency of his nature, would have been the Rector of it, unless
          those atoms that had composed the world had had an ability to govern
          it. Since there could be no universal end of all things but God, God
          only can claim an entire right to the government of it; for though man
          be the end of the lower creation, yet man is not the end of himself
          and his own being; he is not the end of the creation of the supreme
          heavens; he is not able to govern them; they are out of his ken, and
          out of his reach. None fit in regard of the excellency of nature, to
          be the chief end of the whole world but God; and therefore none can
          have a right to the dominion of it but God: in this regard God’s
          dominion differs from the dominion of all earthly potentates. All the
          subjects in creation were made for God as their end, so are not people
          for rulers, but rulers made for people for their protection, and the
          preservation of order in societies.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The dominion of God is founded upon his preservation of things.
          (Ps. xcv. 3, 4); “The Lord is a great King above all gods:” why? “In
          his hand are all the deep places of the earth.” While his hand holds
          things, his hand hath a dominion over them. He that holds a stone in
          the air, exerciseth a dominion over its natural inclination in
          hindering it from falling. The creature depends wholly upon God in its
          preservation; as soon as that Divine hand which sustains everything
          were withdrawn, a languishment and swooning would be the next turn in
          the creature. He is called Lord, Adonai, in regard of his sustentation
          of all things by his continual influx; the word coming of אדן, which
          signifies a basis or pillar, that supports a building. God is the Lord
          of all, as he is the sustainer of all by his power, as well as the
          Creator of all by his word. The sun hath a sovereign dominion over its
          own beams, which depend upon it, so that if he withdraws himself, they
          all attend him, and the world is left in darkness. God maintains the
          vigor of all things, conducts them in their operations; so that
          nothing that they are, nothing that they have, but is owing to his
          preserving power. The Master of this great family may as well be
          called the Lord of it, since every member of it depends upon him for
          the support of that being he first gave them, and holds of his empire.
          As the right to govern resulted from creation, so it is perpetuated by
          the preservation of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The dominion of God is strengthened by the innumerable benefits he
          bestows upon his creatures: the benefits he confers upon us after
          creation, are not the original ground of his dominion. A man hath not
          authority over his servant from the kindness he shows to him, but his
          authority commenceth before any act of kindness, and is founded upon a
          right of purchase, conquest, or compact. Dominion doth not depend upon
          mere benefits; then inferiors might have dominions over superiors. A
          peasant may save the life of a prince to whom he was not subject; he
          hath not therefore a right to step up into his throne and give laws to
          him: and children that maintain their parents in their poverty, might
          then acquire an authority over them which they can never climb to;
          because the benefits they confer cannot parallel the benefits they
          have received from the authors of their lives. The bounties of God to
          us add nothing to the intrinsic right of his natural dominion; they
          being the effects of that sovereignty, as he is a rewarder and
          governor; as the benefits a prince bestows upon his favorite increases
          not that right of authority which is inherent in the crown, but
          strengthens that dominion as it stands in relation to the receiver, by
          increasing the obligation of the favorite to an observance of him, not
          only as his natural prince, but his gracious benefactor. The
          beneficence of God adds, though not an original right of power, yet a
          foundation of a stronger upbraiding the creature, if he walks in a
          violation and forgetfulness of those benefits, and pull in pieces the
          links of that ingenuous duty they call for; and an occasion of
          exercising of justice in punishing the delinquent, which is a part of
          his empire (Isa. i. 2): “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, the
          Lord hath spoken; I have nourished children, and they have rebelled
          against me.” Thus the fundamental right as Creator is made more
          indisputable by his relation as a benefactor, and more as being so
          after a forfeiture of what was enjoyed by creation. The benefits of
          God are innumerable, and so magnificent that they cannot meet with any
          compensation from the creature; and, therefore, do necessarily require
          a submission from the creature, and an acknowledgment of Divine
          authority. But that benefit of redemption doth add a stronger right of
          dominion to God; since he hath not only as a Creator given them being
          and life as his creatures, but paid a price, the price of his Son’s
          blood, for their rescue from captivity; so that he hath a sovereignty
          of grace as well as nature, and the ransomed ones belong to him as
          Redeemer as well as Creator (1 Cor. vi. 19, 20): “Ye are not your own,
          for ye are bought with a price;” therefore your body and your spirit
          are God’s. By this he acquired a right of another kind, and bought us
          from that uncontrollable lordship we affected over ourselves by the
          sin of Adam, that he might use us as his own peculiar for his own
          glory and service. By this redemption there results to God a right
          over our bodies, over our spirits, over our services, as well as by
          creation; and to show the strength of this right, the apostle repeats
          it, “you are bought;” a purchase cannot be without a price paid; but
          he adds price also, “bought with a price.” To strengthen the title,
          purchase gave him a new right, and the greatness of the price
          established that right. The more a man pays for a thing, the more
          usually we say, he deserves to have it, he hath paid enough for it; it
          was, indeed, price enough, and too much for such vile creatures as we
          are.
        </p>
        <p>III. The third thing is, The nature of this dominion.</p>
        <p>
          1. This dominion is independent. His throne is in the heavens; the
          heavens depend not upon the earth, nor God upon his creatures. Since
          he is independent in regard of his essence, he is so in his dominion,
          which flows from the excellency and fulness of his essence; as he
          receives his essence from none, so he derives his dominion from none;
          all other dominion except paternal authority is rooted originally in
          the wills of men. The first title was the consent of the people, or
          the conquest of others by the help of those people that first
          consented; and in the exercise of it, earthly dominion depends upon
          assistance of the subjects, and the members being joined with the head
          carry on the work of government, and prevent civil dissensions; in the
          support of it, it depends upon the subjects’ contributions and taxes;
          the subjects in their strength are the arms, and in their purses the
          sinews of government; but God depends upon none in the foundation of
          his government; he is not a Lord by the votes of his vassals.1000 Nor
          is it successively handed to him by any predecessor, nor constituted
          by the power of a superior; nor forced he his way by war and conquest,
          nor precariously attained it by suit or flattery, or bribing promises.
          He holds not the right of his empire from any other; he hath no
          superior to hand him to his throne, and settle him by commission; he
          is therefore called “King of kings, and Lord of lords,” having none
          above him; “A great King above all gods” (Ps. xcv. 3): needing no
          license from any when to act, nor direction how to act, or assistance
          in his action; he owes not any of those to any person; he was not
          ordered by any other to create, and therefore received not orders from
          any other to rule over what he hath created. He received not his power
          and wisdom from another, and therefore is not subject to any for the
          rule of his government. He only made his own subjects, and from
          himself hath the sole authority; his own will was the cause of their
          beings, and his own will is the director of their actions. He is not
          determined by his creatures in any of his motions, but determines the
          creatures in all; his actions are not regulated by any law without
          him, but by a law within him, the law of his own nature. It is
          impossible he can have any rule without himself, because there is
          nothing superior to himself, nor doth he depend upon any in the
          exercise of his government; he needs no servants in it, when he uses
          creatures: it is not out of want of their help, but for the
          manifestation of his wisdom and power. What he doth by his subjects,
          he can do by himself: “The government is upon his shoulder” (Isa. ix.
          6), to show that he needs not any supporters. All other governments
          flow from him, all other authorities depend upon him; Dei Gratiâ, or
          Dei Providentiâ, is in the style of princes. As their being is derived
          from his power, so their authority is but a branch of his dominion.
          They are governors by Divine providence; God is governor by his sole
          nature. All motions depend upon the first heaven, which moves all; but
          that depends upon nothing. The government of Christ depends upon God’s
          uncreated dominion, and is by commission from him; Christ assumed not
          this honor to himself, “But he that said unto him, Thou art my Son,”
          bestowed it upon him. “He put all things under his feet,” but not
          himself (1 Cor. xv. 27). “When he saith, All things are put under him,
          he is excepted, which did put all things under him.” He sits still as
          an independent governor upon his throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This dominion is absolute. If his throne be in the heavens, there
          is nothing to control him. If he be independent, he must needs be
          absolute; since he hath no cause in conjunction with him as Creator,
          that can share with him in his right, or restrain him in the disposal
          of his creature. His authority is unlimited; in this regard the title
          of “Lord” becomes not any but God properly. Tiberius, though none of
          the best, though one of the subtilest princes, accounted the title of
          “Lord” a reproach to him: since he was not absolute.1001
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Absolute in regard of freedom and liberty. (1.) Thus creation is
          a work of his mere sovereignty; he created, because it was his
          pleasure to create (Rev. iv. 11). He is not necessitated to do this or
          that. He might have chosen whether he would have framed an earth and
          heavens, and laid the foundations of his chambers in the waters. He
          was under no obligation to reduce things from nullity to existence.
          (2.) Preservation is the fruit of his sovereignty. When he had called
          the world to stand out, he might have ordered it to return into its
          dark den of nothingness, ripped up every part of its foundation, or
          have given being to many more creatures then he did. If you consider
          his absolute sovereignty, why might he not have divested Adam
          presently of those rational perfections wherewith he had endowed him?
          And might he not have metamorphosed him into some beast, and elevated
          some beast into a rational nature? Why might he not have degraded an
          angel to a worm, and advanced a worm to the nature and condition of an
          angel? Why might he not have revoked that grant of dominion, which he
          had passed to man over all creatures? It was free to him to permit sin
          to enter into the earth, or to have excluded it out of the earth, as
          he doth out of heaven. (3.) Redemption is a fruit of his sovereignty.
          By his absolute sovereignty he might have confirmed all the angels in
          their standing by grace, and prevented the revolt of any of their
          members from him; and when there was a revolt both in heaven and
          earth, it was free to him to have called out his Son to assume the
          angelical, as well as the human, nature, or have exercised his
          dominion in the destruction of men and devils, rather than in the
          redemption of any; he was under no obligation to restore either the
          one or the other. (4.) May he not impose what terms he pleases? May he
          not impose what laws he pleases, and exact what he will of his
          creature without promising any rewards? May he not use his own for his
          own honor, as well as men use for their credit what they do possess by
          his indulgence? (5.) Affliction is an act of his sovereignty. By this
          right of sovereignty, may not God take away any man’s goods, since
          they were his doles? As he was not indebted to us when he bestowed
          them, so he cannot wrong us when he removes them. He takes from us
          what is more his own than it is ours, and was never ours but by his
          gift, and that for a time only, not forever. By this right he may
          determine our times, put a period to our days when he pleases, strip
          us of one member, and lop off another. Man’s being was from him, and
          why should he not have a sovereignty to take what he had a sovereignty
          to give? Why should this seem strange to any of us, since we ourselves
          exercise an absolute dominion over those things in our possession,
          which have sense and feeling, as well as over those that want it? Doth
          not every man think he hath an absolute authority over the utensils of
          his house, over his horse, his dog, to preserve or kill him, to do
          what he please with him, without rendering any other reason than, It
          is my own? May not God do much more? Doth not his dominion over the
          work of his hands transcend that which a man can claim over his beast
          that he never gave life unto? He that dares dispute against God’s
          absolute right, fancies himself as much a god as his Creator:
          understands not the vast difference between the Divine nature and his
          own; between the sovereignty of God and his own, which is all the
          theme God himself discourseth upon in those stately chapters (Job.
          xxxviii., xxxix. &amp;c.); not mentioning a word of Job’s sin, but
          only vindicating the rights of his own authority. Nor doth Job, in his
          reply (Job xl. 4), speak of his sin, but of his natural vileness as a
          creature in the presence of his Creator. By this right, God unstops
          the bottles of heaven in one place, and stops them in another, causing
          it “to rain upon one city, and not upon another” (Amos iv. 7);
          ordering the clouds to move to this or that quarter where he hath a
          mind to be a benefactor or a judge. (6.) Unequal dispensations are
          acts of his sovereignty. By this right he is patient toward those
          whose sins, by the common voice of men, deserve speedy judgments, and
          pours out pain upon those that are patterns of virtue to the world. By
          this he gives sometimes the worst of men an ocean of wealth and honor
          to swim in, and reduceth an useful and exemplary grace to a scanty
          poverty. By this he “rules the kingdoms of men,” and sets a crown upon
          the head of the basest of men (Dan. iv. 17), while he deposeth another
          that seemed to deserve a weightier diadem. This is, as he is the Lord
          of the ammunition of his thunders, and the treasures of his bounty.
          (7.) He may inflict what torments he pleases. Some say, by this right
          of sovereignty he may inflict what torments he pleaseth upon an
          innocent person; which, indeed, will not bear the nature of a
          punishment as an effect of justice, without the supposal of a crime;
          but a torment, as an effect of that sovereign right he hath over his
          creature, which is as absolute over his work as the “potter’s” power
          is “over his own clay” (Jer. xviii. 6; Rom. ix. 21). May not the
          potter, after his labor, either set his “vessel” up to adorn his
          house, or knock it in pieces, and fling it upon the dunghill; separate
          it to some noble use, or condemn it to some sordid service?1002 Is the
          right of God over his creatures less than that of the potter over his
          vessel, since God contributed all to his creature, but the potter
          never made the clay, which is the substance of the vessel, nor the
          water which was necessary to make it tractable, but only moulded the
          substance of it into such a shape? The vessel that is framed, and the
          potter that frames it, differ only in life: the body of the potter,
          whereby he executes his authority, is of no better a mould than the
          clay, the matter of his vessel. Shall he have so absolute a power over
          that which is so near him, and shall not God over that which is so
          infinitely distant from him? The “vessel,” perhaps, might plead for
          itself that it was once part of the body of a man, and as good as the
          “potter” himself; whereas no creature can plead it was part of God,
          and as good as God himself. Though there be no man in the world but
          deserves affliction, yet the Scripture sometimes lays affliction upon
          the score of God’s dominion, without any respect to the sin of the
          afflicted person. Speaking of a sick person (James v. 15), “If he have
          committed sins, they shall be forgiven him;” whereby is implied, that
          he might be struck into sickness by God, without any respect to a
          particular sin, but in a way of trial; and that his affliction sprung
          not from any exercise of Divine justice, but from his absolute
          sovereignty; and so, in the case of the blind man, when the disciples
          asked for what sin it was, whether for his “own,” or his “parents
          sin,” he was born blind? (John ix. 3), “Neither hath this man sinned,
          nor his parents;” which speaks, in itself, not against the whole
          current of Scripture; but the words import thus much, that God, in
          this blindness from the birth, neither respected any sin of the man’s
          own, nor of his parents, but he did it as an absolute sovereign, to
          manifest his own glory in that miraculous cure which was wrought by
          Christ. Though afflictions do not happen without the desert of the
          creature, yet some afflictions may be sent without any particular
          respect to that desert, merely for the manifestation of God’s glory,
          since the creature was made for God himself, and his honor, and
          therefore may be used in a serviceableness to the glory of the
          Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. His dominion is absolute in regard of unlimitedness by any law
          without him. He is an absolute monarch that makes laws for his
          subjects, but is not bound by any himself, nor receives any rules and
          laws from his subjects, for the management of his government. But most
          governments in the world are bounded by laws made by common consent.
          But when kings are not limited by the laws of their kingdoms, yet they
          are bounded by the law of nature, and by the providence of God. But
          God is under no law without himself; his rule is within him, the
          rectitude and righteousness of his own nature; he is not under that
          law he hath prescribed to man. The law was not made for a “righteous
          man” (1 Tim. i. 9), much less for a righteous God. God is his own law;
          his own nature is his rule, as his own glory is his end; himself is
          his end, and himself is his law. He is moved by nothing without
          himself; nothing hath the dominion of a motive over him but his own
          will, which is his rule for all his actions in heaven and earth. (Dan.
          iv. 32), “He rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever
          he will.” And, (Rom. ix. 18), “He hath mercy on whom he will have
          mercy;” as all things are wrought by him according to his own eternal
          ideas in his own mind, so all is wrought by him according to the
          inward motive in his own will, which was the manifestation of his own
          honor. The greatest motives, therefore, that the best persons have
          used, when they have pleaded for any grant from God, was his own
          glory, which would be advanced by an answer of their petition.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. His dominion is absolute in regard of supremacy and
          uncontrollableness. None can implead him, and cause him to render a
          reason of his actions. He is the sovereign King, “Who may say unto
          him, What dost thou?” (Eccles. viii. 4.) It is an absurd thing for any
          to dispute with God. (Rom. xi. 20), “Who art thou, O man, that
          repliest against God?” Thou, a man, a piece of dust, to argue with a
          God incomprehensibly above thy reason, about the reason of his works!
          Let the potsherds strive with the potsherds of the earth, but “not
          with Him that fashioned them” (Isa. xlv. 9). In all the desolations he
          works, he asserts his own supremacy to silence men. (Ps. xlvi. 10),
          “Be still, and know that I am God!” Beware of any quarrelling motions
          in your minds; it is sufficient than I am God, that is supreme, and
          will not be impleaded, and censured, or worded with by any creature
          about what I do. He is not bound to render a reason of any of his
          proceedings. Subjects are accountable to their princes, and princes to
          God, God to none; since he is not limited by any superior, his
          prerogative is supreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. His dominion is absolute in regard of irresistibleness. Other
          governments are bounded by law; so that what a governor hath strength
          to do, he hath not a right to do; other governors have a limited
          ability, that what they have a right to do, they have not always a
          strength to do; they may want a power to execute their own counsels.
          But God is destitute of neither; he hath an infinite right, and an
          infinite strength; his word is a law; he commands things to stand out
          of nothing, and they do so. “He commanded,” or spake, ὁ εἰπὼν, “light
          to shine out of darkness” (2 Cor. iv. 6). There is no distance of time
          between his word: “Let there be light; and there was light” (Gen. i.
          3). Magistrates often use not their authority, for fear of giving
          occasion to insurrections, which may overturn their empire. But if the
          Lord will work, “who shall let it?” (Isa. xliii. 19): and if God will
          not work, who shall force him? He can check and overturn all other
          powers; his decrees cannot be stopped, nor his hand held back by any:
          if he wills to dash the whole world in pieces, no creature can
          maintain its being against his order. He sets the ordinances of the
          heavens, and the dominion thereof in the earth; and sends lightnings,
          that they may go, and say unto him, “Here we are” (Job. xxxviii. 33,
          34).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Yet this dominion, though it be absolute, is not tyrannical, but it
          is managed by the rules of wisdom, righteousness, and goodness. If his
          throne be in the heavens, it is pure and good: because the heavens are
          the purest parts of the creation, and influence by their goodness the
          lower earth. Since he is his own rule, and his nature is infinitely
          wise, holy, and righteous, he cannot do a thing but what is
          unquestionably agreeable with wisdom, justice, and purity. In all the
          exercises of his sovereign right, he is never unattended with those
          perfections of his nature. Might not God, by his absolute power, have
          pardoned men’s guilt, and thrown the invading sin out of his
          creatures? but in regard of his truth pawned in his threatening, and
          in regard of his justice, which demanded satisfaction, he would not.
          Might not God, by his absolute sovereignty, admit a man into his
          friendship, without giving him any grace? but in regard of the
          incongruity of such an act to his wisdom and holiness, he will not.
          May he not, by his absolute power, refuse to accept a man that desires
          to please him, and reject a purely innocent creature? but in regard of
          his goodness and righteousness, he will not. Though innocence be
          amiable in its own nature, yet it is not necessary in regard of God’s
          sovereignty, that he should love it; but in regard of his goodness it
          is necessary, and he will never do otherwise. As God never acts to the
          utmost of his power, so he never exerts the utmost of his sovereignty:
          because it would be inconsistent with those other properties which
          render him perfectly adorable to the creature. As no intelligent
          creature, neither angel nor man, can be framed without a law in his
          nature, so we cannot imagine God without a law in his own nature,
          unless we would fancy him a rude, tyrannical, foolish being, that hath
          nothing of holiness, goodness, righteousness, wisdom. If he “made the
          heavens in wisdom” (Ps. cxxxvi. 5), he made them by some rule, not by
          a mere will, but a rule within himself, not without. A wise work is
          never the result of an absolute unguided will.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) This dominion is managed by the rule of wisdom. What may appear
          to us to have no other spring than absolute sovereignty, would be
          found to have a depth of amazing wisdom, and accountable reason, were
          our short capacities long enough to fathom it. When the apostle had
          been discoursing of the eternal counsels of God, in seizing upon one
          man, and letting go another, in neglecting the Jews, and gathering in
          the Gentiles, which appears to us to be results only of an absolute
          dominion, yet he resolves not those amazing acts into that, without
          taking it for granted that they were governed by exact wisdom, though
          beyond his ken to see and his line to sound. “O, the depth of the
          riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how unsearchable are
          his judgments, and his ways past finding out” (Rom. ii. 33)! There are
          some things in matters of state, that may seem to be acts of mere
          will, but if we were acquainted with the arcana imperii, the inward
          engines which moved them, and the ends aimed at in those undertakings,
          we might find a rich vein of prudence in them, to incline us to judge
          otherwise than bare arbitrary proceedings. The other attributes of
          power and goodness are more easily perceptible in the works of God
          than his wisdom. The first view of the creation strikes us with this
          sentiment, that the Author of this great fabric was mighty and
          beneficial; but his wisdom lies deeper than to be discerned at the
          first glance, without a diligent inquiry; as at the first casting our
          eyes upon the sea, we behold its motion, color, and something of its
          vastness, but we cannot presently fathom the depth of it, and
          understand those lower fountains that supply that great ocean of
          waters. It is part of God’s sovereignty, as it is of the wisest
          princes, that he hath a wisdom beyond the reach of his subjects; it is
          not for a finite nature to understand an Infinite Wisdom, nor for a
          foolish creature that hath lost his understanding by the fall, to
          judge of the reason of the methods of a wise Counsellor. Yet those
          actions that savor most of sovereignty, present men with some glances
          of his wisdom. Was it mere will, that he suffered some angels to fall?
          But his wisdom was in it for the manifestation of his justice, as it
          was also in the case of Pharaoh. Was it mere will, that he suffered
          sin to be committed by man? Was not his wisdom in this for the
          discovery of his mercy, which never had been known without that, which
          should render a creature miserable? “He hath concluded them all in
          unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all” (Rom. xi. 32). Though God
          had such an absolute right, to have annihilated the world as soon as
          ever he had made it, yet how had this consisted with his wisdom, to
          have erected a creature after his own image one day, and despised it
          so much the next, as to cashier it from being? What wisdom had it been
          to make a thing only to destroy it; to repent of his work as soon as
          ever it came out of his hands, without any occasion offered by the
          creature? If God be supposed to be Creator, he must be supposed to
          have an end in creation; what end can that be but himself and his own
          glory, the manifestation of the perfections of his nature? What
          perfection could have been discovered in so quick an annihilation, but
          that of his power in creating, and of his sovereignty in snatching
          away the being of his rational creature, before it had laid the
          methods of acting? What wisdom to make a world, and a reasonable
          creature for no use; not to praise and honor him, but to be broken in
          pieces, and destroyed by him?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) His sovereignty is managed according to the rule of
          righteousness. Worldly princes often fancy tyranny and oppression to
          be the chief marks of sovereignty, and think their sceptres not
          beautiful till died in blood, nor the throne secure till established
          upon slain carcasses. But “justice and judgment” are the foundation of
          the throne of God (Ps. lxxxix. 14); alluding perhaps to the supporters
          of arms and thrones, which among princes are the figures of lions,
          emblems of courage, as Solomon had (1 Kings, x. 19). But God makes not
          so much might, as right, the support of his. He sits on a “throne of
          holiness” (Ps. xlvii. 8). As he reigns over the heathens, referring to
          the calling of the Gentiles after the rejecting of the Jews; the
          Psalmist here praising the righteousness of it, as the Apostle had the
          unsearchable wisdom of it (Rom. xi. 33). “In all his ways he is
          righteous” (Ps. cxlv. 17): in his ways of terror as well as those of
          sweetness; in those works wherein little else but that of his
          sovereignty appears to us. It is always linked with his holiness, that
          he will not do by his absolute right anything but what is conformable
          to it: since his dominion is founded upon the excellency of his
          nature, he will not do anything but what is agreeable to it, and
          becoming his other perfections. Though he be an absolute sovereign, he
          is not an arbitrary governor; “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do
          right” (Gen. xviii. 25)? i. e. it is impossible but he should act
          righteously in every punctilio of his government, since his
          righteousness capacitates him to be a judge, not a tyrant, of all the
          earth. The heathen poets represented their chief god Jupiter with
          Themis, or Right, sitting by him upon his throne in all his orders.
          God cannot by his absolute sovereignty command some things, because
          they are directly against unchangeable righteousness; as to command a
          creature to hate or blaspheme the Creator, not to own him nor praise
          him. It would be a manifest unrighteousness to order the creature not
          to own him, upon whom he depends both in its being and well‑being;
          this would be against that natural duty which is indispensably due
          from every rational creature to God. This would be to order him to lay
          aside his reason, while he retains it; to disown him to be the
          Creator, while man remains his creature. This is repugnant to the
          nature of God, and the true nature of the creature; or to exact
          anything of man, but what he had given him a capacity, in his original
          nature, to perform. If any command were above our natural power, it
          would be unrighteous; as to command a man to grasp the globe of the
          earth, to stride over the sea, to lave out the waters of the ocean;
          these things are impossible, and become not the righteousness and
          wisdom of God to enjoin. There can be no obligation on man to an
          impossibility. God had a free dominion over nullity before the
          creation; he could call it out into the being of man and beast, but he
          could not do anything in creation foolishly, because of his infinite
          wisdom; nor could he by the right of his absolute sovereignty make man
          sinful, because of his infinite purity. As it is impossible for him
          not to be sovereign, it is impossible for him to deny his Deity and
          his purity. It is lawful for God to do what he will, but his will
          being ordered by the righteousness of his nature, as infinite as his
          will, he cannot do anything but what is just; and therefore in his
          dealing with men, you find him in Scripture submitting the
          reasonableness and equity of his proceedings to the judgment of his
          depraved creatures, and the inward dictates of their own conscience.
          “And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray
          you, between me and my vineyard” (Isa. v. 3). Though God be the great
          Sovereign of the world, yet he acts not in a way of absolute
          sovereignty. He rules by law; he is a “Lawgiver” as well as a “King”
          (Isa. xxxiii. 22). It had been repugnant to the nature of a rational
          creature to be ruled otherwise; to be governed as a beast, this had
          been to frustrate those faculties of will and understanding which had
          been given him. To conclude this: when we say, God can do this or
          that, or command this or that, his authority is not bounded and
          limited properly. Who can reasonably detract from his almightiness,
          because he cannot do anything which savors of weakness; and what
          detracting is it from his authority, that he cannot do anything
          unseemly for the dignity of his nature? It is rather from the
          infiniteness of his righteousness than the straitness of his
          authority; at most it is but a voluntary bounding his dominion by the
          law of his own holiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) His sovereignty is managed according to the rule of goodness.
          Some potentates there have been in the world, that have loved to suck
          the blood, and drink the tears, of their subjects; that would rule
          more by fear than love; like Clearchus, the tyrant of Heraclea, who
          bore the figure of a thunderbolt instead of a sceptre, and named his
          son Thunder, thereby to tutor him to terrify his subjects.1003 But as
          God’s throne is a throne of holiness, so it is a “throne of grace”
          (Heb. iv. 16), a throne encircled with a rainbow: “In sight like to an
          emerald” (Rev. iv. 23): an emblem of the covenant, that hath the
          pleasantness of a green color, delightful to the eye, betokening
          mercy. Though his nature be infinitely excellent above us, and his
          power infinitely transcendent over us, yet the majesty of his
          government is tempered with an unspeakable goodness. He acts not so
          much as an absolute Lord, as a gracious Sovereign and obliging
          Benefactor. He delights not to make his subjects slaves; exacts not
          from them any servile and fearful, but a generous and cheerful,
          obedience. He requires them not to fear, or worship him so much for
          his power, as his goodness. He requires not of a rational creature
          anything repugnant to the honor, dignity, and principles of such a
          nature; not anything that may shame, disgrace it, and make it weary of
          its own being, and the service it owes to its Sovereign. He draws by
          the cords of a man; his goodness renders his laws as sweet as honey or
          the honey‑comb to an unvitiated palate and a renewed mind. And though
          it be granted he hath a full dispose of his creature, as the potter of
          his vessel, and might by his absolute sovereignty inflict upon an
          innocent an eternal torment, yet his goodness will never permit him to
          use this sovereign right to the hurt of a creature that deserves it
          not. If God should cast an innocent creature into the furnace of his
          wrath, who can question him? But who can think that his goodness will
          do so, since that is as infinite as his authority? As not to punish
          the sinner would be a denial of his justice, so to torment an innocent
          would be a denial of his goodness. A man hath an absolute power over
          his beast, and may take away his life, and put him to a great deal of
          pain; but that moral virtue of pity and tenderness would not permit
          him to use this right, but when it conduceth to some greater good than
          that can be evil; either for the good of man, which is the end of the
          creature, or for the good of the poor beast itself, to rid him of a
          greater misery; none but a savage nature, a disposition to be
          abhorred, would torture a poor beast merely for his pleasure. It is as
          much against the nature of God to punish one eternally, that hath not
          deserved it, as it is to deny himself, and act anything foolishly and
          unbeseeming his other perfections, which render him majestical and
          adorable. To afflict an innocent creature for his own good, or for the
          good of the world, as in the case of the Redeemer, is so far from
          being against goodness, that it is the highest testimony of his tender
          bowels to the sons of men. God, though he be mighty, “withdraws not
          his eyes,” i. e. his tender respect, “from the righteous” (Job, xxxvi.
          5, 7‒10). And if he “bind them in fetters,” it is to “show them their
          transgressions,” and “open their ear to discipline,” and renewing
          commands, in a more sensible strain, “to depart from iniquity.” What
          was said of Fabritius, “You may as soon remove the sun from its
          course, as Fabritius from his honesty,” may be of God: you may as soon
          dash in pieces his throne, as separate his goodness from his
          sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This sovereignty is extensive over all creatures. He rules all, as
          the heavens do over the earth. He is “King of worlds, King of ages,”
          as the word translated “eternal” signifies (1 Tim. i. 17), τῷ δὲ
          βασιλεῖ τῶν αἰώνων: and the same word is so translated (Heb. i. 2),
          “By whom also he made the worlds.” The same word is rendered “worlds”
          (Heb. xi. 3): “The worlds were framed by the Word of God.” God is King
          of ages or worlds, of the invisible world and the sensible; of all
          from the beginning of their creation, of whatsoever is measured by a
          time. It extends over angels and devils, over wicked and good, over
          rational and irrational creatures; all things bow down under his hand;
          nothing can be exempted from him: because there is nothing but was
          extracted by him from nothing into being. All things essentially
          depend upon him; and, therefore, must be essentially subject to him;
          the extent of his dominion flows from the perfection of his essence;
          since his essence is unlimited, his royalty cannot be restrained. His
          authority is as void of any imperfection as his essence is; it reaches
          out to all points of the heaven above, and the earth below. Other
          princes reign in a spot of ground. Every worldly potentate hath the
          confines of his dominions. The Pyrenean mountains divide France from
          Spain, and the Alps, Italy from France. None are called kings
          absolutely, but kings of this or that place. But God is the King; the
          spacious firmament limits not his dominion; if we could suppose him
          bounded by any place, in regard of his presence, yet he could never be
          out of his own dominion; whatsoever he looks upon, wheresoever he
          were, would be under his rule. Earthly kings may step out of their own
          country into the territory of a neighbor prince; and as one leaves his
          country, so he leaves his dominion behind him; but heaven and earth,
          and every particle of both, is the territory of God. “He hath prepared
          his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.”
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The heaven of angels, and other excellent creatures, belong to
          his authority. He is principally called “The Lord of Hosts,” in
          relation to his entire command over the angelical legions: therefore,
          ver. 21, following the text, they are called his “hosts,” and
          “ministers that do his pleasure.” Jacob called him so before (Gen.
          xxxii. 1, 2). When he met the angels of God, he calls them “the host
          of God;” and the Evangelist, long after, calls them so (Luke, ii. 13):
          “A multitude of the heavenly host, praising God;” and all this host he
          commands (Isa. xlv. 12): “My hands have stretched out the heavens, and
          all their host have I commanded.” He employs them all in his service;
          and when he issues out his orders to them to do this or that, he finds
          no resistance of his will. And the inanimate creatures in heaven are
          at his beck; they are his armies in heaven, disposed in an excellent
          order in their several ranks (Ps. cxlvii. 4): “He calls the stars by
          name;” they render a due obedience to him as servants to their master,
          when he singles them out, “and calls them by name,” to do some special
          service; he calls them out to their several offices, as the general of
          an army appoints the station of every regiment in a battalia. Or “he
          calls them by name,” i. e. he imposeth names upon them, a sign of
          dominion: the giving names to the inferior creatures being the first
          act of Adam’s derivative dominion over them. These are under the
          sovereignty of God. The stars, by their influences, fight against
          Sisera (Judges v. 20). And the sun holds in its reins, and stands
          stone still, to light Joshua to a complete victory (Josh. x. 12). They
          are all marshalled in their ranks to receive his word of command, and
          fight in close order, as being desirous to have a share in the ruin of
          the enemies of their Sovereign. And those creatures which mount up
          from the earth, and take their place in the lower heavens, vapors,
          whereof hail and snow are formed, are part of the army, and do not
          only receive, but fulfil, his word of command (Ps. cxlviii. 8). These
          are his stores and magazines of judgment against a time of trouble,
          and “a day of battle and war” (Job xxxviii. 22, 23). The sovereignty
          of God is visible in all their motions, in their going and returning.
          If he says, Go, they go; if he say, Come, they come; if he say, do
          this, they gird up their loins, and stand stiff to their duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The hell of devils belong to his authority. They have cast
          themselves out of the arms of his grace into the furnace of his
          justice; they have, by their revolt, forfeited the treasure of his
          goodness, but cannot exempt themselves from the sceptre of his
          dominion; when they would not own him as a Lord Father, they are under
          him as a Lord Judge; they are cast out of his affection, but not freed
          from his yoke. He rules over the good angels as his subjects, over the
          evil ones as his rebels. In whatsoever relation he stands, either as a
          friend or enemy, he never loses that of a Lord. A prince is the lord
          of his criminals as well as of his loyalest subjects. By this right of
          his sovereignty, he uses them to punish some, and be the occasion of
          benefit to others: on the wicked he employs them as instruments of
          vengeance; towards the godly, as in the case of Job, as an instrument
          of kindness for the manifestation of his sincerity against the
          intention of that malicious executioner. Though the devils are the
          executioners of his justice, it is not by their own authority, but
          God’s; as those that are employed either to rack or execute a
          malefactor, are subjects to the prince not only in the quality of men,
          but in the execution of their function. The devil, by drawing men to
          sin, acquires no right to himself over the sinner: for man by sin
          offends not the devil, but God, and becomes guilty of punishment under
          God.1004 When, therefore, the devil is used by God for the punishment
          of any, it is an act of his sovereignty for the manifestation of the
          order of his justice. And as most nations use the vilest persons in
          offices of execution, so doth God those vile spirits. He doth not
          ordinarily use the good angels in those offices of vengeance, but in
          the preservation of his people. When he would solely punish, he
          employs “evil angels” (Ps. lxxviii. 49), a troop of devils. His
          sovereignty is extended over the “deceiver and the deceived” (Job xii.
          16); over both the malefactor and the executioner, the devil and his
          prisoner. He useth the natural malice of the devils for his own just
          ends, and by his sovereign authority orders them to be the
          executioners of his judgments upon their own vassals, as well as
          sometimes inflicters of punishments upon his own servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The earth of men and other creatures belongs to his authority
          (Ps. xlvii. 7). God is King of “all the earth,” and rules to the
          “ends” of it (Ps. lix. 13). Ancient atheists confined God’s dominion
          to the heavenly orbs, and bounded it within the circuit of the
          celestial sphere (Job, xxii. 14): “He walks in the circuit of heaven,”
          i. e. he exerciseth his dominion only there. Pedum positio was the
          sign of the possession of a piece of land, and the dominion of the
          possessor of it; and land was resigned by such a ceremony, as now, by
          the delivery of a twig or turf.1005 But his dominion extends,
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. Over the least creatures. All the creatures of the earth are
          listed in Christ’s muster‑roll, and make up the number of his
          regiments. He hath an host on earth as well as in heaven (Gen. ii. 1):
          “The heavens and earth were finished, and all the host of them.” And
          they are “all his servants” (Ps. cxiv. 91), and move at his pleasure.
          And he vouchsafes the title of his army to the locust, caterpillar,
          and palmer worm (Joel ii. 25); and describes their motions by military
          words, “climbing the walls, marching, not breaking their ranks” (ver.
          7). He hath the command, as a great general, over the highest angel
          and the meanest worm; all the kinds of the smallest insects he
          presseth for his service. By this sovereignty he muzzled the devouring
          nature of the fire to preserve the three children, and let it loose to
          consume their adversaries; and if he speaks the word, the stormy waves
          are hushed, as if they had no principle of rage within them (Ps.
          lxxxix. 9). Since the meanest creature attains its end, and no arrow
          that God hath by his power shot into the world but hits the mark he
          aimed at, we must conclude, that there is a sovereign hand that
          governs all: not a spot of earth, or air, or water in the world, but
          is his possession; not a creature in any element but is his subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. His dominion extends over men. It extends over the highest
          potentate, as well as the meanest peasant; the proudest monarch is no
          more exempt than the most languishing beggar. He lays not aside his
          authority to please the prince, nor strains it up to terrify the
          indigent. “He accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich
          more than the poor; for they are all the work of his hand” (Job xxxiv.
          19). Both the powers and weaknesses, the gallantry and peasantry of
          the earth, stand and fall at his pleasure. Man, in innocence, was
          under his authority as his creature; and man, in his revolt, is
          further under his authority as a criminal: as a person is under the
          authority of a prince, as a governor, while he obeys his laws; and
          further under the authority of the prince, as a judge, when he
          violates his laws. Man is under God’s dominion in everything, in his
          settlement, in his calling, in the ordering his very habitation (Acts
          xvii. 26): “He determines the bounds of their habitations.” He never
          yet permitted any to be universal monarch in the world, nor over the
          fourth part of it, though several, in the pride of their heart, have
          designed and attempted it: the pope, who hath bid the fairest for it
          in spirituals, never attained it; and when his power was most
          flourishing, there were multitudes that would never acknowledge his
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          3d. But especially this dominion, in the peculiarity of its extent, is
          seen in the exercise of it over the spirits and hearts of men. Earthly
          governors have, by his indulgence, a share with him in a dominion over
          men’s bodies, upon which account he graceth princes and judges with
          the title of “gods” (Ps. lxxxii. 6); but the highest prince is but a
          prince “according to the flesh,” as the apostle calls masters in
          relation to their servants (Col. iii. 22).
        </p>
        <p>
          God is the sovereign; man rules over the beast in man, the body; and
          God rules over the man in man, the soul. It sticks not in the outward
          surface, but pierceth to the inward marrow. It is impossible God
          should be without this; if our wills were independent of him, we were
          in some sort equal with himself, in part gods, as well as creatures.
          It is impossible a creature, either in whole or in part, can be
          exempted from it; since he is the fashioner of hearts as well as of
          bodies. He is the Father of spirits, and therefore hath the right of a
          paternal dominion over them. When he established man lord of the other
          creatures, he did not strip himself of the propriety; and when he made
          man a free agent, and lord of the acts of his will, he did not divest
          himself of the sovereignty. His sovereignty is seen,
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] In gifting the spirits of men. Earthly magistrates have hands too
          short to inspire the hearts of their subjects with worthy sentiments:
          when they confer an employment, they are not able to convey an ability
          with it fit for the station: they may as soon frame a statue of liquid
          water, and gild, or paint it over with the costliest colors, as impart
          to any a state‑head for a state‑ministry. But when God chooseth a Saul
          from so mean an employment as seeking of asses, he can treasure up in
          him a spirit fit for government; and fire David, in age a stripling,
          and by education a shepherd, with courage to encounter, and skill to
          defeat, a massy Goliath. And when he designs a person for glory, to
          stand before his throne, he can put a new and a royal spirit into him
          (Ezek. xxxvi. 26). God only can infuse habits into the soul, to
          capacitate it to act nobly and generously.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] His sovereignty is seen in regard of the inclinations of men’s
          wills. No creature can immediately work upon the will, to guide it to
          what point he pleaseth, though mediately it may, by proposing reasons
          which may master the understanding, and thereby determine the will.
          But God bows the hearts of men, by the efficacy of his dominion, to
          what centre he pleaseth. When the more overweaning sort of men, that
          thought their own heads as fit for a crown as Saul’s, scornfully
          despised him; yet God touched the hearts of a band of men to follow
          and adhere to him (1 Sam. x. 26, 27). When the anti‑christian whore
          shall be ripe for destruction, God shall “put it into the heart” of
          the ten horns or kings, “to hate the whore, burn her with fire, and
          fulfil his will” (Rev. xvii. 16, 17). He “fashions the hearts” alike,
          and tunes one string to answer another, and both to answer his own
          design (Ps. xxxiii. 15). And while men seem to gratify their own
          ambition and malice, they execute the will of God, by his secret touch
          upon their spirits, guiding their inclinations to serve the glorious
          manifestation of truth. While the Jews would, in a reproachful
          disgrace to Christ, crucify two thieves with him, to render him more
          incapable to have any followers, they accomplished a prophecy, and
          brought to light a mark of the Messiah, whereby he had been
          charactered in one of their prophets, that he should be “numbered
          among transgressors” (Isa. liii. 12). He can make a man of not
          willing, willing; the wills of all men are in his hand; i. e. under
          the power of his sceptre, to retain or let go upon this or that
          errand, to bend this or that way; as water is carried by pipes to what
          house or place the owner of it is pleased to order. “The king’s heart
          is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of waters; he turns it
          whithersoever he will” (Prov. xxi. 1) without any limitation. He
          speaks of the heart of princes; because, in regard of their height,
          they seem to be more absolute, and impetuous as waters; yet God holds
          them in his hand, under his dominion; turns them to acts of clemency
          or severity, like waters, either to overflow and damage, or to refresh
          and fructify. He can convey a spirit to them, or “cut it off” from
          them (Ps. lxxvi. 12). It is with reference to his efficacious power,
          in graciously turning the heart of Paul, that the apostle breaks off
          his discourse of the story of his conversion, and breaks out into a
          magnifying and glorifying of God’s dominion. “Now unto the King
          eternal,” &amp;c. “be honor and glory forever and ever” (1 Tim. i.
          17). Our hearts are more subject to the Divine sovereignty than our
          members in their motions are subject to our own wills. As we can move
          our hand east or west to any quarter of the world, so can God bend our
          wills to what mark he pleases. The second cause in every motion
          depends upon the first; and that will, being a second cause, may be
          furthered or hindered in its inclinations or executions by God; he can
          bend or unbend it, and change it from one actual inclination to
          another. It is as much under his authority and power to move, or
          hinder, as the vast engine of the heavens is in its motion or standing
          still, which he can affect by a word. The work depends upon the
          workman; the clock upon the artificer for the motions of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] His dominion is seen in regard of terror or comfort. The heart or
          conscience is God’s special throne on earth, which he hath reserved to
          himself, and never indulged human authority to sit upon it. He solely
          orders this in ways of conviction or comfort. He can flash terror into
          men’s spirits in the midst of their earthly jollities, and put death
          into the pot of conscience, when they are boiling up themselves in a
          high pitch of worldly delights, and can raise men’s spirits above the
          sense of torment under racks and flames. He can draw a hand‑writing
          not only in the outward chamber, but the inward closet; bring the rack
          into the inwards of a man. None can infuse comfort when he writes
          bitter things, nor can any fill the heart with gall, when he drops in
          honey. Men may order outward duties, but they cannot unlock the
          conscience, and constrain men to think them duties which they are
          forced, by human laws, outwardly to act: and as the laws of earthly
          princes are bounded by the outward man, so do their executions and
          punishments reach no further than the case of the body: but God can
          run upon the inward man, as a giant, and inflict wounds and gashes
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is an eternal dominion. In regard of the exercise of it, it was
          not from eternity, because there was not from eternity any creature
          under the government of it; but in regard of the foundation of it, his
          essence, his excellency, it is eternal; as God was from eternity
          almighty, but there was no exercise or manifestation of it till he
          began to create. Men are kings only for a time; their lives expire
          like a lamp, and their dominion is extinguished with their lives; they
          hand their empire by succession to others, but many times it is
          snapped off before they are cold in their graves. How are the famous
          empires of the Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, and Greeks, mouldered away,
          and their place knows them no more! and how are the wings of the Roman
          eagle cut, and that empire which overspread a great part of the world,
          hath lost most of its feathers, and is confined to a narrower compass!
          The dominion of God flourisheth from one generation to another: “He
          sits King forever” (Ps. xxix. 10). His “session” signifies the
          establishment, and “forever” the duration; and he “sits now,” his
          sovereignty is as absolute, as powerful as ever. How many lords and
          princes hath this or that kingdom had! in how many families hath the
          sceptre lodged! when as God hath had an uninterrupted dominion; as he
          hath been always the same in his essence, he hath been always glorious
          in his sovereignty: among men, he that is lord to‑day, may be stripped
          of it to‑morrow; the dominions in the world vary; he that is a prince
          may see his royalty upon the wings, and feel himself laden with
          fetters; and a prisoner may be “lifted from his dungeon” to a throne.
          But there can be no diminution of God’s government; “His throne is
          from generation to generation” (Lam. v. 19); it cannot be shaken: his
          sceptre, like Aaron’s rod, is always green; it cannot be wrested out
          of his hands; none raised him to it, none therefore can depose him
          from it; it bears the same splendor in all human affairs; he is an
          eternal, an “immortal King” (1 Tim. i. 17); as he is eternally mighty,
          so he is eternally sovereign; and, being an eternal King, he is a King
          that gives not a momentary and perishing, but a durable and
          everlasting life, to them that obey him: a durable and eternal
          punishment to them that resist him.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Wherein this dominion and sovereign consists, and how it is
          manifested.
        </p>
        <p>
          First. The first act of sovereignty is the making laws. This is
          essential to God; no creature’s will can be the first rule to the
          creature, but only the will of God: he only can prescribe man his
          duty, and establish the rule of it; hence the law is called “the royal
          law” (James ii. 8): it being the first and clearest manifestation of
          sovereignty, as the power of legislation is of the authority of a
          prince. Both are joined together in Isa. liii. 22: “The Lord is our
          Lawgiver; the Lord is our King;” legislative power being the great
          mark of royalty. God, as King, enacts his laws by his own proper
          authority, and his law is a declaration of his own sovereignty, and of
          men’s moral subjection to him, and dependence on him. His sovereignty
          doth not appear so much in his promises as in his precepts: a man’s
          power over another is not discovered by promising, for a promise doth
          not suppose the promiser either superior or inferior to the person to
          whom the promise is made.1006 It is not an exercising authority over
          another, but over a man’s self; no man forceth another to the
          acceptance of his promise, but only proposeth and encourageth to an
          embracing of it. But commanding supposeth always an authority in the
          person giving the precept; it obligeth the person to whom the command
          is directed; a promise obligeth the person by whom the promise is
          made. God, by his command, binds the creature; by his promise he binds
          himself; he stoops below his sovereignty, to lay obligations upon his
          own majesty; by a precept he binds the creature, by a promise he
          encourageth the creature to an observance of his precept: what laws
          God makes, man is bound, by virtue of his creation, to observe; that
          respects the sovereignty of God: what promises God makes, man is bound
          to believe; but that respects the faithfulness of God. God manifested
          his dominion more to the Jews than to any other people in the world;
          he was their Lawgiver, both as they were a church and a commonwealth:
          as a church, he gave them ceremonial laws for the regulating their
          worship; as a state, he gave them judicial laws for the ordering their
          civil affairs; and as both, he gave them moral laws, upon which both
          the laws of the church and state were founded. This dominion of God,
          in this regard, will be manifest,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) In the supremacy of it. The sole power of making laws doth
          originally reside in him (James iv. 12); “There is one Lawgiver, who
          is able to save, and to destroy.” By his own law he judges of the
          eternal states of men, and no law of man is obligatory, but as it is
          agreeable to the laws of this supreme Lawgiver, and pursuant to his
          righteous rules for the government of the world. The power that the
          potentates of the world have to make laws is but derivative from God.
          If their dominion be from him, as it is, for “by him kings reign”
          (Prov. viii. 15), their legislative power, which is a prime flower of
          their sovereignty, is derived from him also: and the apostle resolves
          it into this original when he orders us to be “subject to the higher
          powers, not only for wrath, but for conscience sake” (Rom. xiii. 5).
          Conscience, in its operations, solely respects God; and therefore,
          when it is exercised as the principle of obedience to the laws of men,
          it is not with respect to them, singly considered, but as the majesty
          of God appears in their station and in their decrees. This power of
          giving laws was acknowledged by the heathen to be solely in God by way
          of original; and therefore the greatest lawgivers among the heathen
          pretended their laws to be received from some deity or supernatural
          power, by special revelation: now, whether they did this seriously,
          acknowledging themselves this part of the dominion of God,—for it is
          certain that whatsoever just orders were issued out by princes in the
          world, was by the secret influence of God upon their spirits (Prov.
          viii. 15): “By me princes decree justice;” by the secret conduct of
          Divine wisdom,—or whether they pretended it only as a public engine,
          to enforce upon people the observance of their decrees, and gain a
          greater credit to their edicts, yet this will result from it, that the
          people in general entertained this common notion, that God was the
          great Lawgiver of the world. The first founders of their societies
          could never else have so absolutely gained upon them by such a
          pretence. There was always a revelation of a law from the mouth of God
          in every age: the exhortation of Eliphaz to Job (Job xxii. 22), of
          receiving a “law from the mouth” of God, at the time before the moral
          law was published, had been a vain exhortation had there been no
          revelation of the mind of God in all ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The dominion of God is manifest in the extent of his laws. As he
          is the Governor and Sovereign of the whole world, so he enacts laws
          for the whole world. One prince cannot make laws for another, unless
          he makes him his subject by right of conquest; Spain cannot make laws
          for England, or England for Spain; but God having the supreme
          government, as King over all, is a Lawgiver to all, to irrational, as
          well as rational creatures. The “heavens have their ordinances” (Job
          xxxviii. 33); all creatures have a law imprinted on their beings;
          rational creatures have Divine statutes copied in their heart: for
          men, it is clear (Rom. ii. 14), every son of Adam, at his coming into
          the world, brings with him a law in his nature, and when reason clears
          itself up from the clouds of sense, he can make some difference
          between good and evil; discern something of fit and just. Every man
          finds a law within him that checks him if he offends it: none are
          without a legal indictment and a legal executioner within them; God or
          none was the Author of this as a sovereign Lord, in establishing a law
          in man at the same time, wherein, as an Almighty Creator, he imparted
          a being. This law proceeds from God’s general power of governing, as
          he is the Author of nature, and binds not barely as it is the reason
          of man, but by the authority of God, as it is a law engraven on his
          conscience: and no doubt but a law was given to the angels; God did
          not govern those intellectual creatures as he doth brutes, and in a
          way inferior to his rule of man. Some sinned; all might have sinned in
          regard to the changeableness of their nature. Sin cannot be but
          against some rule; “where there is no law, there is no transgression;”
          what that law was is not revealed; but certainly it must be the same
          in part with the moral law, so far as it agreed with their spiritual
          natures; a love to God, a worship of him, and a love to one another in
          their societies and persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) The dominion of God is manifest in the reason of some laws, which
          seem to be nothing else than purely his own will. Some laws there are
          for which a reason may be rendered from the nature of the thing
          enjoined, as to love, honor, and worship God: for others, none but
          this, God will have it so: such was that positive law to Adam of “not
          eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil” (Gen. ii. 17), which
          was merely an asserting his own dominion, and was different from that
          law of nature God had written in his heart. No other reason of this
          seems to us, but a resolve to try man’s obedience in a way of absolute
          sovereignty, and to manifest his right over all creatures, to reserve
          what he pleased to himself, and permit the use of what he pleased to
          man, and to signify to man that he was to depend on him, who was his
          Lord, and not on his own will. There was no more hurt in itself, for
          Adam to have eaten of that, than of any other in the garden; the fruit
          was pleasant to the eye, and good for food; but God would show the
          right he had over his own goods, and his authority over man, to
          reserve what he pleases of his own creation from his touch; and since
          man could not claim a propriety in anything, he was to meddle with
          nothing but by the leave of his Sovereign, either discovered by a
          special or general license. Thus God showed himself the Lord of man,
          and that man was but his steward, to act by his orders. If God had
          forbidden man the use of more trees in the garden, his command had
          been just; since, as a sovereign Lord, he might dispose of his own
          goods; and when he had granted him the whole compass of that pleasant
          garden, and the whole world round about for him and his posterity, it
          was a more tolerable exercise of his dominion to reserve this “one
          tree,” as a mark of his sovereignty, when he had left “all others” to
          the use of Adam. He reserved nothing to himself, as Lord of the manor,
          but this; and Adam was prohibited nothing else but this one, as a sign
          of his subjection. Now for this no reason can be rendered by any man
          but merely the will of God; this was merely a fruit of his dominion.
          For the moral laws a reason may be rendered; to love God hath reason
          to enforce it besides God’s will; viz., the excellency of his nature,
          and the greatness and multitudes of his benefits. To love our neighbor
          hath enforcing reasons; viz., the conjunction in blood, the
          preservation of human society, and the need we may stand in of their
          love ourselves: but no reason can be assigned of this positive command
          about the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but the pleasure of God.
          It was a branch of his pure dominion to but merely the pleasure of
          God. It was a branch of his pure dominion to try man’s obedience, and
          a mark of his goodness to try it by so and light a precept, when he
          might have extended his authority further. Had not God given this or
          the like order, his absolute dominion had not been so conspicuous. It
          is true, Adam had a law of nature in him, whereby he was obliged to
          perpetual obedience; and though it was a part of God’s dominion to
          implant it in him, yet his supreme dominion over the creatures had not
          been so visible to man but by this, or a precept of the same kind.
          What was commanded or prohibited by the law of nature, did bespeak a
          comeliness in itself, it appeared good or evil to the reason of man;
          but this was neither good nor evil in itself, it received its sole
          authority from the absolute will of God, and nothing could result from
          the fruit itself, as a reason why man should not taste it, but only
          the sole will of God. And as God’s dominion was most conspicuous in
          this precept, so man’s obedience had been most eminent in observing
          it: for in his obedience to it, nothing but the sole power and
          authority of God, which is the proper rule of obedience, could have
          been respected, not any reason from the thing itself. To this we may
          refer some other commands, as that of appointing the time of solemn
          and public worship, the seventh day; though the worship of God be a
          part of the law of nature, yet the appointing a particular day,
          wherein he would be more formally and solemnly acknowledged than on
          other days, was grounded upon his absolute right of legislation: for
          there was nothing in the time itself that could render that day more
          holy than another, though God respected his “finishing the work of
          creation” in his institution of that day (Gen. ii. 3). Such were the
          ceremonial commands of sacrifices and washings under the law, and the
          commands of sacraments under the gospel: the one to last till the
          first coming of Christ and his passion; the other to last till the
          second coming of Christ and his triumph. Thus he made natural and
          unavoidable uncleannesses to be sins, and the touching a dead body to
          be pollution, which in their own nature were not so.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) The dominion of God appears in the moral law, and his majesty in
          publishing it. As the law of nature was writ by his own fingers in the
          nature of man, so it was engraven by his own finger in the “tables of
          stone” (Exod. xxxi. 18), which is very emphatically expressed to be a
          mark of God’s dominion. “And the tables were the work of God, and the
          writing was the writing of God engraven upon the tables” (Exod. xxxii.
          16); and when the first tables were broken, though he orders Moses to
          frame the tables, yet the writing of the law he reserves to himself
          (Exod. xxxiv. 1). It is not said of any part of the Scripture, that it
          was writ by the finger of God, but only of the Decalogue: herein he
          would have his sovereignty eminently appear; it was published by God
          in state, with a numerous attendance of his heavenly militia (Deut.
          xxxii. 2); and the artillery of heaven was shot off at the solemnity;
          and therefore it is called a fiery law, coming from his right hand, i.
          e. his sovereign power. It was published with all the marks of supreme
          majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) The dominion of God appears in the obligation of the law, which
          reacheth the conscience. The laws of every prince are framed for the
          outward conditions of men; they do not by their authority bind the
          conscience; and what obligations do result from them upon the
          conscience, is either from their being the same immediately with
          Divine laws, or as they are according to the just power of the
          magistrate, founded on the law of God. Conscience hath a protection
          from the King of kings, and cannot be arrested by any human power. God
          hath given man but an authority over half the man, and the worst half
          too, that which is of an earthly original; but reserved the authority
          over the better and more heavenly half to himself. The dominion of
          earthly princes extends only to the bodies of men; they have no
          authority over the soul, their punishment and rewards cannot reach it:
          and therefore their laws, by their single authority, cannot bind it,
          but as they are coincident with the law of God, or as the equity of
          them is subservient to the preservation of human society, a regular
          and righteous thing, which is the divine end in government; and so
          they bind, as they have relation to God as the supreme magistrate. The
          conscience is only intelligible to God in its secret motions, and
          therefore only guidable by God; God only pierceth into the conscience
          by his eye, and therefore only can conduct it by his rule. Man cannot
          tell whether we embrace this law in our heart and consciences, or only
          in appearance; “He only can judge it” (Luke xii. 3, 4), and therefore
          he only can impose laws upon it; it is out of the reach of human penal
          authority, if their laws be transgressed inwardly by it. Conscience is
          a book in some sort as sacred as the Scripture; no addition can be
          lawfully made to it, no subtraction from it. Men cannot diminish the
          duty of conscience, or raze out the law God hath stamped upon it. They
          cannot put a supersedeas to the writ of conscience, or stop its mouth
          with a noli prosequi. They can make no addition by their authority to
          bind it; it is a flower in the crown of Divine sovereignty only.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. His sovereignty appears in a power of dispensing with his own laws.
          It is as much a part of his dominion to dispense with his laws, as to
          enjoin them; he only hath the power of relaxing his own right, no
          creature hath power to do it; that would be to usurp a superiority
          over him, and order above God himself. Repealing or dispensing with
          the law is a branch of royal authority. It is true, God will never
          dispense with those moral laws which have an eternal reason in
          themselves and their own nature; as for a creature to fear, love, and
          honor God; this would be to dispense with his own holiness, and the
          righteousness of his nature, to sully the purity of his own dominion;
          it would write folly upon the first creation of man after the image of
          God, by writing mutability upon himself, in framing himself after the
          corrupted image of man; it would null and frustrate the excellency of
          the creature, wherein the image of God mostly shines; nay, it would be
          to dispense with a creature’s being a Creator, and make him
          independent upon the Sovereign of the world in moral obedience. But
          God hath a right to dispense with the ordinary laws of nature in the
          inferior creatures; he hath a power to alter their course by an arrest
          of miracles, and make them come short, or go beyond his ordinances
          established for them. He hath a right to make the sun stand still, or
          move backward; to bind up the womb of the earth, and bar the
          influences of the clouds; bridle in the rage of the fire, and the fury
          of lions; make the liquid waters stand like a wall, or pull up the
          dam, which he hath set to the sea, and command it to overflow the
          neighboring countries: he can dispense with the natural laws of the
          whole creation, and strain everything beyond its ordinary pitch.
          Positive laws he hath reversed; as the ceremonial law given to the
          Jews. The very nature, indeed, of that law required a repeal, and fell
          of course; when that which was intended by it was come, it was of no
          longer significancy; as before it was a useful shadow, it would
          afterwards have been an empty one: had not God took away this,
          Christianity had not, in all likelihood, been propagated among the
          Gentiles. This was the “partition wall between Jews and Gentiles”
          (Eph. xii. 14); which made them a distinct family from all the world,
          and was the occasion of the enmity of the Gentiles against the Jews.
          When God had, by bringing in what was signified by those rites,
          declared his decree for the ceasing of them; and when the Jews, fond
          of those Divine institutions, would not allow him the right of
          repealing what he had the authority of enacting; he resolved, for the
          asserting his dominion, to bury them in the ruins of the temple and
          city, and make them forever incapable of practising the main and
          essential parts of them; for the temple being the pillar of the legal
          service, by demolishing that, God hath taken away their rights of
          sacrificing, it being peculiarly annexed to that place; they have no
          altar dignified with a fire from heaven to consume their sacrifices,
          no legal high‑priest to offer them. God hath by his providence changed
          his own law as well as by his precept; yea, he hath gone higher, by
          virtue of his sovereignty, and changed the whole scene and methods of
          his government after the fall, from King Creator to King Redeemer. He
          hath revoked the law of works as a covenant; released the penalty of
          it from the believing sinner, by transferring it upon the Surety, who
          interposed himself by his own will and Divine designation. He hath
          established another covenant upon other promises in a higher root,
          with greater privileges, and easier terms. Had not God had this right
          of sovereignty, not a man of Adam’s posterity could have been blessed;
          he and they must have lain groaning under the misery of the fall,
          which had rendered both himself and all in his loins unable to observe
          the terms of the first covenant. He hath, as some speak, dispensed
          with his own moral law in some cases; in commanding Abraham to
          sacrifice his son, his only son, a righteous son, a son whereof he had
          the promise, that “in Isaac should his seed be called;” yet he was
          commanded to sacrifice him by the right of his absolute sovereignty as
          the supreme Lord of the lives of his creatures, from the highest angel
          to the lowest worm, whereby he bound his subjects to this law, not
          himself. Our lives are due to him when he calls for them, and they are
          a just forfeit to him, at the very moment we sin, at the very moment
          we come into the world, by reason of the venom of our nature against
          him, and the disturbance the first sin of man (whereof we are
          inheritors) gave to his glory. Had Abraham sacrificed his son of his
          own head, he had sinned, yea, in attempting it; but being authorized
          from heaven, his act was obedience to the Sovereign of the world, who
          had a power to dispense with his own law; and with this law he had
          before dispensed, in the case of Cain’s murder of Abel, as to the
          immediate punishment of it with death, which, indeed, was settled
          afterwards by his authority, but then omitted because of the paucity
          of men, and for the peopling the world; but settled afterwards, when
          there was almost, though not altogether, the like occasion of omitting
          it for a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. His sovereignty appears in punishing the transgression of his law.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) This is a branch of God’s dominion as lawgiver. So was the
          vengeance God would take upon the Amalekites (Exod. xvii. 16): “The
          Lord hath sworn, that the Lord will have war;” the Hebrew is, “The
          hand upon the throne of the Lord,” as in the margin: as a “lawgiver”
          he “saves or destroys” (James iv. 12). He acts according to his own
          law, in a congruity to the sanction of his own precepts; though he be
          an arbitrary lawgiver, appointing what laws he pleases, yet he is not
          an arbitrary judge. As he commands nothing but what he hath a right to
          command, so he punisheth none but whom he hath a right to punish, and
          with such punishment as the law hath denounced. All his acts of
          justice and inflictions of curses are the effects of this sovereign
          dominion (Ps. xxix. 10): “He sits King upon the floods;” upon the
          deluge of waters wherewith he drowned the world, say some. It is a
          right belonging to the authority of magistrates to pull up the
          infectious weeds that corrupt a commonwealth; it is no less the right
          of God, as the lawgiver and judge of all the earth, to subject
          criminals to his vengeance, after they have rendered themselves
          abominable in his eyes, and carried themselves unworthy subjects of so
          great and glorious a King. The first name whereby God is made known in
          Scripture, is Elohim (Gen. i. 1): “In the beginning God created the
          heaven and earth;” a name which signifies his power of judging, in the
          opinion of some critics; from him it is derived to earthly
          magistrates; their judgment is said, therefore, to be the “judgment of
          God” (Deut. i. 17). When Christ came, he proposed this great motive of
          repentance from the “kingdom of heaven being at hand;” the kingdom of
          his grace, whereby to invite men; the kingdom of his justice in the
          punishment of the neglecters of it, whereby to terrify men.
          Punishments as well as rewards belong to royalty; it issued
          accordingly; those that believed and repented came under his gracious
          sceptre, those that neglected and rejected it fell under his iron rod;
          Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple demolished, the inhabitants lost
          their lives by the edge of the sword, or lingered them out in the
          chains of a miserable captivity. This term of “judge,” which signifies
          a sovereign right to govern and punish delinquents, Abraham gives him,
          when he came to root out the people of Sodom, and make them the
          examples of his vengeance (Gen. xviii. 25).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Punishing the transgressions of his law. This is a necessary
          branch of dominion. His sovereignty in making laws would be a trifle,
          if there were not also an authority to vindicate those laws from
          contempt and injury; he would be a Lord only spurned at by rebels.
          Sovereignty is not preserved without justice. When the Psalmist speaks
          of the majesty of God’s kingdom, he tells us, that “righteousness and
          judgment are the habitation of his throne” (Ps. xcvii. 1, 2). These
          are the engines of Divine dignity which render him glorious and
          majestic. A legislative power would be trampled on without executive;
          by this the reverential apprehensions of God are preserved in the
          world. He is known to be Lord of the world “by the judgments which he
          executes” (Ps. ix. 16). When he seems to have lost his dominion, or
          given it up in the world, he recovers it by punishment. When he takes
          some away “with a whirlwind, and in his wrath,” the natural
          consequence men make of it, is this: “Surely there is a God that
          judgeth the earth” (Ps. lviii. 9, 11). He reduceth the creature, by
          the lash of his judgments, that would not acknowledge his authority in
          his precepts. Those sins which disown his government in the heart and
          conscience, as pride, inward blasphemy, &amp;c., he hath reserved a
          time hereafter to reckon for. He doth not presently shoot his arrows
          into the marrow of every delinquent, but those sins which traduce his
          government of the world, and tear up the foundations of human
          converse, and a public respect to him, he reckons with particularly
          here, as well as hereafter, that the life of his sovereignty might not
          always faint in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) This of punishing was the second discovery of his dominion in the
          world. His first act of sovereignty was the giving a law; the next,
          his appearance in the state of a judge. When his orders were violated,
          he rescues the honor of them by an execution of justice. He first
          judged the angels, punishing the evil ones for their crime: the first
          court he kept among them as a governor, was to give them a law; the
          second court he kept was as a judge trying the delinquents, and
          adjudging the offenders to be “reserved in chains of darkness” till
          the final execution (Jude 6); and, at the same time probably, he
          confirmed the good ones in their obedience by grace. So the first
          discovery of his dominion to man, was the giving him a precept, the
          next was the inflicting a punishment for the breach of it. He summons
          Adam to the bar, indicts him for his crime, finds him guilty by his
          own confession, and passeth sentence on him, according to the rule he
          had before acquainted him with.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) The means whereby he punisheth shows his dominion. Sometimes he
          musters up hail and mildew; sometimes he sends regiments of wild
          beasts; so he threatens Israel (Lev. xxvi. 22). Sometimes he sends out
          a party of angels to beat up the quarters of men, and make a carnage
          among them (2 Kings xix. 35). Sometimes he mounts his thundering
          battery, and shoots forth his ammunition from the clouds, as against
          the Philistines (1 Sam. vii. 10). Sometimes he sends the slightest
          creatures to shame the pride and punish the sin of man, as “lice,
          frogs, locusts,” as upon the Egyptians (Exod. viii.‒x.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. This dominion it manifested by God as a proprietor and Lord
          of his creatures and his own goods. And this is evident,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the choice of some persons from eternity. He hath set apart some
          from eternity, wherein he will display the invincible efficacy of his
          grace, and thereby infallibly bring them to the fruition of glory
          (Eph. i. 4, 5): “According as he hath chosen us in him before the
          foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame
          before him in love, having predestinated us to the adoption of
          children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of
          his will.” Why doth he write some names in the “book of life,” and
          leave out others? Why doth he enrol some, whom he intends to make
          denizens of heaven, and refuse to put others in his register? The
          apostle tells us, it is the pleasure of his will. You may render a
          reason for many of God’s actions, till you come to this, the top and
          foundation of all; and under what head of reason can man reduce this
          act but to that of his royal prerogative? Why doth God save some, and
          condemn others at last? because of the faith of the one, and unbelief
          of the other. Why do some men believe? because God hath not only given
          them the means of grace, but accompanied those means with the efficacy
          of his Spirit. Why did God accompany those means with the efficacy of
          his Spirit in some, and not in others? because he had decreed by grace
          to prepare them for glory. But why did he decree, or choose some, and
          not others? Into what will you resolve this but into his sovereign
          pleasure? Salvation and condemnation at the last upshot, are acts of
          God as the Judge, conformable to his own law of giving life to
          believers, and inflicting death upon unbelievers; for those a reason
          may be rendered; but the choice of some, and preterition of others, is
          an act of God as he is a sovereign monarch, before any law was
          actually transgressed, because not actually given. When a prince
          redeems a rebel, he acts as a judge according to law; but when he
          calls some out to pardon, he acts as a sovereign by a prerogative
          above law; into this the apostle resolves it (Rom. ix. 13, 15). When
          he speaks of God’s loving Jacob and hating Esau, and that before they
          had done either good or evil, it is, “because God will have mercy on
          whom he will have mercy, and compassion on whom he will have
          compassion.” Though the first scope of the apostle, in the beginning
          of the chapter, was to declare the reason of God’s rejecting the Jews,
          and calling in the Gentiles; had he only intended to demolish the
          pride of the Jews, and flat their opinion of merit, and aimed no
          higher than that providential act of God; he might, convincingly
          enough to the reason of men, have argued from the justice of God,
          provoked by the obstinacy of the Jews, and not have had recourse to
          his absolute will; but, since he asserts this latter, the strength of
          his argument seems to lie thus: if God by his absolute sovereignty may
          resolve, and fix his love upon Jacob and estrange it from Esau, or any
          other of his creatures, before they have done good or evil, and man
          have no ground to call his infinite majesty to account, may he not
          deal thus with the Jews, when their demerit would be a bar to any
          complaints of the creature against him?1007 If God were considered
          here in the quality of a judge, it had been fit to have considered the
          matter of fact in the criminal; but he is considered as a sovereign,
          rendering no other reason of his action but his own will; “whom he
          will he hardens” (ver. 18). And then the apostle concludes (ver. 20),
          “Who art thou, O man, that repliest against God?” If the reason drawn
          from God’s sovereignty doth not satisfy in this inquiry, no other
          reason can be found wherein to acquiesce: for the last condemnation
          there will be sufficient reason to clear the justice of his
          proceedings. But, in this case of election, no other reason but what
          is alleged, viz., the will of God, can be thought of, but what is
          liable to such knotty exceptions that cannot well be untied.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It could not be any merit in the creature that might determine
          God to choose him. If the decree of election falls not under the merit
          of Christ’s passion, as the procuring cause, it cannot fall under the
          merit of any part of the corrupted mass. The decree of sending Christ
          did not precede, but followed, in order of nature, the determination
          of choosing some. When men were chosen as the subjects for glory,
          Christ was chosen as the means for the bringing them to glory (Eph. i.
          4): “Chosen us in him, and predestinated us to the adoption of
          children by Jesus Christ.” The choice was not merely in Christ as the
          moving cause; that the apostle asserts to be “the good pleasure of his
          will;” but in Christ, as the means of conveying to the chosen ones the
          fruits of their election. What could there be in any man that could
          invite God to this act, or be a cause of distinction of one branch of
          Adam from another? Were they not all hewed out of the same rock, and
          tainted with the same corruption in blood? Had it been possible to
          invest them with a power of merit at the first, had not that venom,
          contracted in their nature, degraded all of power for the future? What
          merit was there in any but of wrathful punishment, since they were all
          considered as criminals, and the cursed brood of an ungrateful rebel?
          What dignity can there be in the nature of the purest part of clay, to
          be made a vessel of honor, more than in another part of clay, as pure
          as that which was formed into a vessel for mean and sordid use? What
          had any one to move his mercy more than another, since they were all
          children of wrath, and equally daubed with original guilt and filth?
          Had not all an equal proportion of it to provoke his justice? What
          merit is there in one dry bone more than another, to be inspired with
          the breath of a spiritual life? Did not all lie wallowing in their own
          filthy blood? and what could the steam and noisomeness of that deserve
          at the hands of a pure Majesty, but to be cast into a sink furthest
          from his sight? Were they not all considered in this deplorable
          posture, with an equal proportion of poison in their nature, when God
          first took his pen, and singled out some names to write in the book of
          life? It could not be merit in any one piece of this abominable mass,
          that should stir up that resolution in God to set apart this person
          for a vessel of glory, while he permitted another to putrefy in his
          own gore. He loved Jacob, and hated Esau, though they were both parts
          of the common mass, the seed of the same loins, and lodged in the same
          womb.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Nor could it be any foresight of works to be done in time by
          them, or of faith, that might determine God to choose them. What good
          could he foresee resulting from extreme corruption, and a nature
          alienated from him? What could he foresee of good to be done by them,
          but what he resolved in his own will, to bestow an ability upon them
          to bring forth? His choice of them was to a holiness, not for a
          holiness preceding his determination (Eph. i. 4). He hath chosen us,
          “that we might be holy” before him; he ordained us “to good works,”
          not for them (Eph. ii. 10). What is a fruit cannot be a moving cause
          of that whereof it is a fruit: grace is a stream from the spring of
          electing love; the branch is not the cause of the root, but the root
          of the branch; nor the stream the cause of the spring, but the spring
          the cause of the stream. Good works suppose grace, and a good and
          right habit in the person, as rational acts suppose reason. Can any
          man say that the rational acts man performs after his creation were a
          cause why God created him? This would make creation, and everything
          else, not so much an act of his will, as an act of his understanding.
          God foresaw no rational act in man, before the act of his will to give
          him reason; nor foresees faith in any, before the act of his will
          determining to give him faith: “Faith is the gift of God” (Eph. ii.
          8). In the salvation which grows up from this first purpose of God, he
          regards not the works we have done, as a principal motive to settle
          the top‑stone of our happiness, but his own purpose, and the grace
          given in Christ; “who hath saved us, and called us with a holy
          calling, not according to our own works, but according to his own
          purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ, before the world
          began” (2 Tim. i. 9). The honor of our salvation cannot be challenged
          by our works, much less the honor of the foundation of it. It was a
          pure gift of grace, without any respect to any spiritual, much less
          natural, perfection. Why should the apostle mention that circumstance,
          when he speaks of God’s loving Jacob, and hating Esau, “when neither
          of them had done good or evil” (Rom. ix. 11), if there were any
          foresight of men’s works as the moving cause of his love or hatred?
          God regarded not the works of either as the first cause of his choice,
          but acted by his own liberty, without respect to any of their actions
          which were to be done by them in time. If faith be the fruit of
          election, the prescience of faith doth not influence the electing act
          of God. It is called “the faith of God’s elect” (Tit. i. 1): “Paul, an
          apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect;” i. e.
          settled in this office to bring the elect of God to faith. If men be
          chosen by God upon the foresight of faith, or not chosen till they
          have faith, they are not so much God’s elect, as God their elect; they
          choose God by faith, before God chooseth them by love: it had not been
          the faith of God’s elect, i. e. of those already chosen, but the faith
          of those that were to be chosen by God afterwards. Election is the
          cause of faith, and not faith the cause of election; fire is the cause
          of heat, and not the heat of fire; the sun is the cause of the day,
          and not the day the cause of the rising of the sun. Men are not chosen
          because they believe, but they believe because they are chosen: the
          apostle did ill, else, to appropriate that to the elect which they had
          no more interest in, by virtue of their election, than the veriest
          reprobate in the world.1008 If the foresight of what works might be
          done by his creatures was the motive of his choosing them, why did he
          not choose the devils to redemption, who could have done him better
          service, by the strength of their nature, than the whole mass of
          Adam’s posterity? Well, then, there is no possible way to lay the
          original foundation of this act of election and preterition in
          anything but the absolute sovereignty of God. Justice or injustice
          comes not into consideration in this case. There is no debt which
          justice or injustice always respects in its acting: if he had pleased,
          he might have chosen all; if he had pleased, he might have chosen
          none. It was in his supreme power to have resolved to have left all
          Adam’s posterity under the rack of his justice; if he determined to
          snatch out any, it was a part of his dominion, but without any injury
          to the creatures he leaves under their own guilt. Did he not pass by
          the angels, and take man? and, by the same right of dominion, may he
          pick out some men from the common mass, and lay aside others to bear
          the punishment of their crimes. Are they not all his subjects? all are
          his criminals, and may be dealt with at the pleasure of their
          undoubted Lord and Sovereign. This is a work of arbitrary power; since
          he might have chosen none, or chosen all, as he saw good himself. It
          is at the liberty of the artificer to determine his wood or stone to
          such a figure, that of a prince, or that of a toad; and his materials
          have no right to complain of him, since it lies wholly upon his own
          liberty. They must have little sense of their own vileness, and God’s
          infinite excellency above them by right of creation, that will contend
          that God hath a lesser right over his creatures than an artificer over
          his wood or stone. If it were at his liberty whether to redeem man, or
          send Christ upon such an undertaking, it is as much at his liberty,
          and the prerogative is to be allowed him, what person he will resolve
          to make capable of enjoying the fruits of that redemption. One man was
          as fit a subject for mercy as another, as they all lay in their
          original guilt: why would not Divine mercy cast its eye upon this man,
          as well as upon his neighbor? There was no cause in the creature, but
          all in God; it must be resolved into his own will: yet not into a will
          without wisdom. God did not choose hand over head, and act by mere
          will, without reason and understanding; an Infinite Wisdom is far from
          such a kind of procedure; but the reason of God is inscrutable to us,
          unless we could understand God as well as he understands himself; the
          whole ground lies in God himself, no part of it in the creature; “not
          in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but in God that shows mercy”
          (Rom. ix. 15, 16). Since God hath revealed no other cause than his
          will, we can resolve it into no other than his sovereign empire over
          all creatures. It is not without a stop to our curiosity, that in the
          same place where God asserts the absolute sovereignty of his mercy to
          Moses, he tells him he could not see his face: “I will be gracious to
          whom I will be gracious;” and he said, “Thou canst not see my face”
          (Exod. xxxiii. 19, 20): the rays of his infinite wisdom are too bright
          and dazzling for our weakness. The apostle acknowledged not only a
          wisdom in this proceeding, but a riches and treasure of wisdom; not
          only that, but a depth and vastness of those riches of wisdom; but was
          unable to give us an inventory and scheme of it (Rom. xi. 33). The
          secrets of his counsels are too deep for us to wade into; in
          attempting to know the reason of those acts, we should find ourselves
          swallowed up into a bottomless gulf: though the understanding be above
          our capacity, yet the admiration of his authority and submission to it
          are not. “We should cast ourselves down at his feet, with a full
          resignation of ourselves to his sovereign pleasure.”1009 This is a
          more comely carriage in a Christian than all the contentious endeavors
          to measure God by our line.

        <p>
          2. In bestowing grace where he pleases. God in conversion and pardon
          works not as a natural agent, putting forth strength to the utmost,
          which God must do, if he did renew man naturally, as the sun shines,
          and the fire burns, which always act, ad extremum virium, unless a
          cloud interpose to eclipse the one, and water to extinguish the other.
          But God acts as a voluntary agent, which can freely exert his power
          when he please, and suspend it when he please. Though God be
          necessarily good, yet he is not necessitated to manifest all the
          treasures of his goodness to every subject; he hath power to distil
          his dews upon one part, and not upon another. If he were necessitated
          to express his goodness without a liberty, no thanks were due to him.
          Who thanks the sun for shining on him, or the fire for warming him?
          None; because they are necessary agents, and can do no other. What is
          the reason he did not reach out his hand to keep all the angels from
          sinking, as well as some, or recover them when they were sunk? What is
          the reason he engrafts one man into the true Vine, and lets the other
          remain a wild olive? Why is not the efficacy of the Spirit always
          linked with the motions of the Spirit? Why does he not mould the heart
          into a gospel frame when he fills the ear with a gospel sound? Why
          doth he strike off the chains from some, and tear the veil from the
          heart, while he leaves others under their natural slavery and Egyptian
          darkness? Why do some lie under the bands of death, while another is
          raised to a spiritual life? What reason is there for all this but his
          absolute will? The apostle resolves the question, if the question be
          asked, why he begets one and not another? Not from the will of the
          creature, but “his own will,” is the determination of one (James i.
          18). Why doth he work in one “to will and to do,” and not in another?
          Because of “his good pleasure,” is the answer of another (Phil. ii.
          13). He could as well new create every one, as he at first created
          them, and make grace as universal as nature and reason, but it is not
          his pleasure so to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is not from want of strength in himself. The power of God is
          unquestionably able to strike off the chains of unbelief from all; he
          could surmount the obstinacy of every child of wrath, and inspire
          every son of Adam with faith as well as Adam himself. He wants not a
          virtue superior to the greatest resistance of his creature; a
          victorious beam of light might be shot into their understandings, and
          a flood of grace might overspread their wills with one word of his
          mouth, without putting forth the utmost of his power. What hindrance
          could there be in any created spirit, which cannot be easily pierced
          into and new moulded by the Father of spirits? Yet he only breathes
          this efficacious virtue into some, and leaves others under that
          insensibility and hardness which they love, and suffer them to
          continue in their benighting ignorance, and consume themselves in the
          embraces of their dear, though deceitful Delilahs. He could have
          conquered the resistance of the Jews, as well as chased away the
          darkness and ignorance of the Gentiles. No doubt but he could
          overpower the heart of the most malicious devil, as well as that of
          the simplest and weakest man. But the breath of the Almighty Spirit is
          in his own power, to breathe “where he lists” (John iii. 8). It is at
          his liberty whether he will give to any the feelings of the invincible
          efficacy of his grace; he did not want strength to have kept man as
          firm as a rock against the temptation of Satan, and poured in such
          fortifying grace, as to have made him impregnable against the powers
          of hell, as well as he did secure the standing of the angels against
          the sedition of their fellows: but it was his will to permit it to be
          otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Nor is it from any prerogative in the creature. He converts not
          any for their natural perfection, because he seizeth upon the most
          ignorant; nor for their moral perfection, because he converts the most
          sinful; nor for their civil perfection, because he turns the most
          despicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] Not for their natural perfection of knowledge. He opened the
          minds and hearts of the more ignorant. Were the nature of the Gentiles
          better manured than that of the Jews, or did the tapers of their
          understandings burn clearer? No; the one were skilled in the
          prophecies of the Messiah, and might have compared the predictions
          they owned with the actions and sufferings of Christ, which they were
          spectators of. He let alone those that had expectations of the
          Messiah, and expectations about the time of Christ’s appearance, both
          grounded upon the oracles wherewith he had entrusted them. The
          Gentiles were unacquainted with the prophets, and therefore destitute
          of the expectations of the Messiah (Eph. ii. 12): they were “without
          Christ;” without any revelation of Christ, because “aliens from the
          commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenant of promise,
          having no hope, and without God in the world,” without any knowledge
          of God, or promises of Christ. The Jews might sooner, in a way of
          reason, have been wrought upon than the Gentiles, who were ignorant of
          the prophets, by whose writings they might have examined the truth of
          the apostles’ declarations. Thus are they refused that were the
          kindred of Christ, according to the flesh, and the Gentiles, that were
          at a greater distance from him, brought in by God; thus he catcheth
          not at the subtle and mighty devils, who had an original in spiritual
          nature more like to him, but at weak and simple man.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] Not for any moral perfection, because he converts the most
          sinful: the Gentiles, steeped in idolatry and superstition. He sowed
          more faith among the Romans than in Jerusalem; more faith in a city
          that was the common sewer of all the idolatry of the nations conquered
          by them, than in that city which had so signally been owned by him,
          and had not practised any idolatry since the Babylonish captivity. He
          planted saintship at Corinth, a place notorious for the infamous
          worship of Venus, a superstition attended with the grossest
          uncleanness; at Ephesus, that presented the whole world with a cup of
          fornication in their temple of Diana; among the Colossians, votaries
          to Cybele in a manner of worship attended with beastly and lascivious
          ceremonies. And what character had the Cretians from one of their own
          poets, mentioned by the apostle to Titus, whom he had placed among
          them to further the progress of the gospel, but the vilest and most
          abominable? (Titus i. 12): “liars,” not to be credited; “evil beasts,”
          not to be associated with; “slow bellies,” fit for no service. What
          prerogative was there in the nature of such putrefaction? as much as
          in that of a toad to be elevated to the dignity of an angel. What
          steam from such dunghills could be welcome to him, and move him to
          cast his eye on them, and sweeten them from heaven? What treasures of
          worth were here to open the treasures of his grace! Were such filthy
          snuffs fit of themselves to be kindled by, and become a lodging for, a
          gospel beam? What invitements could he have from lying, beastliness,
          gluttony, but only from his own sovereignty? By this he plucked
          firebrands out of the fire, while he left straighter and more comely
          sticks to consume to ashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] Not for any civil perfection, because he turns the most
          despicable. He elevates not nature to grace upon the account of
          wealth, honor, or any civil station in the world: he dispenseth not
          ordinarily those treasures to those that the mistaken world foolishly
          admire and dote upon (1 Cor. i. 26); “Not many mighty, not many
          noble:” a purple robe is not usually decked with this jewel; he takes
          more of mouldy clay than refined dust to cast into his image, and
          lodges his treasures more in the earthly vessels than in the world’s
          golden ones; he gives out his richest doles to those that are the
          scorn and reproach of the world. Should he impart his grace most to
          those that abound in wealth or honor, it had been some foundation for
          a conception that he had been moved by those vulgarly esteemed
          excellencies to indulge them more than others. But such a conceit
          languisheth when we behold the subjects of his grace as void
          originally of any allurements, as they are full of provocations.
          Hereby he declares himself free from all created engagements, and that
          he is not led by any external motives in the object.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] It is not from any obligation which lies upon him. He is indebted
          to none: disobliged by all. No man deserves from him any act of grace,
          but every man deserves what the most deplorable are left to suffer. He
          is obliged by the children of wrath to nothing else but showers of
          wrath; owes no more a debt to fallen man, than to fallen devils, to
          restore them to their first station by a superlative grace. How was he
          more bound to restore them, than he was to preserve them; to catch
          them after they fell, than to put a bar in the way of their falling?
          God, as a sovereign, gave laws to men, and a strength sufficient to
          keep those laws. What obligation is there upon God to repair that
          strength man wilfully lost, and extract him out of that condition into
          which he voluntarily plunged himself? What if man sinned by
          temptation, which is a reason alleged by some, might not many of the
          devils do so too? Though there was a first of them that sinned without
          a temptation, yet many of them might be seduced into rebellion by the
          ringleader. Upon that account he is no more bound to give grace to all
          men, than to devils. If he promised life upon obedience, he threatened
          death upon transgression. By man’s disobedience God is quit of his
          promise, and owes nothing but punishment upon the violation of his
          law. Indeed man may pretend to a claim of sufficient strength from him
          by creation, as God is the author of nature, and he had it; but since
          he hath extinguished it by his sin, he cannot in the least pretend any
          obligation on God for a new strength. If it be a “peradventure”
          whether he will “give repentance,” as it is 2 Tim. ii. 25, there is no
          tie in the case; a tie would put it beyond a peradventure with a God
          that never forfeited his obligation. No husbandman thinks himself
          obliged to bestow cost and pains, manure and tillage, upon one field
          more than another; though the nature of the ground may require more,
          yet he is at his liberty whether he will expend more upon one than
          another.1010 He may let it lie fallow as long as he please. God is
          less obliged to till and prune his creatures, than man is obliged to
          his field or trees. If a king proclaim a pardon to a company of
          rebels, upon the condition of each of them paying such a sum of money;
          their estates before were capable of satisfying the condition, but
          their rebellion hath reduced them to an indigent condition; the
          proclamation itself is an act of grace, the condition required is not
          impossible in itself: the prince, out of a tenderness to some, sends
          them that sum of money, he hath by his proclamation obliged them to
          pay, and thereby enabled them to answer the condition he requires; the
          first he doth by a sovereign authority, the second he doth by a
          sovereign bounty. He was obliged to neither of them; punishment was a
          debt due to all of them; if he would remit it upon condition, he did
          relax his sovereign right; and if he would by his largess make any of
          them capable to fulfil the condition, by sending them presently a
          sufficient sum to pay the fine, he acted as proprietor of his own
          goods, to dispose of them in such a quantity to those to whom he was
          not obliged to bestow a mite.
        </p>
        <p>
          [5.] It must therefore be an act of his mere sovereignty. This can
          only sit arbitrator in every gracious act. Why did he give grace to
          Abel and not to Cain, since they both lay in the same womb, and
          equally derived from their parents a taint in their nature; but that
          he would show a standing example of his sovereignty to the future ages
          of the world in the first posterity of man? Why did he give grace to
          Abraham, and separate him from his idolatrous kindred, to dignify him
          to be the root of the Messiah? Why did he confine his promise to
          Isaac, and not extend it to Ishmael, the seed of the same Abraham by
          Hagar, or to the children he had by Keturah after Sarah’s death? What
          reason can be alleged for this but his sovereign will? Why did he not
          give the fallen angels a moment of repentance after their sin, but
          condemned them to irrevocable pains? Is it not as free for him to give
          grace to whom he please, as create what worlds he please; to form this
          corrupted clay into his own image, as to take such a parcel of dust
          from all the rest of the creation whereof to compact Adam’s body? Hath
          he not as much jurisdiction over the sinful mass of his creatures in a
          new creation, as he had over the chaos in the old? And what reason can
          be rendered, of his advancing this part of matter to the nobler
          dignity of a star, and leaving that other part to make up the dark
          body of the earth; to compact one part into a glorious sun, and
          another part into a hard rock, but his royal prerogative? What is the
          reason a prince subjects one malefactor to punishment, and lifts up
          another to a place of trust and profit? that Pharaoh honored the
          butler with an attendance on his person, and remitted the baker to the
          hands of the executioner? It was his pleasure. And is not as great
          right due to God, as is allowed to the worms of the earth? What is the
          reason he hardens a Pharaoh, by a denying him that grace which should
          mollify him, and allows it to another? It is because he will. “Whom he
          will he hardens” (Rom. ix. 18). Hath not man the liberty to pull up
          the sluice, and let the water run into what part of the ground he
          pleases? What is the reason some have not a heart to understand the
          beauty of his ways? Because the Lord doth not give it them (Deut.
          xxix. 4). Why doth he not give all his converts an equal measure of
          his sanctifying grace? some have mites and some have treasures. Why
          doth he give his grace to some sooner, to some later? some are
          inspired in their infancy, others not till a full age, and after; some
          not till they have fallen into some gross sin, as Paul; some betimes,
          that they may do him service: others later, as the thief upon the
          cross, and presently snatcheth them out of the world? Some are weaker,
          some stronger in nature, some more beautiful and lovely, others more
          uncomely and sluggish. It is so in supernaturals. What reason is there
          for this, but his own will? This is instead of all that can be
          assigned on the part of God. He is the free disposer of his own goods,
          and as a Father may give a greater portion to one child than to
          another. And what reason of complaint is there against God? may not a
          toad complain that God did not make it a man, and give it a portion of
          reason? or a fly complain that God did not make it an angel, and give
          it a garment of light; had they but any spark of understanding; as
          well as man complain that God did not give him grace as well as
          another? Unless he sincerely desired it, and then was denied it, he
          might complain of God, though not as a sovereign, yet as a promiser of
          grace to them that ask it. God doth not render his sovereignty
          formidable; he shuts not up his throne of grace from any that seek
          him; he invites man; his arms are open, and the sceptre stretched out;
          and no man continues under the arrest of his lusts, but he that is
          unwilling to be otherwise, and such a one hath no reason to complain
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. His sovereignty is manifest in disposing the means of grace to
          some, not to all. He hath caused the sun to shine bright in one place,
          while he hath left others benighted and deluded by the devil’s
          oracles. Why do the evangelical dews fall in this or that place, and
          not in another? Why was the gospel published in Rome so soon, and not
          in Tartary? Why hath it been extinguished in some places, as soon
          almost as it had been kindled in them? Why hath one place been honored
          with the beams of it in one age, and been covered with darkness the
          next? One country hath been made a sphere for this star, that directs
          to Christ, to move in; and afterwards it hath been taken away, and
          placed in another; sometimes more clearly it hath shone, sometimes
          more darkly, in the same place; what is the reason of this? It is true
          something of it may be referred to the justice of God, but much more
          to the sovereignty of God. That the gospel is published later, and not
          sooner, the apostle tell us is “according to the commandment of the
          everlasting God” (Rom. xvi. 26).
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) The means of grace, after the families from Adam became distinct,
          were never granted to all the world. After that fatal breach in Adam’s
          family by the death of Abel, and Cain’s separation, we read not of the
          means of grace continued among Cain’s posterity; it seems to be
          continued in Adam’s sole family, and not published in societies till
          the time of Seth. “Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord”
          (Gen. iv. 26). It was continued in that family till the deluge, which
          was 1523 years after the creation, according to some, or 1656 years,
          according to others. After that, when the world degenerated, it was
          communicated to Abraham, and settled in the posterity that descended
          from Jacob; though he left not the world without a witness of himself,
          and some sprinklings of revelations in other parts, as appears by the
          Book of Job, and the discourses of his friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The Jews had this privilege granted them above other nations, to
          have a clearer revelation of God. God separated them from all the
          world to honor them with the depositum of his oracles (Rom. iii. 2):
          “To them were committed the oracles of God.” In which regard all other
          nations are said to be “without God” (Eph. ii. 12), as being destitute
          of so great a privilege. The Spirit blew in Canaan when the lands
          about it felt not the saving breath of it. “He hath not dealt so with
          any nation; and as for his judgments, they have not known them” (Ps.
          cxlvii. 20). The rest had no warnings from the prophets, no dictates
          from heaven, but what they had by the light of nature, the view of the
          works of creation, and the administration of Providence, and what
          remained among them of some ancient traditions derived from Noah,
          which, in tract of time, were much defaced. We read but of one Jonah
          sent to Nineveh, but frequent alarms to the Israelites by a multitude
          of prophets commissioned by God. It is true, the door of the Jewish
          church was open to what proselytes would enter themselves, and embrace
          their religion and worship; but there was no public proclamation made
          in the world; only God, by his miracles in their deliverance from
          Egypt (which could not but be famous among all the neighbor nations),
          declared them to be a people favored by heaven: but the tradition from
          Adam and Noah was not publicly revived by God in other parts, and
          raised from that grave of forgetfulness wherein it had lain so long
          buried. Was there any reason in them for this indulgence? God might
          have been as liberal to any other nation, yea, to all the nations in
          the world, if it had been his sovereign pleasure: any other people
          were as fit to be entrusted with his oracles, and be subjects for his
          worship, as that people; yet all other nations, till the rejection of
          the Jews, because of their rejection of Christ, were strangers from
          the covenant of promise. These people were part of the common mass of
          the world: they had no prerogative in nature above Adam’s posterity.
          Were they the extract of an innocent part of his loins, and all the
          other nations drained out of his putrefaction? Had the blood of
          Abraham, from whom they were more immediately descended, any more
          precious tincture than the rest of mankind? They, as well as other
          nations, were made of “one blood” (Acts xvii. 26); and that corrupted
          both in the spring and in the rivulets. Were they better than other
          nations, when God first drew them out of their slavery? We have
          Joshua’s authority for it, that they had complied with the Egyptian
          idolatry, “and served other gods,” in that place of their servitude
          (Josh. xxiv. 14). Had they had an abhorrency of the superstition of
          Egypt, while they remained there, they could not so soon have erected
          a golden calf for worship, in imitation of the Egyptian idols. All the
          rest of mankind had as inviting reasons to present God with, as those
          people had. God might have granted the same privilege to all the
          world, as well as to them, or denied it them, and endowed all the rest
          of the world with his statutes: but the enriching such a small company
          of people with his Divine showers, and leaving the rest of the world
          as a barren wilderness in spirituals, can be placed upon no other
          account originally than that of his unaccountable sovereignty, of his
          love to them: there was nothing in them to merit such high titles from
          God as his first‑born, his peculiar treasure, the apple of his eye. He
          disclaims any righteousness in them, and speaks a word sufficient to
          damp such thoughts in them, by charging them with their wickedness,
          while he “loaded them with his benefits” (Deut. ix. 4, 6). The Lord
          “gives thee not” this land for “thy righteousness;” for thou art a
          stiff‑necked people. It was an act of God’s free pleasure to “choose
          them to be a people to himself” (Deut. vii. 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God afterwards rejected the Jews, gave them up to the hardness of
          their hearts, and spread the gospel among the Gentiles. He hath cast
          off the children of the kingdom, those that had been enrolled for his
          subjects for many ages, who seemed, by their descent from Abraham, to
          have a right to the privileges of Abraham; and called men from the
          east and from the west, from the darkest corners in the world, to “sit
          down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven,” i. e.
          to partake with them of the promises of the gospel (Matt. viii. 11).
          The people that were accounted accursed by the Jews enjoy the means of
          grace, which have been hid from those that were once dignified this
          1600 years; that they have neither ephod, nor teraphim, nor sacrifice,
          nor any true worship of God among them (Hos. iii. 4). Why he should
          not give them grace to acknowledge and own the person of the Messiah,
          to whom he had made the promises of him for so many successive ages,
          but let their “heart be fat,” and “their ears heavy” (Isa. vi.
          10)?—why the gospel at length, after the resurrection of Christ,
          should be presented to the Gentiles, not by chance, but pursuant to
          the resolution and prediction of God, declared by the prophets that it
          should be so in time?—why he should let so many hundreds of years pass
          over, after the world was peopled, and let the nations all that while
          soak in their idolatrous customs?—why he should not call the Gentiles
          without rejecting the Jews, and bind them both up together in the
          bundle of life?—why he should acquaint some people with it a little
          after the publishing it in Jerusalem, by the descent of the Spirit,
          and others not a long time after?—some in the first ages of
          Christianity enjoyed it; others have it not, as those in America, till
          the last age of the world;—can be referred to nothing but his
          sovereign pleasure. What merit can be discovered in the Gentiles?
          There is something of justice in the case of the Jews’ rejection,
          nothing but sovereignty in the Gentiles’ reception into the church. If
          the Jews were bad, the Gentiles were in some sort worse: the Jews
          owned the one true God, without mixture of idols, though they owned
          not the Messiah in his appearance, which they did in a promise; but
          the Gentiles owned neither the one nor the other. Some tell us, it was
          for the merit of some of their ancestors. How comes the means of
          grace, then, to be taken from the Jew, who had (if any people ever
          had) meritorious ancestors for a plea? If the merit of some of their
          former progenitors were the cause, what was the reason the debt due to
          their merit was not paid to their immediate progeny, or to themselves,
          but to a posterity so distant from them, and so abominably depraved as
          the Gentile world was at the day of the gospel‑sun striking into their
          horizon? What merit might be in their ancestors (if any could be
          supposed in the most refined rubbish), it was so little for
          themselves, that no oil could be spared out of their lamps for others.
          What merit their ancestors might have, might be forfeited by the
          succeeding generations. It is ordinarily seen, that what honor a
          father deserves in a state for public service, may be lost by the son,
          forfeited by treason, and himself attainted. Or was it out of a
          foresight that the Gentiles would embrace it, and the Jews reject it;
          that the Gentiles would embrace it in one place, and not in another?
          How did God foresee it, but in his own grace, which he was resolved to
          display in one, not in another? It must be then still resolved into
          his sovereign pleasure. Or did he foresee it in their wills and
          nature? What, were they not all one common dross? Was any part of
          Adam, by nature, better than another? How did God foresee that which
          was not, nor could be, without his pleasure to give ability, and grace
          to receive? Well, then, what reason but the sovereign pleasure of God
          can be alleged, why Christ forbade the apostles, at their first
          commission, to preach to the Gentiles (Matt. x. 15), but, at the
          second and standing commission, orders them to preach to “every
          creature?” Why did he put a demur to the resolutions of Paul and
          Timothy, to impart light to Bithynia, or order them to go into
          Macedonia? Was that country more worthy upon whom lay a great part of
          the blood of the world shed in Alexander’s time (Acts xvi. 6, 7, 9,
          10)? Why should Corazin and Bethsaida enjoy those means that were not
          granted to the Tyrians and Sidonians, who might probably have sooner
          reached out their arms to welcome it (Matt. xi. 21)? Why should God
          send the gospel into our island, and cause it to flourish so long
          here, and not send it, or continue it, in the furthest eastern parts
          of the world? Why should the very profession of Christianity possess
          so small a compass of ground in the world, but five parts in thirty,
          the Mahometans holding six parts, and the other nineteen overgrown
          with Paganism, where either the gospel was never planted, or else
          since rooted up? To whom will you refer this, but to the same cause
          our Saviour doth the revelation of the gospel to babes, and not to the
          wise—even to his Father? “For so it seemed good in thy sight” (Matt.
          xi. 25, 26); “For so was thy good pleasure before thee” (as in the
          original); it is at his pleasure whether he will give any a clear
          revelation of his gospel, or leave them only to the light of nature.
          He could have kept up the first beam of the gospel in the promise in
          all nations among the apostasies of Adam’s posterity, or renewed it in
          all nations when it began to be darkened, as well as he first
          published it to Adam after his fall; but it was his sovereign pleasure
          to permit it to be obscured in one place, and to keep it lighted in
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. His sovereignty is manifest in the various influences of the means
          of grace. He saith to these waters of the sanctuary, as to the floods
          of the sea, “Hitherto you shall go, and no further.” Sometimes they
          wash away the filth of the flesh and outward man, but not that of the
          spirit; the gospel spiritualizeth some, and only moralizeth others;
          some are by the power of it struck down to conviction, but not raised
          up to conversion; some have only the gleams of it in their
          consciences, and others more powerful flashes; some remain in their
          thick darkness under the beaming of the gospel every day in their
          face, and after a long insensibleness are roused by its light and
          warmth; sometimes there is such a powerful breath in it, that it
          levels the haughty imaginations of men, and lays them at its feet that
          before strutted against it in the pride of their heart. The foundation
          of this is not in the gospel itself, which is always the same, nor in
          the ordinances, which are channels as sound at one time as at another,
          but Divine sovereignty that spirits them as he pleaseth, and “blows
          when and where it lists.” It has sometimes conquered its thousands
          (Acts ii. 41); at another time scarce its tens; sometimes the harvest
          hath been great, when the laborers have been but few; at another time
          it hath been small, when the laborers have been many; sometimes whole
          sheaves; at another time scarce gleanings. The evangelical net hath
          been sometimes full at a cast, and at every cast; at another time many
          have labored all night, and day too, and catched nothing (Acts, ii.
          47): “The Lord added to the church daily.” The gospel chariot doth not
          always return with captives chained to the sides of it, but sometimes
          blurred and reproached, wearing the marks of hell’s spite, instead of
          imprinting the marks of its own beauty. In Corinth it triumphed over
          many people (Acts xviii. 10); in Athens it is mocked, and gathers but
          a few clusters (Acts xvii. 32, 34). God keeps the key of the heart, as
          well as of the womb. The apostles had a power of publishing the
          gospel, and working miracles, but under the Divine conduct; it was an
          instrumentality durante bene placito, and as God saw it convenient.
          Miracles were not upon every occasion allowed to them to be wrought,
          nor success upon every administration granted to them; God sometimes
          lent them the key, but to take out no more treasure than was allotted
          to them. There is a variety in the time of gospel operation; some rise
          out of their graves of sin, and beds of sluggishness, at the first
          appearance of this sun; others lie snorting longer. Why doth not God
          spirit it at one season as well as at another, but set his distinct
          periods of time, but because he will show his absolute freedom? And do
          we not sometimes experiment that after the most solemn preparations of
          the heart, we are frustrated of those incomes we expected? Perhaps it
          was because we thought Divine returns were due to our preparations,
          and God stops up the channel, and we return drier than we came, that
          God may confute our false opinion, and preserve the honor of his own
          sovereignty. Sometimes we leap with John Baptist in the womb at the
          appearance of Christ; sometimes we lie upon a lazy bed when he knocks
          from heaven; sometimes the fleece is dry, and sometimes wet, and God
          withholds to drop down his dew of the morning upon it. The dews of his
          word, as well as the droppings of the clouds, belong to his royalty;
          light will not shine into the heart, though it shine round about us,
          without the sovereign order of that God “who commanded light to shine
          out of the darkness” of the chaos (2 Cor. iv. 6). And is it not seen
          also in regard of the refreshing influences of the word? sometimes the
          strongest arguments, and clearest promises, prevail nothing towards
          the quelling black and despairing imaginations; when, afterwards, we
          have found them frighted away by an unexpected word, that seemed to
          have less virtue in it itself than any that passed in vain before it.
          The reasonings of wisdom have dropped down like arrows against a
          brazen wall, when the speech of a weaker person hath found an
          efficacy. It is God by his sovereignty spirits one word and not
          another; sometimes a secret word comes in, which was not thought of
          before, as dropped from heaven, and gives a refreshing, when emptiness
          was found in all the rest. One word from the lips of a sovereign
          prince is a greater cordial than all the harangues of subjects without
          it; what is the reason of this variety, but that God would increase
          the proofs of his own sovereignty? that as it was a part of his
          dominion to create the beauty of a world, so it is no less to create
          the peace as well as the grace of the heart (Isa. lvii. 19): “I create
          the fruit of the lips, peace.” Let us learn from hence to have adoring
          thoughts of, not murmuring fancies against, the sovereignty of God; to
          acknowledge it with thankfulness in what we have; to implore it with a
          holy submission in what we want. To own God as a sovereign in a way of
          dependence, is the way to be owned by him as subjects in a way of
          favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. His sovereignty is manifested in giving a greater measure of
          knowledge to some than to others. What parts, gifts, excellency of
          nature, any have above others, are God’s donative; “He gives wisdom to
          the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding” (Dan. ii.
          21); wisdom, the habit, and knowledge, the right use of it, in
          discerning the right nature of objects, and the fitness of means
          conducing to the end; all is but a beam of Divine light; and the
          different degrees of knowledge in one man above another, are the
          effects of his sovereign pleasure. He enlightens not the minds of all
          men to know every part of his will; one “eats with a doubtful
          conscience,” another in “faith,” without any staggering (Rom. xiv. 2).
          Peter had a desire to keep up circumcision, not fully understanding
          the mind of God in the abolition of the Jewish ceremonies; while Paul
          was clear in the truth of that doctrine. A thought comes into our mind
          that, like a sunbeam, makes a Scripture truth visible in a moment,
          which before we were poring upon without any success; this is from his
          pleasure. One in the primitive times had the gift of knowledge,
          another of wisdom, one the gift of prophecy, another of tongues, one
          the gift of healing, another that of discerning spirits; why this gift
          to one man, and not to another? Why such a distribution in several
          subjects? Because it is his sovereign pleasure. “The Spirit divides to
          every man severally as he will” (1 Cor. xii. 11). Why doth he give
          Bezaleel and Aholiab the gift of engraving, and making curious works
          for the tabernacle (Exod. xxxi. 3), and not others? Why doth he bestow
          the treasures of evangelical knowledge upon the meanest of earthen
          vessels, the poor Galileans, and neglect the Pharisees, stored with
          the knowledge both of naturals and morals? Why did he give to some,
          and not to others, “to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven?”
          (Matt. xiii. 11.) The reason is implied in the words, “Because it was
          the mystery of his kingdom,” and therefore was the act of his
          sovereignty. How would it be a kingdom and monarchy if the governor of
          it were bound to do what he did? It is to be resolved only into the
          sovereign right of propriety of his own goods, that he furnisheth
          babes with a stock of knowledge, and leaves the wise and prudent empty
          of it (Matt. xi. 26): “Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy
          sight.” Why did he not reveal his mind to Eli, a grown man, and in the
          highest office in the Jewish church, but open it to Samuel, a
          stripling? why did the Lord go from the one to the other? Because his
          motion depends upon his own will. Some are of so dull a constitution,
          that they are incapable of any impression, like rocks too hard for a
          stamp; others like water; you may stamp what you please, but it
          vanisheth as soon as the seal is removed. It is God forms men as he
          pleaseth: some have parts to govern a kingdom, others scarce brains to
          conduct their own affairs; one is fit to rule men, and another scarce
          fit to keep swine; some have capacious souls in crazy and deformed
          bodies, others contracted spirits and heavier minds in a richer and
          more beautiful case. Why are not all stones alike? some have a more
          sparkling light, as gems, more orient than pebbles;—some are stars of
          first, and others of a less magnitude; others as mean as glow‑worms, a
          slimy lustre:—it is because he is the sovereign Disposer of what
          belongs to him; and gives here, as well as at the resurrection, to one
          “a glory of the sun;” to another that of the “moon;” and to a third a
          less, resembling that of a “star” (1 Cor. xv. 40). And this God may do
          by the same right of dominion, as he exercised when he endowed some
          kinds of creatures with a greater perfection than others in their
          nature. Why may he not as well garnish one man with a greater
          proportion of gifts, as make a man differ in excellency from the
          nature of a beast? or frame angels to a more purely spiritual nature
          than a man? or make one angel a cherubim or seraphim, with a greater
          measure of light than another? Though the foundation of this is his
          dominion, yet his wisdom is not uninterested in his sovereign
          disposal; he garnisheth those with a greater ability whom he intends
          for greater service, than those that he intends for less, or none at
          all; as an artificer bestows more labor, and carves a more excellent
          figure upon those stones that he designs for a more honorable place in
          the building. But though the intending this or that man for service be
          the motive of laying in a greater provision in him than in others, yet
          still it is to be referred to his sovereignty, since that first act of
          culling him out for such an end was the fruit solely of his sovereign
          pleasure: as when he resolved to make a creature actively to glorify
          him, in wisdom he must give him reason; yet the making such a creature
          was an act of his absolute dominion.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. His sovereignty is manifest in the calling some to a more special
          service in their generation. God settles some in immediate offices of
          his service, and perpetuates them in those offices, with a neglect of
          others, who seem to have a greater pretence to them. Moses was a great
          sufferer for Israel, the solicitor for them in Egypt, and the
          conductor of them from Egypt to Canaan; yet he was not chosen to the
          high priesthood, but that was an office settled upon Aaron, and his
          posterity after him, in a lineal descent; Moses was only pitched upon
          for the present rescue of the captived Israelites, and to be the
          instrument of Divine miracles; but notwithstanding all the success he
          had in his conduct, his faithfulness in his employment, and the
          transcendent familiarity he had with the great Ruler of the world, his
          posterity were left in the common level of the tribe of Levi, without
          any special mark of dignity upon them above the rest for all the
          services of that great man. Why Moses for a temporary magistrate,
          Aaron for a perpetual priesthood, above all the rest of the
          Israelites? hath little reason but the absolute pleasure of God, who
          distributes his employments as he pleaseth; and as a master orders his
          servant to do the noblest work, and another to labor in baser offices,
          according to his pleasure. Why doth he call out David, a shepherd, to
          sway the Jewish sceptre, above the rest of the brothers, that had a
          fairer appearance, and had been bred in arms, and inured to the toils
          and watchings of a camp? Why should Mary be the mother of Christ, and
          not some other of the same family of David, of a more splendid birth,
          and a nobler education? Though some other reasons may be rendered, yet
          that which affords the greatest acquiescence, is the sovereign will of
          God. Why did Christ choose out of the meanest of the people the twelve
          apostles, to be heralds of his grace in Judea, and other parts of the
          world; and afterwards select Paul before Gamaliel, his instructor, and
          others of the Jews, as learned as himself, and advance him to be the
          most eminent apostle, above the heads of those who had ministered to
          Christ in the days of his flesh? Why should he preserve eleven of
          those he first called to propagate and enlarge his kingdom, and leave
          the other to the employment of shedding his blood? Why, in the times
          of our reformation, he should choose a Luther out of a monastery, and
          leave others in their superstitious nastiness, to perish in the
          traditions of their fathers? Why set up Calvin, as a bulwark of the
          gospel, and let others as learned as himself wallow in the sink of
          popery? It is his pleasure to do so. The potter hath power to separate
          this part of the clay to form a vessel for a more public use, and
          another part of the clay to form a vessel for a more private one. God
          takes the meanest clay to form the most excellent and honorable
          vessels in his house. As he formed man, that was to govern the
          creatures of the same clay and earth whereof the beasts were formed,
          and not of that nobler element of water, which gave birth to the fish
          and birds: so he forms some, that are to do him the greatest service,
          of the meanest materials, to manifest the absolute right of his
          dominion.

          7. His sovereignty is manifest in the bestowing much wealth and honor
          upon some, and not vouchsafing it to the more industrious labors and
          attempts of others. Some are abased, and others are elevated; some are
          enriched, and others impoverished; some scarce feel any cross, and
          others scarce feel any comfort in their whole lives; some sweat and
          toil, and what they labor for runs out of their reach; others sit
          still, and what they wish for falls into their lap. One of the same
          clay hath a diadem to beautify his head, and another wants a covering
          to protect him from the weather. One hath a stately palace to lodge
          in, and another is scarce master of a cottage where to lay his head. A
          sceptre is put into one man’s hand, and a spade into another’s; a rich
          purple garnisheth one man’s body, while another wraps himself in
          dunghill rags. The poverty of some, and the wealth of others, is an
          effect of the Divine sovereignty, whence God is said to be the Maker
          of the “poor as well as the rich” (Prov. xxii. 2), not only of their
          persons, but of their conditions. The earth, and the fulness thereof,
          is his propriety; and he hath as much a right as Joseph had to bestow
          changes of raiment upon what Benjamins he please. There is an election
          to a greater degree of worldly felicity, as there is an election of
          some to a greater degree of supernatural grace and glory: as he makes
          it “rain upon one city, and not upon another” (Amos iv. 7), so he
          causeth prosperity to distil upon the head of one and not upon
          another; crowning some with earthly blessings, while he crosseth
          others with continual afflictions: for he speaks of himself as a great
          proprietor of the corn that nourisheth us, and the wine that cheers
          us, and the wood that warm us (Hos. ii. 8, 9): “I will take away,” not
          your corn and wine, but “my corn, my wine, my wool.” His right to
          dispose of the goods of every particular person is unquestionable. He
          can take away from one, and pass over the propriety to another. Thus
          he devolved the right of the Egyptian jewels to the Israelites, and
          bestowed upon the captives what before he had vouchsafed to the
          oppressors; as every sovereign state demands the goods of their
          subjects for the public advantage in a case of exigency, though none
          of that wealth was gained by any public office, but by their private
          industry, and gained in a country not subject to the dominion of those
          that require a portion of them. By this right he changes strangely the
          scene of the world; sometimes those that are high are reduced to a
          mean and ignominious condition, those that are mean are advanced to a
          state of plenty and glory. The counter, which in accounting signifies
          now but a penny, is presently raised up to signify a pound. The proud
          ladies of Israel, instead of a girdle of curious needlework, are
          brought to make use of a cord; as the vulgar translates rent, a rag,
          or list of cloth (Isa. iii. 24), and sackcloth for a stomacher instead
          of silk. This is the sovereign act of God, as he is Lord of the world
          (Ps. lxxv. 6, 7): “Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from
          the west, nor from the south, but God is the Judge: he putteth down
          one, and setteth up another.” He doth no wrong to any man, if he lets
          him languish out his days in poverty and disgrace: if he gives or
          takes away, he meddles with nothing but what is his own more than
          ours: if he did dispense his benefits equally to all, men would soon
          think it their due. The inequality and changes preserve the notion of
          God’s sovereignty, and correct our natural unmindfulness of it. If
          there were no changes, God would not be feared as the “King of all the
          earth” (Ps. lv. 19): to this might also be referred his investing some
          countries with greater riches in their bowels, and on the surface; the
          disposing some of the fruitful and pleasant regions of Canaan or
          Italy, while he settles others in the icy and barren parts of the
          northern climates.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. His sovereignty is manifest in the times and seasons of dispensing
          his goods. He is Lord of the times when, as well as of the goods
          which, he doth dispose of to any person; these “the Father hath put in
          his own power” (Acts i. 7). As it was his sovereign pleasure to
          restore the kingdom to Israel, so he would pitch upon the time when to
          do it, and would not have his right invaded, so much as by a question
          out of curiosity. This disposing of opportunities, in many things, can
          be referred to nothing else but his sovereign pleasure. Why should
          Christ come at the twilight and evening of the world? at the fulness,
          and not at the beginning, of time? Why should he be from the infancy
          of the world so long wrapt up in a promise, and not appear in the
          flesh till the last times and gray hairs of the world, when so many
          persons, in all nations, had been hurried out of the world without any
          notice of such a Redeemer? What was this but his sovereign will? Why
          the Gentiles should be left so long in the devil’s chains, wallowing
          in the sink of their abominable superstitions, since God had declared
          his intention by the prophets to call multitudes of them, and reject
          the Jews;—why he should defer it so long, can be referred to nothing
          but the same cause. What is the reason the veil continues so long upon
          the heart of the Jews, that is promised, one time or other, to be
          taken off? Why doth God delay the accomplishment of those glorious
          predictions of the happiness and interest of that people? Is it
          because of the sin of their ancestors,—a reason that cannot bear much
          weight? If we cast it upon that account, their conversion can never be
          expected, can never be effected; if for the sins of their ancestors,
          is it not also for their own sins? Do their sins grow less in number,
          or less venomous, or provoking in quality, by this delay? Is not their
          blasphemy of Christ as malicious, their hatred of him as strong and
          rooted, as ever? Do they not as much approve of the bloody act of
          their ancestors, since so many ages are past, as their ancestors did
          applaud it at the time of the execution? Have they not the same
          disposition and will, discovered sufficiently by the scorn of Christ,
          and of those that profess his name, to act the same thing over again,
          were Christ now in the same state in the world, and they invested with
          the same power of government? If their conversion were deferred one
          age after the death of Christ for the sins of their preceding
          ancestors, is it to be expected now; since the present generation of
          the Jews in all countries have the sins of those remote, the
          succeeding, and their more immediate ancestors, lying upon them? This,
          therefore, cannot be the reason; but as it was the sovereign pleasure
          of God to foretell his intention to overcome the stoutness of their
          hearts, so it is his sovereign pleasure that it shall not be performed
          till the “fulness of the Gentiles be come in” (Rom. xi. 25). As he is
          the Lord of his own grace, so he is the Lord of the time when to
          dispense it. Why did God create the world in six days, which he could
          have erected and beautified in a moment? Because it was his pleasure
          so to do. Why did he frame the world when he did, and not many ages
          before? Because he is Master of his own work. Why did he not resolve
          to bring Israel to the fruition of Canaan till after four hundred
          years? Why did he draw out their deliverance to so long time after he
          began to attempt it? Why such a multitude of plagues upon Pharaoh to
          work it, when he could have cut short the work by one mortal blow upon
          the tyrant and his accomplices? It was his sovereign pleasure to act
          so, though not without other reasons intelligible enough by looking
          into the story. Why doth he not bring man to a perfection of stature
          in a moment after his birth, but let him continue in a tedious
          infancy, in a semblance to beasts, for the want of an exercise of
          reason? Why doth he not bring this or that man, whom he intends for
          service, to a fitness in an instant, but by long tracts of study, and
          through many meanders and labyrinths? Why doth he transplant a hopeful
          person in his youth to the pleasures of another world, and let
          another, of an eminent holiness, continue in the misery of this, and
          wade through many floods of afflictions? What can we chiefly refer all
          these things to but his sovereign pleasure? The “times are determined
          by God” (Acts xvii. 26).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly. The dominion of God is manifested as a governor, as well as a
          lawgiver and proprietor.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In disposing of states and kingdoms. (Ps. lxxv. 7): “God is Judge;
          he puts down one, and sets up another.” “Judge” is to be taken not in
          the same sense that we commonly use the word, for a judicial minister
          in a way of trial, but for a governor; as you know the extraordinary
          governors raised up among the Jews were called judges, whence one
          entire book in the Old Testament is so denominated, the Book of
          Judges. God hath a prerogative to “change times and seasons” (Dan. ii.
          21), i. e. the revolutions of government, whereby times are altered.
          How many empires, that have spread their wings over a great part of
          the world, have had their carcasses torn in pieces; and unheard‑of
          nations plucked off the wings of the Roman eagle, after it had preyed
          upon many nations of the world; and the Macedonian empire was as the
          dew that is dried up a short time after it falls.1011 He erected the
          Chaldean monarchy, used Nebuchadnezzar to overthrow and punish the
          ungrateful Jews, and, by a sovereign act, gave a great parcel of land
          into his hands; and what he thought was his right by conquest, was
          God’s donative to him. You may read the charter to Nebuchadnezzar,
          whom he terms his servant (Jer. xxvii. 6): “And now I have given all
          those lands” (the lands are mentioned ver. 3), “into the hands of
          Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant:” which decree he
          pronounceth after his asserting his right of sovereignty over the
          whole earth (ver. 5). After that, he puts a period to the Chaldean
          empire, and by the same sovereign authority decrees Babylon to be a
          spoil to the nations of the north country, and delivers her up as a
          spoil to the Persian (Jer. l. 9, 10): and this for the manifestation
          of his sovereign dominion, that he was the Lord, that made peace, and
          created evil (Isa. xlv. 6, 7). God afterwards overthrows that by the
          Grecian Alexander, prophesied of under the figure of a goat, with “one
          horn between his eyes” (Dan. viii.): the swift current of his
          victories, as swift as his motion, showed it to be from an
          extraordinary hand of heaven, and not either from the policy or
          strength of the Macedonian. His strength, in the prophet, is described
          to be less, being but one horn running against the Persian, described
          under the figure of a ram with two horns:1012 and himself acknowledged
          a Divine motion exciting him to that great attempt, when he saw
          Joddus, the high‑priest, coming out in his priestly robes, to meet him
          at his approach to Jerusalem, whom he was about to worship,
          acknowledging that the vision which put him upon the Persian war
          appeared to him in such a garb. What was the reason Israel was rent
          from Judah, and both split into two distinct kingdoms? Because
          Rehoboam would not hearken to sober and sound counsels, but follow the
          advice of upstarts. What was the reason he did not hearken to sound
          advice, since he had so advantageous an education under his father
          Solomon, the wisest prince of the world? “The cause was from the Lord”
          (1 Kings, xii. 15), that he might perform what he had before spoke. In
          this he acted according to his royal word; but, in the first resolve,
          he acted as a sovereign lord, that had the disposal of all nations in
          the world. And though Ahab had a numerous posterity, seventy sons to
          inherit the throne after him, yet God by his sovereign authority gives
          them up into the hands of Jehu, who strips them of their lives and
          hopes together: not a man of them succeeded in the throne, but the
          crown is transferred to Jehu by God’s disposal. In wars, whereby
          flourishing kingdoms are overthrown, God hath the chief hand; in
          reference to which it is observed that, in the two prophets, Isaiah
          and Jeremiah, God is called “the Lord of Hosts” one hundred and thirty
          times. It is not the sword of the captain, but the sword of the Lord,
          bears the first rank; “the sword of the Lord and of Gideon” (Judges
          vii. 18). The sword of a conqueror is the sword of the Lord, and
          receives its charge and commission from the great Sovereign (Jer.
          xlvii. 6, 7). We are apt to confine our thoughts to second causes, lay
          the fault upon the miscarriages of persons, the ambition of the one,
          and the covetousness of another, and regard them not as the effects of
          God’s sovereign authority, linking second causes together to serve his
          own purpose. The skill of one man may lay open the folly of a
          counsellor; an earthly force may break in pieces the power of a mighty
          prince: but Job, in his consideration of those things, refers the
          matter higher: “He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins
          with a girdle” (Job xii. 18). “He looseth the bonds of kings,” i. e.
          takes off the yokes they lay upon their subjects, “and girds their
          loins with a girdle” (a cord, as the vulgar); he lays upon them those
          fetters they framed for others; such a girdle, or band, as is the mark
          of captivity, as the words, ver. 19, confirm it: “He leads princes
          away spoiled, and overthrows the mighty.” God lifts up some to a great
          height, and casts down others to a disgraceful ruin. All those changes
          in the face of the world, the revolutions of empires, the desolating
          and ravaging wars, which are often immediately the birth of the vice,
          ambition, and fury of princes, are the royal acts of God as Governor
          of the world. All government belongs to him; he is the Fountain of all
          the great and the petty dominions in the world; and, therefore, may
          place in them what substitutes and vicegerents he pleaseth, as a
          prince may remove his officers at pleasure, and take their commissions
          from them. The highest are settled by God durante bene placito, and
          not quamdiu bene se gesserint. Those princes that have been the glory
          of their country have swayed the sceptre but a short time, when the
          more wolvish ones have remained longer in commission, as God hath seen
          fit for the ends of his own sovereign government. Now, by the
          revolutions in the world, and changes in governors and government, God
          keeps up the acknowledgment of his sovereignty, when he doth arrest
          grand and public offenders that wear a crown by his providence, and
          employ it, by their pride, against him that placed it there. When he
          arraigns such by a signal hand from heaven, he makes them the public
          examples of the rights of his sovereignty, declaring thereby, that the
          cedars of Lebanon are as much at his foot, as the shrubs of the
          valley; that he hath as sovereign an authority over the throne in the
          palace, as over the stool in the cottage.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The dominion of God is manifested in raising up and ordering the
          spirits of men according to his pleasure. He doth, as the Father of
          spirits, communicate an influence to the spirits of men, as well as an
          existence; he puts what inclinations he pleaseth into the will, stores
          it with what habits he please, whether natural or supernatural,
          whereby it may be rendered more ready to act according to the Divine
          purpose. The will of man is a finite principle, and therefore subject
          to Him who hath an infinite sovereignty over all things; and God,
          having a sovereignty over the will, in the manner of its acting,
          causeth it to will what he wills, as to the outward act, and the
          outward manner of performing it. There are many examples of this part
          of his sovereignty. God, by his sovereign conduct, ordered Moses a
          protectoress as soon as his parents had formed an “ark of bulrushes,”
          wherein to set him floating on the river (Exod. ii. 3‒6): they expose
          him to the waves, and the waves expose him to the view of Pharaoh’s
          daughter, whom God, by his secret ordering her motion, had posted in
          that place; and though she was the daughter of a prince that
          inveterately hated the whole nation, and had, by various arts,
          endeavored to extirpate them, yet God inspires the royal lady with
          sentiments of compassion to the forlorn infant, though she knew him to
          be one of the Hebrews’ children (ver. 6), i. e. one of that race whom
          her father had devoted to the hands of the executioner; yet God, that
          doth by his sovereignty rule over the spirits of all men, moves her to
          take that infant into her protection, and nourish him at her own
          charge, give him a liberal education, adopt him as her son, who, in
          time, was to be the ruin of her race, and the saviour of his nation.
          Thus he appointed Cyrus to be his shepherd, and gave him a pastoral
          spirit for the restoration of the city and temple of Jerusalem (Isa.
          xliv. 28): and Isaiah (chap. xlv. 5) tells them, in the prophecy, that
          he had girded him, though Cyrus had not known him, i. e. God had given
          him a military spirit and strength for so great an attempt, though he
          did not know that he was acted by God for those divine purposes. And
          when the time came for the house of the Lord to be rebuilt, the
          spirits of the people were raised up, not by themselves, but by God
          (Ezra i. 5), “Whose spirit God had raised to go up;” and not only the
          spirit of Zerubbabel, the magistrate, and of Joshua, the priest, but
          the spirit of all the people, from the highest to the meanest that
          attended him, were acted by God to strengthen their hands, and promote
          the work (Hag. i. 14). The spirits of men, even in those works which
          are naturally desirable to them, as the restoration of the city and
          rebuilding of the Temple was to those Jews, are acted by God, as the
          Sovereign over them, much more when the wheels of men’s spirits are
          lifted up above their ordinary temper and motion. It was this empire
          of God good Nehemiah regarded, as that whence he was to hope for
          success; he did not assure himself so much of it, from the favor he
          had with the king, nor the reasonableness of his intended petition,
          but the absolute power God had over the heart of that great monarch;
          and, therefore, he supplicates the heavenly, before he petitioned the
          earthly, throne (Neh. ii. 4): “So I prayed to the God of heaven.” The
          heathens had some glance of this; it is an expression that Cicero hath
          somewhere, “That the Roman commonwealth was rather governed by the
          assistance of the Supreme Divinity over the hearts of men, than by
          their own counsels and management.” How often hath the feeble courage
          of men been heightened to such a pitch as to stare death in the face,
          which before were damped with the least thought or glance of it! This
          is a fruit of God’s sovereign dominion.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The dominion of God is manifest in restraining the furious passions
          of men, and putting a block in their way. Sometimes God doth it by a
          remarkable hand, as the Babel builders were diverted from their proud
          design by a sudden confusion of their language, and rendering it
          unintelligible to one another; sometimes by ordinary, though
          unexpected, means; as when Saul, like a hawk, was ready to prey upon
          David, whom he had hunted as a partridge upon the mountains, he had
          another object presented for his arms and fury by the Philistines’
          sudden invasion of a part of his territory (1 Sam. xxiii. 26‒28). But
          it is chiefly seen by an inward curbing mutinous affections, when
          there is no visible cause. What reason but this can be rendered, why
          the nations bordering on Canaan, who bore no good will to the Jews,
          but rather wished the whole race of them rooted out from the face of
          the earth, should not invade their country, pillage their houses, and
          plunder their cattle, while they were left naked of any human defence,
          the males being annually employed at one time at Jerusalem in worship;
          what reason can be rendered, but an invisible curb God put into their
          spirits? What was the reason not a man, of all the buyers and sellers
          in the Temple, should rise against our Saviour, when, with a high
          hand, he began to whip them out, but a Divine bridle upon them? though
          it appears, by the questioning his authority, that there were Jews
          enough to have chased out him and his company (John ii. 15, 18). What
          was the reason that, at the publishing the gospel by the apostles at
          the first descent of the Spirit, those that had used the Master so
          barbarously a few days before, were not all in a foam against the
          servants, that, by preaching that doctrine, upbraided them with the
          late murder? Had they better sentiments of the Lord, whom they had put
          to death? Were their natures grown tamer, and their malignity
          expelled? No; but that Sovereign who had loosed the reins of their
          malicious corruption, to execute the Master for the purchase of
          redemption, curbed it from breaking out against the servants, to
          further the propagation of the doctrine of redemption. He that
          restrains the roaring lion of hell, restrains also his whelps on
          earth; he and they must have a commission before they can put forth a
          finger to hurt, how malicious soever their nature and will be. His
          empire reaches over the malignity of devils, as well as the nature of
          beasts. The lions out of the den, as well as those in the den, are
          bridled by him in favor of his Daniels. His dominion is above that of
          principalities and powers; their decrees are at his mercy, whether
          they shall stand or fall; he hath a vote above their stiffest
          resolves: his single word, I will, or, I forbid, outweighs the most
          resolute purposes of all the mighty Nimrods of the earth in their
          rendezvouses and cabals, in their associations and counsels (Isa.
          viii. 9, 10): “Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be
          broken in pieces; take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.”
          “When the enemy shall come in like a flood,” with a violent and
          irresistible force, intending nothing but ravage and desolation, “the
          Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against them” (Isa. lix.
          19), shall give a sudden check, and damp their spirits, and put them
          to a stand. When Laban furiously pursued Jacob, with an intent to do
          him an ill turn, God gave him a command to do otherwise (Gen. xxxi.
          24). Would Laban have respected that command any more than he did the
          light of nature when he worshipped idols, had not God exercised his
          authority in inclining his will to observe it, or laying restraints
          upon his natural inclinations, or denying his concourse to the acting
          those ill intentions he had entertained? The stilling the principles
          of commotion in men, and the noise of the sea, are arguments of the
          Divine dominion; neither the one nor the other is in the power of the
          most sovereign prince without Divine assistance: as no prince can
          command a calm to a raging sea, so no prince can order stillness to a
          tumultuous people; they are both put together as equally parts of the
          Divine prerogative (Ps. lxv. 7), which “stills the noise of the sea,
          and tumult of the people:” and David owns God’s sovereignty more than
          his own, “in subduing the people under him” (Ps. xviii. 47). In this
          his empire is illustrious (Ps. xxix. 10): “The Lord sitteth upon the
          floods, yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever;” a King impossible to be
          deposed, not only on the natural floods of the sea, that would
          naturally overflow the world, but the metaphorical floods or tumults
          of the people, the sea in every wicked man’s heart, more apt to rage
          morally than the sea to foam naturally. If you will take the
          interpretation of an angel, waters and floods, in the prophetic style,
          signify the inconstant and mutable people (Rev. xvii. 1, 5): “The
          waters where the whore sits are people, and multitudes, and nations,
          and tongues:” so the angel expounds to John the vision which he saw
          (ver. 1). The heathens acknowledged this part of God’s sovereignty in
          the inward restraints of men: those apparitions of the gods and
          goddesses in Homer, to several of the great men when they were in a
          fury, were nothing else, in the judgment of the wisest philosophers,
          than an exercise of God’s sovereignty in quelling their passions,
          checking their uncomely intentions, and controlling them in that which
          their rage prompted them to. And, indeed, did not God set bounds to
          the storms in men’s hearts, we should soon see the funeral, not only
          of religion, but civility; the one would be blown out, and the other
          torn up by the roots.

          4. The dominion of God is manifest in defeating the purposes and
          devices of men. God often makes a mock of human projects, and doth as
          well accomplish that which they never dreamt of, as disappoint that
          which they confidently designed. He is present at all cabals, laughs
          at men’s formal and studied counsels, bears a hand over every egg they
          hatch, thwarts their best compacted designs, supplants their
          contrivances, breaks the engines they have been many years rearing,
          diverts the intentions of men, as a mighty wind blows an arrow from
          the mark which the archer intended. (Job v. 12): “He disappointeth the
          devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their
          enterprise; he taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and the
          counsel of the froward is carried headlong.” Enemies often draw an
          exact scheme of their intended proceedings, marshal their companies,
          appoint their rendezvous, think to make but one morsel of those they
          hate; God, by his sovereign dominion, turns the scale, changeth the
          gloominess of the oppressed into a sunshine, and the enemies’ sunshine
          into darkness. When the nations were gathered together against Sion,
          and said, “Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Sion” (Micah
          iv. 11), what doth God do in this case? (ver. 12), “He shall gather
          them,” i. e. those conspiring nations, as “sheaves into the floor.”
          Then he sounds a trumpet to Sion: “Arise, and thresh, O daughter of
          Sion, for I will make thy horn iron, and thy hoofs brass, and thou
          shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain
          unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.”
          I will make them and their counsels, them and their strength, the
          monuments and signal marks of my empire over the whole earth. When you
          see the cunningest designs baffled by some small thing intervening;
          when you see men of profound wisdom infatuated, mistake their way, and
          “grope in the noon‑day as in the night” (Job v. 14), bewildered in a
          plain way; when you see the hopes of mighty attempters dashed into
          despair, their triumphs turned into funerals, and their joyful
          expectations into sorrowful disappointments; when you see the weak,
          devoted to destruction, victorious, and the most presumptuous defeated
          in their purposes, then read the Divine dominion in the desolation of
          such devices. How often doth God take away the heart and spirit of
          grand designs, and burst a mighty wheel, by snatching but one man out
          of the world! How often doth he “cut off the spirits of princes” (Ps.
          lxxvi. 12), either from the world by death, or from the execution of
          their projects by some unforeseen interruption, or from favoring those
          contrivances, which before they cherished by a change of their minds!
          How often hath confidence in God, and religious prayer, edged the
          weakest and smallest number of weapons to make a carnage of the
          carnally confident! How often hath presumption been disappointed, and
          the contemned enemy rejoiced in the spoils of the proud expectant of
          victory! Phidias made the image of Nemesis, or Revenge, at Marathon,
          of that marble which the haughty Persians, despising the weakness of
          the Athenian forces, brought with them, to erect a trophy for an
          expected, but an ungained, victory.1013 Haman’s neck, by a sudden
          turn, was in the halter, when the Jews’ necks were designed to the
          block; Julian designed the overthrow of all the Christians, just
          before his breast was pierced by an unexpected arrow; the
          Powder‑traitors were all ready to give fire to the mine, when the
          sovereign hand of Heaven snatched away the match. Thus the great Lord
          of the world cuts off men on the pinnacle of their designs, when they
          seem to threaten heaven and earth; puts out the candle of the wicked,
          which they thought to use to light them to the execution of their
          purposes; turns their own counsels into a curse to themselves, and a
          blessing to their adversaries, and makes his greatest enemies
          contribute to the effecting his purposes. How may we take notice of
          God’s absolute disposal of things in private affairs, when we see one
          man, with a small measure of prudence and little industry, have great
          success, and others, with a greater measure of wisdom, and a greater
          toil and labor, find their enterprises melt between their fingers! It
          was Solomon’s observation, “That the race was not to the swift, nor
          the battle to the strong, neither bread to the wise, nor riches to men
          of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill” (Eccles. ix. 11).
          Many things might interpose to stop the swift in his race, and damp
          the courage of the most valiant: things do not happen according to
          men’s abilities, but according to the overruling authority of God: God
          never yet granted man the dominion of his own way, no more than to be
          lord of his own time: “The way of man is not in himself, it is not in
          him that walketh to direct his steps” (Jer. x. 23). He hath given man
          a power of acting, but not the sovereignty to command success. He
          makes even those things which men intended for their security to turn
          to their ruin; Pilate delivered up Christ to be accounted a friend to
          Cæsar, and Cæsar soon after proves an enemy to him, removes him from
          his government, and sends him into banishment. The Jews imagined by
          the crucifying Christ to keep the Roman ensigns at a distance from
          them, and this hasted their march, by God’s sovereign disposal, which
          ended in a total desolation. “He makes the judges fools” (Job xxii.
          17), by taking away his light from their understanding, and suffering
          them to go on in the vanity of their own spirits, that his sovereignty
          in the management of things may be more apparent; for then he is known
          to be Lord, when he “snares the wicked in the work of his own hands”
          (Ps. ix. 16). You have seen much of this doctrine in your experience,
          and, if my judgment fail me not, you will yet see much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. The dominion of God is manifest in sending his judgments upon whom
          he please. “He kills and makes alive; he wounds and heals” whom he
          pleaseth: his thunders are his own, and he may cast them upon what
          subjects he thinks good: he hath a right, in a way of justice, to
          punish all men; he hath his choice, in a way of sovereignty, to pick
          out whom he please, to make the examples of it. Might not some nations
          be as wicked as those of Sodom and Gomorrah, yet have not been
          scorched with the like dreadful flames? Zoar was untouched, while the
          other cities, her neighbors, were burnt to ashes. Were there never any
          places and persons successors in Sodom’s guilt? Yet those only by his
          sovereign authority are separated by him to be the examples of his
          “eternal vengeance” (Jude 7). Why are not sinners as Sodom, like as
          those ancient ones, scalded to death by the like fiery drops? It is
          because it is his pleasure; and the same reason is to be rendered, why
          he would in a way of justice cut off the Jews for their sins, and
          leave the Gentiles untouched in the midst of their idolatries. When
          the church was consumed because of her iniquities, they acknowledged
          God’s sovereignty in this. “We are the clay, and thou art our Potter,
          and we all the work of thy hands” (Isa. lxiv. 7, 8); thou hast a
          liberty to break or preserve us. Judgments move according to God’s
          order. When the sword hath a charge against Ashkelon and the
          sea‑shore, thither it must march, and touch not any other place or
          person as it goes, though there may be demerit enough for it to
          punish. When the prophet had spake to the sword, “O thou sword of the
          Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy
          scabbard, rest and be still;” the prophet answers for the sword, “How
          can it be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against
          Ashkelon? there hath he appointed it” (Jer. xlvii. 6, 7). If he hath
          appointed a judgment against London or Westminster, or any other
          place, there it shall drop, there it shall pierce, and in no other
          place without a like charge. God, as a sovereign, gives instructions
          to every judgment, when, and against whom, it shall march, and what
          cities, what persons, it shall arrest; and he is punctually obeyed by
          them, as a sovereign Lord. All creatures stand ready for his call, and
          are prepared to be executioners of his vengeance, when he speaks the
          word; they are his hosts by creation, and in array for his service: at
          the sound of his trumpet, or beat of his drum, they troop together
          with arms in their hands, to put his orders exactly in execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. The dominion of God is manifest in appointing to every man his
          calling and station in the world. If the hairs of every man’s head
          fall under his sovereign care, the calling of every man, wherein he is
          to glorify God and serve his generation, which is of a greater concern
          than the hairs of the head, falls under his dominion. He is the master
          of the great family, and divides to every one his work as he pleaseth.
          The whole work of the Messiah, the time of every action, as well as
          the hour of his passion, was ordered and appointed by God. The
          separation of Paul to the preaching of the gospel, was by the
          sovereign disposal of God (Rom. i. 1). By the same exercise of his
          authority, that he “sets every man the bounds of his habitation” (Acts
          xvii. 26), he prescribes also to him the nature of his work. He that
          ordered Adam, the father of mankind, his work, and the place of it,
          the “dressing the garden” (Gen. ii. 15), doth not let any of his
          posterity be their own choosers, without an influence of his sovereign
          direction on them. Though our callings are our work, yet they are by
          God’s order, wherein we are to be faithful to our great Master and
          Ruler.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. The dominion of God is manifest in the means and occasions of men’s
          conversion. Sometimes one occasion, sometimes another; one word lets a
          man go, another arrests him, and brings him before God and his own
          conscience; it is as God gives out the order. He lets Paul be a
          prisoner at Jerusalem, that his cause should not be determined there;
          moves him to appeal to Cæsar, not only to make him a prisoner, but a
          preacher, in Cæsar’s court, and render his chains an occasion to bring
          in a harvest of converts in Nero’s palace. His bonds in or for Christ
          are “manifest in all the palace” (Phil. i. 12, 13); not the bare
          knowledge of his bonds, but the sovereign design of God in those
          bonds, and the success of them; the bare knowledge of them would not
          make others more confident for the gospel, as it follows, ver. 14,
          without a providential design of them. Onesimus, running from his
          master, is guided by God’s sovereign order into Paul’s company, and
          thereby into Christ’s arms; and he who came a fugitive, returns a
          Christian (Philem. 10, 15). Some, by a strong affliction, have had by
          the Divine sovereignty their understandings awakened to consider, and
          their wills spirited to conversion. Monica being called Meribibula, or
          toss‑pot, was brought to consider her way, and reform her life. A word
          hath done that at one time, which hath often before fallen without any
          fruit. Many have come to suck in the eloquence of the minister, and
          have found in the honey for their ears a sting for their consciences.
          Austin had no other intent in going to hear Ambrose but to have a
          taste of his famous oratory. But while Ambrose spake a language to his
          ear, God spake a heavenly dialect to his heart. No reason can be
          rendered of the order, and timing, and influence of those things, but
          the sovereign pleasure of God, who will attend one occasion and season
          with his blessing, and not another.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. The dominion of God is manifest in disposing of the lives of men.
          He keeps the key of death, as well as that of the womb, in his own
          hand; he hath given man a life, but not power to dispose of it, or lay
          it down at his pleasure; and therefore he hath ordered man not to
          murder, not another, not himself; man must expect his call and grant,
          to dispose of the life of his body. Why doth he cut the thread of this
          man’s life, and spin another’s out to a longer term? Why doth one die
          an inglorious death, and another more honorable? One silently drops
          away in the multitude, while another is made a sacrifice for the honor
          of God, or the safety of his country. This is a mark of honor he gives
          to one and not to another. “To you it is given” (Phil. i. 29). The
          manner of Peter’s death was appointed (John xxi. 19). Why doth a small
          and slight disease against the rules of physic, and the judgment of
          the best practitioners, dislodge one man’s soul out of his body, while
          a greater disease is mastered in another, and discharges the patient,
          to enjoy himself a longer time in the land of the living? Is it the
          effect of means so much as of the Sovereign Disposer of all things? If
          means only did it, the same means would always work the same effect,
          and sooner master a dwarfish than a giant‑like distemper. “Our times
          are only in God’s hands” (Ps. xxxi. 15); either to cut short or
          continue long. As his sovereignty made the first marriage knot, so he
          reserves the sole authority to himself to make the divorce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly. The dominion of God is manifest in his being a Redeemer, as
          well as Lawgiver, Proprietor, and Governor. His sovereignty was
          manifest in the creation, in bestowing upon this or that part of
          matter a form more excellent than upon another. He was a Lawgiver to
          men and angels, and prescribed them rules according to the counsel of
          his own will. These were his creatures, and perfectly at his disposal.
          But in redemption a sovereignty is exercised over the Son, the Second
          person in the Trinity, one equal with the Father in essence and works,
          by whom the worlds were created, and by whom they do consist. The
          whole gospel is nothing else but a declaration of his sovereign
          pleasure concerning Christ, and concerning us in him; it is therefore
          called “the mystery of his will” (Eph. i. 9); the will of God is
          distinct from the will of Christ, a purpose in himself, not moved
          thereunto by any; the whole design was framed in the Deity, and as
          much the purpose of his sovereign will as the contrivance of his
          immense wisdom. He decreed, in his own pleasure, to have the Second
          Person assume our nature for to deliver mankind from that misery
          whereinto it was fallen. The whole of the gospel, and the privileges
          of it, are in that chapter resolved into the will and pleasure of God.
          God is therefore called “the head of Christ” (1 Cor. xi. 3). As Christ
          is superior to all men, and the man superior to the woman, so is God
          superior to Christ, and of a more eminent dignity; in regard of the
          constituting him mediator, Christ is subject to God, as the body to
          the head. “Head” is a title of government and sovereignty, and
          magistrates were called the “heads” of the people. As Christ is the
          head of man, so is God the head of Christ; and as man is subject to
          Christ, so is Christ subject to God; not in regard of the Divine
          nature, wherein there is an equality, and consequently no dominion of
          jurisdiction; nor only in his human nature, but in the economy of a
          Redeemer, considered as one designed, and consenting to be incarnate,
          and take our flesh; so that after this agreement, God had a sovereign
          right to dispose of him according to the articles consented to. In
          regard of his undertaking, and the advantage he was to bring to the
          elect of God upon the earth, he calls God by the solemn title of “his
          Lord” in that prophetic psalm of him (Ps. xvi. 2): “O my soul, thou
          hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extends not
          unto thee, but unto the saints that are in the earth.” It seems to be
          the speech of Christ in heaven, mentioning the saints on earth as at a
          distance from him. I can add nothing to the glory of thy majesty, but
          the whole fruit of my meditation and sufferings will redound to the
          saints on earth. And it may be observed, that God is called the Lord
          of Hosts in the evangelical prophets, Isaiah, Haggai, Zachariah, and
          Malachi, more in reference to this affair of redemption, and the
          deliverance of the church, than for any other works of his providence
          in the world.

          1. This sovereignty of God appears, in requiring satisfaction for the
          sin of man. Had he indulged man after his fall, and remitted his
          offence without a just compensation for the injury he had received by
          his rebellion, his authority had been vilified, man would always have
          been attempting against his jurisdiction, there would have been a
          continual succession of rebellions on man’s part; and if a continual
          succession of indulgences on God’s part, he had quite disowned his
          authority over man, and stripped himself of the flower of his crown;
          satisfaction must have been required some time or other from the
          person thus rebelling, or some other in his stead; and to require it
          after the first act of sin, was more preservative to the right of the
          Divine sovereignty, than to do it after a multitude of repeated
          revolts. God must have laid aside his authority if he had laid aside
          wholly the exacting punishment for the offence of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. This sovereignty of God appears, in appointing Christ to this work
          of redemption. His sovereignty was before manifest over angels and men
          by the right of creation; there was nothing wanting to declare the
          highest charge of it, but his ordering his own Son to become a mortal
          creature; the Lord of all things to become lower than those angels
          that had, as well as all other things, received their being and beauty
          from him, and to be reckoned in his death among the dust and refuse of
          the world: he by whom God created all things, not only became a man,
          but a crucified man, by the will of his Father (Gal. i. 4), “who gave
          himself for our sins according to the will of God;” to which may refer
          that expression (Prov. viii. 22), of his being “possessed by God in
          the beginning of his way.” Possession is the dominion of a thing
          invested in the possessor; he was possessed, indeed, as a Son by
          eternal generation; he was possessed also in the beginning of his way
          or works of creation, as a Mediator by special constitution: to this
          the expression seems to refer, if you read on to the end of ver. 31,
          wherein Christ speaks of his “rejoicing in the habitable part of his
          earth,” the earth of the great God, who hath designed him to this
          special work of redemption. He was a Son by nature, but a Mediator by
          Divine will; in regard of which Christ is often called God’s servant,
          which is a relation to God as a Lord. God being the Lord of all
          things, the dominion of all things inferior to him is inseparable from
          him; and in this regard, the whole of what Christ was to do, and did
          actually do, was acted by him as the will of God, and is expressed so
          by himself in the prophecy (Ps. xl. 7), “Lo, I come;” (ver. 8), “I
          delight to do thy will;” which are put together (Heb. x. 7), “Lo, I
          come to do thy will, O God.” The designing Christ to this work was an
          act of mercy, but founded on his sovereignty. His compassionate bowels
          might have pitied us without his being sovereign, but without it could
          not have relieved us. It was the council of his own will, as well as
          of his bowels: none was his counsellor or persuader to that mercy he
          showed: (Rom. xi. 34), “Who hath been his counsellor?” for it refers
          to that mercy in “sending the Deliverer out of Sion” (ver. 26), as
          well as to other things the apostle had been discoursing of. As God
          was at liberty to create, or not to create, so he was at liberty to
          redeem or not to redeem, and at his liberty whether to appoint Christ
          to this work, or not to call him out to it. In giving this order to
          his Son, his sovereignty was exercised in a higher manner than in all
          the orders and instructions he hath given out to men or angels, and
          all the employments he ever sent them upon. Christ hath names which
          signify an authority over him: he is called “an Angel,” and a
          “Messenger” (Mal. iii. 1); an “Apostle” (Heb. iii. 1): declaring
          thereby, that God hath as much authority over him as over the angels
          sent upon his messages, or over the apostles commissioned by his
          authority, as he was considered in the quality of Mediator.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This sovereignty of God appears in transferring our sins upon
          Christ. The supreme power in a nation can only appoint or allow of a
          commutation of punishment; it is a part of sovereignty to transfer the
          penalty due to the crime of one upon another, and substitute a
          sufferer, with the sufferer’s own consent, in the place of a criminal,
          whom he had a mind to deliver from a deserved punishment. God
          transferred the sins of men upon Christ, and inflicted on him a
          punishment for them. He summed up the debts of man, charged them upon
          the score of Christ, imputing to him the guilt, and inflicting upon
          him the penalty. (Isa. liii. 6): “The Lord hath laid upon him the
          iniquity of us all;” he made them all to meet upon his back: “He hath
          made him to be sin for us” (2 Cor. v. 21); he was made so by the
          sovereign pleasure of God: a punishment for sin, as most understand
          it, which could not be righteously inflicted, had not sin been first
          righteously imputed, by the consent of Christ, and the order of the
          Judge of the world. This imputation could be the immediate act of none
          but God, because he was the sole creditor. A creditor is not bound to
          accept of another’s suretyship, but it is at his liberty whether he
          will or no; and when he doth accept of him, he may challenge the debt
          of him, as if he were the principal debtor himself. Christ made
          himself sin for us by a voluntary submission; and God made him sin for
          us by a full imputation, and treated him penally, as he would have
          done those sinners in whose stead he suffered. Without this act of
          sovereignty in God, we had forever perished: for if we could suppose
          Christ laying down his life for us without the pleasure and order of
          God, he could not have been said to have borne our punishment. What
          could he have undergone in his humanity but a temporal death? But more
          than this was due to us, even the wrath of God, which far exceeds the
          calamity of a mere bodily death. The soul being principal in the
          crime, was to be principal in the punishment. The wrath of God could
          not have dropped upon his soul, and rendered it so full of agonies,
          without the hand of God: a creature is not capable to reach the soul,
          neither as to comfort nor terror; and the justice of God could not
          have made him a sufferer, if it had not first considered him a sinner
          by imputation, or by inherency, and actual commission of a crime in
          his own person. The latter was far from Christ, who was holy,
          harmless, and undefiled. He must be considered then in the other state
          of imputation, which could not be without a sovereign appointment, or
          at least concession of God: for without it, he could have no more
          authority to lay down his life for us, than Abraham could have had to
          have sacrificed his son, or any man to expose himself to death without
          a call; nor could any plea have been entered in the court of heaven,
          either by Christ for us, or by us for ourselves. And though the death
          of so great a person had been meritorious in itself, it had not been
          meritorious for us, or accepted for us; Christ is “delivered up by
          him” (Rom. viii. 32), in every part of that condition wherein he was,
          and suffered; and to that end, that “we might become the righteousness
          of God in him” (2 Cor. v. 21): that we might have the righteousness of
          him that was God imputed to us, or that we might have a righteousness
          as great and proportioned to the righteousness of God, as God
          required. It was an act of Divine sovereignty to account him that was
          righteous a sinner in our stead, and to account us, who were sinners,
          righteous upon the merit of his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. This was done by the command of God; by God as a Lawgiver, having
          the supreme legislative and preceptive authority: in which respect,
          the whole work of Christ is said to be an answer to a law, not one
          given him, but put into his heart, as the law of nature was in the
          heart of man at first. (Ps. xl. 7, 8): “Thy law is within my heart.”
          This law was not the law of nature or moral law, though that was also
          in the heart of Christ, but the command of doing those things which
          were necessary for our salvation, and not a command so much of doing,
          as of dying. The moral law in the heart of Christ would have done us
          no good without the mediatory law; we had been where we were by the
          sole observance of the precepts of the moral law, without his
          suffering the penalty of it: the law in the heart of Christ was the
          law of suffering, or dying, the doing that for us by his death which
          the blood of sacrifices was unable to effect. Legal “sacrifices thou
          wouldest not; thy law is within my heart;” i. e. thy law ordered me to
          be a sacrifice; it was that law, his obedience to which was
          principally accepted and esteemed, and that was principally his
          passive, his obedience to death (Phil. ii. 8); this was the special
          command received from God, that he should die (John x. 18). It is not
          so clearly manifested when this command was given, whether after the
          incarnation of Christ, or at the point of his constitution as
          Mediator, upon the transaction between the Father and the Son
          concerning the affair of redemption: the promise was given “before the
          world began” (Tit. i. 2). Might not the precept be given, before the
          world began, to Christ, as considered in the quality of Mediator and
          Redeemer? Precepts and promises usually attend one another; every
          covenant is made up of both. Christ, considered here as the Son of God
          in the Divine nature, was not capable of a command or promise; but
          considered in the relation of Mediator between God and man, he was
          capable of both. Promises of assistance were made before his actual
          incarnation, of which the Prophets are full: why not precepts for his
          obedience, since long before his incarnation this was his speech in
          the Prophet, “Thy law is within my heart!” however, a command, a law
          it was, which is a fruit of the Divine sovereignty; that as the
          sovereignty of God was impeached and violated by the disobedience of
          Adam, it might be owned and vindicated by the obedience of Christ;
          that as we fell by disloyalty to it, we might rise by the highest
          submission to it in another head, infinitely superior in his person to
          Adam, by whom we fell.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. This sovereignty of God appears in exalting Christ to such a
          sovereign dignity as our Redeemer. Some, indeed, say, that this
          sovereignty of Christ’s human nature was natural, and the right of it
          resulted from its union with the Divine; as a lady of mean condition,
          when espoused and married to a prince, hath, by virtue of that, a
          natural right to some kind of jurisdiction over the whole kingdom,
          because she is one with the king.1014 But to waive this; the Scripture
          placeth wholly the conferring such an authority upon the pleasure and
          will of God. As Christ was a gift of God’s sovereign will to us, so
          this was a gift of God’s sovereign will to Christ (Matt. xxviii. 28):
          “All power is given me.” And he “gave him to be head over all things
          to the church” (Eph. i. 22); “God gave him a name above every name”
          (Phil. ii. 9); and, therefore, his throne he sits upon is called “The
          throne of his Father” (Rev. iii. 21). And he “committed all judgment
          to the Son,” i. e. all government and dominion; an empire in heaven
          and earth (John v. 22); and that because he is “the Son of Man” (ver.
          27); which may understood, that the Father hath given him authority to
          exercise that judgment and government as the Son of Man, which he
          originally had as the Son of God; or rather, because he became a
          servant, and humbled himself to death, he gives him this authority as
          the reward of his obedience and humility, conformable to Phil. ii. 9.
          This is an act of the high sovereignty of God, to obscure his own
          authority in a sense, and take into association with him, or vicarious
          subordination to him, the human nature of Christ as united to the
          Divine; not only lifting it above the heads of all the angels, but
          giving that person in our nature an empire over them, whose nature was
          more excellent than ours: yea, the sovereignty of God appears in the
          whole management of this kingly office of Christ; for it is managed in
          every part of it according to God’s order (Ezek. xxxvii. 24, 25):
          “David, my servant, shall be king over them,” and “my servant David
          shall be their prince forever:” he shall be a prince over them, but my
          servant in that principality, in the exercise and duration of it. The
          sovereignty of God is paramount in all that Christ hath done as a
          priest, or shall do as a king.

          1. How great is the contempt of this sovereignty of God! Man naturally
          would be free from God’s empire, to be a slave under the dominion of
          his own lust; the sovereignty of God, as a Lawgiver, is most abhorred
          by man (Lev. xxvi. 43). The Israelites, the best people in the world,
          were apt, by nature, not only to despise, but abhor, his statutes;
          there is not a law of God but the corrupt heart of man hath an
          abhorrency of: how often do men wish that God had not enacted this or
          that law that goes against the grain! and, in wishing so, wish that he
          were no sovereign, or not such a sovereign as he is in his own nature,
          but one according to their corrupt model. This is the great quarrel
          between God and man, whether he or they shall be the Sovereign Ruler.
          He should not, by the will of man, rule in any one village in the
          world; God’s vote should not be predominant in any one thing. There is
          not a law of his but is exposed to contempt by the perverseness of man
          (Prov. i. 21): “Ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would have
          none of my reproof:” Septuag. “Ye have made all my counsels without
          authority.” The nature of man cannot endure one precept of God, nor
          one rebuke from him; and for this cause God is at the expense of
          judgments in the world, to assert his own empire to the teeth and
          consciences of men (Ps. lix. 13): “Lord, consume them in wrath, and
          let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of the earth.” The
          dominion of God is not slighted by any creature of this world but man;
          all others observe it by observing his order, whether in their natural
          motions or preternatural irruptions; they punctually act according to
          their commission. Man only speaks a dialect against the strain of the
          whole creation, and hath none to imitate him among all the creatures
          in heaven and earth, but only among those in hell: man is more
          impatient of the yoke of God than of the yoke of man. There are not so
          many rebellions committed by inferiors against their superiors and
          fellow‑creatures, as are committed against God. A willing and easy
          sinning is an equalling the authority of God to that of man (Hos. vi.
          7): “They, like men, have transgressed my covenant;” they have made no
          more account of breaking my covenant than if they had broken some
          league or compact made with a mere man; so slightly do they esteem the
          authority of God; such a disesteem of the Divine authority is a
          virtual undeifying of him.1015 To slight his sovereignty is to stab
          his Deity; since the one cannot be preserved without the support of
          the other, his life would expire with his authority. How base and
          brutish is it for vile dust and mouldering clay to lift up itself
          against the majesty of God, whose throne is in the heavens, who sways
          his sceptre over all parts of the world—a Majesty before whom the
          devils shake, and the highest cherubims tremble! It is as if the
          thistle, that can presently be trod down by the foot of a wild beast,
          should think itself a match for the cedar of Lebanon, as the phrase
          is, 2 Kings xiv. 9.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us consider this in general; and, also, in the ordinary practice
          of men. First, In general.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) All sin in its nature is a contempt of the Divine dominion. As
          every act of obedience is a confirmation of the law, and consequently
          a subscription of the authority of the Lawgiver (Deut. xxvii. 26), so
          every breach to it is a conspiracy against the sovereignty of the
          Lawgiver; setting up our will against the will of God is an articling
          against his authority, as setting up our reason against the methods of
          God is an articling against his wisdom; the intendment of every act of
          sin is to wrest the sceptre out of God’s hand. The authority of God is
          the first attribute in the Deity which it directs its edge against; it
          is called, therefore, a “transgression of his law” (1 John iii. 4),
          and, therefore, a slight, or neglect, of the majesty of God; and the
          not keeping his commands is called a “forgetting God” (Deut. viii.
          11), i. e. a forgetting him to be our absolute Lord. As the first
          notion we have of God as a Creator is that of his sovereignty, so the
          first perfection that sin struck at, in the violation of the law, was
          his sovereignty as a Lawgiver. “Breaking the law is a dishonoring God”
          (Rom. ii. 23), a snatching off his crown; to obey our own wills before
          the will of God, is to prefer ourselves as our own sovereigns before
          him. Sin is a wrong, and injury to God, not in his essence, that is
          above the reach of a creature, nor in anything profitable to him, or
          pertaining to his own intrinsic advantage; not an injury to God in
          himself, but in his authority, in those things which pertain to his
          glory; a disowning his due right, and not using his goods according to
          his will. Thus the whole world may be called, as God calls Chaldea, “a
          land of rebels” (Jer. l. 21): “Go up against the land of Merathaim,”
          or rebels: rebels, not against the Jews, but against God. The mighty
          opposition in the heart of man to the supremacy of God is discovered
          emphatically by the apostle (Rom. viii. 7) in that expression, “The
          carnal mind is enmity against God,” i. e. against the authority of
          God, because “it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
          be.” It refuseth not subjection to this or that part, but to the
          whole; to every mark of Divine authority in it; it will not lay down
          its arms against it, nay, it cannot but stand upon its terms against
          it; the law can no more be fulfilled by a carnal mind, than it can be
          disowned by a sovereign God. God is so holy, that he cannot alter a
          righteous law, and man is so averse, that he cares not for, nay,
          cannot fulfil, one title; so much doth the nature of man swell against
          the majesty of God. Now an enmity to the law, which is in every sin,
          implies a perversity against the authority of God that enacted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) All sin, in its nature, is the despoiling God of his sole
          sovereignty, which was probably the first thing the devil aimed at.
          That pride was the sin of the devil, the Scripture gives us some
          account of, when the apostle adviseth not a novice, or one that hath
          but lately embraced the faith, to be chosen a bishop (1 Tim. iii. 6),
          “Lest, being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of
          the devil;” lest he fall into the same sin for which the devil was
          condemned. But in what particular thing this pride was manifest, is
          not so easily discernible; the ancients generally conceived it to be
          an affecting the throne of God, grounding it on Isa. xiv. 12: “How art
          thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning! for thou hast said in thy
          heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
          stars of God.” It is certain the prophet speaks there of the king of
          Babylon, and taxeth him for his pride, and gives to him the title of
          “Lucifer,” perhaps likening him in his pride to the devil, and then it
          notes plainly the particular sin of the devil, attempting a share in
          the sovereignty of God; and some strengthen their conjecture from the
          name of the archangel who contended against Satan (Jude 9), which is
          Michael, which signifies, “Who as God?” or, “Who like God?” the name
          of the angel giving the superiority to God, intimating the contrary
          disposition in the devil, against whom he contended. It is likely his
          sin was an affecting equality with God in empire, or a freedom from
          the sovereign authority of God; because he imprinted such a kind of
          persuasion on man at his first temptation: “Ye shall be as gods” (Gen.
          iii. 5); and though it be restrained to the matter of knowledge, yet
          that being a fitness for government, it may be extended to that also.
          But it is plainly a persuading them, that they might be, in some sort,
          equal with God, and independent on him as their superior. What he had
          found so fatal to himself, he imagined would have the same success in
          the ruin of man. And since the devil hath, in all ages of the world,
          usurped a worship to himself which is only due to God, and would be
          served by man, as if he were the God of the world; since all his
          endeavor was to be worshipped as the Supreme God on earth, it is not
          unreasonable to think, that he invaded the supremacy of God in heaven,
          and endeavored to be like the Most High before his banishment, as he
          hath attempted to be like the Most High since. And since the devil and
          antichrist are reputed by John, in the Revelation, to be so near of
          kin, and so like in disposition, why might not that, which is the sin
          of antichrist, the image of him, be also the sin of Satan, “to exalt
          himself above all that is called God” (2 Thess. ii. 4), and “sit as
          God in his temple,” affecting a partnership in his throne and worship?
          Whether it was this, or attempting an unaccountable dominion over
          created things, or because he was the prime angel, and the most
          illustrious of that magnificent corporation, he might think himself
          fit to reign with God over all things else? Or if his sin were envy,
          as some think, at the felicity of man in paradise, it was still a
          quarrelling with God’s dominion, and right of disposing his own goods
          and favors; he is, therefore, called “Belial” (2 Cor. vi. 14, 15):
          “What concord hath Christ with Belial?” i. e. with the devil, one
          “without yoke,” as the word “Belial” signifies.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) It is more plain, that this was the sin of Adam. The first act of
          Adam was to exercise a lordship over the lower creatures, in giving
          names to them,—a token of dominion (Gen. ii. 19). The next was to
          affect a lordship over God, in rebelling against him. After he had
          writ the first mark of his own delegated dominion, in the names he
          gave the creatures, and owned their dependence on him as their
          governor, he would not acknowledge his own dependence on God. As soon
          as the Lord of the world had put him into possession of the power he
          had allotted him, he attempted to strip his Lord of that which he had
          reserved to himself; he was not content to lay a yoke upon the other
          creatures, but desirous to shake off the Divine yoke from himself, and
          be subject to none but his own will; hence Adam’s sin is more
          particularly called “disobedience” (Rom. v. 19): for, in the eating
          the apple, there was no moral evil in itself, but a contradiction to
          the positive command and order of God, whereby he did disown God’s
          right of commanding him, or reserving anything from him to his own
          use. The language all his posterity speaks, “Let us break his bands,
          and cast away his cords from us” (Ps. ii. 3), was learned from Adam in
          that act of his. The next act we read of, was that of Cain’s murdering
          Abel, which was an invading God’s right, in assuming an authority to
          dispose of the life of his brother,—a life which God had given him,
          and reserved the period of it in his own hands. And he persists in the
          same usurpation when God came to examine him, and ask him where his
          brother was; how scornful was his answer! (Gen. iv. 9): “Am I my
          brother’s keeper?” as much as if he had said, What have you to do to
          examine me? or, What obligation is there upon me to render an account
          of him? or, as one saith, it is as much as if he had said, “Go, look
          for him yourself.”1016 The sovereignty of God did not remain
          undisturbed as soon as ever it appeared in creation; the devils
          rebelled against it in heaven, and man would have banished it from the
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) The sovereignty of God hath not been less invaded by the
          usurpations of men. One single order of the Roman episcopacy hath
          endeavored to usurp the prerogatives of God; the Pope will prohibit
          what God hath allowed; the marriage of priests; the receiving of the
          cup, as well as of the bread, in the sacrament; the eating of this or
          that sort of meat at special times, meats which God hath sanctified;
          and forbid them, too, upon pain of damnation. It is an invasion of
          God’s right to forbid the use of what God hath granted, as though the
          earth, and the fulness thereof, were no longer the Lord’s, but the
          Pope’s; much more to forbid what God hath commanded, as if Christ
          overreached his own authority, when he enjoined all to drink of the
          sacramental wine, as well as eat of the sacramental bread. No lord but
          will think his right usurped by that steward who shall permit to
          others what his lord forbids, and forbid that which his master allows,
          and act the lord instead of the servant. Add to this the pardons of
          many sins, as if he had the sole key to the treasures of Divine mercy;
          the disposing of crowns and dominions at his pleasure, as if God had
          divested himself of the title of King of kings, and transferred it
          upon the see of Rome. The allowing public stews, dispensing with
          incestuous marriages, as if God had acted more the part of a tyrant
          than of a righteous Sovereign in forbidding them, depriving the Jews
          of the propriety in their estates upon their conversion to
          Christianity, as if the pilfering men’s goods were the way to teach
          them self‑denial, the first doctrine of Christian religion; and God
          shall have no honor from the Jew without a breach of his law by theft
          from the Christian. Granting many years’ indulgences upon slight
          performances, the repeating so many Ave‑Marias and Pater‑Nosters in a
          day, canonizing saints, claiming the keys of heaven, and disposing of
          the honors and glory of it, and proposing creatures as objects of
          religious worship, wherein he answers the character of the apostle (2
          Thess. ii. 4), “showing himself that he is God,” in challenging that
          power which is only the right of Divine sovereignty; exalting himself
          above God, in indulging those things which the law of God never
          allowed, but hath severely prohibited. This controlling the
          sovereignty of God, not allowing him the rights of his crown, is the
          soul and spirit of many errors. Why are the decrees of election and
          preterition denied? Because men will not acknowledge God the Sovereign
          Disposer of his creature. Why is effectual calling and efficacious
          grace denied? Because they will not allow God the proprietor and
          distributer of his own goods. Why is the satisfaction of Christ
          denied? Because they will not allow God a power to vindicate his own
          law in what way he pleaseth. Most of the errors of men may be resolved
          into a denial of God’s sovereignty; all have a tincture of the first
          evil sentiment of Adam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly. The sovereignty of God is contemned in the practices of
          men—(1.) As he is a Lawgiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] When laws are made, and urged in any state contrary to the law of
          God. It is part of God’s sovereignty to be a Lawgiver; not to obey his
          law is a breach made upon his right of government; but it is treason
          in any against the crown of God, to mint laws with a stamp contrary to
          that of heaven, whereby they renounce their due subjection, and vie
          with God for dominion, snatch the supremacy from him, and account
          themselves more lords than the Sovereign Monarch of the world. When
          men will not let God be the judge of good and evil, but put in their
          own vote, controlling his to establish their own; such are not content
          to be as gods, subordinate to the supreme God, to sit at his feet; nor
          co‑ordinate with him, to sit equal upon his throne; but paramount to
          him, to over‑top and shadow his crown;—a boldness that leaves the
          serpent, in the first temptation, under the character of a more
          commendable modesty; who advised our first parents to attempt to be as
          gods, but not above him, and would enervate a law of God, but not
          enact a contrary one to be observed by them. Such was the usurpation
          of Nebuchadnezzar, to set up a golden image to be adored (Dan. iii.),
          as if he had power to mint gods, as well as to conquer men; to set the
          stamp of a Deity upon a piece of gold, as well as his own effigies
          upon his current coin. Much of the same nature was that of Darius, by
          the motion of his flatterers, to prohibit any petition to be made to
          God for the space of thirty days, as though God was not to have a
          worship without a license from a doting piece of clay (Dan. vi. 7). So
          Henry the Third of France, by his edict, silenced masters of families
          from praying with their households.1017 And it is a farther contempt
          of God’s authority, when good men are oppressed by the sole weight of
          power, for not observing such laws, as if they had a real sovereignty
          over the consciences of men, more than God himself.1018 When the
          apostles were commanded by an angel from God, to preach in the Temple
          the doctrine of Christ (Acts v. 19, 20), they were fetched from thence
          with a guard before the council (ver. 6). And what is the language of
          those statesmen to them? as absolute as God himself could speak to any
          transgressors of his law. “Did not we straitly command you, that you
          should not teach in this name?” (ver. 28). It is sufficient that we
          gave you a command to be silent, and publish no more this doctrine of
          Jesus; it is not for you to examine our decrees, but rest in our order
          as loyal subjects, and comply with your rulers; they might have
          added,—though it be with the damnation of your souls. How would those
          overrule the apostles by no other reason but their absolute pleasure!
          And though God had espoused their cause, by delivering them out of the
          prison, wherein they had locked them the day before, yet not one of
          all this council had the wit or honesty to entitle it a fighting
          against God, but Gamaliel (ver. 29). So foolishly fond are men to put
          themselves in the place of God, and usurp a jurisdiction over men’s
          consciences: and to presume that laws made against the interest and
          command of God, must be of more force than the laws of God’s enacting.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] The sovereignty of God is contemned in making additions to the
          laws of God. The authority of a sovereign Lawgiver is invaded and
          vilified when an inferior presumes to make orders equivalent to his
          edicts. It is a præmunire against heaven to set up an authority
          distinct from that of God, or to enjoin anything as necessary in
          matter of worship for which a Divine commission cannot be shown. God
          was always so tender of this part of his prerogative, that he would
          not have anything wrought in the tabernacle, not a vessel, not an
          instrument, but what himself had prescribed. “According to all that I
          show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all
          the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it” (Exod. xxv. 9);
          which is strictly urged again, ver. 40: “Look that thou make them
          after their pattern;” look to it, beware of doing anything of thine
          own head, and justling with my authority. It was so afterwards in the
          matter of the temple, which succeeded the tabernacle; God gave the
          model of it to David, and made him “understand in writing by his hand
          upon him, even all the works of this pattern” (1 Chron. xxviii. 19).
          Neither the royal authority in Moses, who was king in Jesurun; nor in
          David, who was a man after God’s own heart, and called to the crown by
          a special and extraordinary providence; nor Aaron, and the high
          priests his successors, invested in the sacerdotal office, had any
          authority from God, to do anything in the framing the tabernacle or
          temple of their own heads. God barred them from anything of that
          nature, by giving them an exact pattern, so dear to him was always
          this flower of his crown. And afterwards, the power of appointing
          officers and ordinances in the church was delegated to Christ, and was
          among the rest of those royalties given to him, which he fully
          completed “for the edifying of the body” (Eph. iv. 11, 12); and he
          hath the eulogy by the Spirit of God, to be “faithful as Moses was in
          all his house, to Him that appointed him” (Heb. iii. 2). Faithfulness
          in a trust implies a punctual observing directions; God was still so
          tender of this, that even Christ, the Son, should no more do anything
          in this concern without appointment and pattern, than “Moses, a
          servant” (ver. 5, 6). It seems to be a vote of nature to refer the
          original of the modes of all worship to God; and therefore in all
          those varieties of ceremonies among the heathens, there was scarce any
          but were imagined by them to be the dictates and orders of some of
          their pretended deities, and not the resolves of mere human authority.
          What intrusion upon God’s right hath the papacy made in regard of
          officers, cardinals, patriarchs, &amp;c., not known in any Divine
          order? In regard of ceremonies in worship, pressed as necessary to
          obtain the favor of God, holy water, crucifixes, altars, images,
          cringings, reviving many of the Jewish and Pagan ceremonies, and
          adopting them into the family of Christian ordinances; as if God had
          been too absolute and arbitrary in repealing the one, and dashing in
          pieces the other. When God had by his sovereign order framed a
          religion for the heart, men are ready to usurp an authority to frame
          one for the sense, to dress the ordinances of God in new and gaudy
          habits, to take the eye by a vain pomp; thus affecting a Divine
          royalty, and acting a silly childishness; and after this, to impose
          the observation of those upon the consciences of men, is a bold ascent
          into the throne of God; to impose laws upon the conscience, which
          Christ hath not imposed, hath deservedly been thought the very spirit
          of antichrist; it may be called also the spirit of anti‑god. God hath
          reserved to himself the sole sovereignty over the conscience, and
          never indulged men any part of it; he hath not given man a power over
          his own conscience, much less one man a power over another’s
          conscience. Men have a power over outward things to do this or that,
          where it is determined by the law of God, but not the least authority
          to control any dictate or determination of conscience: the sole empire
          of that is appropriate to God, as one of the great marks of his
          royalty. What an usurpation is it of God’s right to make conscience a
          slave to man, which God hath solely, as the Father of spirits,
          subjected to himself!—an usurpation which, though the apostles, those
          extraordinary officers, might better have claimed, yet they utterly
          disowned any imperious dominion over the faith of others (2 Cor. i.
          24). Though in this they do not seem to climb up above God, yet they
          set themselves in the throne of God, envy him an absolute monarchy,
          would be sharers with him in his legislative power, and grasp one end
          of his sceptre in their own hands. They do not pretend to take the
          crown from God’s head, but discover a bold ambition to shuffle their
          hairy scalps under it, and wear part of it upon their own, that they
          may rule with him, not under him; and would be joint lords of his
          manor with him, who hath, by the apostle, forbidden any to be “lords
          of his heritage” (1 Pet. v. 3): and therefore they cannot assume such
          an authority to themselves till they can show where God hath resigned
          this part of his authority to them. If their exposition of that place
          (Matt. xvi. 18), “Upon this rock I will build my church,” be granted
          to be true, and that the person and successors of Peter are meant by
          that rock, it could be no apology for their usurpations; it is not
          Peter and his successors shall build, but “I will build;” others are
          instruments in building, but they are to observe the directions of the
          grand Architect.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] The sovereignty of God is contemned when men prefer obedience to
          men’s laws before obedience to God. As God hath an undoubted right, as
          the Lawgiver and Ruler of the world, to enact laws without consulting
          the pleasure of men, or requiring their consent to the verifying and
          establishing his edicts, so are men obliged, by their allegiance as
          subjects, to observe the laws of their Creator, without consulting
          whether they be agreeable to the laws of his revolted creatures. To
          consult with flesh and blood whether we should obey, is to authorize
          flesh and blood above the purest and most sovereign Spirit. When men
          will obey their superiors, without taking in the condition the apostle
          prescribes to servants (Col. iii. 22), “In singleness of heart fearing
          God,” and postpone the fear of God to the fear of man, it is to render
          God of less power with them than the drop of a bucket, or dust of the
          balance. When we, out of fear of punishment, will observe the laws of
          men against the laws of God, it is like the Egyptians, to worship a
          ravenous crocodile instead of a Deity; when we submit to human laws,
          and stagger at Divine, it is to set man upon the throne of God, and
          God at the footstool of man; to set man above, and God beneath; to
          make him the tail, and not the head, as God speaks in another case of
          Israel (Deut. xxviii. 13). When we pay an outward observation to
          Divine laws, because they are backed by the laws of man, and human
          authority is the motive of our observance, we subject God’s
          sovereignty to man’s authority; what he hath from us, is more owing to
          the pleasure of men than any value we have for the empire of God: when
          men shall commit murders, and imbrue their hands in blood by the order
          of a grandee; when the worst sins shall be committed by the order of
          papal dispensations; when the use of his creatures, which God hath
          granted and sanctified, shall be abstained from for so many days in
          the week, and so many weeks in the year, because of a Roman edict, the
          authority of man is acknowledged, not only equal, but superior, to
          that of God; the dominion of dust and clay is preferred before the
          undoubted right of the Sovereign of the world; the commands of God are
          made less than human, and the orders of men more authoritative than
          Divine, and a grand rebel’s usurpation of God’s right is countenanced.
          When men are more devout in observance of uncertain traditions, or
          mere human inventions, than at the hearing of the unquestionable
          oracles of God; when men shall squeeze their countenances into a more
          serious figure, and demean themselves in a more religious posture, at
          the appearance of some mock ceremony, clothed in a Jewish or Pagan
          garb, which hath unhappily made a rent in the coat of Christ, and pay
          a more exact reverence to that which hath no Divine, but only a human
          stamp upon it, than to the clear and plain word of God, which is
          perhaps neglected with sleepy nods, or which is worse, entertained
          with profane scoffs;—this is to prefer the authority of man employed
          in trifles, before the authority of the wise Lawgiver of the world:
          besides, the ridiculousness of it is as great as to adore a glow‑worm,
          and laugh at the sun; or for a courtier to be more exact in his
          cringes and starched postures before a puppet than before his
          sovereign prince. In all this we make not the will and authority of
          God our rule, but the will of man; disclaim our dependence on God, to
          hang upon the uncertain breath of a creature. In all this God is made
          less than man, and man more than God; God is deposed, and man
          enthroned; God made a slave, and man a sovereign above him. To this we
          may refer the solemn addresses of some for the maintenance of the
          Protestant religion according to law, the law of man; not so much
          minding the law of God, resolving to make the law, the church, the
          state, the rule of their religion, and change that if the laws be
          changed, steering their opinions by the compass of the magistrate’s
          judgment and interest.

          [1.] By envy. When we are not flush and gay, as well spread and
          sparkling as others, this passion gnaws our souls, and we become the
          executioners to rack ourselves, because God is the executor of his own
          pleasure. The foundation of this passion is a quarrel with God; to
          envy others the enjoyment of their propriety is to envy God his right
          of disposal, and, consequently, the propriety of his own goods; it is
          a mental theft committed against God; we rob him of his right in our
          will and wish; it is a robbery to make ourselves equal with God when
          it is not our due, which is implied (Phil. ii. 6), when Christ is said
          “to think it no robbery to be equal with God.” We would wrest the
          sceptre out of his hand, wish he were not the conductor of the world,
          and that he would resign his sovereignty, and the right of the
          distribution of his own goods, to the capricios of our humor, and ask
          our leave to what subjects he should dispense his favors. All envy is
          either a tacit accusation of God as an usurper, and assuming a right
          to dispose of that which doth not belong to him, and so it is a denial
          of his propriety, or else charges him with a blind or unjust
          distribution, and so it is a bespattering his wisdom and
          righteousness. When God doth punish envy, he vindicates his own
          sovereignty, as though this passion chiefly endeavored to blast this
          perfection (Ezek. xxv. 11, 12): “As I live, saith the Lord, I will do
          according to thy anger, and according to thy envy, and thou shall know
          that I am the Lord.” The sin of envy in the devils was immediately
          against the crown of God, and so was the sin of envy in the first man,
          envying God the sole prerogative in knowledge above himself. This base
          humor in Cain, at the preference of Abel’s sacrifice before his, was
          the cause that he deprived him of his life: denying God, first his
          right of choice and what he should accept, and then invading God’s
          right of propriety, in usurping a power over the life and being of his
          brother, which solely belonged to God.

          [2.] The dominion of God, as a proprietor, is practically contemned by
          a violent or surreptitious taking away from any what God hath given
          him the possession of. Since God is the Lord of all, and may give the
          possession and dominion of things to whom he pleaseth, all theft and
          purloining, all cheating and cozening another of his right, is not
          only a crime against the true possessor, depriving him of what he is
          entrusted with, but against God, as the absolute and universal
          proprietor, having a right thereby to confer his own goods upon whom
          he pleaseth, as well as against God as a Lawgiver, forbidding such a
          violence: the snatching away what is another’s, denies man the right
          of possession, and God the right of donation: the Israelites taking
          the Egyptians’ jewels had been theft had it not been by a Divine
          license and order, but cannot be slandered with such a term, after the
          Proprietor of the whole world had altered the title, and alienated
          them by his positive grant from the Egyptians, to confer them upon the
          Israelites.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] The dominion of God, as a proprietor, is practically contemned by
          not using what God hath given us for those ends for which he gave them
          to us. God passeth things over to us with a condition to use that for
          his glory which he hath bestowed upon us by his bounty: he is Lord of
          the end for which he gives, as well as Lord of what he gives; the
          donor’s right of propriety is infringed when the lands and legacies he
          leaves to a particular use are not employed to those ends to which he
          bequeathed them: the right of the lord of a manor is violated when the
          copyhold is not used according to the condition of the conveyance. So
          it is an invasion of God’s sovereignty not to use the creatures for
          those ends for which we are entrusted with them: when we deny
          ourselves a due and lawful support from them; hence covetousness is an
          invasion of his right: or when we unnecessarily waste them; hence
          prodigality disowns his propriety: or when we bestow not anything upon
          the relief of others; hence uncharitableness comes under the same
          title, appropriating that to ourselves, as if we were the lords, when
          we were but the usufructuaries for ourselves, and stewards for others;
          this is to be “rich to ourselves, not to God” (Luke xii. 21), for so
          are they who employ not their wealth for the service, and according to
          the intent, of the donor. Thus the Israelites did not own God the true
          proprietor of their corn, wine, and oil, which God had given them for
          his worship, when they prepared offerings for Baal out of his stock:
          “For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
          multiplied her gold and silver, which they prepared for Baal” (Hos.
          ii. 8); as if they had been sole proprietors, and not factors by
          commission, to improve the goods for the true owner. It is the same
          invasion of God’s right to use the parts and gifts that God hath given
          us, either as fuel for our pride, or advancing self, or a witty
          scoffing at God and religion; when we use not religion for the honor
          of our Sovereign, but a stool to rise by, and observe his precepts
          outwardly, not out of regard to his authority, but as a stale to our
          interest, and furnishing self with a little concern and trifle; when
          men will wrest his word for the favor of their lusts, which God
          intended for the checking of them, and make interpretations of it
          according to their humors, and not according to his will discovered in
          the Scripture, this is to pervert the use of the best goods and
          depositum he hath put into our hands, even Divine revelations. Thus
          hypocrisy makes the sovereignty of God a nullity.

          (3.) The dominion of God, as a Governor, is practically contemned.
        </p>
        <p>
          [1.] In idolatry. Since worship is an acknowledgment of God’s
          sovereignty, to adore any creature instead of God, or to pay to
          anything that homage of trust and confidence which is due to God,
          though it be the highest creature in heaven or earth, is to
          acknowledge that sovereignty to pertain to a creature, which is
          challenged by God; as to set up the greatest lord in a kingdom in the
          government, instead of the lawful prince, is rebellion and usurpation;
          and that woman incurs the crime of adultery, who commits it with a
          person of great port and honor, as well as with one of a mean
          condition. While men create anything a god, they own themselves
          supreme above the true God, yea, and above that which they account a
          god; for, by the right of creation, they have a superiority, as it is
          a deity blown up by the breath of their own imagination. The authority
          of God is in this sin acknowledged to belong to an idol; it is called
          loathing of God as a husband (Ezek. xvi. 45), all the authority of God
          as a husband and Lord over them: so when we make anything or any
          person in the world the chief object and prop of our trust and
          confidence, we act the same part. Trust in an idol is the formal part
          of idolatry; “so is every one that trusts in them” (Ps. cxv. 8), i. e.
          in idols: whatsoever thing we make the object of our trust, we rear as
          an idol. It is not unlawful to have the image of a creature, but to
          bestow divine adoration upon it; it was not unlawful for the Egyptians
          to possess and use oxen, but to dub them gods to be adored, it was: it
          is not unlawful to have wealth and honor, nor to have gifts and parts,
          they are the presents of God; but to love them above God, to fix our
          reliance upon them more than upon God, is to rob God of his due, who,
          being our Creator, ought to be our confidence. What we want we are to
          desire of him, and expect from him. When we confide in anything else
          we deny God the glory of his creation; we disown him to be Lord of the
          world; imply that our welfare is in the hands of, and depends upon,
          that thing wherein we confide; it is not only to “equal it to God” in
          sovereign power, which is his own phrase (Isa. xl. 25), but to prefer
          it before him in a reproach of him. When the hosts of heaven shall be
          served instead of the Lord of those hosts; when we shall lackey after
          the stars, depend barely upon their influences, without looking up to
          the great Director of the sun, it is to pay an adoration unto a
          captain in a regiment which is due to the general. When we shall “make
          gold our hope, and say to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence,” it
          is to deny the supremacy of that God that is above; as well as if we
          kiss our hands, in a way of adoration, to the sun in its splendor, or
          “the moon walking in its brightness,” for Job couples them together
          (ch. xxxi. 25‒28); it is to prefer the authority of earth before that
          of heaven, and honor clay above the Sovereign of the world: as if a
          soldier should confide more in the rag of an ensign, or the fragment
          of a drum, for his safety, than in the orders and conduct of his
          general; it were as much as is in his power to uncommission him, and
          snatch from him his commander’s staff. When we advance the creature in
          our love above God, and the altar of our soul smokes with more
          thoughts and affections to a petty interest than to God, we lift up
          that which was given us as a servant in the place of the Sovereign,
          and bestow that throne upon it which is to be kept undefiled for the
          rightful Lord, and subject the interest of God to the demands of the
          creature. So much respect is due to God, that none should be placed in
          the throne of our affections equal with him, much less anything to
          perk above him.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2.] Impatience is a contempt of God as a governor. When we meet with
          rubs in the way of any design, when our expectations are crossed, we
          will break through all obstacles to accomplish our projects, whether
          God will or no. When we are too much dejected at some unexpected
          providence, and murmur at the instruments of it, as if God divested
          himself of his prerogative of conducting human affairs; when a little
          cross blows us into a mutiny, and swells us into a sauciness to
          implead God, or make us fret against him (as the expression is, Isa.
          viii. 21), wishing him out of his throne; no sin is so devilish as
          this; there is not any strikes more at all the attributes of God than
          this, against his goodness, righteousness, holiness, wisdom, and doth
          as little spare his sovereignty as any of the rest: what can it be
          else, but an impious invasion of his dominion, to quarrel with him for
          what he doth, and to say, What reason hast thou to deal thus with me?
          This language is in the nature of all impatience, whereby we question
          his sovereignty, and parallel our dominion with his. When men have not
          that confluence of wealth or honor they greedily desired, they bark at
          God, and revile his government: they are angry God doth not more
          respectfully observe them, as though he had nothing to do in their
          matters, and were wanting in that becoming reverence which they think
          him bound to pay to such great ones as they are; they would have God
          obedient to their minds, and act nothing but what he receives a
          commission for from their wills. When we murmur, it is as if we would
          command his will, and wear his crown; a wresting the sceptre out of
          his hands to sway it ourselves; we deny him the right of government,
          disown his power over us, and would be our own sovereigns: you may
          find the character of it in the language of Jehoram (as many
          understand it), “Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what should I wait
          for the Lord any longer?” (2 Kings vi. 33). This is an evil of such a
          nature, that it could come from none but the hand of God; why should I
          attend upon him, as my Sovereign, that delights to do me so much
          mischief, that throws curses upon me when I expected blessings? I will
          no more observe his directions, but follow my own sentiments, and
          regard not his authority in the lips of his doting prophet. The same
          you find in the Jews, when they were under God’s lash; “And they said,
          There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will
          every one do the imagination of his evil heart” (Jer. xviii. 12): we
          can expect no good from him, and therefore we will be our own
          sovereigns, and prefer the authority of our own imaginations before
          that of his precepts. Men would be their own carvers, and not suffer
          God to use his right; as if a stone should order the mason in what
          manner to hew it, and in what part of the building to place it. We are
          not ordinarily concerned so much at the calamities of our neighbors,
          but swell against heaven at a light drop upon ourselves. We are
          content God should be the sovereign of others, so that he will be a
          servant to us: let him deal as he will himself with others, so he will
          treat us, and what relates to us, as we will ourselves. We would have
          God resign his authority to our humors, and our humors should be in
          the place of a God to him, to direct him what was fit to do in our
          cause. When things go not according to our vote, our impatience is a
          wish that God was deposed from his throne, that he would surrender his
          seat to some that would deal more favorably, and be more punctual
          observers of our directions. Let us look to ourselves in regard of
          this sin, which is too common, and the root of much mischief. This
          seems to be the first bubbling of Adam’s will; he was not content with
          the condition wherein God had placed him, but affected another, which
          ended in the ruin of himself, and of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3.] Limiting God in his way of working to our methods, is another
          part of the contempt of his dominion. When we will prescribe him
          methods of acting, that he should deliver us in this or that way, we
          would not suffer him to be the Lord of his own favors, and have the
          privilege to be his own director. When we will limit him to such a
          time, wherein to work our deliverance, we would rob him of the power
          of times and seasons, which are solely in his hand. We would regulate
          his conduct according to our imaginations, and assume a power to give
          laws to our Sovereign. Thus the Israelites “limited the Holy One of
          Israel” (Ps. lxxviii. 41): they would control his absolute dominion,
          and, of a sovereign, make him their slave. Man, that is God’s vassal,
          would set bounds to his Lord, and cease to be a servant, and commence
          master, when he would give, not take, directions from him. When God
          had given them manna, and their fancies were weary of that delicious
          food, they would prescribe heaven to rain down some other sort of food
          for them. When they wanted no sufficient provision in the wilderness,
          they quarrelled with God for bringing them out of Egypt, and not
          presently giving them a place of seed, of figs, vines, and
          pomegranates (Numb. xx. 5), which is called a “striving with the Lord”
          (ver. 13), a contending with him for his Lordship. When we tempt God,
          and require a sign of him as a mark of his favor, we circumscribe his
          dominion; when we will not use the means he hath appointed, but father
          our laziness upon a trust in his providence, as if we expected he
          should work a miracle for our relief; when we censure him for what he
          hath done in the course of his providence; when we capitulate with
          him, and promise such a service, if he will do us such a good turn
          according to our platform, we would bring down his sovereign pleasure
          to our will, we invade his throne, and expect a submissive obedience
          from him. Man that hath not wit enough to govern himself, would be
          governing God, and those that cannot be their own sovereigns, affect a
          sovereignty over heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4.] Pride and presumption is another invasion of his dominion. When
          men will resolve to go to‑morrow to such a city, to such a fair and
          market, to traffic, and get gain, without thinking of the necessity of
          a Divine license, as if ourselves were the lords of our time and of
          our lives, and God were to lackey after us (James iv. 13, 15): “Ye
          that say, To‑day we will go into such a city, and buy and sell,
          whereas ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live;” as if they
          had a freehold, and were not tenants at will to the Lord of the manor.
          When we presume upon our own strength or wit to get the better of our
          adversaries; as the Germans (as Tacitus relates) assured themselves,
          by the numerousness of their army, of a victory against the Romans,
          and prepared chains to fetter the captives before the conquest, which
          were found in their camp after their defeat;—when we are peremptory in
          expectations of success according to our will; as Pharaoh (Exod. xv.
          9), “I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my lust
          shall be satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, my hand shall
          destroy them:” he speaks more like a god than a man, as if he were the
          sovereign power, and God only his vicar and lieutenant; how he struts,
          without thinking of a superior power to curb him!—when men ascribe to
          themselves what is the sole fruit of God’s sovereign pleasure; as the
          king of Assyria speaks a language fit only to be spoken by God (Isa.
          x. 13, 14, &amp;c.), “I have removed the bounds of the people; my hand
          hath found as a nest the riches of the people; I have gathered all the
          earth;” which God declares to be a wrong to his sovereignty by the
          title wherewith he prefaceth his threatening against him (ver. 16):
          “Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones
          leanness,” &amp;c. It is indeed a rifling, if not of his crown, yet of
          the most glittering jewel of it, his glory. “He that mocks the poor
          reproacheth his Maker” (Prov. xvii. 5). He never thinks that God made
          them poor, and himself rich; he owns not his riches to be dropped upon
          him by the Divine hand. Self is the great invader of God’s
          sovereignty; doth not only spurn at it, but usurp it, and assume
          divine honors, payable only to the universal Sovereign. The Assyrian
          was not so modest as the Chaldean, who would impute his power and
          victories to his idol (Hab. i. 11), whom he thought to be God, though
          yet robbing the true God of his authority; and so much was signified
          by their names, Nebuchadnezzar, Evil‑Merodach, Belshazzar, Nebo,
          Merodach, Bel, being the Chaldean idols, and the names signifying,
          Lord of wealth, Giver of riches, and the like.—When we behave
          ourselves proudly towards others, and imagine ourselves greater than
          our Maker ever meant us;—when we would give laws to others, and expect
          the most submissive observances from them, as if God had resigned his
          authority to us, and made us, in his stead, the rightful monarchs of
          the world. To disdain that any creature should be above us, is to
          disdain God’s sovereign disposition of men, and consequently, his own
          superiority over us. A proud man would govern all, and would not have
          God his Sovereign, but his subject; to overvalue ourselves, is to
          undervalue God.
        </p>
        <p>
          [5.] Slight and careless worship of God is another contempt of his
          sovereignty. A prince is contemned, not only by a neglect of those
          reverential postures which are due to him, but in a reproachful and
          scornful way of paying them. To behave ourselves uncomely or
          immodestly before a prince, is a disesteem of majesty. Sovereignty
          requires awe in every address, where this is wanting there is a
          disrespect of authority. We contemn God’s dominion when we give him
          the service of the lip, the hand, the knee, and deny him that of the
          heart; as they in Ezekiel xxxiii. 31, as though he were the Sovereign
          only of the body, and not of the soul. To have devout figures of the
          face, and uncomely postures of the soul, is to exclude his dominion
          from our spirits, while we own it only over our outward man; we render
          him an insignificant Lord, not worthy of any higher adorations from us
          than a senseless statue; we demean not ourselves according to his
          majestical authority over us, when we present him not with the cream
          and quintessence of our souls. The greatness of God required a great
          house, and a costly palace (1 Chron. xxix. 11, 16); David speaks it in
          order to the building God a house and a temple; God being a great King
          expects a male the best of our flock (Mal. i. 14), a masculine and
          vigorous service. When we present him with a sleepy, sickly rheumatic
          service, we betray our conceptions of him to be as mean as if he were
          some petty lord, whose dominion were of no larger extent than a
          mole‑hill, or some inconsiderable village.
        </p>
        <p>
          [6.] Omission of the service he hath appointed is another contempt of
          his sovereignty. This is a contempt of his dominion, whereby he hath a
          right to appoint what means and conditions he pleaseth, for the
          enjoyment of his proffered and promised benefits. It is an enmity to
          his sceptre not to accept of his terms after a long series of precepts
          and invitations made for the restoring us to that happiness we had
          lost, and providing all means necessary thereunto, nothing being
          wanting but our own concurrence with it, and acceptance of it, by
          rendering that easy homage he requires. By withholding from him the
          service he enjoins, we deny that we hold anything of him; as he that
          pays not the quit rent, though it be never so small, disowns the
          sovereignty of the lord of the manor; it implies, that he is a
          miserable poor lord, having no right, or destitute of any power, to
          dispose of anything in the world to our advantage (Job xxii. 17):
          “They say unto God, Depart from us, what can the Almighty do for
          them?” They will have no commerce with him in a way of duty, because
          they imagine him to have no sovereign power to do anything for them in
          way of benefit, as if his dominion were an empty title, and as much
          destitute of any authority to command a favor for them as any idol.
          They think themselves to have as absolute a disposal of things, as God
          himself. What can he do for us? what can he confer upon us, that we
          cannot invest ourselves in? as though they were sovereigns in an
          equality with God. Thus men live “without God in the world” (Eph. ii.
          12), as if there were no Supreme Being to pay a respect to, or none
          fit to receive any homage at their hands; withholding from God the
          right of his time and the right of his service, which is the just
          claim of his sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
          [7.] Censuring others is a contempt of his sovereignty. When we
          censure men’s persons or actions by a rash judgment; when we will be
          judges of the good and evil of men’s actions, where the law of God is
          utterly silent, we usurp God’s place, and invade his right; we claim a
          superiority over the law, and judge God defective, as the Rector of
          the world, in his prescriptions of good and evil. (James iv. 11, 12),
          “He that speaks evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaks
          evil of the law, and judgeth the law; there is one Lawgiver who is
          able to save, and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?” Do
          you know what you do in judging another? You take upon you the garb of
          a sovereign, as if he were more your servant than God’s, and more
          under your authority than the authority of God; it is a setting
          thyself in God’s tribunal, and assuming his rightful power of judging;
          thy brother is not to be governed by thy fancy, but by God’s law, and
          his own conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Information. Hence it follows, that God doth actually govern the
          world. He hath not only a right to rule, but “he rules over all,” so
          saith the text. He is “King of kings, and Lord of lords,”—what, to let
          them do what they please, and all that their lusts prompt them to?
          hath God an absolute dominion? Is it good, and is it wise? Is it then
          a useless prerogative of the Divine nature? Shall so excellent a power
          lie idle, as if God were a lifeless image? Shall we fancy God like
          some lazy monarch, that solaceth himself in the gardens of his palace,
          or steeps himself in some charming pleasures, and leaves his
          lieutenants to govern the several provinces, which are all members of
          his empire, according to their own humor? Not to exercise this
          dominion is all one as not to have it; to what purpose is he invested
          with this sovereignty, if he were careless of what were done in the
          world, and regarded not the oppressions of men? God keeps no useless
          excellency by him; he actually reigns over the heathen (Ps. xlvii. 8),
          and those as bad, or worse than heathens. It had been a vanity in
          David to call upon the heavens to be glad, and the earth to rejoice,
          under the rule of a “sleepy Deity” (1 Chron. xvi. 31). No; his sceptre
          is full of eyes, as it was painted by the Egyptians; he is always
          waking, and always more than Ahasuerus, reading over the records of
          human actions. Not to exercise his authority, is all one as not to
          regard whether he keep the crown upon his head, or continue the
          sceptre in his hand. If his sovereignty were exempt from care, it
          would be destitute of justice; God is more righteous than to resign
          the ensigns of his authority to blind and oppressive man; to think
          that God hath a power, and doth not use it for just and righteous
          ends, is to imagine him an unrighteous as well as a careless
          Sovereign; such a thing in a man renders him a base man, and a worse
          governor; it is a vice that disturbs the world, and overthrows the
          ends of authority, as to have a power, and use it well, is the
          greatest virtue of an earthly sovereign. What an unworthy conception
          is it of God, to acknowledge him to be possessed of a greater
          authority than the greatest monarch, and yet to think that he useth it
          less than a petty lord; that his crown is of no more value with him
          than a feather? This represents God impotent, that he cannot, or
          unrighteous and base, that he will not administer the authority he
          hath for the noblest and justest end. But can we say, that he neglects
          the government of the world? How come things then to remain in their
          due order? How comes the law of nature yet to be preserved in every
          man’s soul? How comes conscience to check, and cite, and judge? If God
          did not exercise his authority, what authority could conscience have
          to disturb man in unlawful practices, and to make his sports and
          sweetness so unpleasant and sour to him? Hath he not given frequent
          notices and memorials, that he holds a curb over corrupt inclinations,
          puts rubs in the way of malicious attempters, and often oversets the
          disturbers of the peace of the world?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Information. God can do no wrong, since he is absolute Sovereign.
          Man may do wrong, princes may oppress and rifle, but it is a crime in
          them so to do: because their power is a power of government, and not
          of propriety, in the goods or lives of their subjects; but God cannot
          do any wrong, whatsoever the clamors of creatures are, because he can
          do nothing but what he hath a sovereign right to do. If he takes away
          your goods, he takes not away anything that is yours more than his
          own, since though he entrusted you with them, he divested not himself
          of the propriety. When he takes away our lives, he takes what he gave
          us by a temporary donation, to be surrendered at his call: we can
          claim no right in anything but by his will. He is no debtor to us: and
          since he owes us nothing, he can wrong us in nothing that he takes
          away. His own sovereignty excuseth him in all those acts which are
          most distasteful to the creature. If we crop a medicinal plant for our
          use, or a flower for our pleasure, or kill a lamb for our food, we do
          neither of them any wrong: because the original of them was for our
          use, and they had their life, and nourishment, and pleasing qualities
          for our delight and support. And are not we much more made for the
          pleasure and use of God, than any of those can be for us? “Of him and
          to him are all things” (Rom. xi. 36): hath not God as much right over
          any one of us, as over the meanest worm? Though there be a vast
          difference in nature between the angels in heaven and the worms on
          earth, yet they are all one in regard of subjection to God; he is as
          much the Lord of the one as the other; as much the Proprietor of the
          one as the other; as much the Governor of one as the other;—not a
          cranny in the world is exempt from his jurisdiction;—not a mite or
          grain of a creature exempt from his propriety. He is not our Lord by
          election; he was a Lord before we were in being; he had no terms put
          upon him who capitulated with him, and set him in his throne by
          covenant. What oath did he take to any subject at his first
          investiture in his authority? His right is as natural, as eternal as
          himself: as natural as his existence, and as necessary as his Deity.
          Hath he any law but his own will? What wrong can he do that breaks no
          law, that fulfils his law in everything he doth, by fulfilling his own
          will, which as it is absolutely sovereign, so it is infinitely
          righteous? In whatsoever he takes from us, then, he cannot injure us;
          it is no crime in any man to seize upon his own goods to vindicate his
          own honor; and shall it be thought a wrong in God to do such things,
          besides the occasion he hath from every man, and that every day
          provoking him to do it? He seems rather to wrong himself by forbearing
          such a seizure, than wrong us by executing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Information. If God have a sovereignty over the whole world, then
          merit is totally excluded. His right is so absolute over all
          creatures, that he neither is, nor can be, a debtor to any; not to the
          undefiled holiness of the blessed angels, much less to poor earthly
          worms; those blessed spirits enjoy their glory by the title of his
          sovereign pleasure, not by virtue of any obligation devolving from
          them upon God. Are not the faculties, whereby they and we perform any
          act of obedience, his grant to us? Is not the strength, whereby they
          and we are enabled to do anything pleasing to him, a gift from him?
          Can a vassal merit of his lord, or a slave of his master, by using his
          tools, and employing his strength in his service, though it was a
          strength he had naturally, not by donation from the man in whose
          service it is employed? God is Lord of all—all is due to him; how can
          we oblige him by giving him what is his own, more his to whom it is
          presented, than ours by whom it is offered? He becomes not a debtor by
          receiving anything from us, but by promising something to us.1019
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Information. If God hath a sovereign dominion over the whole world,
          then hence it follows, that all magistrates are but sovereigns under
          God. He is King of kings, and Lord of lords; all the potentates of the
          world are no other than his lieutenants, movable at his pleasure, and
          more at his disposal than their subjects are at theirs. Though they
          are dignified with the title of “gods,” yet still they are at an
          infinite distance from the supreme Lord; gods under God, not to be
          above him, not to be against him. The want of the due sense of their
          subordination to God hath made many in the world act as sovereigns
          above him more than sovereigns under him. Had they all bore a deep
          conviction of this upon their spirits, such audacious language had
          never dropped from the mouth of Pharaoh: “Who is the Lord, that I
          should obey his voice, to let Israel go?” (Exod. v. 2), presuming that
          there was no superior to control him, nor any in heaven able to be a
          match for him; Darius had never published such a doting edict, as to
          prohibit any petition to God; Nero had never fired Rome, and sung at
          the sight of the devouring flames; nor ever had he ripped up his
          mother’s belly, to see the womb where he first lodged, and received a
          life so hateful to his country. Nor would Abner and Joab, the two
          generals, have accounted the death of men but a sport and interlude.
          “Let the young men arise and play before us” (2 Sam. ii. 14); what
          play it was, the next verse acquaints you with; thrusting their swords
          into one another’s sides. They were no more troubled at the death of
          thousands, than a man is to kill a fly, or a flea. Had a sense of this
          but hovered over their souls, people in many countries had not been
          made their foot‑balls, and used worse than their dogs! Nor had the
          lives of millions, worth more than a world, been exposed to fire and
          sword, to support some sordid lust, or breach of faith upon an idle
          quarrel, and for the depredation of their neighbors’ estates; the
          flames of cities had not been so bright, nor the streams of blood so
          deep, nor the cries of innocents so loud. In particular,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) If God be Sovereign, all under‑sovereigns are not to rule against
          him, but to be obedient to his orders. If they “rule by his authority”
          (Prov. viii. 15), they are not to rule against his interest; they are
          not to imagine themselves as absolute as God, and that their laws must
          be of as sovereign authority against his honor, as the Divine are for
          it. If they are his lieutenants on earth, they ought to act according
          to his orders. No man but will account a governor of a province a
          rebel, if he disobeys the orders sent to him by the sovereign prince
          that commissioned him. Rebellion against God is a crime of princes, as
          well as rebellion against princes a crime of subjects. Saul is charged
          with it by Samuel in a high manner for an act of simple disobedience,
          though intended for the service of God, and the enriching his country
          with the spoils of the Amalekites. “Rebellion is as the sin of
          witchcraft” (1 Sam. xv. 23); like witchcraft or covenanting with the
          devil, acting as if he had received his commission not from God, but
          from Satan. Magistrates, as commissioned by God, ought to act for him.
          Doth human authority ever give a commission to any to rebel against
          itself? did God ever depute any earthly sovereignty against his glory,
          and give them leave to outlaw his laws, to introduce their own? No;
          when he gave the vicarious dominion to Christ, he calls upon the kings
          of the earth to be instructed, and be wise, and “kiss the Son” (Ps.
          ii. 10, 12), i. e. to observe his orders, and pay him homage as their
          Governor. What a silly doltish thing is it to resist that Supreme
          Authority, to which the archangels submit themselves, and regulate
          their employments punctually by their instructions! Those excellent
          creatures exactly obey him in all the acts of their subordinate
          government in the world; those in whose hand the greatest monarch is
          no more than a silly fly between the fingers of a giant. A
          contradiction to the interest of God hath been fatal to kings. The
          four monarchies have had their wings clipped, and most of them have
          been buried in their own ashes; they have all, like the imitators of
          Lucifer’s pride, fallen from the heaven of their glory to the depth of
          their shame and misery. All governors are bound to be as much obedient
          to God, as their subjects are bound to be submissive to them. Their
          authority over men is limited; God’s authority over them is absolute
          and unbounded. Though every soul ought to be subject to the higher
          powers, yet there is a higher Power of all, to which those higher
          powers are to subject themselves; they are to be keepers of both the
          tables of the law of God, and are then most sovereigns when they set
          in their own practice an example of obedience to God, for their
          subjects to write after.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) They ought to imitate God in the exercise of their sovereignty in
          ways of justice and righteousness. Though God be an absolute
          sovereign, yet his government is not tyrannical, but managed according
          to the rules of righteousness, wisdom, and goodness. If God, that
          created them as well as their subjects, doth so exercise his
          government, it is a duty incumbent upon them to do the same; since
          they are not the creators of their people, but the conductors. As
          God’s government tends to the good of the world, so ought theirs to
          the good of their countries. God committed not the government of the
          world to the Mediator in an unlimited way, but for the good of the
          church, in order to the eternal salvation of his people. “He gave him
          to be head over all things to the church” (Eph. i. 22). He had power
          over the devils to restrain them in their temptation and malice; power
          over the angels to order their ministry for the heirs of salvation. So
          power is given to magistrates for the civil preservation of the world
          and of human society; they ought therefore to consider for what ends
          they were placed over the rest of mankind, and not exercise their
          authority in a licentious way, but conformable to that justice and
          righteousness wherein God doth administer his government, and for the
          preservation of those who are committed to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Magistrates must then be obeyed when they act according to God’s
          order, and within the bounds of the Divine commission. They are no
          friends to the sovereignty of God, that are enemies to magistracy, his
          ordinance. Saul was a good governor, though none of the best men, and
          the despisers of his government after God’s choice, were the sons of
          Belial (1 Sam. x. 27). Christ was no enemy to Cæsar. To pull down a
          faithful magistrate, such an one as Zerubbabel, is to pluck a signet
          from the hand of God; for in that capacity he accounts him (Hag. ii.
          23). God’s servants stand or fall to their own Master; how doth he
          check Aaron and Miriam for speaking against Moses, his servant? “Were
          you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” (Numb. xii. 8);
          against Moses as related to you in the capacity of a governor; against
          Moses as related to you in the capacity of my servant? To speak
          anything against them, as they act by God’s order, is an invasion of
          God’s sovereign right, who gave them their commission. To act against
          just power, or the justice of an earthly power, is to act against
          God’s ordinance, who ordained them in the world, but not any abuse, or
          ill use of their power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use II. How dreadful is the consideration of this doctrine to all
          rebels against God! Can any man that hath brains in his head, imagine
          it an inconsiderable thing to despise the Sovereign of the world? It
          was the sole crime of disobedience to that positive law, whereby God
          would have a visible memorial of his sovereignty preserved in the eye
          of man, that showered down that deluge of misery, under which the
          world groans to this day. God had given Adam a soul, whereby he might
          live as a rational creature; and then gives him a law, whereby he
          might live as a dutiful subject: for God forbidding him to eat of the
          fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, declared his own
          supremacy over Adam, and his propriety in the pleasant world he had
          given him by his bounty; he let him know hereby, that man was not his
          own lord, nor was to live after his own sentiments, but the directions
          of a superior. As when a great lord builds a magnificent palace, and
          brings in another to inhabit it, he reserves a small duty to himself,
          not of an equal value with the house, but for an acknowledgment of his
          own right, that the tenant may know he is not the lord of it, but hath
          this grant by the liberality of another.1020 God hereby gave Adam
          matter for a pure obedience, that had no foundation in his own nature
          by any implanted law; he was only in it to respect the will of his
          Sovereign, and to understand that he was to live under the power of a
          higher than himself. There was no more moral evil in the eating of
          this fruit, as considered distinct from the command, than in eating of
          any other fruit in the garden: had there been no prohibition, he might
          with as much safety have fed upon it as upon any other. No law of
          nature was transgressed in the act of eating of it, but the
          sovereignty of God over him was denied by him; and for this the death
          threatened was inflicted on his posterity: for though divines take
          notice of other sins in the fall of Adam, yet God, in his trial,
          chargeth him with none but this, and doth put upon his question an
          emphasis of his own authority: “Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I
          commanded ye that thou shouldest not eat?” (Gen. iii. 11). This I am
          pleased with, that thou shouldest disown my dominion over thyself, and
          this garden. This was the inlet to all the other sins: as the
          acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty is the first step to the practice
          of all the duties of a creature, so the disowning his sovereignty is
          the first spring of all the extravagances of a creature. Every sin
          against the sovereign Lawgiver is worthy of death: the transgression
          of this command deserved death, and procured it to spread itself over
          the face of the world. God’s dominion cannot be despised without
          meriting the greatest punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Punishment necessarily follows upon the doctrine of sovereignty. It
          is a faint and a feeble sovereignty that cannot preserve itself, and
          vindicate its own wrongs against rebellious subjects; the height of
          God’s dominion infers a vengeance on the contemners of it: if God be
          an eternal King, he is an eternal Judge. Since sin unlinks the
          dependence between God the Sovereign, and man the subject, if God did
          not vindicate the rights of his sovereignty, and the authority of his
          law, he would seem to despise his own dominion, be weary of it, and
          not act the part of a good governor. But God is tender of his
          prerogative, and doth most bestir himself when men exalt themselves
          proudly against him: “In the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he will
          be above them” (Exod. xviii. 11). When Pharaoh thought himself a mate
          for God, and proudly rejected his commands, as if they had been the
          messages of some petty Arabian lord, God rights his own authority upon
          the life of his enemy by the ministry of the Red Sea. He turned a
          great king into a beast, to make him know that the Most High ruled in
          the kingdoms of men: “The demand is by the word of the holy ones, to
          the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the
          kingdoms of men” (Dan. iv. 16, 17); and that by the petitions of the
          angels, who cannot endure that the empire of God should be obscured
          and diminished by the pride of man. Besides the tender respect he hath
          to his own glory, he is constantly presented with the solicitations of
          the angels to punish the proud ones of the earth, that darken the
          glory of his majesty: it is necessary for the rescue of his honor, and
          necessary for the satisfaction of his illustrious attendants, who
          would think it a shame to them to serve a Lord that were always
          unconcerned in the rebellions of his creatures, and tamely suffer
          their spurns at his throne; and therefore there is a day wherein the
          haughtiness of man shall be bowed down, the cedars of Lebanon
          overthrown, and high mountains levelled, that “God may be exalted in
          that day” (Isa. ii. 11, 12), &amp;c. Pride is a sin that immediately
          swells against God’s authority; this shall be brought down that God
          may be exalted; not that he should have a real exaltation, as if he
          were actually deposed from his government, but that he shall be
          manifested to be the Sovereign of the whole world. It is necessary
          there should be a day to chase away those clouds that are upon his
          throne, that the lustre of his majesty may break forth to the
          confusion of all the children of pride that vaunt against him. God
          hath a dominion over us as a Lawgiver, as we are his creatures; and a
          dominion over us in a way of justice, as we are his criminals.
        </p>
        <p>2. This punishment is unavoidable.</p>
        <p>
          (1.) None can escape him. He hath the sole authority over hell and
          death, the keys of both are in his hand: the greatest Cæsar can no
          more escape him than the meanest peasant: “Who art thou, O great
          mountain, before Zerubbabel?” (Zech. iv. 7). The height of angels is
          no match for him, much less that of the mortal grandees of the world;
          they can no more resist him than the meanest person; but are rather,
          as the highest steeples, the fittest marks for his crushing thunder.
          If he speaks the word, the principalities of men come down, and “the
          crown of their glory” (Jer. xiii. 18). He can “take the mighty away in
          a moment,” and that “without hands,” i. e. without instruments (Job
          xxxiv. 20). The strongest are like the feet of Nebuchadnezzar’s image,
          iron and clay; iron to man, but clay to God, to be crumbled to
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) What comfort can be reaped from a creature, when the Sovereign of
          the world arms himself with terrors, and begins his visitation? “What
          will you do in the day of visitation, to whom will you flee for help,
          and where will you leave your glory?” (Isa. x. 3). The torments from a
          subject may be relieved by the prince, but where can there be an
          appeal from the Sovereign of the world? Where is there any above him
          to control him, if he will overthrow us? Who is there to call him to
          account, and say to him, What dost thou? He works by an uncontrollable
          authority; he needs not ask leave of any; “he works, and none can let
          it” (Isa. xliii. 13): as when he will relieve, none can afflict; so
          when he will wound, none can relieve. If a king appoint the punishment
          of a rebel, the greatest favorite in the court cannot speak a
          comfortable word to him: the most beloved angel in heaven cannot
          sweeten and ease the spirit of a man that the Sovereign Power is set
          against to make the butt of his wrath. The devils lie under his
          sentence, and wear their chains as marks of their condemnation,
          without hope of ever having them filed off, since they are laid upon
          them by the authority of an unaccountable Sovereign.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) By his sovereign authority God can make any creature the
          instrument of his vengeance. He hath all the creatures at his beck,
          and can commission any of them to be a dreadful scourge. Strong winds
          and tempests fulfil his word (Ps. cxlviii. 8); the lightnings answer
          him at his call, and cry aloud, “Here are we” (Job xxxviii. 35). By
          his sovereign authority he can render locusts as mischievous as lions,
          forge the meanest creatures into swords and arrows, and commission the
          most despicable to be his executioners. He can cut off joy from our
          spirits, and make our own hearts be our tormentors, our most confident
          friends our persecutors, our nearest relations to be his avengers;
          they are more his, who is their Sovereign, than ours, who place a vain
          confidence in them. Rather than Abraham shall want children, he can
          raise up stones, and adopt them into his family; and rather than not
          execute his vengeance, he can array the stones in the streets, and
          make them his armed subjects against us. If he speak the word, a hair
          shall drop from our heads to choke us, or a vapor, congealed into
          rheum in our heads, shall drop down and putrefy our vitals. He can
          never want weapons, who is Sovereign over the thunders of heaven and
          stones of the earth, over every creature; and can, by a sovereign
          word, turn our greatest comforts into curses.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This punishment must be terrible. How doth David, a great king,
          sound in his body, prosperous in his crown, and successful in his
          conquests, settled in all his royal conveniences, groan under the
          wrathful touch of a greater King than himself (Ps. vi. xxxviii., and
          his other penitential Psalms), not being able to give himself a writ
          of ease by all the delights of his palace and kingdom! “If the wrath
          of a king be as the roaring of a lion” (Prov. xix. 10) to a poor
          subject, how great is the wrath of the King of kings, that cannot be
          set forth by the terror of all the amazing volleys of thunder that
          have been since the creation, if the noise of all were gathered into
          one single crack! As there is an inconceivable ground of joy in the
          special favor of so mighty a King, so is there of terror in his severe
          displeasure: he is “terrible to the kings of the earth; with God is
          terrible majesty” (Ps. lxxvi. 12). What a folly is it, then, to rebel
          against so mighty a Sovereign!
        </p>
        <p>
          Use III. Of comfort. The throne of God drops honey and sweetness, as
          well as dread and terror; all his other attributes afford little
          relief without this of his dominion and universal command. When,
          therefore, he speaks of his being the God of his people, he doth often
          preface it with “the Lord thy God;” his sovereignty, as a Lord, being
          the ground of all the comfort we can take in his federal relation as
          our God; thy God, but superior to thee; thy God, not as thy cattle and
          goods are thine, in a way of sole propriety, but a Lord too, in a way
          of sovereignty, not only over thee, but over all things else for thee.
          As the end of God’s settling earthly governments was for the good of
          the communities over which the governors preside, so God exerciseth
          his government for the good of the world, and more particularly for
          the good of the church, over which he is a peculiar Governor.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. His love to his people is as great as his sovereignty over them. He
          stands not upon his dominion with his people so much as upon his
          affection to them; he would not be called “Baali, my Lord,” i. e. he
          would not be known only by the name of sovereignty, but “Ishi, my
          husband,” a name of authority and sweetness together (Hos. ii. 16, 19,
          &amp;c.): he signifies that he is not only the Lord of our spirits and
          bodies, but a husband by a marriage knot, admitting us to a nearness
          to him, and communion of goods with him. Though he majestically sits
          upon a high throne, yet it is a throne “encircled with a rainbow”
          (Ezek. i. 28), to show that his government of his people is not only
          in a way of absolute dominion, but also in a way of federal relation;
          he seems to own himself their subject rather than their Sovereign,
          when he gives them a charter to command him in the affairs of his
          church (Isa. xlv. 11); “Ask of me things to come concerning my sons,
          and concerning the work of my hands command you me.” Some read it by
          way of question, as a corrective of a sauciness: Do you ask me of
          things to come, and seem to command me concerning the works of my
          hands, as if you were more careful of my interest among my people than
          I am, who have formed them? But if this were the sense, it would seem
          to discourage an importunity of prayer for public deliverance; and
          therefore, to take it according to our translation, it is an
          exhortation to prayer, and a mighty encouragement in the management
          and exercise of it. Urge me with my promise, in a way of humble
          importunity, and you shall find me as willing to perform my word, and
          gratify your desires, as if I were rather under your authority, than
          you under mine: as much as to say, If I be not as good as my word, to
          satisfy those desires that are according to my promise, implead me at
          my own throne, and, if I be failing in it, I will give judgment
          against myself: almost like princes’ charters, and gracious grants,
          “We grant such a thing against us and our heirs,” giving the subject
          power to implead them if they be not punctually observed by them. How
          is the love of God seen in his condescension below the majesty of
          earthy governors! He that might command, by the absoluteness of his
          authority, doth not only do that, but entreats, in the quality of a
          subject, as if he had not a fulness to supply us, but needed something
          from us for a supply of himself (2 Cor. v. 20): “As though God did
          beseech you by us.” And when he may challenge, as a due by the right
          of his propriety, what we bestow upon his poor, which are his subjects
          as well as ours, he reckons it as a loan to him, as if what we had
          were more our own than his (Prov. xix. 17). He stands not upon his
          dominion so much with us, when he finds us conscientious in paying the
          duty we owe to him; he rules as a Father, by love as well as by
          authority; he enters into a peculiar communion with poor earthly
          worms, plants his gracious tabernacle among the troops of sinners,
          instructs us by his word, invites us by his benefits, admits us into
          his presence, is more desirous to bestow his smiles than we to receive
          them, and acts in such a manner as if he were willing to resign his
          sceptre into the hands of any that were possessed with more love and
          kindness to us than himself: this is the comfort of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In his being Sovereign, his pardons carry in them a full security.
          He that hath the keys of hell and death, pardons the crime, and wipes
          off the guilt. Who can repeal the act of the chief Governor? what
          tribunal can null the decrees of an absolute throne? (Isa. xliii. 25),
          “I, even I, am he that blots out thy transgressions, for my name’s
          sake.” His sovereign dominion renders his mercy comfortable. The
          clemency of a subject, though never so great, cannot pardon; people
          may pity a criminal, while the executioner tortures him, and strips
          him of his life; but the clemency of the Supreme Prince establisheth a
          pardon. Since we are under the dominion of God, if he pardons, who can
          reverse it? if he doth not, what will the pardons of men profit us in
          regard of an eternal state? If God be a King forever, then he whom God
          forgives, he in whom God reigns, shall live forever; else he would
          want subjects on earth, and have none of his lower creatures, which he
          formed upon the earth, to reign over after the dissolution of the
          world; if his pardons did not stand secure, he would, after this life,
          have no voluntary subjects that had formerly a being upon the earth;
          he would be a King only over the damned creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Corruptions will certainly be subdued in his voluntary subjects.
          The covenant, “I will be your God,” implies protection, government,
          and relief, which are all grounded upon sovereignty; that, therefore,
          which is our greatest burden, will be removed by his sovereign power
          (Mic. vii. 19): “He will subdue our iniquities.” If the outward
          enemies of the church shall not bear up against his dominion, and
          perpetuate their rebellions unpunished, those within, his people,
          shall as little bear up against his throne, without being destroyed by
          him; the billows of our own hearts, and the raging waves within us,
          are as much at his beck as those without us; and his sovereignty is
          more eminent in quelling the corruptions of the heart, than the
          commotions of the world in reigning over men’s spirits, by changing
          them, or curbing them, more than over men’s bodies, by pinching and
          punishing them. The remainders of Satan’s empire will moulder away
          before him, since He that is in us is a greater Sovereign “than he
          that is in the world” (1 John iv. 4). His enemies will be laid at his
          feet, and so never shall prevail against him, when his kingdom shall
          come. He could not be Lord of any man, as a happy creature, if he did
          not, by his power, make them happy; and he could not make them happy,
          unless, by his grace, he made them holy: he could not be praised, as a
          Lord of glory, if he did not make some creatures glorious to praise
          him; and an earthly creature could not praise him perfectly, unless he
          had every grain of enmity to his glory taken out of his heart. Since
          God is the only Sovereign, he only can still the commotions in our
          spirits, and pull down all the ensigns of the devil’s royalty; he can
          waste him by the powerful word of his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Hence is a strong encouragement for prayer. “My King,” was the
          strong compellation David used in prayer, as an argument of comfort
          and confidence, as well as that of “my God” (Ps. v. 2): “Hearken to
          the voice of my cry, my King and my God.” To be a king is to have an
          office of government and protection: he gives us liberty to approach
          to him as the “Judge of all” (Heb. xii. 23), i. e. as the Governor of
          the world; we pray to one that hath the whole globe of heaven and
          earth in his hand, and can do whatsoever he will: though he be higher
          than the cherubims, and transcendently above all in majesty, yet we
          may soar up to him with the wings of our soul, faith and love, and lay
          open our cause, and find him as gracious as if he were the meanest
          subject on earth, rather than the most sovereign God in heaven. He
          hath as much of tenderness as he hath of authority, and is pleased
          with prayer, which is an acknowledgment of his dominion, an honoring
          of that which he delights to honor; for prayer, in the notion of it,
          imports thus much—that God is the Rector of the world, that he takes
          notice of human affairs, that he is a careful, just, wise Governor, a
          storehouse of blessing, a fountain of goodness to the indigent, and a
          relief to the oppressed. What have we reason to fear when the
          Sovereign of the world gives us liberty to approach to him and lay
          open our case? that God, who is King of the whole earth, not only of a
          few villages or cities in the earth, but the whole earth; and not only
          King of this dreggy place of our dross, but of heaven, having
          prepared, or established, his throne in the most glorious place of the
          creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Here is comfort in affliction. As a sovereign, he is the author of
          afflictions; as a sovereign, he can be the remover of them; he can
          command the waters of affliction to go so far and no farther. If he
          speaks the word, a disease shall depart as soon as a servant shall
          from your presence with a nod; if we are banished from one place, he
          can command a shelter for us in another; if he orders Moab, a nation
          that had no great kindness for his people, to let “his outcasts dwell
          with them,” they shall entertain them, and afford them sanctuary (Isa.
          xvi. 4). Again, God chasteneth as a “Sovereign,” but teacheth as a
          “Father” (Ps. xcix. 12); the exercise of his authority is not without
          an exercise of his goodness; he doth not correct for his own pleasure,
          or the creature’s torment, but for the creature’s instruction; though
          the rod be in the hand of a sovereign, yet it is tinctured with the
          kindness of Divine bowels: he can order them as a sovereign to mortify
          our flesh, and try our faith. In the severest tempest, the Lord that
          raised the wind against us, which shattered the ship, and tore its
          rigging, can change that contrary wind for a more happy one, to drive
          us into the port.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It is a comfort against the projects of the church’s adversaries in
          times of public commotions. The consideration of the Divine
          sovereignty may arm us against the threatenings of mighty ones, and
          the menaces of persecutors. God hath authority above the crowns of
          men, and a wisdom superior to the cabals of men; none can have a step
          without him; he hath a negative voice upon their counsels, a negative
          hand upon their motions; their politic resolves must stop at the point
          he hath prescribed them; their formidable strength cannot exceed the
          limits he hath set them; their overreaching wisdom expires at the
          breath of God: “There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel
          against the Lord” (Prov. xxi. 30); not a bullet can be discharged, nor
          a sword drawn, a wall battered, nor a person despatched out of the
          world, without the leave of God, by the mightiest in the world. The
          instruments of Satan are no more free from his sovereign restraint
          than their inspirer; they cannot pull the hook out of their nostrils,
          nor cast the bridle out of their mouths; this Sovereign can shake the
          earth, rend the heavens, overthrow mountains, the most mountainous
          opposers of his interest. Though the nations rush in against his
          people like the rushing of many waters, “God shall rebuke them, they
          shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and
          like a rolling thing before the whirlwind” (Isa. xvii. 13); so doth he
          often burst in pieces the most mischievous designs, and conducts the
          oppressed to a happy port: he often turns the severest tempests into a
          calm, as well as the most peaceful calm into a horrible storm. How
          often hath a well‑rigged ship, that seemed to spurn the sea under her
          feet, and beat the waves before her to a foam, been swallowed up into
          the bowels of that element, over whose back she rode a little before!
          God never comes to deliver his church as a governor, but in a wrathful
          posture (Ezek. xx. 33): “Surely, saith the Lord, with a mighty hand,
          and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule
          over you;” not with fury poured out upon the church, but fury poured
          out upon her enemies, as the words following evidence: the church he
          would bring out from the countries where she was scattered, and bring
          the people into the bond of the covenant. He sometimes “cuts off the
          spirits of princes” (Ps. lxxvi. 12), i. e. cuts off their designs as
          men do the pipes of a water‑course. The hearts of all are as open to
          him as the riches of heaven, where he resides; he can slip an
          inclination into the heart of the mighty, which they dreamed not of
          before; and if he doth not change their projects, he can make them
          abortive, and waylay them in their attempts. Laban marched with fury,
          but God put a padlock on his passion against Jacob (Gen. xxxi. 24,
          29); the devils, which ravage men’s minds, must be still when he gives
          out his sovereign orders. This Sovereign can make his people find
          favor in the eyes of the cruel Egyptians, which had so long oppressed
          them (Exod. xi. 3); and speak a good word in the heart of
          Nebuchadnezzar for the prophet Jeremiah, that he should order his
          captain to take him into his special protection, when he took Zedekiah
          away prisoner in chains, and “put out his eyes” (Jer. xxxix. 11). His
          people cannot want deliverance from Him who hath all the world at his
          command, when he is pleased to bestow it; he hath as many instruments
          of deliverance as he hath creatures at his beck in heaven or earth,
          from the meanest to the highest. As he is the Lord of hosts, the
          church hath not only an interest in the strength he himself is
          possessed with, but in the strength of all the creatures that are
          under his command, in the elements below, and angels above. In those
          armies of heaven, and in the inhabitants of the earth, he doth “what
          he will” (Dan. iv. 35); they are all in order and array at his
          command. There are angels to employ in a fatal stroke, lice and frogs
          to quell the stubborn hearts of his enemies; he can range his thunders
          and lightnings, the cannon and granadoes of heaven, and the worms of
          the earth in his service; he can muzzle lions, calm the fury of the
          fire, turn his enemies’ swords into their own bowels, and their
          artillery on their own breasts; set the wind in their teeth, and make
          their chariot‑wheels languish; make the sea enter a quarrel with them,
          and wrap them in its waves till it hath stifled them in its lap. The
          angels have storms, and tempests, and wars in their hands, but at the
          disposal of God; when they shall cast them out against the empire of
          antichrist (Rev. vii. 1, 2), then shall Satan be discharged from his
          throne, and no more seduce the nations; the everlasting gospel shall
          be preached, and God shall reign gloriously in Sion. Let us,
          therefore, shelter ourselves in the Divine sovereignty, regard God as
          the most high in our dangers and in our petitions. This was David’s
          resolution (Ps. lvii. 1, 2): “I will cry unto God most high;” this
          dominion of God is the true “tower of David, wherein there are a
          thousand shields” for defence and encouragement (Cant. iv. 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Use IV. If God hath an extensive dominion over the whole world, this
          ought to be often meditated on, and acknowledged by us. This is the
          universal duty of mankind. If he be the Sovereign of all, we should
          frequently think of our great Prince, and acknowledge ourselves his
          subjects, and him our Lord. God will be acknowledged the Lord of the
          whole earth; the neglect of this is the cause of the judgments which
          are sent upon the world. All the prodigies were to this end, that they
          might know, or acknowledge, that “God was the Lord” (Exod. x. 2); as
          God was proprietor, he demanded the first‑born of every Jew, and the
          first‑born of every beast; the one was to be redeemed, and the other
          sacrificed; this was the quit rent they were to pay to him for their
          fruitful land. The first‑fruits of the earth were ordered to be paid
          to him, as a homage due to the landlord, and an acknowledgment they
          held all in chief of him. The practice of offering first‑fruits for an
          acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty, was among many of the heathens,
          and very ancient; hence they dedicated some of the chief of their
          spoils, owning thereby the dominion and goodness of God, whereby they
          had gained the victory; Cain owned this in offering the fruits of the
          earth, and it was his sin he owned no more, viz., his being a sinner,
          and meriting the justice of God, as his brother Abel did in his bloody
          sacrifice. God was a sovereign Proprietor and Governor while man was
          in a state of innocence; but when man proved a rebel, the sovereignty
          of God bore another relation towards him, that of a Judge, added to
          the other. The first‑fruits might have been offered to God in a state
          of innocence, as a homage to him as Lord of the manor of the world;
          the design of them was to own God’s propriety in all things, and men’s
          dependence on him for the influences of heaven in producing the fruits
          of the earth, which he had ordered for their use. The design of
          sacrifices, and placing beasts instead of the criminal, was to
          acknowledge their own guilt, and God as a sovereign Judge; Cain owned
          the first, but not the second; he acknowledged his dependence on God
          as a Proprietor, but not his obnoxiousness to God as a Judge; which
          may be probably gathered from his own speech, when God came to examine
          him, and ask him for his brother (Gen. iv. 9): “Am I my brother’s
          keeper?” Why do you ask me? though I own thee as the Lord of my land
          and goods, yet I do not think myself accountable to thee for all my
          actions. This sovereignty of God ought to be acknowledged in all the
          parts of it, in all the manifestations of it to the creature; we
          should bear a sense of this always upon our spirits, and be often in
          the thoughts of it in our retirements; we should fancy that we saw God
          upon his throne in his royal garb, and great attendants about him, and
          take a view of it, to imprint an awe upon our spirits. The meditation
          of this would,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Fix us on him as an object of trust. It is upon his sovereign
          dominion as much as upon anything, that safe and secure confidence is
          built; for if he had any superior above him to control him in his
          designs and promises, his veracity and power would be of little
          efficacy to form our souls to a close adherency to him. It were not
          fit to make him the object of our trust that can be gainsayed by a
          higher than himself, and had not a full authority to answer our
          expectations; if we were possessed with this notion fully and
          believingly, that God were high above all, that “his kingdom rules
          over all,” we should not catch at every broken reed, and stand gaping
          for comforts from a pebble stone. He that understands the authority of
          a king, would not waive a reliance on his promise to depend upon the
          breath of a changeling favorite. None but an ignorant man would change
          the security he may have upon the height of a rock, to expect it from
          the dwarfishness of a molehill. To put confidence in any inferior lord
          more than in the prince, is a folly in civil converse, but a rebellion
          in divine; God only being above all, can only rule all; can command
          things to help us, and check other things which we depend on, and make
          them fall short of our expectations. The due consideration of this
          doctrine would make us pierce through second causes to the first, and
          look further than to the smaller sort of sailors, that climb the
          ropes, and dress the sails, to the pilot that sits at the helm, the
          master, that, by an indisputable authority, orders all their notions.
          We should not depend upon second causes for our support, but look
          beyond them to the authority of the Deity, and the dominion he hath
          over all the works of his hands (Zech. x. 1): “Ask ye of the Lord rain
          in the time of the latter rain;” when the seasons of the year conspire
          for the producing such an effect, when the usual time of rain is
          wheeled about in the year, stop not your thoughts at the point of the
          heavens whence you expect it, but pierce the heavens, and solicit God,
          who must give order for it before it comes. The due meditation of all
          things depending on the Divine dominion would strike off our hands
          from all other holds, so that no creature would engross the dependence
          and trust which is due to the First Cause; as we do not thank the
          heavens when they pour out rain, so we are not to depend upon them
          when we want it; God is to be sought to when the womb of second causes
          is opened to relieve us, as well as when the womb of second causes is
          barren, and brings not forth its wonted progeny.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It would make us diligent in worship. The consideration of God, as
          the Supreme Lord, is the foundation of all religion: “Our Father,
          which art in heaven,” prefaceth the Lord’s prayer; “Father” is a name
          of authority; “in heaven,” the place where he hath fixed his throne,
          notes his government; not “my Father,” but “our Father,” notes the
          extent of this authority. In all worship we acknowledge the object of
          our worship our Lord, and ourselves his vassals; if we bear a sense
          that he is our Sovereign King, it would draw us to him in every
          exigence, and keep us with him in a reverential posture, in every
          address; when we come, we should be careful not to violate his right,
          but render him the homage due to his royalty. We should not appear
          before him with empty souls, but filled with holy thoughts: we should
          bring him the best of our flock, and present him with the prime of our
          strength; were we sensible we hold all of him, we should not withhold
          anything from him which is more worthy than another. Our hearts would
          be framed into an awful regard of him, when we consider that glorious
          and “fearful name, the Lord our God” (Deut. xxviii. 58). We should
          look to our feet when we enter into his house; if we considered him in
          heaven upon his throne, and ourselves on earth at his footstool
          (Eccles. v. 2), lower before him than a worm before an angel, it would
          hinder garnishness and lightness. The Jews, saith Capel, on 1 Tim. i.
          17, repeat this expression, מלך העולם, King of worlds, or Eternal
          King; probably the first original of it might be to stake them down
          from wandering. When we consider the majesty of God, clothed with a
          robe of light, sitting upon his high throne, adorned with his royal
          ensigns, we should not enter into the presence of so great a Majesty
          with the sacrifice of fools, with light motions and foolish thoughts,
          as if he were one of our companions to be drolled with. We should not
          hear his word as if it were the voice of some ordinary peasant. The
          consideration of majesty would engender reverence in our service; it
          would also make us speak of God with honor and respect, as of a great
          and glorious king, and not use defaming expressions of him, as if he
          were an infamous being. And were he considered as a terrible majesty,
          he would not be frequently solicited by some to pronounce a damnation
          upon them upon every occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It would make us charitable to others. Since he is our Lord, the
          great Proprietor of the world, it is fit he should have a part of our
          goods, as well as our time: he being the Lord both of our goods and
          time. The Lord is to be honored with our substance (Prov. iii. 9);
          kings were not to be approached to without a present; tribute is due
          to kings: but because he hath no need of any from us to bear up his
          state, maintain the charge of his wars, or pay his military officers
          and hosts, it is a debt due to him to acknowledge him in his poor, to
          sustain those that are a part of his substance; though he stands in no
          need of it himself, yet the poor, that we have always with us, do; as
          a seventh part of our weekly time, so some part of our weekly gains,
          are due to him. There was to be a weekly laying by in store somewhat
          of what God had prospered them, for the relief of others (1 Cor. xvi.
          1, 2); the quantity is not determined, that is left to every man’s
          conscience, “according as God hath prospered him” that week. If we did
          consider God as the Donor and Proprietor, we should dispose of his
          gifts according to the design of the true owner, and act in our places
          as stewards entrusted by him, and not purse up his part, as well as
          our own, in our coffers. We should not deny him a small quit rent, as
          an acknowledgement that we have a greater income from him; we should
          be ready to give the inconsiderable pittance he doth require of us, as
          an acknowledgment of his propriety, as well as liberality.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It would make us watchful, and arm us against all temptations. Had
          Eve stuck to her first argument against the serpent, she had not been
          instrumental to that destruction which mankind yet feel the smart of
          (Gen. iii. 3): “God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it;” the great
          Governor of the world hath laid his sovereign command upon us in this
          point. The temptation gained no ground till her heart let go the sense
          of this for the pleasure of her eye and palate. The repetition of
          this, the great Lord of the world hath said or ordered, had both
          unargumented and disarmed the tempter. A sense of God’s dominion over
          us would discourage a temptation, and put it out of countenance; it
          would bring us with a vigorous strength to beat it back to a retreat.
          If this were as strongly urged as the temptation, it would make the
          heart of the tempted strong, and the motion of the tempter feeble.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It would make us entertain afflictions as they ought to be
          entertained, viz., with a respect to God. When men make light of any
          affliction from God, it is a contempt of his sovereignty, as to
          contemn the frown, displeasure, and check of a prince, is an affront
          to majesty: it is as if they did not care a straw what God did with
          them, but dare him to do his worst. There is a “despising the
          chastening of the Almighty” (Job v. 17). To be unhumbled under his
          hand, is as much, or more, affront to him, than to be impatient under
          it. Afflictions must be entertained as a check from heaven, as a frown
          from the great Monarch of the world; under the feeling of every
          stroke, we are to acknowledge his sovereignty and bounty; to despise
          it, is to make light of his authority over us; as to despise his
          favors is to make light of his kindness to us. A sense of God’s
          dominion would make us observe every check from him, and not diminish
          his authority by casting off a due sense of his correction.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. This dominion of God would make us resign up ourselves to God in
          everything. He that considers himself a thing made by God, a vassal
          under his authority, would not expostulate with him, and call him to
          an account why he hath dealt so or so with him. It would stab the
          vitals of all pleas against him. We should not then contest with him,
          but humbly lay our cause at his feet, and say with Eli, (1 Sam. iii.
          18), “It is the Lord, let him do what seems good.” We should not
          commence a suit against God, when he doth not answer our prayers
          presently, and send the mercy we want upon the wings of the wind; he
          is the Lord, the Sovereign. The consideration of this would put an end
          to our quarrels with God; should I expect that the Monarch of the
          world should wait upon me; or I, a poor worm, wait upon him? Must I
          take state upon me before the throne of heaven, and expect the King of
          kings should lay by his sceptre, to gratify my humor? Surely Jonah
          thought God no more than his fellow, or his vassal, at that time when
          he told him to his face he did well to be angry, as though God might
          not do what he pleased with so small a thing as a gourd; he speaks as
          if he would have sealed a lease of ejectment, to exclude him from any
          propriety in anything in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. This dominion of God would stop our vain curiosity. When Peter was
          desirous to know the fate of John, the beloved disciple, Christ
          answereth no more than this: (John xxi. 22), “If I will that he tarry
          till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.” Consider your
          duty, and lay aside your curiosity, since it is my pleasure not to
          reveal it. The sense of God’s absolute dominion would silence many
          vain disputes in the world. What if God will not reveal this or that?
          the manner and method of his resolves should humble the creature under
          intruding inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>Use V. Of exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          1. The doctrine of the dominion of God may teach us humility. We are
          never truly abased, but by the consideration of the eminence and
          excellency of the Deity. Job never thought himself so pitiful a thing,
          so despicable a creature, as after God’s magnificent declamation upon
          the theme of his own sovereignty (Job xlii. 5, 6). When God’s name is
          regarded as the most excellent and sovereign name in all the earth,
          then is the soul in the fittest temper to lie low, and cry out, What
          is man, that so great a Majesty should be mindful of him? When Abraham
          considers God as the supreme Judge of all the earth, he then owns
          “himself but dust and ashes” (Gen. xviii. 25, 27). Indeed, how can
          vile and dusty man vaunt before God, when angels, far more excellent
          creatures, cannot stand before him, but with a veil on their faces?
          How little a thing is man in regard of all the earth! How mean a thing
          is the earth in regard of the vaster heavens! How poor a thing is the
          whole world in comparison of God! How pitiful a thing is man, if
          compared with so excellent a Majesty! There is as great a distance
          between God and man, as between being and not being; and the more man
          considers the Divine royalty, the more disesteem he will have of
          himself; it would make him stoop and disrobe himself, and fall low
          before the throne of the King of kings, throwing down before his
          throne any crown he gloried in (Rev. iv. 10).
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) In regard of authority. How unreasonable is pride in the presence
          of majesty! How foolish is it for a country justice of peace to think
          himself as great as his prince that commissioned him! How unreasonable
          is pride in the presence of the greatest sovereignty! What, is human
          greatness before Divine? The stars discover no light when the sun
          appears, but in a humble posture withdraw in their lesser beams, to
          give the sole glory of enlightening the world to the sun, who is, as
          it were, the sovereign of those stars, and imparts a light unto them.
          The greatest prince is infinitely less, if compared with God, than the
          meanest scullion in his kitchen can be before him. As the wisdom,
          goodness, and holiness of a man is a mere mote compared to the
          goodness and holiness of God, so is the authority of a man a mere
          trifle in regard of the sovereignty of God: and who but a simple child
          would be proud of a mote or trifle? Let man be as great as he can, and
          command others, he is still a subject to One greater than himself.
          Pride would then vanish like smoke at the serious consideration of
          this sovereignty. One of the kings of this country did very handsomely
          shame the flattery of his courtiers, that cried him up as lord of sea
          and land, by ordering his chair to be set on the sand of the sea
          shore, when the tide was coming in, and commanding the waters not to
          touch his feet, which when they did without any regard to his
          authority, he took occasion thereby to put his flatterers out of
          countenance, and instruct himself in a lesson of humility. “See,”
          saith he, “how I rule all things, when so mean a thing as the water
          will not obey me!” It is a ridiculous pride that the Turk and Persian
          discover in their swelling titles. What poor sovereigns are they, that
          cannot command a cloud, give out an effectual order for a drop of
          rain, in a time of drought, or cause the bottles of heaven to turn
          their mouth another way in a time of too much moisture! Yet their own
          prerogatives are so much in their minds, that they jostle out all
          thoughts of the supreme prerogative of God, and give thereby occasion
          to frequent rebellions against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) In regard of propriety. And this doctrine is no less an abatement
          of pride in the highest, as well as in the meanest; it lowers pride in
          point of propriety, as well as in point of authority. Is any proud of
          his possessions? how many lords of those possessions have gone before
          you! how many are to follow you!1021 Your dominion lasts but a short
          time, too short to be a cause of any pride and glory in it. God by a
          sovereign power can take you from them, or them from you, when he
          pleaseth. The traveller refresheth himself in the heat of summer under
          a shady tree; how many have done so before him the same day he knows
          not, and how many will have the benefit after before night comes, he
          is as much ignorant of; he, and the others that went before him and
          follow after him, use it for their refreshment, but none of them can
          say, that they are the lords of it; the property is invested in some
          other person, whom perhaps they know not. The propriety of all you
          have is in God, not truly in yourselves. Doth not that man deserve
          scorn from you, who will play the proud fool in gay clothes and
          attire, which are known to be none of his own, but borrowed? Is it not
          the same case with every proud man, though he hath a property in his
          goods by the law of the land? Is anything you have your own truly? Is
          it not lent you by the great Lord? Is it not the same vanity in any of
          you, to be proud of what you have as God’s loan to you, as for such a
          one to be proud of what he hath borrowed of man? And do you not make
          yourselves as ridiculous to angels and good men, who know that though
          it is yours in opposition to man, yet it is not yours in opposition to
          God? they are granted you only for your use, as the collar of esses
          and sword, and other ensigns of the chief magistrate in the city, pass
          through many hands in regard of the use of them, but the propriety
          remains in the community and body of the city: or as the silver plate
          of a person that invites you to a feast is for your use during the
          time of the invitation. What ground is there to be proud of those
          things you are not the absolute lords and proprietors of, but only
          have the use of them granted to you during the pleasure of the
          Sovereign of the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Praise and thankfulness result from this doctrine of the
          sovereignty of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) He is to be praised for his royalty. (Ps. cxlv. 1), “I will
          extoll thee, my God, O King.” The Psalmist calls upon men five times
          to sing praise to him as King of all the earth. (Ps. xlvii. 6, 7),
          “Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises to our king, sing
          praises: for God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises with
          understanding.” All creatures, even the inanimate ones, are called
          upon to praise him because of the excellency of his name and the
          supremacy of his glory, in the 148th Psalm throughout, and ver. 13.
          That Sovereign Power that gave us hearts and tongues, deserves to have
          them employed in his praises, especially since he hath by the same
          hand given us so great matter for it. As he is a Sovereign we owe him
          thankfulness; he doth not deal with us in a way of absolute dominion;
          he might then have annihilated us, since he hath as full a dominion to
          reduce us to nothing. Consider the absoluteness of his sovereignty in
          itself, and you must needs acknowledge that he might have multiplied
          precepts, enjoined us the observance of more than he hath done; he
          might have made our tether much shorter; he might exact obedience, and
          promise no reward for it; he might dash us against the walls, as a
          potter doth his vessel, and no man have any just reason to say, What
          dost thou? or, Why dost thou use me so? A greater right is in him to
          use us in such a manner as we do sensible as well as insensible
          things. And if you consider his dominion as it is capable to be
          exercised in a way of unquestionable justice, and submitted to the
          reason and judgments of creatures, he might have dealt with us in a
          smarter way than he hath hitherto done; instead of one affliction, we
          might have had a thousand: he might have shut his own hands from
          pouring out any good upon us, and ordered innumerable scourges to be
          prepared for us; but he deals not with us according to the rights of
          his dominion. He doth not oppress us by the greatness of his majesty;
          he enters into covenant with us, and allures us by the chords of a
          man, and shows himself as much a merciful as an absolute Sovereign.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) As he is a Proprietor, we owe him thankfulness. He is at his own
          choice whether he will bestow upon us any blessings or no; the more
          value, therefore, his benefits deserve from us, and the Donor the more
          sincere returns. If we have anything from the creature to serve our
          turn, it is by the order of the chief Proprietor. He is the spring of
          honor, and the fountain of supplies: all creatures are but as the
          conduit pipes in a great city, which serve several houses with water,
          but from the great spring. All things are conveyed originally from his
          own hand, and are dispensed from his exchequer. If this great
          Sovereign did not order them, you would have no more supplies from a
          creature than you could have nourishment from a chip: it is the Divine
          will in everything that doth us good; every favor from creatures is
          but a smile from God, an evidence of his royalty to move us to pay a
          respect to him as the great Lord. Some heathens had so much respect
          for God, as to conclude that his will, and not their prudence, was the
          chief conductor of their affairs. His goodness to us calls for our
          thankfulness, but his sovereignty calls for a higher elevation of it:
          a smile from a prince is more valued, and thought worthy of more
          gratitude, than a present from a peasant; a small gift from a great
          person is more gratefully to be received than a larger from an
          inferior person: the condescension of royalty magnifies the gift. What
          is man, that thou, so great a Majesty, art mindful of him, to bestow
          this or that favor upon him?—is but a due reflection upon every
          blessing we receive. Upon every fresh blessing we should acknowledge
          the Donor and true Proprietor, and give him the honor of his dominion:
          his property ought to be thankfully owned in everything we are capable
          of consecrating to him; as David, after the liberal collection he had
          made for the building of the temple, owns in his dedication of it to
          that use the propriety of God: “Who am I, and what is my people, that
          we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all
          things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee” (1 Chron.
          xxix. 14): it was but a return of God’s own to him, as the waters of
          the river are no other than the return to the sea of what was taken
          from it. Praise and thankfulness is a rent due from all mankind, and
          from every creature, to the great Landlord, since all are tenants, and
          hold by him at his will. “Every creature in heaven and earth, and
          under the earth, and in the sea,” were heard, by John, to ascribe
          “blessing, honor, glory, and power, to Him that sits on the throne”
          (Rev. v. 13). We are as much bound to the sovereignty of God for his
          preservation of us, as for his creation of us; we are no less obliged
          to him that preserves our beings when exposed to dangers, than we are
          for bestowing a being upon us when we were not capable of danger.
          Thankfulness is due to this Sovereign for public concerns. Hath he not
          preserved the ship of his church in the midst of whistling winds and
          roaring waves; in the midst of the combats of men and devils; and
          rescued it often when it hath been near shipwrecked?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How should we be induced from hence to promote the honor of this
          Sovereign! We should advance him as supreme, and all our actions
          should concur in his honor: we should return to his glory what we have
          received from his sovereignty, and enjoy by his mercy: he that is the
          superior of all, ought to be the end of all. This is the harmony of
          the creation; that which is of an inferior nature is ordered to the
          service of that which is of a more excellent nature; thus water and
          earth, that have a lower being, are employed for the honor and beauty
          of the plants of the earth, who are more excellent in having a
          principle of a growing life: these plants are again subservient to the
          beasts and birds, which exceed them in a principle of sense, which the
          others want: those beasts and birds are ordered for the good of man,
          who is superior to them in a principle of reason, and is invested with
          a dominion over them. Man having God for his superior, ought as much
          to serve the glory of God, as other things are designed to be useful
          to man. Other governments are intended for the good of the community,
          the chief end is not the good of the governors themselves: but God
          being every way sovereign, the sovereign Being, giving being to all
          things, the sovereign Ruler, giving order and preservation to all
          things, is also the end of all things, to whose glory and honor all
          things, all creatures, are to be subservient; “for of him, and through
          him, and to him, are all things, to whom be glory for ever” (Rom. xi.
          36): of him, as the efficient cause; through him, as the preserving
          cause; to him, as the final cause. All our actions and thoughts ought
          to be addressed to his glory; our whole beings ought to be consecrated
          to his honor, though we should have no reward but the honor of having
          been subservient to the end of our creation: so much doth the
          excellency and majesty of God, infinitely elevated above us, challenge
          of us. Subjects use to value the safety, honor, and satisfaction of a
          good prince above their own: David is accounted worth ten thousand of
          the people; and some of his courtiers thought themselves obliged to
          venture their lives for his satisfaction in so mean a thing as a
          little water from the well of Bethlehem. Doth not so great, so good a
          Sovereign as God, deserve the same affection from us? “Do we swear,”
          saith a heathen, “to prefer none before Cæsar, and have we not greater
          reason to prefer none before God?”1022 It is a justice due from us to
          God to maintain his glory, as it is a justice to preserve the right
          and property of another. As God would lay aside his Deity if he did
          deny himself, so a creature acts irregularly, and out of the rank of a
          creature, if it doth not deny itself for God. He that makes himself
          his own end, makes himself his own sovereign. To napkin up a gift he
          hath bestowed upon us, or to employ what we possess solely to our own
          glory, to use anything barely for ourselves, without respect to God,
          is to apply it to a wrong use, and to injure God in his propriety, and
          the end of his donation. What we have ought to be used for the honor
          of God: he retains the dominion and lordship, though he grants us the
          use: we are but stewards, not proprietors, in regard to God, who
          expects an account from us, how we have employed his goods to his
          honor. The kingdom of God is to be advanced by us: we are to pray that
          his kingdom may come: we are to endeavor that his kingdom may come,
          that is, that God may be known to be the chief Sovereign; that his
          dominion, which was obscured by Adam’s fall, may be more manifested;
          that his subjects, which are suppressed in the world, may be
          supported; his laws, which are violated by the rebellions of men, may
          be more obeyed; and his enemies be fully subdued by his final
          judgment, the last evidence of his dominion in this state of the
          world; that the empire of sin and the devil may be abolished, and the
          kingdom of God perfected, that none may rule but the great and
          rightful Sovereign. Thus while we endeavor to advance the honor of his
          throne, we shall not want an honor to ourselves. He is too gracious a
          Sovereign to neglect them that are mindful of his glory; “those that
          honor him, he will honor” (1 Sam. ii. 30).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Fear and reverence of God in himself, and in his actions, is a duty
          incumbent on us from this doctrine (Jer. x. 7): “Who would not fear
          thee, O King of nations?” The ingratitude of the world is taxed in not
          reverencing God as a great king, who had given so many marks of his
          royal government among them. The prophet wonders there was no fear of
          so great a King in the world, since, “among all the wise men of the
          nations, and among all their kings, there is none like unto this;” no
          more reverence of him, since none ruled so wisely, nor any ruled so
          graciously. The dominion of God is one of the first sparks that gives
          fire to religion and worship, considered with the goodness of this
          Sovereign (Ps. xii. 27, 28): “All the nations shall worship before
          thee, for the kingdom is the Lord’s, and he is Governor among the
          nations.” Epicurus, who thought God careless of human affairs, leaving
          them at hap‑hazard, to the conduct of men’s wisdom and mutability of
          fortune, yet acknowledged that God ought to be worshipped by man for
          the excellency of his nature, and the greatness of his majesty. How
          should we reverence that God, that hath a throne encompassed with such
          glorious creatures as angels, whose faces we are not able to behold,
          though shadowed in assumed bodies! how should we fear the Lord of
          Hosts, that hath so many armies at his command in the heavens above,
          and in the earth below, whom he can dispose to the exact obedience of
          his will! how should men be afraid to censure any of his actions, to
          sit judge of their Judge, and call him to an account at their bar! how
          should such an earth‑worm, a mean animal as man, be afraid to speak
          irreverently of so great a King among his pots and strumpets! Not to
          fear him, not to reverence him, is to pull his throne from under him,
          and make him of a lower authority than ourselves, or any creature that
          we reverence more.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Prayer to God, and trust in him, is inferred from his sovereignty.
          If he be the supreme Sovereign, holding heaven and earth in his hand,
          disposing all things here below, not committing everything to the
          influence of the stars or the humors of men, we ought, then, to apply
          ourselves to him in every case, implore the exercise of his authority;
          we hereby own his peculiar right over all things and persons. He only
          is the supreme Head in all causes, and over all persons: “Thine is the
          kingdom” (Matt. vi. 13), concludes the Lord’s prayer, both as a motive
          to pray, and a ground to expect what we want. He that believes not
          God’s government will think it needless to call upon him, will expect
          no refuge under him in a strait, but make some creature‑reed his
          support. If we do not seek to him, but rely upon the dominion we have
          over our own possessions, or upon the authority of anything else, we
          disown his supremacy and dominion over all things; we have as good an
          opinion of ourselves, or of some creatures, as we ought to have of
          God; we think ourselves, or some natural cause we seek to or depend
          upon, as much sovereigns as he, and that all things which concern us
          are as much at the dispose of an inferior, as of the great Lord. It
          is, indeed, to make a god of ourselves, or of the creature; when we
          seek to him, upon all occasions, we own this Divine eminency, we
          acknowledge that it is by him men’s hearts are ordered, the world
          governed, all things disposed; and God, that is jealous of his glory,
          is best pleased with any duty in the creature that doth acknowledge
          and desire the glorification of it, which prayer and dependence on him
          doth in a special manner, desiring the exercise of his authority, and
          the preservation of it in ordering the affairs of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Obedience naturally results from this doctrine. As his justice
          requires fear, his goodness thankfulness, his faithfulness trust, his
          truth belief, so his sovereignty, in the nature of it, demands
          obedience: as it is most fit he should rule, in regard of his
          excellency, so it is most fit we should obey him in regard of his
          authority: he is our Lord, and we his subjects; he is our Master, and
          we his servants; it is righteous we should observe him, and conform to
          his will: he is everything that speaks an authority to command us, and
          that can challenge an humility in us to obey. As that is the truest
          doctrine that subjects us most to God, so he is the truest Christian
          that doth, in his practice, most acknowledge this subjection; and as
          sovereignty is the first notion a creature can have of God, so
          obedience is the first and chief thing conscience reflects upon the
          creature. Man holds all of God; and therefore owes all the operations
          capable to be produced by those faculties to that Sovereign Power that
          endowed him with them. Man had no being but from him; he hath no
          motion without him; he should, therefore, have no being but for him;
          and no motion but according to him: to call him Lord, and not to act
          in subjection to him, is to mock and put a scorn upon him (Luke vi.
          46): “Why call you me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?”
          It is like the crucifying Christ under the title of a King. It is not
          by professions, but by observance of the laws of a prince, that we
          manifest a due respect to him: by that we reverence that authority
          that enacted them, and the prudence that framed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine affords us motives to obey, and directs us to the manner
          of obedience.
        </p>
        <p>1st. Motives to obey,</p>
        <p>
          (1.) It is comely and orderly. Is it not a more becoming thing to be
          ruled by the will of our Sovereign than by that of our lusts?—to
          observe a wise and gracious Authority, than to set up inordinate
          appetites in the room of his law? Would not all men account it a
          disorder to be abominated, to see a slave or vassal control the just
          orders of his lord, and endeavor to subject his master’s will to his
          own? much more to expect God should serve our humor rather than we be
          regulated by his will. It is more orderly that subjects should obey
          their governors, than governors their subjects; that passion should
          obey reason, than reason obey passion. When good governors are to
          conform to subjects, and reason veil to passion, it is monstrous! the
          one disturbs the order of a community, and the other defaceth the
          beauty of the soul. Is it a comely thing for God to stoop to our
          meanness, or for us to stoop to his greatness?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) In regard of the Divine sovereignty, it is both honorable and
          advantageous to obey God. It is, indeed, the glory of a superior to be
          obeyed by his inferior; but where the sovereign is of transcendent
          excellency and dignity, it is an honor to a mean person to be under
          his immediate commands, and enrolled in his service. It is more honor
          to be God’s subject than to be the greatest worldly monarch; his very
          service is an empire, and disobedience to him is a slavery. It is a
          part of his sovereignty to reward any service done him.1023 Other
          lords may be willing to recompense the service of their subjects, but
          are often rendered unable; but nothing can stand in the way of God to
          hinder your reward, if nothing stand in your way to hinder your
          obedience (Lev. xviii. 5): “If you keep my statutes, you shall live in
          them; I am the Lord.” Is there anything in the world can recompense
          you for rebellion against God, and obedience to a lust? Saul cools the
          hearts of his servants from running after David, by David’s inability
          to give them fields and vineyards (1 Sam. xxii. 7): “Will the son of
          Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you
          captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, that you have
          conspired against me?” But God hath a dominion to requite, as well as
          an authority to command your obedience; he is a great Sovereign, to
          bear you out in your observance of his precepts against all reproaches
          and violence of men, and at last to crown you with eternal honor. If
          he should neglect vindicating, one time or other, your loyalty to him,
          he will neglect the maintaining and vindicating his own sovereignty
          and greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) God, in all his dispensations to man, was careful to preserve the
          rights of his sovereignty in exacting obedience of his creature. The
          second thing he manifested his sovereignty in was that of a Lawgiver
          to Adam, after that of a Proprietor in giving him the possession of
          the garden; one followed immediately the other (Gen. ii. 15, 16): “The
          Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress
          it; and the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
          garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of
          good and evil thou shalt not eat of it,” &amp;c. Nothing was to be
          enjoyed by man but upon the condition of obedience to his Lord; and it
          is observed that in the description of the creation, God is not called
          “Lord” till the finishing of the creation, and particularly in the
          forming of man. “And the Lord God formed man” (Gen. ii. 7). Though he
          was Lord of all creatures, yet it was in man he would have his
          sovereignty particularly manifested, and by man have his authority
          specially acknowledged. The law is prefaced with this title: “I am the
          Lord thy God” (Exod. xx. 2): authority in Lord, sweetness in God, the
          one to enjoin, the other to allure obedience; and God enforceth
          several of the commands with the same title. And as he begins many
          precepts with it, so he concludes them with the same title, “I am the
          Lord,” Lev. xix. 37, and in other places. In all his communications of
          his goodness to man in ways of blessing them, he stands upon the
          preservation of the rights of his sovereignty, and manifests his
          graciousness in favor of his authority. “I am the Lord your God,” your
          God in all my perfections for your advantage, but yet your Sovereign
          for your obedience. In all his condescension he will have the rights
          of this untouched and unviolated by us. When Christ would give the
          most pregnant instance of his condescending and humble kindness, he
          urgeth his authority to ballast their spirits from any presumptuous
          eruptions because of his humility. “You call me Master, and Lord; and
          you say well: for so I am” (John xiii. 13). He asserts his authority,
          and presseth them to their duty, when he had seemed to lay it by for
          the demeanor of a servant, and had, below the dignity of a master, put
          on the humility of a mean underling, to wash the disciples feet; all
          which was to oblige them to perform the command he then gave them
          (ver. 14), and in obedience to his authority, and imitation of his
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) All creatures obey him. All creatures punctually observe the law
          he hath imprinted on their nature, and in their several capacities
          acknowledge him their Sovereign; they move according to the
          inclinations he imprinted on them. The sea contains itself in its
          bounds, and the sun steps out of its sphere; the stars march in their
          order, “they continue this day according to thy ordinance, for all are
          thy servants” (Ps. cxix. 91). If he orders things contrary to their
          primitive nature, they obey him. When he speaks the word, the
          devouring fire becomes gentle, and toucheth not a hair of the children
          he will preserve; the hunger‑starved lions suspend their ravenous
          nature, when so good a morsel as Daniel is set before them; and the
          sun, which had been in perpetual motion since its creation, obeys the
          writ of ease God sent it in Joshua’s time, and stands still. Shall
          insensible and sensible creatures be punctual to his orders, passively
          acknowledge his authority? shall lions and serpents obey God in their
          places?—and shall not man, who can, by reason, argue out the
          sovereignty of God, and understand the sense and goodness of his laws,
          and actively obey God with that will he hath enriched him with above
          other creatures? Yet the truth is, every sensitive, yea, every
          senseless creature, obeys God more than his rational, more than his
          gracious creatures in this world. The rational creatures since the
          fall have a prevailing principle of corruption. Let the obedience of
          other creatures incite us more to imitate them, and shame our
          remissness in not acknowledging the dominion of God, in the just way
          he prescribes us to walk in. Well then, let us not pretend to own God
          as our Lord, and yet act the part of rebels; let us give him the
          reverence, and pay him that obedience, which of right belongs to so
          great a King. Whatsoever he speaks as a true God, ought to be
          believed; whatsoever he orders as a sovereign God, ought to be obeyed;
          let not God have less than man, nor man have more than God. It is a
          common principle writ upon the reason of all men, that respect and
          observance is due to the majesty of a man, much more to the Majesty of
          God as a Lawgiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          2d. As this doctrine presents us motives, so it directs us to the
          manner and kind of our obedience to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) It must be with a respect to his authority. As the veracity of
          God is the formal object of faith, and the reason why we believe the
          things he hath revealed; so the authority of God is the formal object
          of our obedience, or the reason why we observe the things he hath
          commanded. There must be a respect to his will as the rule, as well as
          to his glory as the end. It is not formally obedience that is not done
          with regard to the order of God, though it may be materially
          obedience, as it answers the matter of the precept. As when men will
          abstain from excess and rioting, because it is ruinous to their
          health, not because it is forbidden by the great Lawgiver; this is to
          pay a respect to our own conveniency and interest, not a conscientious
          observance to God; a regard to our health, not to our Sovereign; a
          kindness to ourselves, not a justice due to the rights of God. There
          must not only be a consideration of the matter of the precept as
          convenient, but a consideration of the authority of the Lawgiver as
          obligatory. “Thus saith the Lord,” ushers in every order of his,
          directing our eye to the authority enacting it; Jeroboam did God’s
          will of prophecy in taking the kingdom of Israel; and the devils may
          be subservient in God’s will or providence; but neither of them are
          put upon the account of obedience, because not done intentionally with
          any conscience of the sovereignty of God. God will have this owned by
          a regular respect to it; so much he insists upon the honor of it, that
          the sacrifice of Christ, God‑man, was most agreeable to him, not only
          as it was great and admirable in itself, but also for that ravishing
          obedience to his will, which was the life and glory of his sacrifice,
          whereby the justice of God was not only owned in the offering, but the
          sovereignty of God owned in the obedience. “He became obedient unto
          death; wherefore God highly exalted him” (Phil. ii. 8).
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) It must be the best and most exact obedience. The most sovereign
          authority calls for the exactest and lowest observance; the highest
          Lord for the deepest homage; being, he is, a “great King, he must have
          the best in our flock” (Mal. i. 14). Obedience is due to God, as King,
          and the choicest obedience is due to him, as he is the most excellent
          King. The more majestic and noble any man is, the more careful we are
          in our manner of service to him. We are bound to obey God, not only
          under the title of a “Lord” in regard of jurisdiction and political
          subjection, but under the title of a true “Lord and Master,” in regard
          of propriety; since we are not only his subjects but his servants, the
          exactest obedience is due to God, jure servitutis; “When you have done
          all, say you are unprofitable servants” (Luke xvii. 10), because we
          can do nothing which we owe not to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Sincere and inward obedience. As it is a part of his sovereignty
          to prescribe laws not only to man in his outward state, but to his
          conscience, so it is a part of our subjection to receive his laws into
          our will and heart. The authority of his laws exceeds human laws in
          the extent and riches of them, and our acknowledgment of his
          sovereignty cannot be right, but by subjecting the faculties of our
          soul to the Lawgiver of our souls; we else acknowledge his authority
          to be as limited as the empire of man; when his will not only sways
          the outward action, but the inward motion, it is a giving him the
          honor of his high throne above the throne of mortals. The right of God
          ought to be preserved undamaged in affection, as well as action.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It must be sole obedience. We are ordered to serve him only; “Him
          only shalt thou serve” (Matt. iv. 10): as the only Supreme Lord, as
          being the highest Sovereign, it is fit he should have the highest
          obedience before all earthly sovereigns, and as being unparalleled by
          any among all the nations, so none must have an obedience equal to
          him. When God commands, if the highest power on earth countermands it,
          the precept of God must be preferred before the countermand of the
          creature. “Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto
          you more than unto God, judge ye” (Acts iv. 18, 19). We must never
          give place to the authority of all the monarchs in the world, to the
          prejudice of that obedience we owe to the Supreme Monarch of heaven
          and earth; this would be to place the throne of God at the footstool
          of man, and debase him below the rank of a creature. Loyalty to man
          can never recompense for the mischief accruing from disloyalty to God.
          All the obedience we are to give to man, is to be paid in obedience to
          God, and with an eye to his precept: therefore, what servants do for
          their masters, they must do “as to the Lord” (Col. iii. 23); and
          children are to obey their parents “in the Lord” (Eph. vi. 1). The
          authority of God is to be eyed in all the services payable to man;
          proper and true obedience hath God solely for its principal and
          primary object; all obedience to man that interferes with that, and
          would justle out obedience to God, is to be refused. What obedience is
          due to man, is but rendered as a part of obedience to God, and a
          stooping of his authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          (5.) It must be universal obedience. The laws of man are not to be
          universally obeyed; some may be oppressing and unjust: no man hath
          authority to make an unjust law, and no subject is bound to obey an
          unrighteous law; but God being a righteous Sovereign, there is not one
          of his laws but doth necessarily oblige us to obedience. Whatsoever
          this Supreme Power declares to be his will, it must be our care to
          observe; man, being his creature, is bound to be subject to whatsoever
          laws he doth impose to the meanest as well as to the greatest: they
          having equally a stamp of Divine authority upon them. We are not to
          pick and choose among his precepts: this is to pare away part of his
          authority, and render him a half sovereign. It must be universal in
          all places. An Englishman in Spain is bound to obey the laws of that
          country wherein he resides: and so not responsible there for the
          breach of the laws of his native country. In the same condition is a
          Spaniard in England. But the laws of God are to be obeyed in every
          part of the world; wheresoever Divine Providence doth cast us, it
          casts us not out of the places where he commands, nor out of the
          compass of his own empire. He is Lord of the world, and his laws
          oblige in every part of the world; they were ordered for a world, and
          not for a particular climate and territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          (6.) It must be indisputable obedience. All authority requires
          readiness in the subject; the centurion had it from his soldiers; they
          went when he ordered them, and came when he beckoned to them (Matt.
          viii. 9). It is more fit God should have the same promptness from his
          subjects. We are to obey his orders, though our purblind understanding
          may not apprehend the reason of every one of them. It is without
          dispute that he is sovereign, and therefore it is without dispute that
          we are bound to obey him, without controlling his conduct. A master
          will not bear it from his slave, why should God from his creature?
          Though God admits his creatures sometimes to treat with him about the
          equality of his justice, and also about the reason of some commands,
          yet sometimes he gives no other reason but his own sovereignty, “Thus
          saith the Lord;” to correct the malapertness of men, and exact from
          them an entire obedience to his unlimited and absolute authority. When
          Abraham was commanded to offer Isaac, God acquaints him not with the
          reason of his demand till after (Gen. xxii. 2, 12), nor did Abraham
          enter any demur to the order, or expostulate with God, either from his
          own natural affection to Isaac, the hardness of the command, it being,
          as it were, a ripping up of his own bowels, nor the quickness of it
          after he had been a child of the promise, and a Divine donation above
          the course of nature. Nor did Paul confer with flesh and blood, and
          study arguments from nature and interest to oppose the Divine command,
          when he was sent upon his apostolical employment (Gal. i. 16). The
          more indisputable his right is to command, the stronger is our
          obligation to obey, without questioning the reason of his orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          (7.) It must be joyful obedience. Men are commonly more cheerful in
          their obedience to a great prince than to a mean peasant; because the
          quality of the master renders the service more honorable. It is a
          discredit to a prince’s government, when his subjects obey him with
          discontent and dejectedness, as though he were a hard master, and his
          laws tyrannical and unrighteous. When we pay obedience but with a dull
          and feeble pace, and a sour and sad temper, we blemish our great
          Sovereign, imply his commands to be grievous, void of that peace and
          pleasure he proclaims to be in them; that he deserves no respect from
          us, if we obey him because we must, and not because we will.
          Involuntary obedience deserves not the title: it is rather submission
          than obedience, an act of the body, not of the mind: a mite of
          obedience with cheerfulness, is better than a talent without it. In
          the little Paul did, he comforts himself in this, that with the “mind
          he served the law of God” (Rom. vii. 25); the testimonies of God were
          David’s delight (Ps. cxix. 24). Our understandings must take pleasure
          in knowing him, our wills delightfully embrace him, and our actions be
          cheerfully squared to him. This credits the sovereignty of God in the
          world, makes others believe him to be a gracious Lord, and move them
          to have some veneration for his authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          (8.) It must be a perpetual obedience. As man is a subject as soon as
          he is a creature, so he is a subject as long as he is a creature.
          God’s sovereignty is of perpetual duration, as long as he is God;
          man’s obedience must be perpetual, while he is a man. God cannot part
          with his sovereignty, and a creature cannot be exempted from
          subjection; we must not only serve him, but cleave to him (Deut. xiii.
          4). Obedience is continued in heaven, his throne is established in
          heaven, it must be bowed to in heaven, as well as in earth. The angels
          continually fulfil his pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Exhortation. Patience is a duty flowing from this doctrine. In all
          strokes upon ourselves, or thick showers upon the church, “the Lord
          reigns,” is a consideration to prevent muttering against him, and make
          us quietly wait to see what the issue of his Divine pleasure will be.
          It is too great an insolence against the Divine Majesty to censure
          what he acts, or quarrel with him for what he inflicts. Proud clay
          doth very unbecomingly swell against an infinite superior. If God be
          our Sovereign, we ought to subscribe to his afflicting will without
          debates, as well as to his liberal will with affectionate applauses.
          We should be as full of patience under his sharper, as of praise under
          his more grateful, dispensations, and be without reluctancy against
          his penal, as well as his preceptive, pleasure. It is God’s part to
          inflict, and the creature’s part to submit.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine affords us motives, and shows us the nature of patience.
          1. Motives to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) God, being Sovereign, hath an absolute right to dispose of all
          things. His title to our persons and possessions is, upon this
          account, stronger than our own can be; we have as much reason to be
          angry with ourselves, when we assert our worldly right against others,
          as to be angry with God for asserting the right of his dominion over
          us. Why should we enter a charge against him, because he hath not
          tempered us so strong in our bodies, drawn us with as fair colors,
          embellished our spirits with as rich gifts as others? Is he not the
          Sovereign of his own goods, to impart what, and in what measure, he
          pleaseth? Would you be content your servants should check your
          pleasure in dispensing your own favors? It is an unreasonable thing
          not to leave God to the exercise of his own dominion. Though Job were
          a pattern of patience, yet he had deep tinctures of impatience; he
          often complains of God’s usage of him as too hard, and stands much
          upon his own integrity; but when God comes, in the latter chapters of
          that book, to justify his carriage towards him, he chargeth him not as
          a criminal, but considers him only as his vassal. He might have found
          flaws enough in Job’s carriage, and corruption enough in Job’s nature,
          to clear the equity of his proceeding as a judge; but he useth no
          other medium to convince him, but the greatness of his Majesty, the
          unlimitedness of his sovereignty, which so appals the good man, that
          he puts his finger on his mouth and stands mute with a self‑abhorrency
          before him, as a Sovereign, rather than as a Judge. When he doth pinch
          us, and deprive us of what we most affect, his right to do it should
          silence our lips and calm our hearts from any boisterous uproars
          against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) The property of all still remains in God, since he is sovereign.
          He did not divest himself of the property when he granted us the use;
          the earth is his, not ours; the fulness any of us have, as well as the
          fulness others have. After he had given the Israelites corn, wine, and
          oil, he calls them all his, and emphatically adds my, to every one of
          them (Hos. ii. 9). His right is universal over every mite we have, and
          perpetual too; he may, therefore, take from us what he please. He did
          but deposit in our hands for awhile the benefits we enjoy, either
          children, friends, estate, or lives; he did not make a total
          conveyance of them, and alienate his own property, when he put them
          into our hands; we can show no patent for them, wherein the full right
          is passed over to us, to hold them against his will and pleasure, and
          implead him if he offer to re‑assume them: he reserved a power to
          dispossess us upon a forfeiture, as he is the Lord and Governor. Did
          any of us yet answer the condition of his grant? it was his indulgence
          to allow them so long; there is reason to submit to him, when he
          re‑assumes what he lent us, and rather to thank him that he lent it so
          long, and did not seize upon it sooner.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) Other things have more reason to complain of our sovereignty over
          them, than we of God’s exercise of his sovereignty over us. Do we not
          exercise an authority over our beasts, as to strike them when we
          please, and merely for our pleasure; and think we merit no reproof for
          it, because they are our own, and of a nature inferior to ours? And
          shall not God, who is absolute, do as much with us, who are more below
          him than the meanest creatures are below us? They are creatures as
          well as we, and we no more creatures than they; they were framed by
          Omnipotence as well as we; there is no more difference between them
          and us in the notion of creatures. As there is no difference between
          the greatest monarch on earth, and the meanest beggar on the dunghill,
          in the notion of a man; the beggar is a man, as well as the monarch,
          and as much a man; the difference consists in the special endowments
          we have above them by the bounty of their and our common Creator. We
          are less, if compared with God, than the worst, meanest, and most
          sordid creature can be, if compared with us. Hath not a bird or a hare
          (if they had a capacity) more reason to complain of men’s persecuting
          them by their hawks and their dogs? but would their complaints appear
          reasonable, since both were made for the use of man, and man doth but
          use the nature of the one to attain a benefit by the other? Have we
          any reason to complain of God if he lets loose other creatures, the
          devouring hounds of the world, to bite and afflict us? We must not
          open our lips against him, nor let our heart swell against his
          scourge, since both they and we were made for his use, as well as
          other creatures for our; this is a reason to stifle all complaints
          against God, but not to make us careless of preventing afflictions, or
          emerging out of them by all just ways. The hare hath a nature to shift
          for itself by its winding and turning, and the bird by its flight; and
          neither of them could be blamed, if they were able, should the one
          scratch out the eyes of the hounds, and the other sacrifice the hawk
          to its own fury.
        </p>
        <p>
          (4.) It is a folly not to submit to him. Why should we strive against
          him, since he is an unaccountable Sovereign, and “gives no account of
          any of his matters?” (Job xxxiii. 13.) Who can disannul the judgment
          God gives? There is no appeal from the supreme court; a higher court
          can repeal or null the sentence of an inferior court, but the sentence
          of the highest stands irreversible, but by itself and its own
          authority. It is better to lower our sails, than to grapple with one
          that can shoot us under water; to submit to that Sovereign whom we
          cannot subdue.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It shows us the true nature of patience in regard of God: it is a
          submission to God’s sovereignty. As the formal object of obedience is
          the authority of God enacting the law, so the formal object of
          patience is the authority of God inflicting the punishment: as his
          right of commanding is to be eyed in the one, so his right of
          punishing is to be considered in the other. This was Eli’s condition,
          when he had received a message that might put flesh and blood into a
          mutiny, the rending the priesthood from his family, and the ruin of
          his house: yet this consideration, “It is the Lord,” calms him into
          submission, and a willing compliance with the Divine pleasure (1 Sam.
          iii. 18): “It is the Lord, let him do what seems good in his sight.”
          Job was of the same strain (Job i. 21): “The Lord gives, and the Lord
          hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord;” he considers God as
          a sovereign, who was not to be reproached, or have anything uncomely
          uttered of him, for what he had done. To be patient because we cannot
          avoid it, or resist it, is a violent, not a loyal patience; but to
          submit because it is the will of God to inflict; to be silent, because
          the sovereignty of God doth order it, is a patience of a true
          complexion. The other kind of patience is no other than that of an
          enemy that will free himself as soon as he can, and by any way, though
          never so violent, that offers itself. This sort of patience is that of
          a subject acknowledging the supreme authority over him, and that he
          ought to be ordered by the will, and to the glory of God, more than by
          his own will, and for his own ease; “I was dumb, I opened not my
          mouth” (Ps. xxxix. 10); not because I could not help it, but “because
          thou didst it,” thou who art my sovereign Lord. The greatness of God
          claims an awful and inviolable respect from his creatures in what way
          soever he doth dispose of them; this is due to him; since his kingdom
          ruleth over all, his kingdom should be acknowledged by all, and his
          royal authority submitted to in all that he doth.
