        <h2>DISCOURSE IV.</h2>
        <p>ON SPIRITUAL WORSHIP.</p>
        <p>
          John iv. 24.—God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
          him in spirit and in truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus despatched the first proposition, “God is a Spirit,” it
          will not be amiss to handle the inference our Saviour makes from that
          proposition, which is the second observation propounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doct. That the worship due from us to God ought to be spiritual, and
          spiritually performed. Spirit and truth are understood variously. We
          are to worship God,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Not by legal ceremonies. The evangelical administration being
          called spirit, in opposition to the legal ordinances as carnal; and
          truth in opposition to them as typical. As the whole Judaical service
          is called flesh, so the whole evangelical service is called spirit; or
          spirit may be opposed to the worship at Jerusalem, as it was carnal;
          truth, to the worship on the Mount Gerizim, because it was false. They
          had not the true object of worship, nor the true medium of worship as
          those at Jerusalem had. Their worship should cease, because it was
          false; and the Jewish worship should cease, because it was carnal.
          There is no need of a candle when the sun spreads his beams in the
          air; no need of those ceremonies when the Sun of righteousness
          appeared; they only served for candles to instruct and direct men till
          the time of his coming. The shadows are chased away by displaying the
          substance, so that they can be of no more use in the worship of God,
          since the end for which they were instituted is expired; and that
          discovered to us in the gospel, which the Jews sought for in vain
          among the baggage and stuff of their ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. With a spiritual and sincere frame. In spirit, i. e. with spirit;
          with the inward operations of all the faculties of our souls, and the
          cream and flower of them; and the reason is, because there ought to be
          a worship suitable to the nature of God; and as the worship was to be
          spiritual, so the exercise of that worship ought to be in a spiritual
          manner.417 It shall be a worship “in truth,” because the true God
          shall be adored without those vain imaginations and fantastic
          resemblances of him,418 which were common among the blind Gentiles,
          and contrary to the glorious nature of God, and unworthy ingredients
          in religious services. It shall be a worship “in spirit,” without
          those carnal rites the degenerate Jews rested on; such a posture of
          soul which is the life and ornament of every service God looks for at
          your hands. There must be some proportion between the object adored,
          and the manner in which we adore it; it must not be a mere corporeal
          worship, because God is not a body; but it must rise from the centre
          of our soul, because God is a Spirit. If he were a body, a bodily
          worship might suit him, images might be fit to represent him; but
          being a Spirit, our bodily services enter us not into communion with
          him. Being a spirit, we must banish from our minds all carnal
          imaginations of him, and separate from our wills all cold and
          dissembled affections to him. We must not only have a loud voice, but
          an elevated soul; not only a bended knee, but a broken heart; not only
          a supplicating tone, but a groaning spirit; not only a ready ear for
          the word, but a receiving heart; and this shall be of greater value
          with him, than the most costly outward services offered at Gerizim or
          Jerusalem. Our Saviour certainly meant not by worshipping in spirit,
          only the matter of the evangelical service, as opposed to the legal
          administration, without the manner wherein it was to be performed. It
          is true, God always sought a worship in spirit; he expected the heart
          of the worshipper should join with his instituted rights of adoration
          in every exercise of them; but he expects such a carriage more under
          the gospel administration, because of the clearer discoveries of his
          nature made in it, and the greater assistances conveyed by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall, therefore, 1. Lay down some general propositions. 2. Show
          what this spiritual worship is. 3. Why we must offer to God a
          spiritual service. 4. The use.
        </p>
        <p>1. Some general propositions.</p>
        <p>
          Prop. I. The right exercise of worship is founded upon, and riseth
          from, the spirituality of God.419 The first ground of the worship we
          render to God, is the infinite excellency of his nature, which is not
          only one attribute, but results from all; for God, as God, is the
          object of worship; and the notion of God consists not in thinking him
          wise, good, just, but all those infinitely beyond any conception; and
          hence it follows that God is an object infinitely to be loved and
          honored. His goodness is sometimes spoken of in Scripture as a motive
          of our homage (Psalm cxxx. 4): “There is forgiveness with thee that
          thou mayest be feared.” Fear, in the Scripture dialect, signifies the
          “whole worship of God” (Acts x. 35): but in every nation, “he that
          fears him” is accepted of him.420 If God should act towards men
          according to the rigors of his justice due to them for the least of
          their crimes, there could be no exercise of any affection but that of
          despair, which could not engender a worship of God, which ought to be
          joined with love, not with hatred. The beneficence and patience of
          God, and his readiness to pardon men, is the reason of the honor they
          return to him; and this is so evident a motive, that generally the
          idolatrous world ranked those creatures in the number of their gods,
          which they perceived useful and beneficial to mankind, as the sun and
          moon, the Egyptians the ox, &amp;c. And the more beneficial anything
          appeared to mankind, the higher station men gave it in the rank of
          their deities, and bestowed a more peculiar and solemn worship upon
          it. Men worshipped God to procure and continue his favor, which would
          not have been acted by them, had they not conceived it a pleasing
          thing to him to be merciful and gracious. Sometimes his justice is
          proposed to us as a motive of worship (Heb. xii. 28, 29): “Serve God
          with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire;” which
          includes his holiness, whereby he doth hate sin, as well as his wrath,
          whereby he doth punish it. Who but a mad and totally brutish person,
          or one that was resolved to make war against heaven, could behold the
          effects of God’s anger in the world, consider him in his justice as a
          “consuming fire,” and despise him, and rather be drawn out by that
          consideration to blasphemy and despair, than to seek all ways to
          appease him? Now though the infinite power of God, his unspeakable
          wisdom, his incomprehensible goodness, the holiness of his nature, the
          vigilance of his providence, the bounty of his hand, signify to man
          that he should love and honor him, and are the motives of worship; yet
          the spirituality of his nature is the rule of worship, and directs us
          to render our duty to him with all the powers of our soul. As his
          goodness beams out upon us, worship is due in justice to him; and as
          he is the most excellent nature, veneration is due to him in the
          highest manner with the choicest affections. So that indeed the
          spirituality of God comes chiefly into consideration in matter of
          worship: all his perfections are grounded upon this: he could not be
          infinite, immutable, omniscient, if he were a corporeal being;421 we
          cannot give him a worship unless we judge him worthy, excellent, and
          deserving a worship at our hands; and we cannot judge him worthy of a
          worship, unless we have some apprehensions and admirations of his
          infinite virtues; and we cannot apprehend and admire those
          perfections, but as we see them as causes shining in their effects.
          When we see, therefore, the frame of the world to be the work of his
          power, the order of the world to be the fruit of his wisdom, and the
          usefulness of the world to be the product of his goodness, we find the
          motives and reasons of worship; and weighing that this power, wisdom,
          goodness, infinitely transcend any corporeal nature, we find a rule of
          worship, that it ought to be offered by us in a manner suitable to
          such a nature as is infinitely above any bodily being. His being a
          Spirit declares what he is; his other perfections declare what kind of
          Spirit he is. All God’s perfections suppose him a Spirit; all centre
          in this; his wisdom doth not suppose him merciful, or his mercy
          suppose him omniscient; there may be distinct notions of those, but
          all suppose him to be of a spiritual nature. How cold and frozen will
          our devotions be, if we consider not his omniscience, whereby he
          discerns our hearts! How carnal will our services be, if we consider
          him not as a pure Spirit!422 In our offers to, and transactions with
          men, we deal not with them as mere animals, but as rational creatures;
          and we debase their natures if we treat them otherwise; and if we have
          not raised apprehensions of God’s spiritual nature in our treating
          with him, but allow him only such frames as we think fit enough for
          men, we debase his spirituality to the littleness of our own being. We
          must, therefore, possess our souls with this; we shall else render him
          no better than a fleshly service. We do not much concern ourselves in
          those things of which we are either utterly ignorant, or have but
          slight apprehensions of. That is the first proposition;—The right
          exercise of worship is grounded upon the spirituality of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. II. This spiritual worship of God is manifest by the light of
          nature, to be due to him. In reference to this, consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The outward means or matter of that worship which would be
          acceptable to God, was not known by the light of nature. The law for a
          worship, and for a spiritual worship by the faculties of our souls was
          natural, and part of the law of creation; though the determination of
          the particular acts, whereby God would have this homage testified, was
          of positive institution, and depended not upon the law of creation.
          Though Adam in innocence knew God was to be worshipped, yet by nature
          he did not know by what outward acts he was to pay this respect, or at
          what time he was more solemnly to be exercised in it than at another:
          this depended upon the directions God, as the sovereign Governor and
          Lawgiver, should prescribe. You therefore find the positive
          institutions of the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil,” and the
          determination of the time of worship (Gen. ii. 3, 17). Had there been
          any such notion in Adam naturally, as strong as that other, that a
          worship was due to God, there would have been found some relics of
          these modes universally consented to by mankind, as well as of the
          other. But though all nations have by an universal consent concurred
          in the acknowledgment of the being of God, and his right to adoration,
          and the obligation of the creature to it; and that there ought to be
          some public rule and polity in matters of religion (for no nation hath
          been in the world without a worship, and without external acts and
          certain ceremonies to signify that worship); yet their modes and rites
          have been as various as their climates, unless in that common notion
          of sacrifices, not descending to them by nature, but tradition from
          Adam; and the various ways of worship have been more provoking than
          pleasing. Every nation suited the kind of worship to their particular
          ends and polities they designed to rule by. How God was to be
          worshipped is more difficult to be discerned by nature with its eyes
          out than with its eyes clear.423 The pillars upon which the worship of
          God stands cannot be discerned without revelation, no more than blind
          Samson could tell where the pillars of the Philistines’ theatre stood,
          without one to conduct him. What Adam could not see with his sound
          eyes, we cannot with our dim eyes; he must be told from heaven what
          worship was fit for the God of heaven. It is not by nature that we can
          have such a full prospect of God as may content and quiet us; this is
          the noble effect of Divine revelation; He only knows himself, and can
          only make himself known to us. It could not be supposed that an
          infinite God should have no perfections but what were visible in the
          works of his hands; and that these perfections should not be
          infinitely greater, than as they were sensible in their present
          effects: this had been to apprehend God a limited Being, meaner than
          he is. Now it is impossible to honor God as we ought, unless we know
          him as he is; and we could not know him as he is, without divine
          revelation from himself; for none but God can acquaint us with his own
          nature: and therefore the nations void of this conduct, heaped up
          modes of worship from their own imaginations, unworthy of the majesty
          of God, and below the nature of man. A rational man would scarce have
          owned such for signs of honor, as the Scripture mentions in the
          services of Baal and Dagon; much less an infinitely wise and glorious
          God. And when God had signified his mind to his own people, how
          unwilling were they to rest satisfied with God’s determination, but
          would be warping to their own inventions, and make gods, and ways of
          worship to themselves!424 as in the matter of the golden calf, as was
          lately spoken of.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Though the outward manner of worship acceptable to God could not be
          known without revelation, and those revelations might be various; yet
          the inward manner of worship with our spirits was manifest by nature:
          and not only manifest by nature to Adam in innocence, but after his
          fall, and the scales he had brought upon his understanding by that
          fall. When God gave him his positive institutions before the fall, or
          whatsoever additions God should have made, had he persisted in that
          state; or, when he appointed him, after his fall, to testify his
          acknowledgment of him by sacrifices, there needed no command to him to
          make those acknowledgments by those outward ways prescribed to him,
          with the intention and prime affection of his spirit: this nature
          would instruct him in without revelation; for he could not possibly
          have any semblance of reason to think that the offering of beasts, or
          the presenting the first fruits of the increase of the ground, as an
          acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty over him and his bounty to him,
          was sufficient, without devoting to him that part wherein the image of
          his Creator did consist: he could not but discern, by a reflection
          upon his own being, that he was made for God as well as by God: for it
          is a natural principle of which the apostle speaks (Rom. xi. 36), “For
          of him, and through him, and to him are all things,” &amp;c.: that the
          whole whereof he did consist was due to God; and that his body, the
          dreggy and dusty part of his nature, was not fit to be brought alone
          before God, without that nobler principle, which he had, by creation,
          linked with it. Nothing in the whole law of nature, as it is informed
          of religion, was clearer, next to the being of a God, than this manner
          of worshipping God with the mind and spirit. And as the Gentiles never
          sunk so low into the mud of idolatry, as to think the images they
          worshipped were really their gods, but the representations, or
          habitations of their gods; so they never deserted this principle in
          the notion of it, that God was to be honored with the best they were,
          and the best they had: as they never denied the being of a God in the
          notion, though they did in the practice, so they never rejected this
          principle in notion, though they did, and now most men do, in the
          inward observation of it: it was a maxim among them that God was mens
          animus, mind and spirit, and therefore was to be honored with the mind
          and spirit: that religion did not consist in the ceremonies of the
          body, but the work of the soul; whence the speech of one of them:
          “Sacrifice to the gods, not so much clothed with purple garments as a
          pure heart:”425 and of another: “God regards not the multitude of the
          sacrifices, but the disposition of the sacrificer.”426 It is not fit
          we should deny God the cream and the flower, and give him the flotten
          part and the stalks. And with what reverence and intention of mind
          they thought their worship was to be performed, is evident by the
          priests crying out often, Hoc age, Mind this, let your spirits be
          intent upon it. This could not but result,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) From the knowledge of ourselves. It is a natural principle, “God
          hath made us, and not we ourselves” (Psalm c. 1, 2). Man knows himself
          to be a rational creature; as a creature he was to serve his Creator,
          and as a rational creature with the best part of that rational nature
          he derived from him. By the same act of reason that he knows himself
          to be a creature, he knows himself to have a Creator; that this
          Creator is more excellent than himself, and that an honor is due from
          him to the Creator for framing of him; and, therefore, this honor was
          to be offered to him by the most excellent part which was framed by
          him. Man cannot consider himself as a thinking, understanding, being,
          but he must know that he must give God the honor of his thoughts, and
          worship him with those faculties whereby he thinks, wills, and
          acts.427 He must know his faculties were given him to act, and to act
          for the glory of that God who gave him his soul, and the faculties of
          it; and he could not in reason think they must be only active in his
          own service, and the service of the creature, and idle and
          unprofitable in the service of his Creator. With the same powers of
          our soul, whereby we contemplate God, we must also worship God; we
          cannot think of him but with our minds, nor love him but with our
          will; and we cannot worship him without the acts of thinking and
          loving, and therefore cannot worship him without the exercise of our
          inward faculties: how is it possible then for any man that knows his
          own nature, to think that extended hands, bended knees, and lifted up
          eyes, were sufficient acts of worship, without a quickened and active
          spirit?
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) From the knowledge of God. As there was a knowledge of God by
          nature, so the same nature did dictate to man, that God was to be
          glorified as God; the apostle implies the inference in the charge he
          brings against them for neglecting it.428 “We should speak of God as
          he is,” said one;429 and the same reason would inform them that they
          were to act towards God as he is. The excellency of the object
          required a worship according to the dignity of his nature, which could
          not be answered but by the most serious inward affection, as well as
          outward decency; and a want of this cannot but be judged to be
          unbecoming the majesty of the Creator of the world, and the excellency
          of religion. No nation, no person, did ever assert, that the vilest
          part of man was enough for the most excellent Being, as God is; that a
          bodily service could be a sufficient acknowledgment for the greatness
          of God, or a sufficient return for the bounty of God. Man could not
          but know that he was to act in religion conformably to the object of
          religion, and to the excellency of his own soul:430 the notion of a
          God was sufficient to fill the mind of man with admiration and
          reverence, and the first conclusion from it would be to honor God, and
          that he have all the affection placed on him that so infinite and
          spiritual a Being did deserve: the progress then would be, that this
          excellent Being was to be honored with the motions of the
          understanding and will, with the purest and most spiritual powers in
          the nature of man, because he was a spiritual being, and had nothing
          of matter mingled with him. Such a brutish imagination, to suppose
          that blood and fumes, beasts and incense, could please a Deity,
          without a spiritual frame, cannot be supposed to befall any but those
          that had lost their reason in the rubbish of sense. Mere rational
          nature could never conclude that so excellent a Spirit would be put
          off with a mere animal service; an attendance of matter and body
          without spirit, when they themselves, of an inferior nature, would be
          loth to sit down contented with an outside service from those that
          belong to them; so that this instruction of our Saviour, that God is
          to be worshipped in spirit and truth, is conformable to the sentiments
          of nature, and drawn from the most undeniable principles of it. The
          excellency of God’s nature, and the excellent constitution of human
          faculties, concur naturally to support this persuasion; this was as
          natural to be known by men, as the necessity of justice and temperance
          for the support of human societies and bodies. It is to be feared,
          that if there be not among us such brutish apprehensions, there are
          such brutish dealings with God, in our services, against the light of
          nature; when we place all our worship of God in outward attendances
          and drooping countenances, with unbelieving frames and formal
          devotions; when prayer is muttered over in private, slightly, as a
          parrot learns lessons by rote, not understanding what it speaks, or to
          what end it speaks it; not glorifying God in thought and spirit, with
          understanding and will.

          Prop. III. Spiritual worship therefore was always required by God, and
          always offered to him by one or other. Man had a perpetual obligation
          upon him to such a worship from the nature of God; and what is founded
          upon the nature of God is invariable. This and that particular mode of
          worship may wax old as a garment, and as a vesture may be folded up
          and changed, as the expression is of the heavens;431 but God endures
          forever; his spirituality fails not, therefore a worship of him in
          spirit must run through all ways and rites of worship. God must cease
          to be Spirit, before any service but that which is spiritual can be
          accepted by him. The light of nature is the light of God; the light of
          nature being unchangeable, what was dictated by that, was alway, and
          will alway be, required by God. The worship of God being perpetually
          due from the creature, the worshipping him as God is as perpetually
          his right. Though the outward expressions of his honor were different,
          one way in Paradise (for a worship was then due, since a solemn time
          for that worship was appointed), another under the law, another under
          the gospel; the angels also worship God in heaven, and fall down
          before his throne; yet, though they differ in rites, they agree in
          this necessary ingredient, all rites, though of a different shape,
          must be offered to him, not as carcasses, but animated with the
          affections of the soul. Abel’s sacrifice had not been so excellent in
          God’s esteem, without those gracious habits and affections working in
          his soul.432 Faith works by love; his heart was on fire as well as his
          sacrifice. Cain rested upon his present; perhaps thought he had
          obliged God; he depended upon the outward ceremony, but sought not for
          the inward purity: it was an offering brought to the Lord;433 he had
          the right object, but not the right manner (Gen. iv. 7): “If thou
          doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?” And in the command afterwards
          to Abraham, “Walk before me, and be thou perfect,” was the direction
          in all our religious acts and walkings with God. A sincere act of the
          mind and will, looking above and beyond all symbols, extending the
          soul to a pitch far above the body, and seeing the day of Christ
          through the veil of the ceremonies, was required by God: and though
          Moses, by God’s order, had instituted a multitude of carnal
          ordinances, sacrifices, washings, oblations of sensible things, and
          recommended to the people the diligent observation of those statutes,
          by the allurements of promises and denouncing of threatenings; as if
          there were nothing else to be regarded, and the true workings of grace
          were to be buried under a heap of ceremonies; yet sometimes he doth
          point them to the inward worship, and, by the command of God, requires
          of them the “circumcision of the heart” (Deut. x. 16), the turning to
          God with “all their heart and all their soul” (Deut. xxx. 10): whereby
          they might recollect, that it was the engagement of the heart and the
          worship of the Spirit that was most agreeable to God; and that he took
          not any pleasure in their observance of ceremonies, without true piety
          within, and the true purity of their thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. IV. It is, therefore, as much every man’s duty to worship God in
          spirit, as it is their duty to worship him. Worship is so due to him
          as God, as that he that denies it disowns his deity; and spiritual
          worship is so due, that he that waives it denies his spirituality. It
          is a debt of justice we owe to God, to worship him; and it is as much
          a debt of justice to worship him according to his nature. Worship is
          nothing else but a rendering to God the honor that is due to him; and,
          therefore, the right posture of our spirits in it is as much, or more,
          due, than the material worship in the modes of his own prescribing:
          that is, grounded both upon his nature and upon his command; this only
          upon his command, that is perpetually due; whereas, the channel
          wherein outward worship runs may be dried up, and the river diverted
          another way; such a worship wherein the mind thinks of God, feels a
          sense of God, has a spirit consecrated to God, the heart glowing with
          affections to God; it is else a mocking God with a feather. A rational
          nature must worship God with that wherein the glory of God doth most
          sparkle in him. God is most visible in the frame of the soul, it is
          there his image glitters; he hath given us a jewel as well as a case,
          and the jewel as well as the case we must return to him; the spirit is
          God’s gift, and must “return to him;”434 it must return to him in
          every service morally, as well as it must return to him at last
          physically. It is not fit we should serve our Maker only with that
          which is the brute in us, and withhold from him that which doth
          constitute us reasonable creatures; we must give him our bodies, but a
          “living sacrifice.”435 If the spirit be absent from God when the body
          is before him, we present a dead sacrifice; it is morally dead in the
          duty, though it be naturally alive in the posture and action. It is
          not an indifferent thing whether we shall worship God or no; nor is it
          an indifferent thing whether we shall worship him with our spirits or
          no; as the excellency of man’s knowledge consists in knowing things as
          they are in truth, so the excellency of the will in willing things as
          they are in goodness. As it is the excellency of man, to know God as
          God; so it is no less his excellency, as well as his duty to honor God
          as God. As the obligation we have to the power of God for our being,
          binds us to a worship of him; so the obligation we have to his bounty
          for fashioning us according to his own image, binds us to an exercise
          of that part wherein his image doth consist. God hath “made all things
          for himself” (Prov. xvi. 4), that is, for the evidence of his own
          goodness and wisdom; we are therefore to render him a glory according
          to the excellency of his nature, discovered in the frame of our own.
          It is as much our sin not to glorify God as God, as not to attempt the
          glorifying of him at all; it is our sin not to worship God as God, as
          well as to omit the testifying any respect at all to him. As the
          Divine nature is the object of worship, so the Divine perfections are
          to be honored in worship; we do not honor God if we honor him not as
          he is; we honor him not as a Spirit, if we think him not worthy of the
          ardors and ravishing admirations of our spirits. If we think the
          devotions of the body are sufficient for him, we contract him into the
          condition of our own being; and not only deny him to be a spiritual
          nature, but dash out all those perfections which he could not be
          possessed of were he not a Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. V. The ceremonial law was abolished to promote the spirituality
          of divine worship. That service was gross, carnal, calculated for an
          infant and sensitive church. It consisted in rudiments, the
          circumcision of the flesh, the blood and smoke of sacrifices, the
          steams of incense, observation of days, distinction of meats, corporal
          purifications; every leaf of the law is clogged with some rite to be
          particularly observed by them. The spirituality of worship lay veiled
          under a thick cloud, that the people could not behold the glory of the
          gospel, which lay covered under those shadows (2 Cor. iii. 13): “They
          could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:”
          They understood not the glory and spiritual intent of the law, and
          therefore came short of that spiritual frame in the worship of God,
          which was their duty. And therefore in opposition to this
          administration, the worship of God under the gospel is called by our
          Saviour in the text, a worship in spirit; more spiritual for the
          matter, more spiritual for the motives, and more spiritual for the
          manner and frames of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. This legal service is called flesh in Scripture, in opposition to
          the gospel, which is called spirit. The ordinances of the law, though
          of divine institution, are dignified by the apostle with no better a
          title than carnal ordinances,436 and a carnal command:437 but the
          gospel is called the ministration of the Spirit, as being attended
          with a special and spiritual efficacy on the minds of men.438 And when
          the degenerate Galatians, after having tasted of the pure streams of
          the gospel, turned about to drink of the thicker streams of the law,
          the apostle tells them, that they begun in the spirit and would now be
          made perfect in the flesh;439 they would leave the righteousness of
          faith for a justification by works. The moral law, which is in its own
          nature spiritual,440 in regard of the abuse of it, in expectation of
          justification by the outward works of it, is called flesh: much more
          may the ceremonial administration, which was never intended to run
          parallel with the moral, nor had any foundation in nature as the other
          had. That whole economy consisted in sensible and material things,
          which only touched the flesh: it is called the letter and the oldness
          of the letter;441 as letters, which are but empty sounds of
          themselves, but put together and formed into words, signify something
          to the mind of the hearer or reader: an old letter, a thing of no
          efficacy upon the spirit, but as a law written upon paper. The gospel
          hath an efficacious spirit attending it, strongly working upon the
          mind and will, and moulding the soul into a spiritual frame for God,
          according to the doctrine of the gospel; the one is old and decays,
          the other is new and increaseth daily. And as the law itself is called
          flesh, so the observers of it and resters in it are called Israel
          after the flesh;442 and the evangelical worshipper is called a Jew
          after the spirit (Rom. ii. 29). They were Israel after the flesh as
          born of Jacob, not Israel after the spirit as born of God; and
          therefore the apostle calls them Israel and not Israel;443 Israel
          after a carnal birth, not Israel after a spiritual; Israel in the
          circumcision of the flesh, not Israel by a regeneration of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. The legal ceremonies were not a fit means to bring the heart into a
          spiritual frame. They had a spiritual intent; the rock and manna
          prefigured the salvation and spiritual nourishment by the Redeemer.444
          The sacrifices were to point them to the justice of God in the
          punishment of sin, and the mercy of God in substituting them in their
          steads, as types of the Redeemer and the ransom by his blood. The
          circumcision of the flesh was to instruct them in the circumcision of
          the heart: they were flesh in regard of their matter, weakness and
          cloudiness, spiritual in regard of their intent and signification;
          they did instruct, but not efficaciously work strong spiritual
          affections in the soul of the worshipper. They were weak and beggarly
          elements;445 had neither wealth to enrich nor strength to nourish the
          soul: they could not perfect the comers to them, or put them into a
          frame agreeable to the nature of God,446 nor purge the conscience from
          those dead and dull dispositions which were by nature in them:447
          being carnal they could not have an efficacy to purify the conscience
          of the offerer and work spiritual effects: had they continued without
          the exhibition of Christ, they could never have wrought any change in
          us or purchased any favor for us.448 At the best they were but
          shadows, and came inexpressibly short of the efficacy of that person
          and state whose shadows they were. The shadow of a man is too weak to
          perform what the man himself can do, because it wants the life,
          spirit, and activity of the substance: the whole pomp and scene was
          suited more to the sensitive than the intellectual nature; and, like
          pictures, pleased the fancy of children rather than improved their
          reason. The Jewish state was a state of childhood,449 and that
          administration a pedagogy.450 The law was a schoolmaster fitted for
          their weak and childish capacity, and could no more spiritualize the
          heart, than the teachings in a primer‑school can enable the mind, and
          make it fit for affairs of state; and because they could not better
          the spirit, they were instituted only for a time, as elements
          delivered to an infant age, which naturally lives a life of sense
          rather than a life of reason. It was also a servile state, which doth
          rather debase than elevate the mind; rather carnalize than
          spiritualize the heart: besides, it is a sense of mercy that both
          melts and elevates the heart into a spiritual frame: “There is
          forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared;”451 and they had,
          in that state, but some glimmerings of mercy in the daily bloody
          intimations of justice. There was no sacrifice for some sins, but a
          cutting off without the least hints of pardon; and in the yearly
          remembrance of sin there was as much to shiver them with fear, as to
          possess them with hopes; and such a state which always held them under
          the conscience of sin, could not produce a free spirit, which was
          necessary for a worship of God according to his nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. In their use they rather hindered than furthered a spiritual
          worship. In their own nature they did not tend to the obstructing a
          spiritual worship, for then they had been contrary to the nature of
          religion, and the end of God who appointed them; nor did God cover the
          evangelical doctrine under the clouds of the legal administration, to
          hinder the people of Israel from perceiving it, but because they were
          not yet capable to bear the splendor of it, had it been clearly set
          before them. The shining of the face of Moses was too dazzling for
          their weak eyes, and therefore there was a necessity of a veil, not
          for the things themselves, but the “weakness of their eyes.”452 The
          carnal affections of that people sunk down into the things themselves;
          stuck in the outward pomp, and pierced not through the veil to the
          spiritual intent of them; and by the use of them without rational
          conceptions, they besotted their minds and became senseless of those
          spiritual motions required of them. Hence came all their expectations
          of a carnal Messiah; the veil of ceremonies was so thick, and the film
          upon their eyes so condensed, that they could not look through the
          veil to the Spirit of Christ; they beheld not the heavenly Canaan for
          the beauty of the earthly; nor minded the regeneration of the spirit,
          while they rested upon the purifications of the flesh; the prevalency
          of sense and sensitive affections diverted their minds from inquiring
          into the intent of them. Sense and matter are often clogs to the mind,
          and sensible objects are the same often to spiritual motions. Our
          souls are never more raised than when they are abstracted from the
          entanglements of them. A pompous worship, made up of many sensible
          objects, weakens the spirituality of religion. Those that are most
          zealous for outward, are usually most cold and indifferent in inward
          observances; and those that overdo in carnal modes, usually underdo in
          spiritual affections. This was the Jewish state.453 The nature of the
          ceremonies being pompous and earthly by their show and beauty, meeting
          with their weakness and childish affections, filled their eyes with an
          outward lustre, allured their minds and detained them from seeking
          things higher and more spiritual; the kernel of those rights lay
          concealed in a thick shell; the spiritual glory was little seen; and
          the spiritual sweetness little tasted. Unless the Scripture be
          diligently searched, it seems to transfer the worship of God from the
          true faith and the spiritual motions of the heart, and stake it down
          to outward observances, and the opus operatum. Besides, the voice of
          the law did only declare sacrifices, and invited the worshippers to
          them with a promise of the atonement of sin, turning away the wrath of
          God. It never plainly acquainted them that those things were types and
          shadows of something future; that they were only outward purifications
          of the flesh; it never plainly told them, at the time of appointing
          them, that those sacrifices could not abolish sin, and reconcile them
          to God. Indeed, we see more of them since their death and dissection,
          in that one Epistle to the Hebrews, than can be discerned in the five
          books of Moses. Besides, man naturally affects a carnal life, and
          therefore affects a carnal worship; he designs the gratifying his
          sense, and would have a religion of the same nature. Most men have no
          mind to busy their reasons about the things of sense, and are
          naturally unwilling to raise them up to those things which are allied
          to the spiritual nature of God; and therefore the more spiritual any
          ordinance is, the more averse is the heart of man to it. There is a
          simplicity of the gospel from which our minds are easily corrupted by
          things that pleasure the sense, as Eve was by the curiosity of her
          eyes, and the liquorishness of her palate.454 From this principle hath
          sprung all the idolatry in the world. The Jews knew they had a God who
          had delivered them, but they would have a sensible God to go before
          them;455 and the papacy at this day is a witness of the truth of this
          natural corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Upon these accounts, therefore, God never testified himself well
          pleased with that kind of worship. He was not displeased with them, as
          they were his own institution, and ordained for the representing
          (though in an obscure manner) the glorious things of the gospel; nor
          was he offended with those people’s observance of them; for, since he
          had commanded them, it was their duty to perform them, and their sin
          to neglect them; but he was displeased with them as they were
          practised by them, with souls as morally carnal in the practices, as
          the ceremonies were materially carnal in their substance. It was not
          their disobedience to observe them; but it was a disobedience, and a
          contempt of the end of the institution to rest upon them; to be warm
          in them, and cold in morals; they fed upon the bone and neglected the
          marrow; pleased themselves with the shell, and sought not for the
          kernel; they joined not with them the internal worship of God; fear of
          him, with faith in the promised Seed, which lay veiled under those
          coverings (Hos. vi. 6); “I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the
          knowledge of God more than burnt‑offerings;” and therefore he seems
          sometimes weary of his own institutions, and calls them not his own,
          but their sacrifices, their feasts (Isa. i. 11, 14): they were his by
          appointment, theirs by abuse; the institution was from his goodness
          and condescension, therefore his; the corruption of them was from the
          vice of their nature, therefore theirs. He often blamed them for their
          carnality in them; showed his dislike of placing all their religion in
          them; gives the sacrificers, on that account, no better a title than
          that of the princes of Sodom and Gomorrah;456 and compares the
          sacrifices themselves to the “cutting off a dog’s neck,” “swine’s
          blood,” and “the murder of a man.”457 And indeed God never valued
          them, or expressed any delight in them; he despised the feasts of the
          wicked (Amos v. 21); and had no esteem for the material offerings of
          the godly (Psalm l. 13): “Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the
          blood of goats?” which he speaks to his saints and people, before he
          comes to reprove the wicked; which he begins (ver. 16), “But to the
          wicked, God said,” &amp;c. So slightly he esteems them, that he seems
          to disown them to be any part of his command, when he brought his
          people out of the land of Egypt (Jer. vii. 21): “I spake not to your
          fathers, nor commanded them concerning burnt‑offerings and
          sacrifices.” He did not value and regard them, in comparison with that
          inward frame which he had required by the moral law; that being given
          before the law of ceremonies, obliged them, in the first place, to an
          observance of those precepts. They seemed to be below the nature of
          God, and could not of themselves please him. None could in reason
          persuade themselves that the death of a beast was a proportionable
          offering for the sin of a man, or ever was intended for the expiation
          of transgression. In the same rank are all our bodily services under
          the gospel; a loud voice without spirit, bended bulrushes without
          inward affections, are no more delightful to God, than the sacrifices
          of animals; it is but a change of one brute for another of a higher
          species; a mere brute for that part of man which hath an agreement
          with brutes; such a service is a mere animal service, and not
          spiritual.

          5. And therefore God never intended that sort of worship to be
          durable, and had often mentioned the change of it for one more
          spiritual. It was not good or evil in itself; whatsoever goodness it
          had was solely derived to it by institution, and therefore it was
          mutable. It had no conformity with the spiritual nature of God who was
          to be worshipped, nor with the rational nature of man who was to
          worship; and therefore he often speaks of taking away the new moons,
          and feasts, and sacrifices, and all the ceremonial worship, as things
          he took no pleasure in, to have a worship more suited to his excellent
          nature; but he never speaks of removing the gospel administration, and
          the worship prescribed there, as being more agreeable to the nature
          and perfections of God, and displaying them more illustriously to the
          world. The apostle tells us, it was to be “disannulled because of its
          weakness;”458 a determinate time was fixed for its duration, till the
          accomplishment of the truth figured under that pedagogy.459 Some of
          the modes of that worship being only typical, must naturally expire
          and be insignificant in their use, upon the finishing of that by the
          Redeemer, which they did prefigure: and other parts of it, though God
          suffered them so long, because of the weakness of the worshipper, yet
          because it became not God to be always worshipped in that manner, he
          would reject them, and introduce another more spiritual and elevated.
          “Incense and a pure offering” should be offered everywhere unto his
          name.460 He often told them he would make a “new covenant by the
          Messiah,” and the old should be rejected;461 that the “former things
          should not be remembered, and the things of old no more considered,”
          when he should do “a new thing in the earth.”462 Even the ark of the
          covenant, the symbol of his presence, and the glory of the Lord in
          that nation, should not any more be remembered and visited;463 that
          the temple and sacrifices should be rejected, and others established;
          that the order of the Aaronical priesthood should be abolished, and
          that of Melchizedek set up in the stead of it, in the person of the
          Messiah, to endure forever;464 that Jerusalem should be changed; a new
          heaven and earth created; a worship more conformable to heaven, more
          advantageous to earth. God had proceeded in the removal of some parts
          of it, before the time of taking down the whole furniture of this
          house; the pot of manna was lost; Urim and Thummim ceased; the glory
          of the temple was diminished; and the ignorant people wept at the
          sight of the one, without raising their faith and hope in the
          consideration of the other, which was promised to be filled with a
          spiritual glory. And as soon as ever the gospel was spread in the
          world, God thundered out his judgments upon that place in which he had
          fixed all those legal observances; so that the Jews, in the letter and
          flesh, could never practise the main part of their worship, since they
          were expelled from that place where it was only to be celebrated. It
          is one thousand six hundred years since they have been deprived of
          their altar, which was the foundation of all the Levitical worship,
          and have wandered in the world without a sacrifice, a prince, or
          priest, an ephod or teraphim.465 And God fully put an end to it in the
          command he gave to the apostles, and in them to us, in the presence of
          Moses and Elias, to hear his Son only (Matt. xvii. 5): “Behold a voice
          out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
          well pleased; hear ye him.” And at the death of our Saviour, testified
          it to that whole nation and the world, by the rending in twain the
          veil of the temple. The whole frame of that service, which was carnal,
          and, by reason of the corruption of man, weakened, is nulled; and a
          spiritual worship is made known to the world, that we might now serve
          God in a more spiritual manner, and with more spiritual frames.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VI. The service and worship the gospel settles is spiritual, and
          the performance of it more spiritual. Spirituality is the genius of
          the gospel, as carnality was of the law; the gospel is therefore
          called spirit; we are abstracted from the employments of sense, and
          brought nearer to a heavenly state. The Jews had angels’ bread poured
          upon them; we have angels’ service prescribed to us, the praises of
          God, communion with God in spirit, through his Son Jesus Christ, and
          stronger foundations for spiritual affections. It is called a
          “reasonable service;”466 it is suited to a rational nature, though it
          finds no friendship from the corruption of reason. It prescribes a
          service fit for the reasonable faculties of the soul, and advanceth
          them while it employs them. The word reasonable may be translated
          “word‑service,”467 as well as reasonable service; an evangelical
          service, in opposition to a law service. All evangelical service is
          reasonable, and all truly reasonable service is evangelical.
        </p>
        <p>
          The matter of the worship is spiritual; it consists in love of God,
          faith in God, recourse to his goodness, meditation on him, and
          communion with him. It lays aside the ceremonial, spiritualizeth the
          moral. The commands that concerned our duty to God, as well as those
          that concerned our duty to our neighbor, were reduced by Christ to
          their spiritual intention. The motives are spiritual; it is a state of
          more grace, as well as of more truth,468 supported by spiritual
          promises, beaming out in spiritual privileges; heaven comes down in it
          to earth, to spiritualize earth for heaven. The manner of worship is
          more spiritual; higher flights of the soul, stronger ardors of
          affection, sincerer aims at his glory; mists are removed from our
          minds, clogs from the soul, more of love than fear; faith in Christ
          kindles the affections, and works by them. The assistances to
          spiritual worship are greater. The Spirit doth not drop, but is
          plentifully poured out. It doth not light sometimes upon, but dwells
          in the heart. Christ suited the gospel to a spiritual heart, and the
          Spirit changeth the carnal heart to make it fit for a spiritual
          gospel. He blows upon the garden, and causes the spices to flow forth;
          and often makes the soul in worship like the chariots of Aminadab, in
          a quick and nimble motion. Our blessed Lord and Saviour, by his death,
          discovered to us the nature of God; and after his ascension sent his
          Spirit to fit us for the worship of God, and converse with him. One
          spiritual evangelical believing breath is more delightful to God than
          millions of altars made up of the richest pearls, and smoking with the
          costliest oblations, because it is spiritual; and a mite of spirit is
          of more worth than the greatest weight of flesh: one holy angel is
          more excellent than a whole world of mere bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prop. VII. Yet the worship of God with our bodies is not to be
          rejected upon the account that God requires a spiritual worship.
          Though we must perform the weightier duties of the law, yet we are not
          to omit and leave undone the lighter precepts, since both the magnalia
          and minutula legis, the greater and the lesser duties of the law, have
          the stamp of divine authority upon them. As God under the ceremonial
          law did not command the worship of the body and the observation of
          outward rites without the engagement of the spirit, so neither doth he
          command that of the spirit without the peculiar attendance of the
          body. The Schwelksendians denied bodily worship; and the indecent
          postures of many in public attendance intimate no great care either of
          composing their bodies or spirits. A morally discomposed body
          intimates a tainted heart. Our bodies as well as our spirits are to be
          presented to God.469 Our bodies in lieu of the sacrifices of beasts,
          as in the Judaical institutions; body for the whole man; a living
          sacrifice, not to be slain, as the beasts were, but living a new life,
          in a holy posture, with crucified affections. This is the inference
          the apostle makes of the privileges of justification, adoption,
          co‑heirship with Christ, which he had before discoursed of; privileges
          conferred upon the person, and not upon a part of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Bodily worship is due to God. He hath a right to an adoration by
          our bodies, as they are his by creation; his right is not diminished,
          but increased, by the blessing of redemption: (1 Cor. vi. 20) “For you
          are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your bodies and your
          spirits, which are God’s.” The body, as well as the spirit, is
          redeemed, since our Saviour suffered crucifixion in his body, as well
          as agonies in his soul. Body is not taken here for the whole man, as
          it may be in Rom xii.; but for the material part of our nature, it
          being distinguished from the spirit. If we are to render to God an
          obedience with our bodies, we are to render him such acts of worship
          with our bodies as they are capable of. As God is the Father of
          spirits, so he is the God of all flesh; therefore the flesh he hath
          framed of the earth, as well as the noble portion he hath breathed
          into us, cannot be denied him without a palpable injustice. The
          service of the body we must not deny to God, unless we will deny him
          to be the author of it, and the exercise of his providential care
          about it. The mercies of God are renewed every day upon our bodies as
          well as our souls, and, therefore, they ought to express a fealty to
          God for his bounty every day. “Both are from God; both should be for
          God. Man consists of body and soul; the service of man is the service
          of both. The body is to be sanctified as well as the soul; and,
          therefore, to be offered to God as well as the soul. Both are to be
          glorified, both are to glorify. As our Saviour’s divinity was
          manifested in his body, so should our spirituality in ours. To give
          God the service of the body and not of the soul, is hypocrisy; to give
          God the service of the spirit and not of the body, is sacrilege; to
          give him neither, atheism.”470 If the only part of man that is visible
          were exempted from the service of God, there could be no visible
          testimonies of piety given upon any occasion. Since not a moiety of
          man, but the whole is God’s creature, he ought to pay a homage with
          the whole, and not only with a moiety of himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Worship in societies is due to God, but this cannot be without some
          bodily expressions. The law of nature doth as much direct men to
          combine together in public societies for the acknowledgment of God, as
          in civil communities for self‑preservation and order; and a notice of
          a society for religion is more ancient than the mention of civil
          associations for politic government (Gen. iv. 26): “Then began men to
          call upon the name of the Lord,” viz., in the time of Seth. No
          question but Adam had worshipped God before, as well as Abel, and a
          family religion had been preserved; but, as mankind increased in
          distinct families, they knit together in companies to solemnize the
          worship of God.471 Hence, as some think, those that incorporated
          together for such ends, were called the “sons of God;” sons by
          profession, though not sons by adoption; as those of Corinth were
          saints by profession, though in such a corrupted church they could not
          be all so by regeneration; yet saints, as being of a Christian
          society, and calling upon the name of Christ, that is, worshipping God
          in Christ, though they might not be all saints in spirit and practice.
          So Cain and Abel met together to worship (Gen. iv. 3) “at the end of
          the days,” at a set time. God settled a public worship among the Jews,
          instituted synagogues for their convening together, whence called the
          “synagogues of God.”472 The Sabbath was instituted to acknowledge God
          a common benefactor. Public worship keeps up the memorials of God in a
          world prone to atheism, and a sense of God in a heart prone to
          forgetfulness. The angels sung in company, not singly, at the birth of
          Christ,473 and praised God not only with a simple elevation of their
          spiritual nature, but audibly, by forming a voice in the air.
          Affections are more lively, spirits more raised in public than
          private; God will credit his own ordinance. Fire increaseth by laying
          together many coals on one place; so is devotion inflamed by the union
          of many hearts, and by a joint presence; nor can the approach of the
          last day of judgment, or particular judgments upon a nation, give a
          writ of ease from such assemblies. (Heb. x. 25): “Not forsaking the
          assembling ourselves together; but so much the more as you see the day
          approaching.” Whether it be understood of the day of judgment, or the
          day of the Jewish destruction and the Christian persecution, the
          apostle uses it as an argument to quicken them to the observance, not
          to encourage them to a neglect. Since, therefore, natural light
          informs us, and divine institution commands us, publicly to
          acknowledge ourselves the servants of God, it implies the service of
          the body. Such acknowledgments cannot be without visible testimonies,
          and outward exercises of devotion, as well as inward affections. This
          promotes God’s honor, checks others’ profaneness, allures men to the
          same expressions of duty; and though there may be hypocrisy and an
          outward garb without an inward frame, yet better a moiety of worship
          than none at all; better acknowledge God’s right in one than disown it
          in both.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Jesus Christ, the most spiritual worshipper, worshipped God with
          his body. He prayed orally, and kneeled, “Father, if it be thy
          will,”474 &amp;c. He blessed with his mouth, “Father, I thank
          thee.”475 He lifted up his eyes as well as elevated his spirit, when
          he praised his Father for mercy received, or begged for the blessings
          his disciples wanted.476 The strength of the spirit must have vent at
          the outward members. The holy men of God have employed the body in
          significant expressions of worship; Abraham in falling on his face,
          Paul in kneeling, employing their tongues, lifting up their hands.
          Though Jacob was bed‑rid, yet he would not worship God without some
          devout expression of reverence; it is in one place “leaning upon his
          staff;”477 in another, “bowing himself upon his bed’s head.”478 The
          reason of the diversity is in the Hebrew word, which, without vowels,
          may be read mittah, a bedor matteh, a staff; however, both signify a
          testimony of adoration by a reverent gesture of the body. Indeed, in
          angels and separated souls, a worship is performed purely by the
          spirit; but while the soul is in conjunction with the body, it can
          hardly perform a serious act of worship without some tincture upon the
          outward man and reverential composure of the body. Fire cannot be in
          the clothes but it will be felt by the members, nor flames be pent up
          in the soul without bursting out in the body. The heart can no more
          restrain itself from breaking out, than Joseph could inclose his
          affections without expressing them in tears to his brethren.479 “We
          believe, and therefore speak.”480
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude: God hath appointed some parts of worship which cannot be
          performed without the body, as sacraments; we have need of them
          because we are not wholly spiritual and incorporeal creatures. The
          religion which consists in externals only is not for an intellectual
          nature; a worship purely intellectual is too sublime for a nature
          allied to sense, and depending much upon it. The christian mode of
          worship is proportioned to both; it makes the sense to assist the
          mind, and elevates the spirit above the sense. Bodily worship helps
          the spiritual: the members of the body reflect back upon the heart,
          the voice bars distractions, the tongue sets the heart on fire in good
          as well as in evil. It is as much against the light of nature to serve
          God without external significations, as to serve him only with them
          without the intention of the mind. As the invisible God declares
          himself to men by visible works and signs, so should we declare our
          invisible frames by visible expressions. God hath given us a soul and
          body in conjunction; and we are to serve him in the same manner he
          hath framed us.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thing I am to show is, what spiritual worship is. In
          general, the whole spirit is to be employed; the name of God is not
          sanctified but by the engagement of our souls. Worship is an act of
          the understanding, applying itself to the knowledge of the excellency
          of God and actual thoughts of his majesty; recognizing him as the
          supreme Lord and Governor of the world, which is natural knowledge;
          beholding the glory of his attributes in the Redeemer, which is
          evangelical knowledge. This is the sole act of the spirit of man. The
          same reason is for all our worship as for our thanksgiving. This must
          be done with understanding: (Psalm xlvii. 7) “Sing ye praise with
          understanding;” with a knowledge and sense of his greatness, goodness,
          and wisdom. It is also an act of the will, whereby the soul adores and
          reverences his majesty, is ravished with his amiableness, embraceth
          his goodness, enters itself into an intimate communion with this most
          lovely object, and pitcheth all his affections upon him. We must
          worship God understandingly; it is not else a reasonable service. The
          nature of God and the law of God abhor a blind offering; we must
          worship him heartily, else we offer him a dead sacrifice. A reasonable
          service is that wherein the mind doth truly act something with God.
          All spiritual acts must be acts of reason, otherwise they are not
          human acts, because they want that principle which is constitutive of
          man, and doth difference him from other creatures. Acts done only by
          sense are the acts of a brute; acts done by reason are the acts of a
          man. That which is only an act of sense cannot be an act of religion.
          The sense, without the conduct of reason, is not the subject of
          religious acts; for then beasts were capable of religion as well as
          men. There cannot be religion where there is not reason; and there
          cannot be the exercise of religion where there is not an exercise of
          the rational faculties; nothing can be a christian act that is not a
          human act. Besides, all worship must be for some end; the worship of
          God must be for God. It is by the exercise of our rational faculties
          that we only can intend an end. An ignorant and carnal worship is a
          brutish worship. Particularly,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Spiritual worship is a worship from a spiritual nature. Not only
          physically spiritual, so our souls are in their frame; but morally
          spiritual, by a renewing principle. The heart must be first cast into
          the mould of the gospel, before it can perform a worship required by
          the gospel. Adam living in Paradise might perform a spiritual worship;
          but Adam fallen from his rectitude could not: we, being heirs of his
          nature, are heirs of his impotence. Restoration to a spiritual life
          must precede any act of spiritual worship. As no work can be good, so
          no worship can be spiritual, till we are created in Christ.481 Christ
          is our life.482 As no natural action can be performed without life in
          the root or heart, so no spiritual act without Christ in the soul. Our
          being in Christ is as necessary to every spiritual act as the union of
          our soul with our body is necessary to natural action. Nothing can
          exceed the limits of its nature; for then it should exceed itself in
          acting, and do that which it hath no principle to do. A beast cannot
          act like a man, without partaking of the nature of a man; nor a man
          act like an angel, without partaking of the angelical nature. How can
          we perform spiritual acts without a spiritual principle? Whatsoever
          worship proceeds from the corrupted nature, cannot deserve the title
          of spiritual worship, because it springs not from a spiritual habit.
          If those that are evil cannot speak good things, those that are carnal
          cannot offer a spiritual service. Poison is the fruit of a viper’s
          nature (Matt. xii. 34): “O generation of vipers, how can you, being
          evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the
          mouth speaks.” As the root is, so is the fruit. If the soul be
          habitually carnal, the worship cannot be actually spiritual. There may
          be an intention of spirit, but there is no spiritual principle as a
          root of that intention. A heart may be sensibly united with a duty,
          when it is not spiritually united with Christ in it. Carnal motives
          and carnal ends may fix the mind in an act of worship, as the sense of
          some pressing affliction may enlarge a man’s mind in prayer.
          Whatsoever is agreeable to the nature of God must have a stamp of
          Christ upon it; a stamp of his grace in performance, as well as of his
          mediation in the acceptance. The apostle lived not, but Christ lived
          in him;483 the soul worships not, but Christ in him. Not that Christ
          performs the act of worship, but enables us spiritually to worship,
          after he enables us spiritually to live. As God counts not any soul
          living but in Christ, so he counts not any a spiritual worshipper but
          in Christ. The goodness and fatness of the fruit come from the fatness
          of the olive wherein we are engrafted. We must find healing in
          Christ’s wings, before God can find spirituality in our services. All
          worship issuing from a dead nature is but a dead service. A living
          action cannot be performed, without being knit to a living root.

          2. Spiritual worship is done by the influence and with the assistance
          of the Spirit of God. A heart may be spiritual, when a particular act
          of worship may not be spiritual. The Spirit may dwell in the heart,
          when he may suspend his influence on the act. Our worship is then
          spiritual, when the fire that kindles our affections comes from
          heaven, as that fire upon the altar wherewith the sacrifices were
          consumed. God tastes a sweetness in no service, but as it is dressed
          up by the hand of the Mediator, and hath the air of his own Spirit in
          it; they are but natural acts, without a supernatural assistance;
          without an actual influence, we cannot act from spiritual motives, nor
          for spiritual ends, nor in a spiritual manner. We cannot mortify a
          lust without the Spirit,484 nor quicken a service without the Spirit.
          Whatsoever corruption is killed, is slain by his power; whatsoever
          duty is spiritualized, is refined by his breath. He quickens our dead
          bodies in our resurrection;485 he renews our dead souls in our
          regeneration; he quickens our carnal services in our adorations; the
          choicest acts of worship are but infirmities without his auxiliary
          help.486 We are logs, unable to move ourselves, till he raise our
          faculties to a pitch agreeable to God; puts his hand to the duty, and
          lifts that up and us with it. Never any great act was performed by the
          apostles to God, or for God; but they are said to be filled with the
          Holy Ghost. Christ could not have been conceived immaculate as that
          “holy thing,” without the Spirit’s overshadowing the Virgin; nor any
          spiritual act conceived in our heart, without the Spirit’s moving upon
          us, to bring forth a living religion from us. The acts of worship are
          said to be in the Spirit, “supplication in the Spirit;”487 not only
          with the strength and affection of our own spirits, but with the
          mighty operation of the Holy Ghost, if Jude may be the interpreter;488
          the Holy Ghost exciting us, impelling us, and firing our souls by his
          divine flame; raising up the affections, and making the soul cry with
          a holy importunity, Abba, Father. To render our worship spiritual, we
          should, before every engagement in it, implore the actual presence of
          the Spirit, without which we are not able to send forth one spiritual
          breath or groan; but be wind‑bound like a ship without a gale, and our
          worship be no better than carnal. How doth the spouse solicit the
          Spirit with an “Awake, O north wind, and come, thou south wind,”489
          &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Spiritual worship is done with sincerity. When the heart stands
          right to God, and the soul performs what it pretends to perform; when
          we serve God with our spirits, as the apostle (Rom. i. 9), “God is my
          witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son:” this
          is not meant of the Holy Ghost; for the apostle would never have
          called the Spirit of God his own spirit; but with my spirit, that is,
          a sincere frame of heart. A carnal worship, whether under the law or
          gospel, is, when we are busied about external rites, without an inward
          compliance of soul. God demands the heart; “My son, give me thy
          heart;”490 not give me thy tongue, or thy lips, or thy hands; these
          may be given without the heart, but the heart can never be bestowed
          without these as its attendants. A heap of services can be no more
          welcome to God, without our spirits, than all Jacob’s sons could be to
          Joseph, without the Benjamin he desired to see. God is not taken with
          the cabinet, but the jewel; he first respected Abel’s faith and
          sincerity, and then his sacrifice; he disrespected Cain’s infidelity
          and hypocrisy, and then his offering. For this cause he rejected the
          offerings of the Jews, the prayers of the Pharisees, and the alms of
          Ananias and Sapphira, because their hearts and their duties were at a
          distance from one another. In all spiritual sacrifices, our spirits
          are God’s portion. Under the law, the reins were to be consumed by the
          fire on the altar, because the secret intentions of the heart were
          signified by them (Psalm vii. 9), “The Lord trieth the heart and the
          reins.” It was an ill omen among the heathen, if a victim wanted a
          heart. The widow’s mites, with her heart in them, were more esteemed
          than the richer offerings without it.491 Not the quantity of service,
          but the will in it, is of account with this infinite Spirit. All that
          was to be brought for the framing of the tabernacle was to be offered
          “willingly with the heart.”492 The more of will, the more of
          spirituality and acceptableness to God (Psalm cxix. 108), “Accept the
          free‑will offering of my lips.” Sincerity is the salt which seasons
          every sacrifice. The heart is most like to the object of worship; the
          heart in the body is the spring of all vital actions; and a spiritual
          soul is the spring of all spiritual actions. How can we imagine God
          can delight in the mere service of the body, any more than we can
          delight in converse with a carcass? Without the heart it is no
          worship; it is a stage play; an acting a part without being that
          person really which is acted by us: a hypocrite, in the notion of the
          word, is a stage‑player. We may as well say a man may believe with his
          body, as worship God only with his body. Faith is a great ingredient
          in worship; and it is “with the heart man believes unto
          righteousness.”493 We may be truly said to worship God, though we want
          perfection; but we cannot be said to worship him, if we want
          sincerity; a statue upon a tomb, with eyes and hands lifted up, offers
          as good and true a service; it wants only a voice, the gestures and
          postures are the same; nay, the service is better; it is not a
          mockery; it represents all that it can be framed to; but to worship
          without our spirits, is a presenting God with a picture, an echo,
          voice, and nothing else; a compliment; a mere lie; a “compassing him
          about with lies.”494 Without the heart the tongue is a liar; and the
          greatest zeal a dissembling with him. To present the spirit, is to
          present with that which can never naturally die; to present him only
          the body, is to present him that which is every day crumbling to dust,
          and will at last lie rotting in the grave; to offer him a few rags,
          easily torn; a skin for a sacrifice, a thing unworthy the majesty of
          God; a fixed eye and elevated hands, with a sleepy heart and earthly
          soul, are pitiful things for an ever‑blessed and glorious Spirit: nay,
          it is so far from being spiritual, that it is blasphemy; to pretend to
          be a Jew outwardly, without being so inwardly, is, in the judgment of
          Christ, to blaspheme.495 And is not the same title to be given with as
          much reason to those that pretend a worship and perform none? Such a
          one is not a spiritual worshipper, but a blaspheming devil in Samuel’s
          mantle.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Spiritual worship is performed with an unitedness of heart. The
          heart is not only now and then with God, but “united to fear or
          worship his name.”496 A spiritual duty must have the engagement of the
          spirit, and the thoughts tied up to the spiritual object. The union of
          all the parts of the heart together with the body is the life of the
          body; and the moral union of our hearts is the life of any duty. A
          heart quickly flitting from God makes not God his treasure; he slights
          the worship, and therein affronts the object of worship. All our
          thoughts ought to be ravished with God; bound up in him as in a bundle
          of life; but when we start from him to gaze after every feather, and
          run after every bubble, we disown a full and affecting excellency, and
          a satisfying sweetness in him. When our thoughts run from God, it is a
          testimony we have no spiritual affection to God; affection would stake
          down the thoughts to the object affected; it is but a mouth love, as
          the prophet praiseth it;497 but their hearts go “after their
          covetousness;” covetous objects pipe, and the heart danceth after
          them; and thoughts of God are shifted off to receive a multitude of
          other imaginations; the heart and the service staid awhile together,
          and then took leave of one another. The Psalmist498 still found his
          heart with God when he awaked; still with God in spiritual affections
          and fixed meditations. A carnal heart is seldom with God, either in or
          out of worship; if God should knock at the heart in any duty, it would
          be found not at home, but straying abroad. Our worship is spiritual
          when the door of the heart is shut against all intruders, as our
          Saviour commands in closet‑duties.499 It was not his meaning to
          command the shutting the closet‑door, and leave the heart‑door open
          for every thought that would be apt to haunt us. Worldly affections
          are to be laid aside if we would have our worship spiritual; this was
          meant by the Jewish custom of wiping or washing off the dust of their
          feet before their entrance into the temple, and of not bringing money
          in their girdles. To be spiritual in worship, is to have our souls
          gathered and bound up wholly in themselves, and offered to God. Our
          loins must be girt, as the fashion was in the eastern countries, where
          they wore long garments, that they might not waver with the wind, and
          be blown between their legs, to obstruct them in their travel: our
          faculties must not hang loose about us. He is a carnal worshipper that
          gives God but a piece of his heart, as well as he that denies him the
          whole of it; that hath some thoughts pitched upon God in worship, and
          as many willingly upon the world. David sought God, not with a moiety
          of his heart, but with his “whole heart;” with his entire frame;500 he
          brought not half his heart, and left the other in the possession of
          another master. It was a good lesson Pythagoras gave his scholars,501
          “Not to make the observance of God a work by the bye.” If those guests
          be invited, or entertained kindly, or if they come unexpected, the
          spirituality of that worship is lost; the soul kicks down what it
          wrought before: but if they be brow‑beaten by us, and our grief rather
          than our pleasure, they divert our spiritual intention from the work
          in hand, but hinder not God’s acceptance of it as spiritual, because
          they are not the acts of our will, but offences to our wills.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Spiritual worship is performed with a spiritual activity, and
          sensibleness of God; with an active understanding to meditate on his
          excellency, and an active will to embrace him when he drops upon the
          soul. If we understand the amiableness of God, our affections will be
          ravished; if we understand the immensity of his goodness, our spirits
          will be enlarged. We are to act with the highest intention suitable to
          the greatness of that God with whom we have to do (Psalm cl. 2):
          “Praise him according to his excellent greatness;” not that we can
          worship him equally, but in some proportion the frame of the heart is
          to be suited to the excellency of the object; our spiritual strength
          is to be put out to the utmost, as creatures that act naturally do.
          The sun shines, and the fire burns to the utmost of their natural
          power. This is so necessary, that David, a spiritual worshipper, prays
          for it before he sets upon acts of adoration (Psalm lxxx. 18):
          “Quicken us, that we may call upon thy name;” as he was loth to have a
          drowsy faculty, he was loth to have a drowsy instrument, and would
          willingly have them as lively as himself (Psalm lvii. 8): “Awake up,
          my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will awake early.” How
          would this divine soul screw himself up to God, and be turned into
          nothing but a holy flame! Our souls must be boiling hot when we serve
          the Lord.502 The heart doth no less burn when it spiritually comes to
          God, than when God doth spiritually approach to it;503 a Nabal’s
          heart, one as cold as a stone, cannot offer up a spiritual service.
          Whatsoever is enjoined us as our duty, ought to be performed with the
          greatest intenseness of our spirit. As it is our duty to pray, so it
          is our duty to pray with the most fervent importunity. It is our duty
          to love God, but with the purest and most sublime affections; every
          command of God requires the whole strength of the creature to be
          employed in it. That love to God wherein all our duty to God is summed
          up, is to be with all our strength, with all our might, &amp;c.504
          Though in the covenant of grace he hath mitigated the severity of the
          law, and requires not from us such an elevation of our affections as
          was possible in the state of innocence, yet God requires of us the
          utmost moral industry to raise our affections to a pitch, at least
          equal to what they are in other things. What strength of affection we
          naturally have, ought to be as much and more excited in acts of
          worship, than upon other occasions and our ordinary works. As there
          was an inactivity of soul in worship, and a quickness to sin, when sin
          had the dominion; so when the soul is spiritualized, the temper is
          changed; there is an inactivity to sin, and an ardor in duty; the more
          the soul is “dead to sin,” the more it is “alive to God,”505 and the
          more lively too in all that concerns God and his honor; for grace
          being a new strength added to our natural, determines the affections
          to new objects, and excites them to a greater vigor. And as the hatred
          of sin is more sharp, the love to everything that destroys the
          dominion of it is more strong; and acts of worship may be reckoned as
          the chiefest batteries against the power of this inbred enemy. When
          the Spirit is in the soul, like the rivers of waters flowing out of
          the belly, the soul hath the activity of a river, and makes haste to
          be swallowed up in God, as the streams of the river in the sea. Christ
          makes his people “kings and priests to God;”506 first kings, then
          priests; gives first a royal temper of heart, that they may offer
          spiritual sacrifices as priests, kings and priests to God, acting with
          a magnificent spirit in all their motions to him. We cannot be
          spiritual priests, till we be spiritual kings. The Spirit appeared in
          the likeness of fire, and where he resides, communicates, like fire,
          purity and activity. Dulness is against the light of nature. I do not
          remember that the heathen ever offered a snail to any of their false
          deities, nor an ass, but to Priapus, their unclean idol; but the
          Persians sacrificed to the sun a horse, a swift and generous creature.
          God provided against those in the law, commanding an ass’ firstling,
          the offspring of a sluggish creature, to be redeemed, or his neck
          broke, but by no means to be offered to him.507 God is a Spirit
          infinitely active, and therefore frozen and benumbed frames are
          unsuitable to him; he “rides upon a cherub” and flies; he comes upon
          the “wings of the wind;” he rides upon a “swift cloud;”508 and
          therefore demands of us not a dull reason, but an active spirit. God
          is a living God, and therefore must have a lively service. Christ is
          life, and slothful adorations are not fit to be offered up in the name
          of life. The worship of God is called wrestling in Scripture; and Paul
          was a striver in the service of his Master,509 “in an agony.”510
          Angels worshipped God spiritually with their wings on; and when God
          commands them to worship Christ, the next Scripture quoted is, that he
          makes them “flames of fire.”511 If it be thus, how may we charge
          ourselves? What Paul said of the sensual widow,512 that she is “dead
          while she lives,” we may say often of ourselves, we are dead while we
          worship. Our hearts are in duty as the Jews were in deliverances, as
          those “in a dream;”513 by which unexpectedness God showed the
          greatness of his care and mercy; and we attend him as men in a dream,
          whereby we discover our negligence and folly. This activity doth not
          consist in outward acts; the body may be hot, and the heart may be
          faint, but in an inward stirring, meltings, flights. In the highest
          raptures the body is most insensible. Strong spiritual affections are
          abstracted from outward sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Spiritual worship is performed with acting spiritual habits. When
          all the living springs of grace are opened, as the fountains of the
          deep were in the deluge, the soul and all that is within it, all the
          spiritual impresses of God upon it, erect themselves to “bless his
          holy name.”514 This is necessary to make a worship spiritual. As
          natural agents are determined to act suitable to their proper nature,
          so rational agents are to act conformable to a rational being. When
          there is a conformity between the act and the nature whence it flows,
          it is a good act in its kind; if it be rational, it is a good rational
          act, because suitable to its principle; as a man endowed with reason
          must act suitable to that endowment, and exercise his reason in his
          acting; so a Christian endued with grace, must act suitable to that
          nature, and exercise his grace in his acting. Acts done by a natural
          inclination are no more human acts than the natural acts of a beast
          may be said to be human; though they are the acts of a man, as he is
          the efficient cause of them, yet they are not human acts, because they
          arise not from that principle of reason which denominates him a man.
          So acts of worship performed by a bare exercise of reason, are not
          christian and spiritual acts, because they come not from the principle
          which constitutes him a Christian; reason is not the principle, for
          then all rational creatures would be Christians. They ought,
          therefore, to be acts of a higher principle, exercises of that grace
          whereby Christians are what they are; not but that rational acts in
          worship are due to God, for worship is due from us as men, and we are
          settled in that rank of being by our reason. Grace doth not exclude
          reason, but ennobles it, and calls it up to another form; but we must
          not rest in a bare rational worship, but exert that principle whereby
          we are Christians. To worship God with our reason, is to worship him
          as men; to worship God with our grace is to worship him as Christians,
          and so spiritually; but to worship him only with our bodies, is no
          better than brutes. Our desires of the word are to issue from the
          regenerate principle (1 Pet. ii. 2): “As new‑born babes desire the
          sincere milk of the word;” it seems to be not a comparison, but a
          restriction. All worship must have the same spring, and be the
          exercise of that principle, otherwise we can have no communion with
          God. Friends that have the same habitual dispositions, have a
          fundamental fitness for an agreeable converse with one another; but if
          the temper wherein their likeness consists be languishing, and the
          string out of tune, there is not an actual fitness; and the present
          indisposition breaks the converse, and renders the company
          troublesome. Though we may have the habitual graces which compose in
          us a resemblance to God, yet for want of acting those suitable
          dispositions, we render ourselves unfit for his converse, and make the
          worship, which is fundamentally spiritual, to become actually carnal.
          As the will cannot naturally act to any object but by the exercise of
          its affections, so the heart cannot spiritually act towards God but by
          the exercise of graces. This is God’s music (Eph. v. 19): “Singing and
          making melody to God in your hearts.” Singing and all other acts of
          worship are outward, but the spiritual melody is “by grace in the
          heart” (Col. iii. 16): this renders it a spiritual worship; for it is
          an effect of the fulness of the spirit in the soul, as (ver. 19), “But
          be filled with the Spirit.” The overflowing of the Spirit in the
          heart, setting the soul of a believer thus on work to make a spiritual
          melody to God, shows that something higher than bare reason is put in
          tune in the heart. Then is the fruit of the garden pleasant to Christ,
          when the Holy Spirit, “the north and south wind, blow upon the
          spices,” and strike out the fragrancy of them.515 Since God is the
          Author of graces, and bestows them to have a glory from them, they are
          best employed about him and his service. It is fit he should have the
          cream of his own gifts. Without the exercise of grace we perform but a
          work of nature, and offer him a few dry bones without marrow. The
          whole set of graces must be one way or other exercised. If any treble
          be wanting in a lute, there will be great defect in the music. If any
          one spiritual string be dull, the spiritual harmony of worship will be
          spoiled. And therefore;
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Faith must be acted in worship; a confidence in God. A natural
          worship cannot be performed without a natural confidence in the
          goodness of God; whosoever comes to him, must regard him as a
          rewarder, and a faithful Creator.516 A spiritual worship cannot be
          performed without an evangelical confidence in him as a gracious
          Redeemer. To think him a tyrant, meditating revenge, damps the soul;
          to regard him as a gracious king, full of tender bowels, spirits the
          affections to him. The mercy of God is the proper object of trust
          (Psalm xxxiii. 18): “The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him,
          upon them that hope in his mercy.” The worship of God in the Old
          Testament is most described by fear; in the New Testament by faith.
          Fear, or the worship of God, and hope in his mercy are linked
          together; when they go hand in hand, the accepting eye of God is upon
          us; when we do not trust, we do not worship. Those of Judah had the
          temple‑worship among them, especially in Josiah’s time (Zeph. iii. 2),
          the time of that prophecy; yet it was accounted no worship, because no
          trust in the worshippers. Interest in God cannot be improved without
          an exercise of faith. The gospel‑worship is prophesied of, to be a
          confidence in God, as in a husband more than in a lord (Hos. ii. 16):
          “Thou shalt call me Ishi, and shalt call me no more Baali.” “Thou
          shalt call me;” that is, thou shalt worship me, worship being often
          comprehended under invocation. More confidence is to be exercised in a
          husband or father, than in a lord or master. If a man have not faith,
          he is without Christ; and though a man be in Christ by the habit of
          faith, he performs a duty out of Christ without an act of faith:
          without the habit of faith, our persons are out of Christ; and without
          the exercise of faith, the duties are out of Christ. As the want of
          faith in a person is the death of the soul, so the want of faith in a
          service is the death of the offering. Though a man were at the cost of
          an ox, yet to kill it without bringing it to the “door of the
          tabernacle,” was not a sacrifice, but a murder (Lev. xvii. 3, 4). The
          tabernacle was a type of Christ, and a look to him is necessary in
          every spiritual sacrifice. As there must be faith to make any act an
          act of obedience, so there must be faith to make any act of worship
          spiritual. That service is not spiritual that is not vital; and it
          cannot be vital without the exercise of a vital principle; all
          spiritual life is “hid in Christ,” and drawn from him by faith (Gal.
          ii. 20). Faith, as it hath relation to Christ, makes every act of
          worship a living act, and, consequently, a spiritual act. Habitual
          unbelief cuts us off from the body of Christ (Rom. xi. 20): “Because
          of unbelief they were broken off;” and a want of actuated belief
          breaks us off from a present communion with Christ in spirit. As
          unbelief in us hinders Christ from doing any mighty work, so unbelief
          in us hinders us from doing any mighty spiritual duty; so that the
          exercise of faith, and a confidence in God, is necessary to every
          duty.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Love must be acted to render a worship spiritual. Though God
          commanded love in the Old Testament, yet the manner of giving the law
          bespoke more of fear than love. The dispensation of the law was with
          fire, thunder, &amp;c., proper to raise horror, and benumb the spirit;
          which effect it had upon the Israelites, when they desired that God
          would speak no more to them. Grace is the genius of the gospel, proper
          to excite the affection of love. The law was given by the “disposition
          of angels,” with signs to amaze; the gospel was ushered in with the
          “songs of angels,” composed of peace and good‑will, calculated to
          ravish the soul. Instead of the terrible voice of the law, “Do this
          and live,” the comfortable voice of the gospel is, “Grace, grace!”
          Upon this account the principle of the Old Testament was fear, and the
          worship often expressed by the fear of God. The principle of the New
          Testament is love. The Mount Sinai gendereth to bondage (Gal. iv. 44);
          Mount Sion, from whence the gospel or evangelical law goes forth,
          gendereth to liberty; and therefore the “spirit of bondage unto fear,”
          as the property of the law, is opposed to the state of adoption, the
          principle of love, as the property of the gospel (Rom. viii. 15); and
          therefore the worship of God under the gospel, or New Testament, is
          oftener expressed by love than fear, as proceeding from higher
          principles, and acting nobler passions. In this state we are to serve
          him without fear (Luke i. 74); without a bondage fear; not without a
          fear of unworthy treating him; with a “fear of his goodness” as it is
          prophesied of (Hos. ix. 5). Goodness is not the object of terror, but
          reverence; God, in the law, had more the garb of a judge; in the
          gospel, of a father; the name of a father is sweeter and bespeaks more
          of affection. As their services were with a feeling of the thunders of
          the law in their consciences, so is our worship to be with a sense of
          gospel grace in our spirits; spiritual worship is that, therefore,
          which is exercised with a spiritual and heavenly affection, proper to
          the gospel. The heart should be enlarged according to the liberty the
          gospel gives of drawing near to God as a father. As he gives us the
          nobler relation of children, we are to act the nobler qualities of
          children. Love should act according to its nature, which is desired of
          union; desire of a moral union by affections, as well as a mystical
          union by faith; as flame aspires to reach flame, and become one with
          it. In every act of worship we should endeavor to be united to God,
          and become one spirit with him. This grace doth spiritualize worship;
          in that one word, love, God hath wrapt up all the devotion he requires
          of us; it is the total sum of the first table, “Thou shalt love the
          Lord thy God:” it is to be acted in everything we do; but in worship
          our hearts should more solemnly rise up and acknowledge him amiable
          and lovely, since the law is stripped of its cursing power, and made
          sweet in the blood of the Redeemer. Love is a thing acceptable of
          itself, but nothing acceptable without it; the gifts of one man to
          another are spiritualized by it. We would not value a present without
          the affection of the donor; every man would lay claim to the love of
          others, though he would not to their possessions. Love is God’s right
          in every service, and the noblest thing we can bestow upon him in our
          adorations of him. God’s gifts to us are not so estimable without his
          love; nor our services valuable by him without the exercise of a
          choice affection. Hezekiah regarded not his deliverance without the
          love of the Deliverer; “In love to my soul thou hast delivered me”
          (Isa. xxxviii. 17). So doth God say, In love to my honor thou hast
          worshipped me: so that love must be acted, to render our worship
          spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. A spiritual sensibleness of our own weakness is necessary to make
          our worship spiritual. Affections to God cannot be without relentings
          in ourselves. When the eye is spiritually fixed upon a spiritual God,
          the heart will mourn that the worship is no more spiritually suitable.
          The more we act love upon God, as amiable and gracious, the more we
          should exercise grief in ourselves, as we are vile and offending.
          Spiritual worship is a melting worship, as well as an elevating
          worship; it exalts God, and debaseth the creature. The Publican was
          more spiritual in his humble address to God, when the Pharisee was
          wholly carnal with his swelling language. A spiritual love in worship
          will make us grieve that we have given him so little, and could give
          him no more. It is a part of spiritual duty to bewail our carnality
          mixed with it; as we receive mercies spiritually, when we receive them
          with a sense of God’s goodness and our own vileness; in the same
          manner we render a spiritual worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Spiritual desires for God render the service spiritual; when the
          soul “follows hard after him” (Psalm lxiii. 8); pursues after God as a
          God of infinite and communicative goodness, with sighs and groans
          unutterable. A spiritual soul seems to be transformed into hunger and
          thirst, and becomes nothing but desire. A carnal worshipper is taken
          with the beauty and magnificence of the temple; a spiritual worshipper
          desires to see the glory of God in the sanctuary (Psalm lxiii. 2), he
          pants after God: as he came to worship, to find God, he boils up in
          desires for God, and is loth to go from it without God, “the living
          God” (Psalm xlii. 2). He would see the Urim and the Thummim; the
          unusual sparkling of the stones upon the high‑priest’s breast‑plate.
          That deserves not the title of spiritual worship, when the soul makes
          no longing inquiries: “Saw you him whom my soul loves?” A spiritual
          worship is when our desires are chiefly for God in the worship; as
          David desires to dwell in the house of the Lord; but his desire is not
          terminated there, but to behold the beauty of the Lord (Psalm xxvii.
          4), and taste the ravishing sweetness of his presence. No doubt but
          Elijah’s desires for the enjoyment of God while he was mounting to
          heaven, were as fiery as the chariot wherein he was carried.
          Unutterable groans acted in worship are the fruit of the Spirit, and
          certainly render it a spiritual service (Rom. viii. 26). Strong
          appetites are agreeable to God, and prepare us to eat the fruit of
          worship. A spiritual Paul presseth forward to know Christ, and the
          power of his resurrection; and a spiritual worshipper actually aspires
          in every duty to know God, and the power of his grace. To desire
          worship as an end is carnal; to desire it as a means, and act desires
          in it for communion with God in it, is spiritual, and the fruit of a
          spiritual life.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Thankfulness and admiration are to be exercised in spiritual
          service. This is a worship of spirits; praise is the adoration of the
          blessed angels (Isa. vi. 3), and of glorified spirits (Rev. iv. 11):
          “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor, and power;” and
          (Rev. v. 13, 14), they worship him ascribing “Blessing, honor, glory,
          and power to Him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever
          and ever.” Other acts of worship are confined to this life, and leave
          us as soon as we have set our foot in heaven; there, no notes but this
          of praise are warbled out; the power, wisdom, love, and grace in the
          dispensation of the gospel, seat themselves in the thoughts and
          tongues of blessed souls. Can a worship on earth be spiritual, that
          hath no mixture of an eternal heavenly duty with it? The worship of
          God in innocence had been chiefly an admiration of him in the works of
          creation; and should not our evangelical worship be an admiration of
          him in the works of redemption, which is a restoration to a better
          state? After the petitioning for pardoning grace (Hos. xiv. 2), there
          is a rendering the calves or heifers of our lips, alluding to the
          heifers used in eucharistical sacrifices. The praise of God is the
          choicest sacrifice and worship under a dispensation of redeeming
          grace; this is the prime and eternal part of worship under the gospel.
          The Psalmist (Psalm cxlix. cl.), speaking of the gospel times, spurs
          on to this kind of worship; “Sing to the Lord a new song; let the
          children of Zion be joyful in their king; let the saints be joyful in
          glory, and sing aloud upon their beds; let the high praises of God be
          in their mouths;” he begins and ends both psalms with “Praise ye the
          Lord.” That cannot be a spiritual and evangelical worship, that hath
          nothing of the praise of God in the heart. The consideration of God’s
          adorable perfections, discovered in the gospel, will make us come to
          him with more seriousness; beg blessings of him with more confidence;
          fly to him with a winged faith and love, and more spiritually glorify
          him in our attendances upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Spiritual worship is performed with delight. The evangelical
          worship is prophetically signified by keeping the feast of
          tabernacles; “They shall go up from year to year, to worship the King,
          the Lord of Hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles” (Zech. xiv.
          16): why that feast, when there were other feasts observed by the
          Jews? That was a feast celebrated with the greatest joy; typical of
          the gladness which was to be under the exhibition of the Messiah, and
          a thankful commemoration of the redemption wrought by him. It was to
          be celebrated five days after the “solemn day of atonement” (Lev.
          xxiii. 34, compared with ver. 27), wherein there was one of the
          solemnest types of the sacrifice of the death of Christ. In this feast
          they commemorated their exchange of Egypt for Canaan; the manna
          wherewith they were fed; the water out of the rock wherewith they were
          refreshed; in remembrance of this, they poured water on the ground,
          pronouncing those words in Isaiah, they shall “draw waters out of the
          wells of salvation;” which our Saviour refers to himself (John vii.
          37), inviting them to him, to drink “upon the last day, the great day
          of the feast of tabernacles,” wherein the solemn ceremony was
          observed. Since we are freed by the death of the Redeemer from the
          curses of the law, God requires of us a joy in spiritual privileges. A
          sad frame in worship gives the lie to all gospel liberty, to the
          purchase of the Redeemer’s death, the triumphs of his resurrection: it
          is a carriage, as if we were under the influences of the legal fire
          and lightning, and an entering a protest against the freedom of the
          gospel. The evangelical worship is a spiritual worship; and praise,
          joy, and delight are prophesied of, as great ingredients in attendance
          on gospel ordinances (Isaiah xii. 3‒5). What was occasion of terror in
          the worship of God under the law, is the occasion of delight in the
          worship of God under the gospel. The justice and holiness of God, so
          terrible in the law, becomes comfortable under the gospel; since they
          have feasted themselves on the active and passive obedience of the
          Redeemer. The approach is to God as gracious, not to God as
          unpacified; as a son to a father, not as a criminal to a judge. Under
          the law, God was represented as a judge; remembering their sin in
          their sacrifices, and representing the punishment they had merited: in
          the gospel as a father, accepting the atonement, and publishing the
          reconciliation wrought by the Redeemer. Delight in God is a gospel
          frame; therefore the more joyful, the more spiritual: “The sabbath is
          to be a delight;” not only in regard of the day, but in regard to the
          duties of it (Isa. lviii. 13); in regard of the marvellous work he
          wrought on it; raising up our blessed Redeemer on that day, whereby a
          foundation was laid for the rendering our persons and services
          acceptable to God (Psalm cxviii. 24); “This is the day which the Lord
          hath made, we will be glad and rejoice in it.” A lumpish frame becomes
          not a day and a duty, that hath so noble and spiritual a mark upon it.
          The angels, in the first act of worship after the creation, were
          highly joyful (Job xxxviii. 7): “They shouted for joy,” &amp;c. The
          saints have particularly acted this in their worship. David would not
          content himself with an approach to the altar, without going to God as
          his “exceeding joy” (Psalm xliii. 4). My triumphant joy: when he
          danced before the ark, he seems to be transformed into delight and
          pleasure (2 Sam. vi. 14, 16). He had as much delight in worship, as
          others had in their harvest and vintage. And those that took joyfully
          the spoiling of their goods, would as joyfully attend upon the
          communications of God. Where there is a fulness of the Spirit, there
          is a “waking melody to God in the heart” (Eph. v. 18, 19); and where
          there is an acting of love (as there is in all spiritual services),
          the proper fruit of it is joy in a near approach to the object of the
          soul’s affection. Love is appetitus unionis; the more love, the more
          delight in the approachings of God to the soul, or the outgoings of
          the soul to God. As the object of worship is amiable in a spiritual
          eye, so the means tending to a communion with this object are
          delightful in the exercise. Where there is no delight in a duty, there
          is no delight in the object of the duty; the more of grace, the more
          of pleasure in the actings of it; as the more of nature there is in
          any natural agent, the more of pleasure in the act, so the more
          heavenly the worship, the more spiritual. Delight is the frame and
          temper of glory. A heart filled up to the brim with joy, is a heart
          filled up to the brim with the Spirit; joy is the fruit of the Holy
          Ghost (Gal. v. 22). (1.) Not the joy of God’s dispensation flowing
          from God, but a gracious active joy streaming to God. There is a joy,
          when the comforts of God are dropped into the soul, as oil upon the
          wheel; which indeed makes the faculties move with more speed and
          activity in his service, like the chariots of Aminadab; and a soul may
          serve God in the strength of this taste, and its delight terminate in
          the sensible comfort. This is not the joy I mean, but such a joy that
          hath God for its object, delighting in him as the term, in worship as
          the way to him; the first is God’s dispensation, the other is our
          duty; the first is an act of God’s favor to us, the second a sprout of
          habitual grace in us. The comforts we have from God may elevate our
          duties; but the grace we have within doth spiritualize our duties.
          (2.) Nor is every delight an argument of a spiritual service. All the
          requisites to worship must be taken in. A man may invent a worship and
          delight in it; as Micah in the adoration of his idol, when he was glad
          he had got both an Ephod and a Levite (Judges xvii). As a man may have
          a contentment in sin, so he may have a contentment in worship; not
          because it is a worship of God, but the worship of his own invention,
          agreeable to his own humor and design, as (Isa. lviii. 2) it is said,
          they “delighted in approaching to God;” but it was for carnal ends.
          Novelty engenders complacency; but it must be a worship wherein God
          will delight; and that must be a worship according to his own rule and
          infinite wisdom, and not our shallow fancies. God requires a
          cheerfulness in his service, especially under the gospel, where he
          sits upon a throne of grace; discovers himself in his amiableness, and
          acts the covenant of grace, and the sweet relation of a father. The
          priests of old were not to sully themselves with any sorrow, when they
          were in the exercise of their functions. God put a bar to the natural
          affections of Aaron and his sons, when Nadab and Abihu had been cut
          off by a severe hand of God (Lev. x. 6). Every true Christian in a
          higher order of priesthood, is a person dedicated to joy and peace,
          offering himself a lively sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving; and
          there is no christian duty, but is to be set off and seasoned with
          cheerfulness: he that loves a cheerful giver in acts of charity,
          requires no less a cheerful spirit in acts of worship; as this is an
          ingredient in worship, so it is the means to make your spirits intent
          in worship. When the heart triumphs in the consideration of divine
          excellency and goodness, it will be angry at anything that offers to
          jog and disturb it.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Spiritual worship is to be performed, though with a delight in God,
          yet with a deep reverence of God. The gospel, in advancing the
          spirituality of worship, takes off the terror, but not the reverence
          of God; which is nothing else in its own nature, but a due and high
          esteem of the excellency of a thing according to the nature of it;
          and, therefore, the gospel presenting us with more illustrious notices
          of the glorious nature of God, is so far from indulging any disesteem
          of him, that it requires of us a greater reverence suitable to the
          height of its discovery, above what could be spelt in the book of
          creation; the gospel worship is therefore expressed by trembling (Hos.
          xi. 10): “They shall walk after the Lord; he shall roar like a lion;
          when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the West.”
          When the lion of the tribe of Judah shall lift up his powerful voice
          in the gospel, the western Gentiles shall run trembling to walk after
          the Lord. God hath alway attended his greatest manifestations with
          remarkable characters of majesty, to create a reverence in his
          creature: he caused the “wind to march before him,” to cut the
          mountain, when he manifested himself to Elijah (1 Kings xix. 11); “A
          wind and a cloud of fire,” before that magnificent vision to Ezekiel
          (chap. i. 4, 5); “Thunders and lightnings” before the giving the law
          (Exod. xix. 18); and a “mighty wind” before the giving the Spirit
          (Acts ii.): God requires of us an awe of him in the very act of
          performance. The angels are pure, and cannot fear him as sinners, but
          in “reverence they cover their faces” when they stand before him (Isa.
          vi. 2): his power should make us reverence him, as we are creatures;
          his justice, as we are sinners; his goodness, as we are restored
          creatures. “God is clothed with unspeakable majesty; the glory of his
          face shines brighter than the lights of heaven in their beauty. Before
          him the angels tremble, and the heavens melt; we ought not therefore
          to come before him with the sacrifice of fools, nor tender a duty to
          him, without falling low upon our faces, and bowing the knees of our
          hearts in token of reverence.”517 Not a slavish fear, like that of
          devils; but a “godly fear,” like that of saints (Heb. xii. 28); joined
          with a sense of an unmovable kingdom, becometh us; and this the
          apostle calls a grace necessary to make our service acceptable, and
          therefore the grace necessary to make it spiritual, since nothing
          finds admission to God, but what is of a spiritual nature. The
          consideration of his glorious nature should imprint an awful respect
          upon our souls to him; his goodness should make his majesty more
          adorable to us, as his majesty makes his goodness more admirable in
          his condescensions to us. As God is a Spirit, our worship must be
          spiritual; and being, as he is, the supreme Spirit, our worship must
          be reverential; we must observe the state he takes upon him in his
          ordinances; “He is in heaven, we upon the earth;” we must not
          therefore be “hasty to utter anything before God” (Eccles. v. 7).
          Consider him a Spirit in the highest heavens, and ourselves spirits
          dwelling in a dreggy earth. Loose and garish frames debase him to our
          own quality; slight postures of spirit intimate him to be a slight and
          mean being; our being in covenant with him, must not lower our awful
          apprehensions of him; as he is the Lord thy God, it is a glorious and
          fearful name, or wonderful (Deut. xxviii. 58); though he lay by his
          justice to believers, he doth not lay by his majesty; when we have a
          confidence in him, because he is the Lord our God, we must have awful
          thoughts of his majesty, because his name is glorious. God is terrible
          from his holy places, in regard of the great things he doth for his
          Israel (Psalm lxviii. 35); we should behave ourselves with that inward
          honor and respect of him, as if he were present to our bodily eyes;
          the higher apprehensions we have of his majesty, the greater awe will
          be upon our hearts in his presence, and the greater spirituality in
          our acts. We should manage our hearts so, as if we had a view of God
          in his heavenly glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Spiritual worship is to be performed with humility in our spirits.
          This is to follow upon the reverence of God. As we are to have high
          thoughts of God, that we may not debase him; we must have low thoughts
          of ourselves, not to vaunt before him. When we have right notions of
          the Divine Majesty, we shall be as worms in our own thoughts, and
          creep as worms into his presence; we can never consider him in his
          glory, but we have a fit opportunity to reflect upon ourselves, and
          consider how basely we revolted from him, and how graciously we are
          restored by him. As the gospel affords us greater discoveries of God’s
          nature, and so enhanceth our reverence of him, so it helps us to a
          fuller understanding of our own vileness and weakness, and therefore
          is proper to engender humility; the more spiritual and evangelical
          therefore any service is, the more humble it is. That is a spiritual
          service that doth most manifest the glory of God; and this cannot be
          manifested by us, without manifesting our own emptiness and
          nothingness. The heathens were sensible of the necessity of humility
          by the light of nature;518 after the name of God, signified by Εἶ
          inscribed on the temple at Delphos, followed Γνῶθί σεαυτον, whereby
          was insinuated, that when we have to do with God, who is the only Ens,
          we should behave ourselves with a sense of our own infirmity, and
          infinite distance from him. As a person, so a duty leavened with
          pride, hath nothing of sincerity, and therefore nothing of
          spirituality in it (Hab. ii. 4): “His soul which is lifted up, is not
          upright in him.” The elders that were crowned by God to be kings and
          priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices, uncrown themselves in their
          worship of him, and cast down their ornaments at “his feet”519 the
          Greek word to worship, προσκυνεῖν, signifies to creep like a dog upon
          his belly before his master; to lie low. How deep should our sense be
          of the privilege of God’s admitting us to his worship, and affording
          us such a mercy under our deserts of wrath! How mean should be our
          thoughts, both of our persons and performances! How patiently should
          we wait upon God for the success of worship! How did Abraham, the
          father of the faithful, equal himself to the earth, when he
          supplicated the God of heaven, and devote himself to him under the
          title of very “dust and ashes!” (Gen. xviii. 27.) Isaiah did but
          behold an evangelical apparition of God and the angels worshipping
          him, and presently reflects upon his “own uncleanness” (Isa. vi. 5).
          God’s presence both requires and causes humility. How lowly is David
          in his own opinion, after a magnificent duty performed by himself and
          his people (1 Chron. xxix. 14): “Who am I? and what is my people, that
          we should be able to offer so willingly?” The more spiritual the soul
          is in its carriage to God, the more humble it is; and the more
          gracious God is in his communications to the soul, the lower it lies.
          God commanded not the fiercer creatures to be offered to him in
          sacrifices, but lambs and kids, meek and lowly creatures; none that
          had stings in their tails, or venom in their tongues520 The meek lamb
          was the daily sacrifice; the doves were to be offered by pairs; God
          would not have honey mixed with any sacrifice (Lev. ii. 11), that
          breeds choler, and choler pride; but oil he commanded to be used, that
          supples and mollifies the parts. Swelling pride and boiling passions
          render our services carnal; they cannot be spiritual, without a humble
          sweetness and an innocent sincerity; one grain of this transcends the
          most costly sacrifices: a contrite heart puts a gloss upon worship
          (Psalm li. 16, 17). The departure of men and angels from God, began in
          pride; our approaches and return to him must begin in humility; and
          therefore all those graces, which are bottomed on humility, must be
          acted in worship, as faith, and a sense of our own indigence. Our
          blessed Saviour, the most spiritual worshipper, prostrated himself in
          the garden with the greatest lowliness, and offered himself upon the
          cross a sacrifice with the greatest humility. Melted souls in worship
          have the most spiritual conformity to the person of Christ in the
          state of humiliation, and his design in that state; as worship without
          it is not suitable to God, so neither is it advantageous for us. A
          time of worship is a time of God’s communication. The vessel must be
          melted to receive the mould it is designed for; softened wax is
          fittest to receive a stamp, and a spiritually melted soul fittest to
          receive a spiritual impression. We cannot perform duty in an
          evangelical and spiritual strain, without the meltingness and meanness
          in ourselves which the gospel requires.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Spiritual worship is to be performed with holiness. God is a holy
          Spirit; a likeness to God must attend the worshipping of God as he is;
          holiness is alway in season; “It becomes his house forever” (Psalm
          xci. 5). We can never serve the living God till we “have consciences
          purged from dead works” (Heb. ix. 14). Dead works in our consciences
          are unsuitable to God, an eternal living Spirit. The more mortified
          the heart, the more quickened the service. Nothing can please an
          infinite purity but that which is pure; since God is in his glory, in
          his ordinances, we must not be in our filthiness. The holiness of his
          Spirit doth sparkle in his ordinances; the holiness of our spirits
          ought also to sparkle in our observance of them. The holiness of God
          is most celebrated in the worship of angels;521 spiritual worship
          ought to be like angelical; that cannot be with souls totally impure.
          As there must be perfect holiness to make a worship perfectly
          spiritual; so there must be some degree of holiness to make it in any
          measure spiritual. God would have all the utensils of the sanctuary
          employed about his service to be holy; the inwards of the sacrifice
          were to be rinsed thrice.522 The crop and feathers of sacrificed doves
          were to be hung eastward towards the entrance of the temple, at a
          distance from the holy of holies, where the presence of God was most
          eminent (Lev. i. 16). When Aaron was to go into the holy of holies, he
          was to “sanctify himself” in an extraordinary manner (Lev. xvi. 4).
          The priests were to be bare‑footed in the temple, in the exercise of
          their office; shoes alway were to be put off upon holy ground: “Look
          to thy foot when thou goest to the house of God,” saith the wise man
          (Eccles. v. 1). Strip the affections, the feet of the soul, of all the
          dirt contracted; discard all earthly and base thoughts from the heart.
          A beast was not to touch the Mount Sinai, without losing his life; nor
          can we come near the throne with brutish affections, without losing
          the life and fruit of the worship. An unholy soul degrades himself
          from a spirit to a brute, and the worship from spiritual to brutish.
          If any unmortified sin be found in the life, as it was in the comers
          to the temple, it taints and pollutes the worship (Isa. i. 15). All
          worship is an acknowledgment of the excellency of God as he is holy;
          hence it is called, a “sanctifying God’s name” (Jer. vii. 9, 10); how
          can any person sanctify God’s name that hath not a holy resemblance to
          his nature? If he be not holy as he is holy, he cannot worship him
          according to his excellency in spirit and in truth; no worship is
          spiritual wherein we have not a communion with God. But what
          intercourse can there be between a holy God, and an impure creature;
          between light and darkness? We have no fellowship with him in any
          service, unless “we walk in the light,” in service and out of service,
          as he is light (1 John i. 7). The heathen thought not their sacrifices
          agreeable to God without washing their hands; whereby they signified
          the preparation of their hearts, before they made the oblation: clean
          hands without a pure heart, signify nothing; the frame of our hearts
          must answer the purity of the outward symbols (Psalm xxvi. 6): “I will
          wash my hands in innocence, so will I compass thine altar, O Lord;” he
          would observe the appointed ceremonies, but not without “cleansing his
          heart as well as his hands.” Vain man is apt to rest upon outward acts
          and rites of worship; but this must alway be practised; the words are
          in the present tense, “I wash,” “I compass.” Purity in worship ought
          to be our continual care. If we would perform a spiritual service,
          wherein we would have communion with God, it must be in holiness; if
          we would walk with Christ, it must be in “white” (Rev. iii. 4),
          alluding to the white garments the priests put on, when they went to
          perform their service; as without this we cannot see God in heaven, so
          neither can we see the beauty of God in his own ordinances.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Spiritual worship is performed with spiritual ends, with raised
          aims at the glory of God. No duty can be spiritual that hath a carnal
          aim; where God is the sole object, he ought to be the principal end;
          in all our actions he is to be our end, as he is the principle of our
          being; much more in religious acts, as he is the object of our
          worship. The worship of God in Scripture is expressed by the “seeking
          of him” (Heb. xi. 6); him, not ourselves; all is to be referred to
          God. As we are “not to live to ourselves, that being the sign of a
          carnal state, so we are not to worship for ourselves” (Rom. xiv. 7,
          8). As all actions are denominated good from their end, as well as
          their object, so upon the same account they are denominated spiritual.
          The end spiritualizeth our natural actions, much more our religious;
          then are our faculties devoted to him when they centre in him. If the
          intention be evil, there is nothing but darkness in the whole service
          (Luke xi. 34). The first institution of the Sabbath, the solemn day
          for worship, was to contemplate the glory of God in his stupendous
          works of creation, and render him a homage for them (Rev. iv. 11):
          “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive honor, glory, and power; for thou
          hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were
          created.” No worship can be returned without a glorifying of God; and
          we cannot actually glorify him, without direct aims at the promoting
          his honor. As we have immediately to do with God, so we are
          immediately to mind the praise of God. As we are not to content
          ourselves with habitual grace, but be rich in the exercise of it in
          worship, so we are not to acquiesce in the habitual aims at the glory
          of God, without the actual overflowings of our hearts in those aims.
          It is natural for man to worship God for self; self‑righteousness is
          the rooted aim of man in his worship since his revolt from God, and
          being sensible it is not to be found in his natural actions, he seeks
          for it in his moral and religious. By the first pride we flung God off
          from being our sovereign, and from being our end, since a pharisaical
          spirit struts it in nature, not only to do things to be seen of men,
          but to be admired by God (Isa. lviii. 3): “Wherefore have we fasted
          and thou takest no knowledge?” This is to have God worship them,
          instead of being worshipped by them. Cain’s carriage after his
          sacrifice testified some base end in his worship; he came not to God
          as a subject to a sovereign, but as if he had been the sovereign, and
          God the subject; and when his design is not answered, and his desire
          not gratified, he proves more a rebel to God, and a murderer of his
          brother. Such base scents will rise up in our worship from the body of
          death which cleaves to us, and mix themselves with our services, as
          weeds with the fish in the net. David, therefore, after his people had
          offered willingly to the temple, begs of God that their “hearts might
          be prepared to him” (1 Chron. xxix. 18); that their hearts might stand
          right to God, without any squinting to self‑ends. Some present
          themselves to God, as poor men offer a present to a great person; not
          to honor him, but to gain for themselves a reward richer than their
          gift. “What profit is it that we have kept his ordinance?” &amp;c.
          (Mal. iii. 14). Some worship him, intending thereby to make him amends
          for the wrong they have done him; wipe off their scores, and satisfy
          their debts; as though a spiritual wrong could be recompensed with a
          bodily service, and an infinite Spirit be outwitted and appeased by a
          carnal flattery. Self is the spirit of carnality; to pretend a homage
          to God, and intend only the advantage of self, is rather to mock him
          than worship him. When we believe that we ought to be satisfied,
          rather than God glorified, we set God below ourselves, imagine that he
          should submit his own honor to our advantage; we make ourselves more
          glorious than God, as though we were not made for him, but he hath a
          being only for us; this is to have a very low esteem of the majesty of
          God. Whatsoever any man aims at in worship above the glory of God,
          that he forms as an idol to himself instead of God, and sets up a
          golden image, God counts not this as a worship. The offerings made in
          the wilderness for forty years together, God esteemed as not offered
          to him (Amos v. 25): “Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings
          in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?” They did it not to
          God, but to themselves; for their own security, and the attainment of
          the possession of the promised land. A spiritual worshipper performs
          not worship for some hopes of carnal advantage; he uses ordinances as
          means to bring God and his soul together, to be more fitted to honor
          God in the world, in his particular place; when he hath been inflamed
          and humble in any address or duty, he gives God the glory; his heart
          suits the doxology at the end of the Lord’s Prayer, ascribes the
          kingdom, power, and glory to God alone, and if any viper of pride
          starts out upon him, he endeavors presently to shake it off. That
          which was the first end of our framing, ought to be the chief end of
          our acting towards God; but when men have the same ends in worship as
          brutes, the satisfaction of a sensitive part, the service is no more
          than brutish. The acting for a sensitive end is unworthy the majesty
          of God to whom we address, and unbecoming a rational creature. The
          acting for a sensitive end is not a rational, much less can it be a
          spiritual service; though the act may be good in itself, yet not good
          in the agent, because he wants a due end. We are, then, spiritual,
          when we have the same end in our redeemed services, as God had in his
          redeeming love, viz., his own glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Spiritual service is offered to God in the name of Christ. Those
          are only “spiritual sacrifices, that are offered up to God by Jesus
          Christ” (1 Pet. ii. 5); that are the fruits of the sanctification of
          the Spirit, and offered in the mediation of the Son: as the altar
          sanctifies the gift, so doth Christ spiritualize our services for
          God’s acceptation; as the fire upon the altar separated the airy and
          finer parts of the sacrifice from the terrene and earthly; this is the
          golden altar upon which the prayers of the saints are offered up
          “before the throne” (Rev. viii. 3). As all that we have from God
          streams through his blood, so all that we give to God ascends by
          virtue of his merits. All the blessings God gave to the Israelites
          came out of Sion,523 that is, from the gospel hid under the law; all
          the duties we present to God are to be presented in Sion, in an
          evangelical manner; all our worship must be bottomed on Christ. God
          hath intended that we should “honor the Son, as we honor the Father;”
          as we honor the Father by offering our service only to him, so we are
          to honor the Son by offering it only in his name; in him alone God is
          well pleased, because in him alone he finds our services spiritual and
          worthy of acceptation; we must therefore take fast hold of him with
          our spirits, and the faster we hold him, the more spiritual is our
          worship. To do anything in the name of Christ, is not to believe the
          worship shall be accepted for itself, but to have our eye fixed upon
          Christ for the acceptance of it, and not to rest upon the work done,
          as carnal people are apt to do. The creatures present their
          acknowledgments to God by man; and man can only present his by Christ.
          It was utterly unlawful after the building of the temple, to sacrifice
          anywhere else; the temple being a type of Christ, it is utterly
          unlawful for us to present our services in any other name than his.
          This is the way to be spiritual. If we consider God out of Christ, we
          can have no other notions but those of horror and bondage. We behold
          him a Spirit, but environed with justice and wrath for sinners; but
          the consideration of him in Christ, veils his justice, draws forth his
          mercy, represents him more a father than a judge. In Christ the aspect
          of justice is changed, and by that the temper of the creature; so that
          in and by this Mediator, we “can have a spiritual boldness, and access
          to God with confidence” (Eph. iii. 12), whereby the spirit is kept
          from benumbness and distraction, and our souls quickened and refined.
          The thoughts kept upon Christ in a duty of worship quickly elevates
          the soul, and benumbness the whole service. Sin makes our services
          black, and the blood of Christ makes both our persons and services
          white.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude this head. God is a Spirit infinitely happy, therefore we
          must approach to him with cheerfulness; he is a Spirit of infinite
          majesty, therefore we must come before him with reverence; he is a
          Spirit infinitely high, therefore we must offer up our sacrifices with
          the deepest humility; he is a Spirit infinitely holy, therefore we
          must address him with purity; he is a Spirit infinitely glorious, we
          must therefore acknowledge his excellency in all that we do, and in
          our measures contribute to his glory, by having the highest aims in
          his worship; he is a Spirit infinitely provoked by us, therefore we
          must offer up our worship in the name of a pacifying Mediator and
          Intercessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The third general is, Why a spiritual worship is due to God, and
          to be offered to him. We must consider the object of worship, and the
          subject of worship; the worshipper and the worshipped. God is a
          spiritual Being; man is a reasonable creature. The nature of God
          informs us what is fit to be presented to him; our own nature informs
          us what is fit to be presented by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason I. The best we have is to be presented to God in worship. For,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Since God is the most excellent Being, he is to be served by us
          with the most excellent thing we have, and with the choicest
          veneration. God is so incomprehensibly excellent, that we cannot
          render him what he deserves: we must render him what we are able to
          offer: the best of our affections; the flower of our strength; the
          cream and top of our spirits. By the same reason that we are bound to
          give God the best worship, we must offer it to him in the best manner.
          We cannot give to God anything too good for so blessed a Being; God
          being a “great king,” slight services become not his majesty (Mal. i.
          13, 14); it is unbecoming the majesty of God, and the reason of a
          creature, to give him a trivial thing; it is unworthy to bestow the
          best of our strength on our lust, and the worst and weakest in the
          service of God. An infinite Spirit should have affections as near to
          infinite as we can; as he is a Spirit without bounds, so he should
          have a service without limits; when we have given him all, we cannot
          serve him according to the excellency of his nature (Josh. xxiv. 19);
          and shall we give him less than all? His infinite excellency, and our
          dependence on him as creatures, demands the choicest adoration; our
          spirits, being the noblest part of our nature, are as due to him as
          the service of our bodies, which are the vilest; to serve him with the
          worst only, is to diminish his honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Under the law, God commanded the best to be offered him. He would
          have the males, the best of the kind; the fat, the best of the
          creature;524 he commanded them to offer him the firstlings of the
          flock; not the firstlings of the womb, but the firstlings of the year:
          the Jewish cattle having two breeding‑times, in the beginning of the
          spring and the beginning of September; the latter breed was the
          weaker, which Jacob knew (Gen. xxx.) when he laid the rods before the
          cattle when they were strong in the spring, and withheld them when
          they were feeble in the autumn. One reason (as the Jews say) why God
          accepted not the offering of Cain was, because he brought the meanest,
          not the best of the fruit; and therefore, it is said, only that he
          brought of the “fruit” of the ground (Gen. iv. 3), not the first of
          the fruit, or the best of the fruit, as Abel, who brought the
          “firstling” of his flock, and the fat thereof (ver. 4).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And this the heathen practised by the light of nature. They for the
          most part offered males, as being more worthy; and burnt the male, not
          the female frankincense, as it is divided into those two kinds; they
          offered the best, when they offered their children to Moloch. Nothing
          more excellent than man, and nothing dearer to parents than their
          children, which are part of themselves. When the Israelites would have
          a golden calf for a representation of God, they would dedicate their
          jewels, and strip their wives and children of their richest ornaments,
          to show their devotion. Shall men serve their dumb idols with the best
          of their substance, and the strength of their souls; and shall the
          living God have a duller service from us, than idols had from them?
          God requires no such hard, but delightful worship from us, our
          spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. All creatures serve man, by the providential order of God, with the
          best they have. As we, by God’s appointment, receive from creatures
          the best they can give, ought we not with a free will to render to God
          the best we can offer? The beasts give us their best fat; the trees
          their best fruit; the sun its best light; the fountains their best
          streams; shall God order us the best from creatures, and we put him
          off with the worst from ourselves?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. God hath given us the choicest thing he had—a Redeemer that was the
          power of God, and the wisdom of God; the best he had in heaven, his
          own Son, and in himself a sacrifice for us, that we might be enabled
          to present ourselves a sacrifice to him. And Christ offered himself
          for us, the best he had, and that with the strength of the Deity
          through the eternal Spirit; and shall we grudge God the best part of
          ourselves? As God would have a worship from his creature, so it must
          be with the best part of his creature. If we have “given ourselves to
          the Lord” (2 Cor. viii. 5), we can worship with no less than
          ourselves. What is the man without his spirit? If we are to worship
          God with all that we have received from him, we must worship him with
          the best part we have received from him; it is but a small glory we
          can give him with the best, and shall we deprive him of his right by
          giving him the worst? As what we are is from God, so what we are ought
          to be for God. Creation is the foundation of worship (Psalm c. 2, 3):
          “Serve the Lord with gladness; know ye that the Lord he is God; it is
          he that hath made us.” He hath ennobled us with spiritual affections;
          where is it fittest for us to employ them, but upon him? and at what
          time, but when we come solemnly to converse with him? Is it justice to
          deny him the honor of his best gift to us? our souls are more his gift
          to us, than anything in the world; other things are so given that they
          are often taken from us, but our spirits are the most durable gift.
          Rational faculties cannot be removed without a dissolution of nature.
          Well then, as he is God, he is to be honored with all the propensions
          and ardor that the infiniteness and excellency of such a Being
          require, and the incomparable obligations he hath laid upon us in this
          state deserve at our hands. In all our worship, therefore, our minds
          ought to be filled with the highest admiration, love, and reverence.
          Since our end was to glorify God, we answer not our end, and honor him
          not, unless we give him the choicest we have.525
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason II. We cannot else act towards God according to the nature of
          rational creatures. Spiritual worship is due to God, because of his
          nature; and due from us, because of our nature. As we are to adore
          God, so we are to adore him as men; the nature of a rational creature
          makes this impression upon him; he cannot view his own nature without
          having this duty striking upon his mind. As he knows, by inspection
          into himself, that there was a God that made him; so, that he is made
          to be in subjection to God, subjection to him in his spirit as well as
          his body, and ought morally to testify this natural dependence on him.
          His constitution informs him that he hath a capacity to converse with
          God; that he cannot converse with him, but by those inward faculties;
          if it could be managed by his body without his spirit, beasts might as
          well converse with God as men. It can never be a “reasonable service”
          (Rom. xii. 1), as it ought to be, unless the reasonable faculties be
          employed in the management of it; it must be a worship prodigiously
          lame, without the concurrence of the chiefest part of man with it. As
          we are to act conformably to the nature of the object, so also to the
          nature of our own faculties. Our faculties, in the very gift of them
          to us, were destined to be exercised, about what? What? All other
          things but the Author of them. It is a conceit cannot enter into the
          heart of a rational creature, that he should act as such a creature in
          other things, and as a stone in things relating to the donor of them;
          as a man, with his mind about him in the affairs of the world; as a
          beast, without reason in his acts towards God. If a man did not employ
          his reason in other things, he would be an unprofitable creature in
          the world: if he do not employ his spiritual faculties in worship, he
          denies them the proper end and use for which they were given him; it
          is a practical denial that God hath given him a soul, and that God
          hath any right to the exercise of it. If there were no worship
          appointed by God in the world, the natural inclination of man to some
          kind of religion would be in vain; and if our inward faculties were
          not employed in the duties of religion they would be in vain; the true
          end of God in the endowment of us with them would be defeated by us,
          as much as lies in us, if we did not serve him with that which we have
          from him solely at his own cost. As no man can with reason conclude,
          that the rest commanded on the Sabbath and the sanctification of it,
          was only a rest of the body, that had been performed by the beasts as
          well as men, but some higher end was aimed at for the rational
          creature; so no man can think that the command for worship terminated
          only in the presence of the body; that God should give the command to
          man as a reasonable creature, and expect no other service from him
          than that of a brute. God did not require a worship from man for any
          want he had, or any essential honor that could accrue to him, but that
          men might testify their gratitude to him, and dependence on him. It is
          the most horrid ingratitude not to have lively and deep sentiments of
          gratitude after such obligations, and not to make those due
          acknowledgments that are proper for a rational creature. Religion is
          the highest and choicest act of a reasonable creature; no creature
          under heaven is capable of it that wants reason. As it is a violation
          of reason not to worship God, so it is no less a violation of reason
          not to worship him with the heart and spirit; it is a high dishonor to
          God, and defeats him not only of the service due to him from man, but
          that which is due to him from all the creatures. Every creature, as it
          is an effect of God’s power and wisdom, doth passively worship God;
          that is, it doth afford matter of adoration to man that hath reason to
          collect it, and return it where it is due. Without the exercise of the
          soul, we can no more hand it to God, than without such an exercise, we
          can gather it from the creature; so that by this neglect, the
          creatures are restrained from answering their chief end; they cannot
          pay any service to God without man; nor can man, without the
          employment of his rational faculties, render a homage to God, any more
          than beasts can. This engagement of our inward power stands firm and
          inviolable, let the modes of worship be what they will, or the changes
          of them by the sovereign authority of God never so frequent; this
          could not expire or be changed as long as the nature of man endured.
          As man had not been capable of a command for worship, unless he had
          been endued with spiritual faculties; so he is not active in a true
          practice of worship, unless they be employed by him in it. The
          constitution of man makes this manner of worship perpetually
          obligatory, and the oblation can never cease, till man cease to be a
          creature furnished with such faculties; in our worship, therefore, if
          we would act like rational creatures, we should extend all the powers
          of our souls to the utmost pitch, and essay to have apprehensions of
          God, equal to the excellency of his nature, which, though we may
          attempt, we can never attain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason III. Without this engagement of our spirits no act is an act of
          worship. True worship, being an acknowledgment of God and the
          perfections of his nature, results only from the soul, that being only
          capable of knowing God and those perfections which are the object and
          motive of worship. The posture of the body is but to testify the
          inward temper and affection of the mind; if, therefore, it testifies
          what it is not, it is a lie, and no worship; the cringes a beast may
          be taught to make to an altar may as well be called worship, since a
          man thinks as little of that God he pretends to honor, as the beast
          doth of the altar to which he bows. Worship is a reverent remembrance
          of God, and giving some honor to him with the intention of the soul;
          it cannot justly have the name of worship, that wants the essential
          part of it; it is an ascribing to God the glory of his nature, an
          owning subjection and obedience to him as our sovereign Lord; this is
          as impossible to be performed without the spirit, as that there can be
          life and motion in a body without a soul; it is a drawing near to God,
          not in regard of his essential presence, so all things are near to
          God, but in an acknowledgment of his excellency, which is an act of
          the spirit; without this, the worst of men in a place of worship are
          as near to God as the best. The necessity of the conjunction of our
          soul ariseth from the nature of worship, which being the most serious
          thing we can be employed in, the highest converse with the highest
          object requires the choicest temper of spirit in the performance. That
          cannot be an act of worship, which is not an act of piety and virtue;
          but there is no act of virtue done by the members of the body, without
          the concurrence of the powers of the soul. We may as well call the
          presence of a dead carcass in a place of worship, an act of religion,
          as the presence of a living body without an intent spirit; the
          separation of the soul from one is natural, the other moral; that
          renders the body lifeless, but this renders the act loathsome to God;
          as the being of the soul gives life to the body, so the operation of
          the soul gives life to the actions. As he cannot be a man that wants
          the form of a man, a rational soul; so that cannot be a worship that
          wants an essential part, the act of the spirit; God will not vouchsafe
          any acts of man so noble a title without the requisite qualifications
          (Hos. v. 6): “They shall go with their flocks and their herds to seek
          the Lord,” &amp;c. A multitude of lambs and bullocks for sacrifice, to
          appease God’s anger. God would not give it the title of worship,
          though instituted by himself, when it wanted the qualities of such a
          service. “The spirit of whoredom was in the midst of them” (v. 4). In
          the judgment of our Saviour, it is a “vain worship, when the
          traditions of men are taught for the doctrines of God” (Matt. xv. 9);
          and no less vain must it be, when the bodies of men are presented to
          supply the place of their spirits. As an omission of duty is a
          contempt of God’s sovereign authority, so the omission of the manner
          of it is a contempt of it, and of his amiable excellency; and that
          which is a contempt and mockery, can lay no just claim to the title of
          worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason IV. There is in worship an approach of God to man. It was
          instituted to this purpose, that God might give out his blessings to
          man; and ought not our spirits to be prepared and ready to receive his
          communications? We are, in such acts, more peculiarly in his presence.
          In the Israelites hearing the law, it is said, God was to “come among
          them” (Exod. xix. 10, 11). Then, men are said to stand before the Lord
          (Deut. x. 8): “God, before whom I stand” (1 Kings, xvii. 1): that is,
          whom I worship; and therefore when Cain forsook the worship of God
          settled in his father’s family, he is said, “to go out from the
          presence of the Lord” (Gen. iv. 16). God is essentially present in the
          world; graciously present in his church. The name of the evangelical
          city is Jehovah Shammah (Ezek. xlviii. 35), “the Lord is there.” God
          is more graciously present in the evangelical institutions than in the
          legal; he “loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
          Jacob” (Ps. lxxxvii. 2); his evangelical law and worship which was to
          go forth from Zion, as the other did from Sinai (Mic. iv. 2). God
          delights to approach to men, and converse with them in the worship
          instituted in the gospel, more than in all the dwellings of Jacob. If
          God be graciously present, ought not we to be spiritually present? A
          lifeless carcass service becomes not so high and delectable a presence
          as this; it is to thrust him from us, not invite him to us; it is to
          practise in the ordinances what the prophet predicts concerning men’s
          usage of our Saviour (Isa. liii. 2): “There is no form, no comeliness,
          nor beauty that we should desire him.” A slightness in worship
          reflects upon the excellency of the object of worship. God and his
          worship are so linked together, that whosoever thinks the one not
          worth his inward care, esteems the other not worth his inward
          affection. How unworthy a slight is it of God, who proffers the
          opening his treasure; the re‑impressing his image; conferring his
          blessings; admits us into his presence, when he hath no need for us;
          who hath millions of angels to attend him in his court, and celebrate
          his praise! He that worships not God with his spirit, regards not
          God’s presence in his ordinances, and slights the great end of God in
          them, and that perfection he may attain by them. We can only expect
          what God hath promised to give, when we tender to him what he hath
          commanded us to present. If we put off God with a shell, he will put
          us off with a husk. How can we expect his heart, when we do not give
          him ours; or hope for the blessing needful for us, when we render not
          the glory due to him? It cannot be an advantageous worship without
          spiritual graces; for those are uniting, and union is the ground of
          all communion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason V. To have a spiritual worship is God’s end in the restoration
          of the creature, both in redemption by his Son and sanctification by
          his spirit. A fitness for spiritual offerings was the end of the
          “coming of Christ” (Mal. iii. 3); he should purge them as gold and
          silver by fire, a spirit burning up their dross, melting them into a
          holy compliance with and submission to God. To what purpose? That they
          may offer to the lord an offering in righteousness; a pure offering
          from a purified spirit; he came to “bring us to God” (1 Pet. iii. 18)
          in such a garb, as that we might be fit to converse with him. Can we
          be thus, without a fixedness of our spirits on him? The offering of
          spiritual sacrifices is the end of making any a “spiritual habitation”
          and a “holy priesthood” (1 Pet. ii. 5). We can no more be worshippers
          of God without a worshipper’s nature, than a man can be a man without
          human nature. As man was at first created for the honor and worship of
          God, so the design of restoring that image which was defaced by sin
          tends to the same end. We are not brought to God by Christ, nor are
          our services presented to him, if they be without our spirits; would
          any man that undertakes to bring another to a prince, introduce him in
          a slovenly and sordid habit, such a garb that he knows hateful to him?
          or bring the clothes or skin of a man stuffed with straw, instead of
          the person? to come with our skins before God, without our spirits, is
          contrary to the design of God in redemption and regeneration. If a
          carnal worship would have pleased God, a carnal heart would have
          served his turn, without the expense of his Spirit in sanctification.
          He bestows upon man a spiritual nature, that he may return to him a
          spiritual service; he enlightens the understanding, that he may have a
          rational service; and new moulds the will, that he may have a
          voluntary service. As it is the milk of the word wherewith he feeds
          us, so it is the service of the word wherewith we must glorify him. So
          much as there is of confusedness in our understanding, so much of
          starting and levity in our wills, so much of slipperiness and skipping
          in our affections; so much is abated of the due qualities of the
          worship of God, and so much we fall short of the end of redemption and
          sanctification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reason VI. A spiritual worship is to be offered to God, because no
          worship but that can be acceptable. We can never be secured of
          acceptance without it; he being a Spirit, nothing but the worship in
          spirit can be suitable to him: what is unsuitable, cannot be
          acceptable; there must be something in us, to make our services
          capable of being presented by Christ for an actual acceptation. No
          service is “acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,” but as it is a
          spiritual sacrifice, and offered by a spiritual heart (1 Pet. ii. 5).
          The sacrifice is first spiritual, before it be acceptable to God by
          Christ; when it is “an offering in righteousness,” it is then, and
          only then, pleasant to the Lord (Mal. iii. 3, 4). No prince would
          accept a gift that is unsuitable to his majesty, and below the
          condition of the person that presents it. Would he be pleased with a
          bottle of water for drink, from one that hath his cellar full of wine?
          How unacceptable must that be that is unsuitable to the Divine
          Majesty! And what can be more unsuitable than a withdrawing the
          operations of our souls from him, in the oblation of our bodies? We as
          little glorify God as God, when we give him only a corporeal worship,
          as the heathen did, when they represented him in a corporeal shape
          (Rom. i. 21); one as well as the other denies his spiritual nature:
          this is worse, for had it been lawful to represent God to the eye, it
          could not have been done but by a bodily figure suited to the sense;
          but since it is necessary to worship him, it cannot be by a corporeal
          attendance, without the operation of the Spirit. A spiritual frame is
          more pleasing to God than the highest exterior adornments, than the
          greatest gifts, and the highest prophetic illuminations. “The glory of
          the second temple” exceeded the glory of the first (Hag. ii. 8, 9). As
          God accounts the spiritual glory of ordinances most beneficial for us,
          so our spiritual attendance upon ordinances is most pleasing to him;
          he that offers the greatest services without it, offers but flesh
          (Hos. viii. 13): “They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my
          offerings, but the Lord accepts them not.” Spiritual frames are the
          soul of religious services; all other carriages without them are
          contemptible to this spirit: we can never lay claim to that promise of
          God, none shall “seek my face in vain.” We affect a vain seeking of
          him, when we want a due temper of spirit for him; and vain spirits
          shall have vain returns: it is more contrary to the nature of God’s
          holiness to have communion with such, than it is contrary to the
          nature of light to have communion with darkness. To make use of this:

          1. If spiritual worship be required by God, how sad is it for them
          that they are so far from giving God a spiritual worship, that they
          render him no worship at all! I speak not of the neglect of public,
          but of private; when men present not a devotion to God from one year’s
          end to the other. The speech of our Saviour, that we must worship God
          in spirit and truth, implies that a worship is due to him from every
          one; that is the common impression upon the consciences of all men in
          the world, if they have not by some constant course in gross sins,
          hardened their souls, and stifled those natural sentiments. There was
          never a nation in the world without some kind of religion; and no
          religion was ever without some modes to testify a devotion; the
          heathens had their sacrifices and purifications; and the Jews, by
          God’s order, had their rites, whereby they were to express their
          allegiance to God. Consider,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) Worship is a duty incumbent upon all men. It is a homage mankind
          owes to God, under the relation wherein he stands obliged to him; it
          is a prime and immutable justice to own our allegiance to him; it is
          as unchangeable a truth that God is to be worshipped, as that God is;
          he is to be worshipped as God, as creator, and therefore by all, since
          he is the Creator of all, the Lord of all, and all are his creatures,
          and all are his subjects. Worship is founded upon creation (Psalm c.
          2, 3): it is due to God for himself and his own essential excellency,
          and therefore due from all; it is due upon the account of man’s
          nature; the human rational nature is the same in all. Whatsoever is
          due to God upon the account of man’s nature, and the natural
          obligations he hath laid upon man, is due from all men; because they
          all enjoy the benefits which are proper to their nature. Man in no
          state was exempted, nor can be exempted from it; in Paradise he had
          his Sabbath and sacraments; man therefore dissolves the obligation of
          a reasonable nature, by neglecting the worship of God. Religion is in
          the first place to be minded. As soon as Noah came out of the ark, he
          contrived not a habitation for himself, but an altar for the Lord, to
          acknowledge him the author of his preservation from the deluge (Gen.
          viii. 20): and wheresoever Abraham came, his first business was to
          erect an altar, and pay his arrears of gratitude to God, before he ran
          upon the score for new mercies (Gen. xii. 7; xiii. 4, 18): he left a
          testimony of worship wherever he came.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) Wholly therefore to neglect it, is a high degree of atheism. He
          that calls not upon God, “saith in his heart, There is no God;” and
          seems to have the sentiments of natural conscience, as to God, stifled
          in him (Psalm xiv. 1, 4): it must arise from a conceit that there is
          no God, or that we are equal to him, adoration not being due from
          persons of an equal state; or that God is unable, or unwilling to take
          notice of the adoring acts of his creatures: what is any of these but
          an undeifying the supreme Majesty? When we lay aside all thoughts of
          paying any homage to him, we are in a fair way opinionatively to deny
          him, as much as we practically disown him. Where there is no knowledge
          of God, that is, no “acknowledgment of God,” a gap is opened to all
          licentiousness (Hos. iv. 1, 2); and that by degrees brawns the
          conscience, and razeth out the sense of God. Those forsake God that
          “forget his holy mountain” (Isa. lxv. 11); they do not practically own
          him as the Creator of their souls or bodies. It is the sin of Cain,
          who turning his back upon worship, is said to “go out from the
          presence of the Lord” (Gen. iv. 16). Not to worship him with our
          spirits, is against his law of creation: not to worship him at all, is
          against his act of creation; not to worship him in truth, is
          hypocrisy; not to worship him at all, is atheism; whereby we render
          ourselves worse than the worms in the earth, or a toad in a ditch.
        </p>
        <p>
          (3.) To perform a worship to a false God, or to the true God in a
          false manner, seems to be less a sin than to live in perpetual neglect
          of it. Though it be directed to a false object instead of God, yet it
          is under the notion of a God, and so is an acknowledgment of such a
          Being as God in the world; whereas the total neglect of any worship,
          is a practical denying of the existence of any supreme Majesty.
          Whosoever constantly omits a public and private worship, transgresses
          against an universally received dictate; for all nations have agreed
          in the common notion of worshipping God, though they have disagreed in
          the several modes and rites whereby they would testify that adoration.
          By a worship of God, though superstitious, a veneration and reverence
          of such a being is maintained in the world; whereas by a total neglect
          of worship, he is virtually disowned and discarded, if not from his
          existence, yet from his providence and government of the world; all
          the mercies we breathe in are denied to flow from him. A foolish
          worship owns religion, though it bespatters it; as if a stranger
          coming into a country mistakes the subject for the prince, and pays
          that reverence to the subject which is due to the prince; though he
          mistakes the object, yet he owns an authority; or if he pays any
          respect to the true prince of that country after the mode of his own,
          though appearing ridiculous in the place where he is, he owns the
          authority of the prince; whereas the omission of all respect would be
          a contempt of majesty: and, therefore, the judgments of God have been
          more signal upon the sacrilegious contemners of worship among the
          heathens, than upon those that were diligent and devout in their false
          worship; and they generally owned the blessings received to the
          preservation of a sense and worship of a Deity among them. Though such
          a worship be not acceptable to God, and every man is bound to offer to
          God a devotion agreeable to his own mind; yet it is commendable, not
          as worship, but as it speaks an acknowledgment of such a being as God,
          in his power and creation, and his beneficence in his providence.
          Well, then, omissions of worship are to be avoided. Let no man execute
          that upon himself which God will pronounce at last as the greatest
          misery, and bid God depart from him, who will at last be loth to hear
          God bid him depart from him. Though man hath natural sentiments that
          God is to be worshipped, yet having an hostility in his nature, he is
          apt to neglect, or give it him in a slight manner; he therefore sets a
          particular mark and notice of attention upon the fourth command,
          “Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day.” Corrupt nature is apt to
          neglect the worship of God, and flag in it. This command, therefore,
          which concerns his worship, he fortifies with several reasons. Nor let
          any neglect worship, because they cannot find their hearts spiritual
          in it. The further we are from God, the more carnal shall we be. No
          man can expect heat by a distance from the sunbeams, or other means of
          warmth. Though God commanded a circumcised heart in the Jewish
          services, yet he did not warrant a neglect of the outward testimonies
          of religion he had then appointed. He expected, according to his
          command, that they should offer the sacrifices, and practise the legal
          purification he had commanded; he would have them diligently observed,
          though he had declared that he imposed them only for a time; and our
          Saviour ordered the practice of those positive rites as long as the
          law remained unrepealed, as in the case of the leper (Mark xiv. 4). It
          is an injustice to refuse the offering ourselves to God according to
          the manner he hath in his wisdom prescribed and required. If spiritual
          worship be required by God, then,
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It informs us, that diligence in outward worship is not to be
          rested in. Men may attend all their days on worship, with a juiceless
          heart and unquickened frame, and think to compensate the neglect of
          the manner with abundance of the matter of service.526 Outward
          expressions are but the badges and liveries of service, not the
          service itself. As the strength of sin lies in the inward frame of the
          heart, so the strength of worship in the inward complexion and temper
          of the soul. What do a thousand services avail, without cutting the
          throat of our carnal affections? What are loud prayers, but as
          sounding brass and tinkling cymbals, without divine charity? A
          pharisaical diligence in outward forms, without inward spirit, had no
          better a title vouchsafed by our Saviour than that of hypocritical.
          God desires not sacrifices, nor delights in burnt‑offerings: shadows
          are not to be offered instead of substance. God required the heart of
          man for itself, but commanded outward ceremonies as subservient to
          inward worship, and goads and spurs unto it. They were never appointed
          as the substance of religion, but auxiliaries to it. What value had
          the offering of the human nature of Christ been of, if he had not had
          a divine nature to qualify him to be the Priest? and what is the
          oblation of our bodies, without a priestly act of the spirit in the
          presentation of it? Could the Israelites have called themselves
          worshippers of God according to his order, if they had brought a
          thousand lambs that had died in a ditch, or been killed at home? They
          were to be brought living to the altar; the blood shed at the foot of
          it. A thousand sacrifices killed without had not been so valuable as
          one brought alive to the place of offering: one sound sacrifice is
          better than a thousand rotten ones. As God took no pleasure in the
          blood of beasts without its relation to the Antitype; so he takes no
          pleasure in the outward rites of worship, without faith in the
          Redeemer. To offer a body with a sapless spirit, is a sacrilege of the
          same nature with that of the Israelites when they offered dead beasts.
          A man without spiritual worship is dead while he worships, though by
          his diligence in the externals of it, he may, like the angel of the
          church of Sardis, “have a name to live” (Rev. iii. 1). What security
          can we expect from a multitude of dead services? What weak shields are
          they against the holy eye and revenging wrath of God! What man, but
          one out of his wits, would solicit a dead man to be his advocate or
          champion? Diligence in outward worship is not to be rested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use II. shall be for examination. Let us try ourselves concerning the
          manner of our worship. We are now in the end of the world, and the
          dregs of time; wherein the apostle predicts there may be much of a
          form, and little of the power of godliness (2 Tim. iii. 1, 5); and,
          therefore, it stands us in hand to search into ourselves, whether it
          be not thus with us? whether there be as much reverence in our spirits
          as there may be devotion in our countenances and outward carriages.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. How, therefore, are our hearts prepared to worship? Is our
          diligence greater to put our hearts in an adoring posture, than our
          bodies in a decent garb? or are we content to have a muddy heart, so
          we may have a dressed carcass? To have a spirit a cage of unclean
          birds, while we wipe the filth from the outside of the platter, is no
          better than a pharisaical devotion, and deserves no better a name than
          that of a whited sepulchre. Do we take opportunities to excite and
          quicken our spirits to the performance, and cry aloud with David,
          “Awake, awake, my glory!” Are not our hearts asleep when Christ
          knocks? When we hear the voice of God, “Seek my face;” do we answer
          him with warm resolutions, “Thy face, Lord, we will seek?” (Ps. xxvii.
          8.) Do we comply with spiritual motions, and strike whilst the iron is
          hot? Is there not more of reluctancy than readiness? Is there a quick
          rising of the soul in reverence to the motion, as Eglon to Ehud; or a
          sullen hanging the head at the first approach of it? Or if our hearts
          seem to be engaged and on fire, what are the motives that quicken that
          fire? Is it only the blast of a natural conscience, fear of hell,
          desires of heaven, as abstracted from God? or is it an affection to
          God; an obedient will to please him; longings to enjoy him, as a holy
          and sanctifying God in his ordinances, as well as a blessed and
          glorified God in heaven? What do we expect in our approaches from him?
          that which may make divine impressions upon us, and more exactly
          conform us to the Divine nature? or do we design nothing but an empty
          formality, a rolling eye, and a filling the air with a few words,
          without any openings of heart to receive the incomes, which, according
          to the nature of the duty, might be conveyed to us? Can this be a
          spiritual worship? The soul then closely waits upon him, when its
          expectation is only from him (Psalm lxii. 6). Are our hearts seasoned
          with a sense of sin; a sight of our spiritual wants; raised notions of
          God; glowing affections to him; strong appetite after a spiritual
          fulness? Do we rouse up our sleepy spirits, and make a covenant with
          all that is within us to attend upon him? So much as we want of this,
          so much we come short of a spiritual worship. In Ps. lvii. 7 (“My
          heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed”), David would fix his heart,
          before he would engage in a praising act of worship. He appeals to God
          about it, and that with doubling the expression, as being certain of
          an inward preparedness. Can we make the same appeals in a fixation of
          spirit?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. How are our hearts fixed upon him; how do they cleave to him in the
          duty? Do we resign our spirits to God, and make them an entire
          holocaust, a whole burnt‑offering in his worship? or do we not
          willingly admit carnal thoughts to mix themselves with spiritual
          duties, and fasten our minds to the creature, under pretences of
          directing them to the Creator? Do we not pass a mere compliment upon
          God, by some superficial act of devotion; while some covetous,
          envious, ambitious, voluptuous imagination may possess our minds? Do
          we not invert God’s order, and worship a lust instead of God with our
          spirits, that should not have the least service, either from our souls
          or bodies, but with a spiritual disdain be sacrificed to the just
          indignation of God? How often do we fight against his will, while we
          cry, “Hail, Master!” instead of crucifying our own thoughts,
          crucifying the Lord of our lives; our outward carriage plausible, and
          our inward stark naught! Do we not often regard iniquity more than God
          in our hearts, in a time of worship?—roll some filthy imagination as a
          sweet morsel under our tongues, and taste more sweetness in that than
          in God? Do not our spirits smell rank of earth, while we offer to
          heaven; and have we not hearts full of thick clay, as their “hands
          were full of blood?” (Isa. i. 15.) When we sacrifice, do we not wrap
          up our souls in communion with some sordid fancy, when we should
          entwine our spirits about an amiable God? While we have some fear of
          him, may we not have a love to something else above him? This is to
          worship, or swear by the Lord, and by Malcham (Zeph. i. 5). How often
          doth an apish fancy render a service inwardly ridiculous, under a
          grave outward posture; skipping to the shop, warehouse,
          counting‑house, in the space of a short prayer! and we are before God
          as a Babel, a confusion of internal languages; and this in those parts
          of worship which are, in the right use, most agreeable to God,
          profitable for ourselves, ruinous to the kingdom of sin and Satan, and
          means to bring us into a closer communion with the Divine Majesty. Can
          this be a spiritual worship?
        </p>
        <p>
          3. How do we act our graces in worship? Though the instrument be
          strung, if the strings be not wound up, what melody can be the issue?
          All readiness and alacrity discover a strength of nature; and a
          readiness in spirituals discovers a spirituality in the heart. As
          unaffecting thoughts of God are not spiritual thoughts, so unaffecting
          addresses to God are not spiritual addresses. Well, then, what
          awakenings, and elevations of faith and love have we? What strong
          outflowings of our souls to him? What indignation against sin? What
          admirations of redeeming grace? How low have we brought our
          corruptions to the footstool of Christ, to be made his conquered
          enemies? How straitly have we clasped our faith about the cross and
          throne of Christ, to become his intimate spouse? Do we in hearing hang
          upon the lips of Christ; in prayer take hold of God, and will not let
          him go; in confessions rend the caul of our hearts, and indite our
          souls before him with a deep humility? Do we act more by a soaring
          love than a drooping fear? So far as our spirits are servile, so far
          they are legal and carnal; so much as they are free and spontaneous,
          so much they are evangelical and spiritual. As men under the law are
          subject to the constraint of “bondage all their life‑time” (Heb. ii.
          15), in all their worship; so under the gospel they are under a
          constraint of love (2 Cor. v. 14): how then are believing affections
          exercised, which are alway accompanied with holy fear; a fear of his
          goodness that admits us into his presence, and a fear to offend him in
          our act of worship? So much as we have of forced or feeble affection,
          so much we have of carnality.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. How do we find our hearts after worship? By an after carriage we
          may judge of the spirituality of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) How are we as to inward strength? When a worship is spiritually
          performed, grace is more strengthened, corruption more mortified; the
          soul, like Samson after his awakening, goes out with a renewed
          strength; as the inward man is renewed day by day, that is, every day;
          so it is renewed in every worship. Every shower makes the grass and
          fruit grow in good ground where the root is good, and the weeds where
          the ground is naught; the more prepared the heart is to obedience in
          other duties after worship, the more evidence there is that it hath
          been spiritual in the exercise of it. It is the end of God in every
          dispensation, as in that of John Baptist, “to make ready a people
          prepared for the Lord” (Luke i. 17): when the heart is by worship
          prepared for fresh acts of obedience, and hath a more exact
          watchfulness against the encroachments of sin. As carnal men after
          worship sprout up in spiritual wickedness, so do spiritual worshippers
          in spiritual graces; spiritual fruits are a sign of a spiritual frame.
          When men are more prone to sin after duty, it is a sign there was but
          little communion with God in it; and a greater strength of sin,
          because such an act is contrary to the end of worship which is the
          subduing of sin. It is a sign the physic hath wrought well, when the
          stomach hath a better appetite to its appointed food; and worship hath
          been well performed, when we have a stronger inclination to other acts
          well pleasing to God, and a more sensible distaste of those
          temptations we too much relished before. It is a sign of a good
          concoction, when there is a greater strength in the vitals of
          religion, a more eager desire to know God. When Moses had been praying
          to God, and prevailed with him, he puts up a higher request to “behold
          his glory” (Exod. xxxiii. 13, 18): when the appetite stands strong to
          fuller discoveries of God, it is a sign there hath been a spiritual
          converse with him.

          (2.) How is it especially as to humility? The Pharisees’ worship was,
          without dispute, carnal; and we find them not more humble after all
          their devotions, but overgrown with more weeds of spiritual pride;
          they performed them as their righteousness. What men dare plead before
          God in his day, they plead before him in their hearts in their day;
          but this men will do at the day of judgment: “We have prophesied in
          thy name,” &amp;c. (Matt. vii. 21). They show what tincture their
          services left upon their spirits; that which excludes them from any
          acceptation at the last day, excludes them from any estimation of
          being spiritual in this day. The carnal worshippers charge God with
          injustice in not rewarding them, and claim an acceptation as a
          compensation due to them (Isa. lviii. 3): “Wherefore have we afflicted
          our souls, and thou takest no knowledge?” A spiritual worshipper looks
          upon his duties with shame, as well as he doth upon his sins with
          confusion; and implores the mercy of God for the one as well as the
          other. In Psalm cxliii. 2, the prophet David, after his supplications,
          begs of God not to enter into judgment with him; and acknowledges any
          answer that God should give him, as a fruit of his faithfulness to his
          promise, and not the merit of his worship: “In thy faithfulness answer
          me,” &amp;c. Whatsoever springs from a gracious principle, and is the
          breath of the Spirit, leaves a man more humble; whereas, that which
          proceeds from a stock of nature, hath the true blood of nature running
          in the veins of it; viz., that pride which is naturally derived from
          Adam. The breathing of the Divine Spirit is, in everything, to conform
          us to our Redeemer; that being the main work of his office, is his
          work in every particular christian act influenced by him. Now Jesus
          Christ, in all his actions, was an exact pattern of all humility.
          After the institution and celebration of the supper, a special act of
          worship in the church, though he had a sense of all the authority his
          Father had given him, yet he “humbles himself to wash his disciples’
          feet” (John xiii. 2‒4); and after his sublime prayer (John xvii.), “He
          humbles himself to the death, and offers himself” to his murderers,
          because of his Father’s pleasure. (John xviii. 1): “When he had spoken
          those words, he went over the brook Kedron into the garden.” What is
          the end of God in appointing worship, is the end of a spiritual heart
          in offering it; not his own exaltation, but God’s glory. Glorifying
          the name of God is the fruit of that evangelical worship the Gentiles
          were in time to give to God (Ps. lxxxvi. 9): “All nations which thou
          hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall
          glorify thy name.” Let us examine, then, what debasing ourselves there
          is in a sense of our own vileness, and distance from so glorious a
          Spirit. Self‑denial is the heart of all gospel grace. Evangelical,
          spiritual worship cannot be without the ingredient of the main
          evangelical principle.

          (3.) What delight is there after it? What pleasure is there, and what
          is the object of that pleasure? Is it the communion we have had with
          God, or a fluency in ourselves? Is it something which hath touched our
          hearts, or tickled our fancies? As the strength of sin is known by the
          delightful thoughts of it after the commission; so is the spirituality
          of duty, by the object of our delightful remembrance after the
          performance. It was a sign David was spiritual in the worship of God
          in the tabernacle, when he enjoyed it, because he longed for the
          spiritual part of it, when he was exiled from it; his desires were not
          only for liberty to revisit the tabernacle, but to see the “power and
          glory of God in the sanctuary,” as he had seen it before (Ps. lxiii.
          2): his desires for it could not have been so ardent, if his
          reflection upon what had past had not been delightful; nor could his
          soul be poured out in him, for the want of such opportunities, if the
          remembrance of the converse he had had with God, had not been
          accompanied with a delightful relish (Ps. xlii. 4). Let us examine
          what delight we find in our spirits after worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use III. is of comfort. And it is very comfortable to consider, that
          the smallest worship with the heart and spirit, flowing from a
          principle of grace, is more acceptable than the most pompous
          veneration; yea, if the oblation were as precious as the whole circuit
          of heaven and earth without it. That God that values a cup of cold
          water given to any as his disciple, will value a sincere service above
          a costly sacrifice. God hath his eye upon them that honor his nature;
          he would not “seek such to worship him,” if he did not intend to
          accept such a worship from them; when we therefore invoke him, and
          praise him, which are the prime parts of religion, he will receive it
          as a sweet savor from us, and overlook infirmities mixed with the
          graces. The great matter of discomfort, and that which makes us
          question the spirituality of worship, is the many starts of our
          spirits, and rovings to other things. For answer to which,
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is to be confessed that these starts are natural to us. Who is
          free from them? We bear in our bosoms a nest of turbulent thoughts,
          which, like busy gnats, will be buzzing about us while we are in our
          most inward and spiritual converses. Many wild beasts lurk in a man’s
          heart, as in a close and covert wood, and scarce discover themselves
          but at our solemn worship. No duty so holy, no worship so spiritual,
          that can wholly privilege us from them; they will jog us in our most
          weighty employments, that, as God said to Cain, sin lies at the door,
          and enters in, and makes a riot in our souls. As it is said of wicked
          men, “they cannot sleep” for multitude of thoughts (Eccles. v. 12); so
          it may be of many a good man, he cannot worship for multitude of
          thoughts; there will be starts, and more in our religious than natural
          employments; it is natural to man. Some therefore think, the bells
          tied to Aaron’s garments, between the pomegranates, were to warn the
          people, and recall their fugitive minds to the present service, when
          they heard the sound of them, upon the least motion of the
          high‑priest. The sacrifice of Abraham, the father or the faithful, was
          not exempt from the fowls pecking at it (Gen. xv. 11). Zechariah
          himself was drowsy in the midst of his visions, which being more
          amazing, might cause a heavenly intentness (Zech. iv. 1): “The angel
          that talked with me, came again and awaked me, as a man is awaked out
          of sleep.” He had been roused up before, but he was ready to drop down
          again; his heart was gone, till the angel jogged him. We may complain
          of such imaginations, as Jeremiah doth of the enemies of the Jews
          (Lam. iv. 19). Our persecutors are swifter than eagles; they light
          upon us with as much speed as eagles upon a carcass; they pursue us
          upon the mountain of divine institutions, and they lay wait for us in
          the wilderness, in our retired addresses to God. And this will be so
          while,
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) There is natural corruption in us. There are in a godly man two
          contrary principles, flesh and spirit, which endeavor to hinder one
          another’s acts, and are alway stirring upon the offensive or defensive
          part (Gal. v. 17). There is a body of death, continually exhaling its
          noisome vapors: it is a body of death in our worship, as well as in
          our natures; it snaps our resolutions asunder (Rom. vii. 19); it
          hinders us in the doing good, and contradicts our wills in the
          stirring up evil. This corruption being seated in all the faculties,
          and a constant domestic in them, has the greater opportunity to
          trouble us, since it is by those faculties that we spiritually
          transact with God; and it stirs more in the time of religious
          exercises, though it be in part mortified; as a wounded beast, though
          tired, will rage and strive to its utmost, when the enemy is about to
          fetch a blow at it. All duties of worship tend to the wounding of
          corruption; and it is no wonder to feel the striving of sin to defend
          itself and offend us, when we have our arms in our hands to mortify
          it, that the blow may be diverted which is directed against it. The
          apostles had aspiring thoughts; and being persuaded of an earthly
          kingdom, expected a grandeur in it; and though we find some appearance
          of it at other times, as when they were casting out devils, and gave
          an account of it to their Master, he gives them a kind of a check
          (Luke x. 20), intimating that there was some kind of evil in their
          rejoicing upon that account; yet this never swelled so high, as to
          break out into a quarrel who should be greatest, until they had the
          most solemn ordinance, the Lord’s supper, to quell it (Luke xxii. 24).
          Our corruption is like lime, which discovers not its fire by any smoke
          or heat, till you cast water, the enemy of fire, upon it; neither doth
          our natural corruption rage so much, as when we are using means to
          quench and destroy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) While there is a devil, and we in his precinct. As he accuseth us
          to God, so he disturbs us in ourselves; he is a bold spirit, and loves
          to intrude himself when we are conversing with God: we read, that when
          the angels presented themselves before God, Satan comes among them
          (Job i. 6). Motions from Satan will thrust themselves in with our most
          raised and angelical frames; he loves to take off the edge of our
          spirits from God; he acts but after the old rate; he from the first
          envied God an obedience from man, and envied man the felicity of
          communion with God; he is unwilling God should have the honor of
          worship, and that we should have the fruit of it; he hath himself lost
          it, and therefore is unwilling we should enjoy it; and being subtle,
          he knows how to make impressions upon us suitable to our inbred
          corruptions, and assault us in the weakest part. He knows all the
          avenues to get within us (as he did in the temptation of Eve), and
          being a spirit, he wants not a power to dart them immediately upon our
          fancy; and being a spirit, and therefore active and nimble, he can
          shoot those darts faster than our weakness can beat them off. He is
          diligent also, and watcheth for his prey, and seeks to devour our
          services as well as our souls, and snatch our best morsels from us. We
          know he mixed himself with our Saviour’s retirements in the
          wilderness, and endeavored to fly‑blow his holy converse with his
          Father in the preparation to his mediatory work. Satan is God’s ape,
          and imitates the Spirit in the office of a remembrancer; as the Spirit
          brings good thoughts and divine promises to mind, to quicken our
          worship, so the devil brings evil things to mind, and endeavors to
          fasten them in our souls to disturb us; and though all the foolish
          starts we have in worship are not purely his issue, yet being of kin
          to him, he claps his hands, and sets them on like so many mastiffs, to
          tear the service in pieces. And both those distractions, which arise
          from our own corruption and from Satan, are most rife in worship, when
          we are under some pressing affliction. This seems to be David’s case,
          Ps. lxxxvi. when in ver. 11 he prays God to unite his heart to fear
          and worship his name; he seems to be under some affliction, or fear of
          his enemies: “O free me from those distractions of spirit, and those
          passions which arise in my soul, upon considering the designs of my
          enemies against me, and press upon me in my addresses to thee, and
          attendances on thee.” Job also in his affliction complains (Job xvii.
          11) that “his purposes were broken off;” he could not make an even
          thread of thoughts and resolutions; they were frequently snapt
          asunder, like rotten yarn when one is winding it up. Good men and
          spiritual worshippers have lain under this trouble. Though they are a
          sign of weakness of grace, or some obstructions in the acting of
          strong grace, yet they are not alway evidences of a want of grace;
          what ariseth from our own corruption, is to be matter of humiliation
          and resistance; what ariseth from Satan, should edge our minds to a
          noble conquest of them. If the apostle did comfort himself with his
          disapproving of what rose from the natural spring of sin within him,
          with his consent to the law, and dissent from his lust; and charges it
          not upon himself, but upon the sin that dwelt in him, with which he
          had broken off the former league, and was resolved never to enter into
          amity with it; by the same reason we may comfort ourselves, if such
          thoughts are undelighted in, and alienate not our hearts from the
          worship of God by all their busy intrusions to interrupt us.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. These distractions (not allowed) may be occasions, by an holy
          improvement, to make our hearts more spiritual after worship, though
          they disturb us in it, by answering those ends for which we may
          suppose God permits them to invade us. And that is,
        </p>
        <p>First, When they are occasions to humble us,</p>
        <p>
          (1.) For our carriage in the particular worship. There is nothing so
          dangerous as spiritual pride; it deprived devils and men of the
          presence of God, and will hinder us of the influence of God. If we had
          had raised and uninterrupted motions in worship, we should be apt to
          be lifted up; and the devil stands ready to tempt us to
          self‑confidence. You know how it was with Paul (2 Cor. xii. 1‒7); his
          buffetings were occasions to render him more spiritual than his
          raptures, because more humble. God suffers those wanderings, starts,
          and distractions, to prevent our spiritual pride; which is as a worm
          at the root of spiritual worship, and mind us of the dusty frame of
          our spirits, how easily they are blown away; as he sends sickness to
          put us in mind of the shortness of our breath, and the easiness to
          lose it. God would make us ashamed of ourselves in his presence; that
          we may own, that what is good in any duty, is merely from his grace
          and Spirit, and not from ourselves; that with Paul we may cry out, “By
          grace we are what we are,” and by grace we do what we do; we may be
          hereby made sensible, that God can alway find something in our
          exactest worship, as a ground of denying us the successful fruit of
          it. If we cannot stand upon our duties for salvation, what can we
          bottom upon in ourselves? If therefore they are occasions to make us
          out of love with any righteousness of our own, to make us break our
          hearts for them, because we cannot keep them out; if we mourn for them
          as our sins, and count them our great afflictions, we have attained
          that brokenness which is a choice ingredient in a spiritual sacrifice.
          Though we have been disturbed by them, yet we are not robbed of the
          success; we may behold an answer of our worship in our humiliation, in
          spite of all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) For the baseness of our nature. These unsteady motions help us to
          discern that heap of vermin that breeds in our nature. Would any man
          think he had such an averseness to his Creator and Benefactor; such an
          unsuitableness to him; such an estrangedness from him, were it not for
          his inspection into his distracted frame? God suffers this to hang
          over us as a rod of correction, to discover and fetch out the folly of
          our hearts. Could we imagine our natures so highly contrary to that
          God who is so infinitely amiable, so desirable an object; or that
          there should be so much folly and madness in the heart, as to draw
          back from God in those services which God hath appointed as pipes
          through which to communicate his grace, to convey himself, his love
          and goodness to the creature? If, therefore, we have a deep sense of,
          and strong reflections upon our base nature, and bewail that mass of
          averseness which lies there, and that fulness of irreverence towards
          the God of our mercies, the object of our worship, it is a blessed
          improvement of our wanderings and diversions. Certainly, if any
          Israelite had brought a lame and rotten lamb to be sacrificed to God,
          and afterward had bewailed it, and laid open his heart to God in a
          sensible and humble confession of it, that repentance had been a
          better sacrifice, and more acceptable in the sight of God, than if he
          had brought a sound and a living offering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, When they are occasions to make us prize duties of worship.
          When we argue, as rationally we may, that they are of singular use,
          since our corrupt hearts and a malicious devil doth chiefly endeavor
          to hinder us from them, and that we find we have not those gadding
          thoughts when we are upon worldly business, or upon any sinful design
          which may dishonor God and wound our souls. This is a sign sin and
          Satan dislike worship, for he is too subtle a spirit to oppose that
          which would further his kingdom. As it is an argument the Scripture is
          the word of God, because the wickedness of the world doth so much
          oppose it, so it is a ground to believe the profitableness and
          excellency of worship, because Satan and our own unruly hearts do so
          much interrupt us in it: if, therefore, we make this use of our
          cross‑steps in worship, to have a greater value for such duties, more
          affections to them, and desires to be frequent in them, our hearts are
          growing spiritual under the weights that would depress them to
          carnality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, When we take a rise from hence, to have heavenly admirations
          of the graciousness of God, that he should pity and pardon so many
          slight addresses to him, and give any gracious returns to us. Though
          men have foolish rangings every day, and in every duty, yet free grace
          is so tender as not to punish them (Gen. viii. 21): “And the Lord
          smelt a sweet savor; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not curse
          the ground for man’s sake, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil
          from his youth.” It is observable, that this was just after a
          sacrifice which Noah offered to God (ver. 20): but probably not
          without infirmities common to human nature, which may be grounded upon
          the reason God gives, that though he had destroyed the earth before,
          because of the “evil of man’s imaginations” (Gen. vi. 5), he still
          found evil imaginations; he doth not say in the heart of Cham, or
          others of Noah’s family, but in man’s heart, including Noah also, who
          had both the judgments of God upon the former world, and the mercy of
          God in his own preservation, before his eyes; yet God saw evil
          imaginations rooted in the nature of man, and though it were so, yet
          he would be merciful. If, therefore, we can, after finding our hearts
          so vagrant in worship, have real frames of thankfulness that God hath
          spared us, and be heightened in our admirations at God’s giving us any
          fruit of such a distracted worship, we take advantage from them to be
          raised into an evangelical frame, which consists in the humble
          acknowledgments of the grace of God. When David takes a review of
          those tumultuous passions which had ruffled his mind, and possessed
          him with unbelieving notions of God in the persons of his prophets
          (Ps. cxvi. 11), how high doth his soul mount in astonishment and
          thankfulness to God for his mercy! (ver. 12.) Notwithstanding his
          distrust, God did graciously perform his promise, and answer his
          desire: then it is, “What shall I render to the Lord?” His heart was
          more affected for it, because it had been so passionate in former
          distrusts. It is indeed a ground of wondering at the patience of the
          Spirit of God, that he should guide our hearts when they are so apt to
          start out, as it is the patience of a master to guide the hand of his
          scholar, while he mixes his writing with many blots. It is not one or
          two infirmities the Spirit helps us in, and helps over, but many (Rom.
          viii. 26). It is a sign of a spiritual heart, when he can take a rise
          to bless God for the renewing and blowing up his affections, in the
          midst of so many incursions from Satan to the contrary, and the
          readiness of the heart too much to comply with them.

          Fourthly, When we take occasion from thence to prize the mediation of
          Christ. The more distractions jog us, the more need we should see of
          going out to a Saviour by faith. One part of our Saviour’s office is
          to stand between us and the infirmities of our worship. As he is an
          advocate, he presents our services, and pleads for them and us (1 John
          ii. 1), for the sins of our duties, as well as for our other sins.
          Jesus Christ is an High‑priest, appointed by God to take away the
          “iniquities of our holy things,” which was typified by Aaron’s plate
          upon his mitre (Exod. xxviii. 36, 38). Were there no imperfections,
          were there no creeping up of those frogs into our minds, we should
          think our worship might merit acceptance with God upon its own
          account; but if we behold our own weakness, that not a tear, a groan,
          a sigh, is so pure, but must have Christ to make it entertainable;
          that there is no worship without those blemishes; and upon this, throw
          all our services into the arms of Christ for acceptance, and solicit
          him to put his merits in the front, to make our ciphers appear
          valuable; it is a spiritual act, the design of God in the gospel being
          to advance the honor and mediation of his Son. That is a spiritual and
          evangelical act which answers the evangelical design. The design of
          Satan, and our own corruption is defeated, when those interruptions
          make us run swifter, and take faster hold on the High‑priest who is to
          present our worship to God, and our own souls receive comfort thereby.
          Christ had temptations offered to him by the devil in his wilderness
          retirement, that, from an experimental knowledge, he might be able
          more “compassionately to succor us” (Heb. ii. 18); we have such
          assaults in our retired worship especially, that we may be able more
          highly to value him and his mediation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Let us not, therefore, be discouraged by those interruptions and
          starts of our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          (1.) If we find in ourselves a strong resistance of them. The flesh
          will be lusting; that cannot be hindered; yet if we do not fulfil the
          lusts of it, rise up at its command, and go about its work, we may be
          said to walk in the Spirit (Gal. v. 16, 17): we “walk in the Spirit,”
          if we “fulfil not the lusts of the flesh,” though there be a lusting
          of the flesh against the Spirit; so we worship in the Spirit, though
          there be carnal thoughts arising if we do not fulfil them; though the
          stirring of them discovers some contrariety in us to God, yet the
          resistance manifests that there is a principle of contrariety in us to
          them; that as there is something of flesh that lusts against the
          spirit, so there is something of spirit in worship which lusts against
          the flesh: we must take heed of omitting worship, because of such
          inroads, and lying down in the mire of a total neglect. If our spirits
          are made more lively and vigorous against them; if those cold vapors
          which have risen from our hearts make us, like a spring in the midst
          of the cold earth, more warm, there is, in this case, more reason for
          us to bless God, than to be discouraged. God looks upon it as the
          disease, not the wilfulness of our nature; as the weakness of the
          flesh, not the willingness of the spirit. If we would shut the door
          upon them, it seems they are unwelcome company; men do not use to lock
          their doors upon those they love; if they break in and disturb us with
          their impertinences, we need not be discomforted, unless we give them
          a share in our affections, and turn our back upon God to entertain
          them; if their presence makes us sad, their flight would make us
          joyful.
        </p>
        <p>
          (2.) If we find ourselves excited to a stricter watch over our hearts
          against them; as travellers will be careful when they come to places
          where they have been robbed before, that they be not so easily
          surprised again. We should not only lament when we have had such
          foolish imaginations in worship breaking in upon us, but also bless
          God that we have had no more, since we have hearts so fruitful of
          weeds. We should give God the glory when we find our hearts preserved
          from these intruders, and not boast of ourselves, but return him our
          praise for the watch and guard he kept over us, to preserve us from
          such thieves. Let us not be discomforted; for as the greatness of our
          sins, upon our turning to God, is no hindrance to our justification,
          because it doth not depend upon our conversion as the meritorious
          cause, but upon the infinite value of our Saviour’s satisfaction,
          which reaches the greatest sins as well as the least; so the multitude
          of our bewailed distractions in worship are not a hindrance to our
          acceptation, because of the uncontrollable power of Christ’s
          intercession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use IV. is for exhortation. Since spiritual worship is due to God, and
          the Father seeks such to worship him, how much should we endeavor to
          satisfy the desire and order of God, and act conformable to the law of
          our creation and the love of redemption! Our end must be the same in
          worship which was God’s end in creation and redemption; to glorify his
          name, set forth his perfections, and be rendered fit, as creatures and
          redeemed ones, to partake of that grace which is the fruit of worship.
          An evangelical dispensation requires a spiritual homage; to neglect,
          therefore, either the matter or manner of gospel duties, is to put a
          slight upon gospel privileges. The manner of duty is ever of more
          value than the matter; the scarlet dye is more precious than the cloth
          tinctured with it. God respects more the disposition of the sacrificer
          than the multitude of the sacrifices.527 The solemn feasts appointed
          by God were but dung as managed by the Jews (Mal. ii. 3). The heart is
          often welcome without the body, but the body never grateful without
          the heart. The inward acts of the spirit require nothing from without
          to constitute them good in themselves; but the outward acts of
          devotion require inward acts to render them savory to God. As the
          goodness of outward acts consists not in the acts themselves, so the
          acceptableness of them results not from the acts themselves, but from
          the inward frame animating and quickening those acts, as blood and
          spirits running through the veins of a duty to make it a living
          service in the sight of God. Imperfections in worship hinder not God’s
          acceptation of it, if the heart, spirited by grace, be there to make
          it a sweet savor. The stench of burning flesh and fat in the legal
          sacrifices might render them noisome to the outward senses; but God
          smelt a sweet savor in them, as they respected Christ. When the heart
          and spirit are offered up to God, it may be a savory duty, though
          attended with unsavory imperfections; but a thousand sacrifices
          without a stamp of faith, a thousand spiritual duties with an habitual
          carnality, are no better than stench with God. The heart must be
          purged, as well as the temple was by our Saviour, of the thieves that
          would rob God of his due worship. Antiquity had some temples wherein
          it was a crime to bring any gold; therefore those that came to worship
          laid their gold aside before they went into the temple. We should lay
          aside our worldly and trading thoughts before we address to worship
          (Isa. xxvi. 9): “With my spirit within me will I seek thee early.” Let
          not our minds be gadding abroad, and exiled from God and themselves.
          It will be thus when the “desire of our soul is to his name, and the
          remembrance of him” (ver. 8). When he hath given so great and
          admirable a gift as that of his Son, in whom are all things necessary
          to salvation, righteousness, peace, and pardon of sin, we should
          manage the remembrance of his name in worship with the closest
          unitedness of heart, and the most spiritual affections. The motion of
          the spirit is the first act in religion; to this we are obliged in
          every act. The devil requires the spirit of his votaries; should God
          have a less dedication than the devil?
        </p>
        <p>Motives to back this exhortation.</p>
        <p>
          I. Not to give God our spirit is a great sin. It is a mockery of God,
          not worship, contempt, not adoration, whatever our outward fervency or
          protestations may be.528 Every alienation of our hearts from him is a
          real scorn put upon him. The acts of the soul are real, and more the
          acts of the man than the acts of the body; because they are the acts
          of the choicest part of man, and of that which is the first spring of
          all bodily motions; it is the λόγος ἐνδιάθετος, the internal speech
          whereby we must speak with God. To give him, therefore, only an
          external form of worship without the life of it, is a taking his name
          in vain. We mock him, when we mind not what we are speaking to him, or
          what he is speaking to us; when the motions of our hearts are contrary
          to the motions of our tongues; when we do anything before him
          slovenly, impudently, or rashly. As in a lutinist it is absurd to sing
          one tune and play another; so it is a foul thing to tell God one thing
          with our lips, and think another with our hearts. It is a sin like
          that the apostle chargeth the heathens with (Rom. i. 28): “They like
          not to retain God in their knowledge.” Their stomachs are sick while
          they are upon any duty, and never leave working till they have thrown
          up all the spiritual part of worship, and rid themselves of the
          thoughts of God, which are as unwelcome and troublesome guests to
          them. When men behave themselves in the sight of God, as if God were
          not God, they do not only defame him, but deny him, and violate the
          unchangeable perfections of the Divine nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It is against the majesty of God, when we have not awful thoughts
          of that great Majesty to whom we address; when our souls cleave not to
          him when we petition him in prayer, or when he gives out his orders to
          us in his Word. It is a contempt of the majesty of a prince, if,
          whilst he is speaking to us, we listen not to him with reverence and
          attention, but turn our backs on him, to play with one of his hounds,
          or talk with a beggar; or while we speak to him, to rake in a
          dunghill. Solomon adviseth us to “keep our foot when we go to the
          house of God” (Eccles. v. 1). Our affections should be steady, and not
          slip away again; why? (ver. 2) because “God is in heaven,” &amp;c. He
          is a God of majesty; earthly, dirty frames are unsuitable to the God
          of heaven; low spirits are unsuitable to the Most High. We would not
          bring our mean servants or dirty dogs into a prince’s presence
          chamber; yet we bring not only our worldly, but our profane affections
          into God’s presence. We give in this case those services to God which
          our Governor would think unworthy of him (Mal. i. 8). The more
          excellent and glorious God is, the greater contempt of him it is to
          suffer such foolish affections to be competitors with him for our
          hearts. It is a scorn put upon him to converse with a creature, while
          we are dealing with him; but a greater to converse in our thoughts and
          fancies with some sordid lust, which is most hateful to him; and the
          more aggravation it attracts, in that we are to apprehend him the most
          glorious object sitting upon his throne in time of worship, and
          ourselves standing as vile creatures before him, supplicating for our
          lives, and the conveyance of grace and mercy to our souls; as if a
          grand mutineer, instead of humbly begging the pardon of his offended
          prince, should present his petition not only scribbled and blotted,
          but besmeared with some loathsome excrement. It is unbecoming both the
          majesty of God, and the worship itself, to present him with a picture
          instead of a substance, and bring a world of nasty affections in our
          hearts, and ridiculous toys in our heads before him, and worship with
          indisposed and heedless souls. He is a great King (Mal. i. 14):
          therefore address to him with fear and reverence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It is against the life of God. Is a dead worship proportioned to a
          living God? The separation of heavenly affections from our souls
          before God, makes them as much a carcass in his sight, as the divorce
          of the soul makes the body a carcass. When the affections are
          separated, worship is no longer worship, but a dead offering, a
          lifeless bulk; for the essence and spirit of worship is departed.
          Though the soul be present with the body in a way of information, yet
          it is not present in a way of affection, and this is the worst; for it
          is not the separation of the soul from informing that doth separate a
          man from God, but the removal of our affections from him. If a man
          pretend an application to God, and sleep and snore all the time,
          without question such a one did not worship. In a careless worship the
          heart is morally dead while the eyes are open: the heart of the spouse
          (Cant. v. 2) waked while her eyes slept; and our hearts, on the
          contrary, sleep while our eyes wake. Our blessed Saviour hath died to
          purge our consciences from dead works and frames, that we may serve
          the living God (Heb. ix. 14); to serve God as a God of life. David’s
          soul cried and fainted for God under this consideration (Ps. xlii. 2);
          but to present our bodies without our spirits, is such a usage of God,
          that implies he is a dead image, not worthy of any but a dead and
          heartless service, like one of those idols the Psalmist speaks of (Ps.
          cxv. 5), that have “eyes, and see not; ears, and hear not;” no life in
          it. Though it be not an objective idolatry, because the worship is
          directed to the true God; yet I may call it a subjective idolatry in
          regard of the frame, fit only to be presented to some senseless stock.
          We intimate God to be no better than an idol, and to have no more
          knowledge of us and insight into us, than an idol can have. If we did
          believe him to be the living God, we durst not come before him with
          services so unsuitable to him, and reproaches of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It is against the infiniteness of God. We should worship God with
          those boundless affections which bear upon them a shadow or image of
          his infiniteness; such are the desires of the soul which know no
          limits, but start out beyond whatsoever enjoyment the heart of man
          possesses. No creeping creature was to be offered to God in sacrifice,
          but such as had legs to run, or wings to fly. For us to come before
          God with a light creeping frame, is to worship him with the lowest
          finite affections, as though anything, though never so mean or torn,
          might satisfy an infinite Being; as though a poor shallow creature
          could give enough to God without giving him the heart, when, indeed,
          we cannot give him a worship proportionable to his infiniteness, did
          our hearts swell as large as heaven in our desires for him in every
          act of our duties.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. It is against the spirituality of God. God being a Spirit, calls
          for a worship in spirit; to withhold this from him implies him to be
          some gross corporeal matter. As a Spirit, he looks for the heart; a
          wrestling heart in prayer, a trembling heart in the Word (Isa. lxvi.
          2). To bring nothing but the body when we come to a spiritual God to
          beg spiritual benefits, to wait for spiritual communications, which
          can only be dispensed to us in a spiritual manner, is unsuitable to
          the spiritual nature of God. A mere carnal service implicitly denies
          his spirituality, which requires of us higher engagements than mere
          corporeal ones. Worship should be rational, not an imaginative
          service, wherein is required the activity of our noblest faculties;
          and our fancy ought to have no share in it, but in subserviency to the
          more spiritual part of our soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. It is against the supremacy of God. As God is one and the only
          Sovereign; so our hearts should be one, cleaving wholly to him, and
          undivided from him. In pretending to deal with him, we acknowledge his
          deity and sovereignty; but in withholding our choicest faculties and
          affections from him, and the starting of our minds to vain objects, we
          intimate their equality with God, and their right as well as his to
          our hearts and affections. It is as if a princess should commit
          adultery with some base scullion while she is before her husband,
          which would be a plain denial of his sole right to her. It intimates
          that other things are superior to God; they are true sovereigns that
          engross our hearts. If a man were addressing himself to a prince, and
          should in an instant turn his back upon him, upon a beck or nod from
          some inconsiderable person; is it not an evidence that that person
          that invited him away hath a greater sovereignty over him than that
          prince to whom he was applying himself? And do we not discard God’s
          absolute dominion over us, when, at the least beck of a corrupt
          inclination, we can dispose of our hearts to it, and alienate them
          from God? as they, in Ezek. xxxiii. 32, left the service of God for
          the service of their covetousness, which evidenced that they owned the
          authority of sin more than the authority of God. This is not to serve
          God as our Lord and absolute Master, but to make God serve our turn,
          and submit his sovereignty to the supremacy of some unworthy
          affection. The creature is preferred before the Creator, when the
          heart runs most upon it in time of religious worship, and our own
          carnal interest swallows up the affections that are due to God. It is
          “an idol set up in the heart” (Ezek. xiv. 4) in his solemn presence,
          and attracts that devotion to itself which we only owe to our
          Sovereign Lord; and the more base and contemptible that is to which
          the spirit is devoted, the more contempt there is of God’s dominion.
          Judas’s kiss, with a “Hail Master!” was no act of worship, or an
          owning his Master’s authority, but a designing the satisfaction of his
          covetousness in the betraying of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. It is against the wisdom of God. God, as a God of order, has put
          earthly things in subordination to heavenly; and we, by this unworthy
          carriage, invert this order, and put heavenly things in subordination
          to earthly; in placing mean and low things in our hearts, and bringing
          them so placed into God’s presence, which his wisdom at the creation
          put under our feet. A service without spiritual affections is a
          “sacrifice of fools” (Eccles. v. 1), which have lost their brains and
          understandings: a foolish spirit is very unsuitable to an infinitely
          wise God. Well may God say of such a one, as Achish of David, who
          seemed mad, “Why have you brought this fellow to play the madman in my
          presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?” (1 Sam. xxi. 15.)
        </p>
        <p>
          7. It is against the omnisciency of God. To carry it fair without, and
          impertinently within, is as though God had not an all‑seeing eye that
          could pierce into the heart, and understand every motion of the inward
          faculties; as though God were easily cheated with an outward fawning
          service, like an apothecary’s box with a gilded title, that may be
          full of cobwebs within. What is such a carriage, but a design to
          deceive God, when, with Herod, we pretend to worship Christ, and
          intend to murder all the motions of Christ in our souls? A heedless
          spirit, an estrangement of our souls, a giving the reins to them to
          run out from the presence of God to see every reed shaken with the
          wind, is to deny him to be the Searcher of hearts, and the Discerner
          of secret thoughts; as though he could not look through us to the
          darkness and remoteness of our minds, but were an ignorant God, who
          might be put off with the worst as well as the best in our flock. If
          we did really believe there were a God of infinite knowledge, who saw
          our frames and whether we came dressed with wedding garments suitable
          to the duties we are about to perform, should we be so garish, and put
          him off with such trivial stuff, without any reverence of his Majesty?
        </p>
        <p>
          8. It is against the holiness of God. To alienate our spirits is to
          offend him while we pretend to worship him; though we may be mighty
          officious in the external part, yet our base and carnal affections
          make all our worship but as a heap of dung; and who would not look
          upon it as an affront to lay dung before a prince’s throne? (Prov.
          xxi. 27), “The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;” how much
          more when he brings it with a wicked mind? A putrefied carcass under
          the law had not been so great an affront to the holiness of God, as a
          frothy unmelted heart, and a wanton fancy, in a time of worship. God
          is so holy, that if we could offer the worship of angels, and the
          quintessence of our souls in his service, it would be beneath his
          infinite purity; how unworthy, then, are they of him, when they are
          presented not only without the sense of our uncleanness, but sullied
          with the fumes and exhalations of our corrupt affections, which are as
          so many plague‑spots upon our duties, contrary to the unspotted purity
          of the Divine nature? Is not this an unworthy conceit of God, and
          injurious to his infinite holiness?
        </p>
        <p>
          9. It is against the love and kindness of God. It is a condescension
          in God to admit a piece of earth to offer up a duty to him, when he
          hath myriads of angels to attend him in his court, and celebrate his
          praise. To admit man to be an attendant on him, and a partner with
          angels, is a high favor. It is not a single mercy, but a heap of
          mercies, to be admitted into the presence of God (Ps. v. 7): “I will
          come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercies.” When the blessed
          God is so kind as to give us access to his majesty, do we not
          undervalue his kindness when we deal uncivilly with him, and deny him
          the choicest part of ourselves? It is a contempt of his sovereignty,
          as our spirits are due to him by nature; a contempt of his goodness,
          as our spirits are due to him by gratitude. How abusive a carriage is
          it to make use of his mercy to encourage our impudence, that should
          excite our fear and reverence! How unworthy would it be for an
          indigent debtor to bring to his indulgent creditor an empty purse
          instead of payment! When God holds out his golden sceptre to encourage
          our approaches to him, stands ready to give us the pardon of sin and
          full felicity, the best things he hath, is it a fit requital of his
          kindness to give him a formal outside only, a shadow of religion; to
          have the heart overswayed with other thoughts and affections, as if
          all his proffers were so contemptible as to deserve only a slight at
          our hands? It is a contempt of the love and kindness of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. It is against the sufficiency and fulness of God. When we give God
          our bodies, and the creature our spirits, it intimates a conceit that
          there is more content to be had in the creature than in God blessed
          forever; that the waters in the cistern are sweeter than those in the
          fountain. Is not this a practical giving God the lie, and denying
          those promises wherein he hath declared the satisfaction he can give
          to the spirit, as he is the God of the spirits of all flesh? If we did
          imagine the excellency and loveliness of God were worthy to be the
          ultimate object of our affections, the heart would attend more closely
          upon him, and be terminated in him; did we believe God to be
          all‑sufficient, full of grace and goodness, a tender Father, not
          willing to forsake his own, willing, as well as able, to supply their
          wants, the heart would not so lamely attend upon him, and would not
          upon every impertinency be diverted from him. There is much of a wrong
          notion of God, and a predominancy of the world above him in the heart,
          when we can more savorly relish the thoughts of low inferior things
          than heavenly, and let our spirits upon every trifling occasion be
          fugitive from him; it is a testimony that we make not God our chiefest
          good. If apprehensions of his excellency did possess our souls, they
          would be fastened on him, glued to him; we should not listen to that
          rabble of foolish thoughts that steal our hearts so often from him.
          Were our breathings after God as strong as the pantings of the hart
          after the water‑brooks, we should be like that creature, not diverted
          in our course by every puddle. Were God the predominant satisfactory
          object in our eye, he would carry our whole soul along with him. When
          our spirits readily retreat from God in worship upon every giddy
          motion, it is a kind of repentance that ever we did come near him, and
          implies that there is a fuller satisfaction, and more attractive
          excellency in that which doth so easily divert us, than in that God to
          whose worship we did pretend to address ourselves. It is as if, when
          we are petitioning a prince, we should immediately turn about, and
          make request to one of his guard, as though so mean a person were more
          able to give us the boon we want than the sovereign is.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Consideration by way of motive. To have our spirits off from God
          in worship is a bad sign: it was not so in innocence. The heart of
          Adam could cleave to God: the law of God was engraven upon him, he
          could apply himself to the fulfilling of it without any twinkling.
          There was no folly and vanity in his mind, no independency in his
          thoughts, no duty was his burden; for there was in him a proneness to,
          and a delight in, all the duties of worship. It is the fall hath
          distempered us; and the more unwieldiness there is in our spirits, the
          more carnal our affections are in worship, the more evidence there is
          of the strength of that revolted state.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It argues much corruption in the heart. As by the eructations of
          the stomach, we may judge of the windiness and foulness of it; so, by
          the inordinate motions of our minds and hearts, we may judge of the
          weakness of its complexion. A strength of sin is evidenced by the
          eruptions and ebullitions of it in worship, when they are more sudden,
          numerous, and vigorous than the motions of grace. When the heart is
          apt, like tinder, to catch fire from Satan, it is a sign of much
          combustible matter suitable to his temptation. Were not corruption
          strong, the soul could not turn so easily from God when it is in his
          presence, and hath an advantageous opportunity to create a fear and
          awe of God in it. Such base fruit could not sprout up so suddenly,
          were there not much sap and juice in the root of sin. What communion
          with a living root can be evidenced without exercises of an inward
          life? That spirit, which is a well of living waters in a gracious
          heart, will be especially springing up when it is before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It shows much affection to earthly things, and little to heavenly.
          There must needs be an inordinate affection to earthly things, when,
          upon every slight solicitation, we can part with God, and turn the
          back upon a service glorious for him and advantageous for ourselves,
          to wed our hearts to some idle fancy that signifies nothing. How can
          we be said to entertain God in our affections, when we give him not
          the precedency in our understandings, but let every trifle jostle the
          sense of God out of our minds? Were our hearts fully determined to
          spiritual things, such vanities could not seat themselves in our
          understandings, and divide our spirits from God. Were our hearts
          balanced with a love to God, the world could never steal our hearts so
          much from his worship, but his worship would draw our hearts to it. It
          shows a base neutrality in the greatest concernments; a halting
          between God and Baal; a contrariety between affection and conscience,
          when natural conscience presses a man to duties of worship, and his
          other affections pull him back, draw him to carnal objects, and make
          him slight that whereby he may honor God. God argues the profaneness
          of the Jews’ hearts from the wickedness they brought into his house,
          and acted there (Jer. xxiii. 11): “Yea, in my house,” that is, my
          worship, “I found their wickedness,” saith the Lord. Carnality in
          worship is a kind of an idolatrous frame; when the heart is renewed,
          idols are cast to the moles and the bats (Isa. ii. 20).
        </p>
        <p>
          3. It shows much hypocrisy to have our spirits off from God. The mouth
          speaks, and the carriage pretends what the heart doth not think; there
          is a dissent of the heart from the pretence of the body. Instability
          is a sure sign of hypocrisy. Double thoughts argue a double heart. The
          wicked are compared to chaff (Ps. i. 4), for the uncertain and various
          motions of their minds, by the least wind of fancy. The least motion
          of a carnal object diverts the spirit from God, as the scent of
          carrion doth the raven from the flight it was set upon. The people of
          God are called God’s spouse, and God calls himself their husband;
          whereby is noted the most intimate union of the soul with God; and
          that there ought to be the highest love and affection to him, and
          faithfulness in his worship; but when the heart doth start from him in
          worship, it is a sign of the unsteadfastness of it with God, and a
          disrelish of any communion with him; it is, as God complains of the
          Israelites, a going a whoring after our own imaginations. As grace
          respects God as the object of worship, so it looks most upon God in
          approaching to him. Where there is a likeness and love, there is a
          desire of converse and intimacy; if there be no spiritual entwining
          about God in our worship, it is a sign there is no likeness to him, no
          true sense of him, no renewed image of God in us; every living image
          will move strongly to join itself with its original copy, and be glad,
          with Jacob, to sit steadily in those chariots that shall convey him to
          his beloved Joseph.
        </p>
        <p>III. Consider the danger of a carnal worship.</p>
        <p>
          1. We lose the comfort of worship. The soul is a great gainer when it
          offers a spiritual worship, and as great a loser when it is unfaithful
          with God. Treachery and perfidiousness hinder commerce among men; so
          doth hypocrisy in its own nature communion with God. God never
          promised anything to the carcass, but to the spirit of worship. God
          hath no obligation upon him, by any word of his, to reward us with
          himself, when we perform it not to himself; when we give an outside
          worship, we have only the outside of an ordinance; we can expect no
          kernel, when we give God only the shell: he that only licks the
          outside of the glass, can never be refreshed with the rich cordial
          enclosed within. A cold and lazy formality will make God to withdraw
          the light of his countenance, and not shine with any delightful
          communications upon our souls; but if we come before him with a
          liveliness of affections, and steadiness of heart, he will draw the
          veil, and cause his glory to display itself before us. An humble
          praying Christian, and a warm, affectionate Christian in worship, will
          soon find a God who is delighted with such frames, and cannot long
          withhold himself from the soul. When our hearts are inflamed with love
          to him in worship, it is a preparation to some act of love on his
          part, whereby he intends further to gratify us. When John was in the
          Spirit on the Lord’s day, that is, in spiritual employment, and
          meditation, and other duties, he had that great revelation of what
          should happen to the church in all ages (Rev. i. 10); his being in the
          Spirit, intimates his ordinary course on that day, and not any
          extraordinary act in him, though it was followed with an extraordinary
          discovery of God to him; when he was thus engaged, “he heard a voice
          behind him.” God doth not require of us spirituality in worship to
          advantage himself, but that we might be prepared to be advantaged by
          him. If we have a clear and well‑disposed eye, it is not a benefit to
          the sun, but fits us to receive benefits from his beams. Worship is an
          act that perfects our own souls; they are then most widened by
          spiritual frames, to receive the influence of divine blessings, as an
          eye most opened receives the fruit of the sun’s light better than the
          eye that is shut. The communications of God are more or less,
          according as our spiritual frames are more or less in our worship; God
          will not give his blessings to unsuitable hearts. What a nasty vessel
          is a carnal heart for a spiritual communication! The chief end of
          every duty enjoined by God, is to have communion with him; and
          therefore it is called a drawing near to God; it is impossible,
          therefore, that the outward part of any duty can answer the end of God
          in his institution. It is not a bodily appearance or gesture whereby
          men can have communion with God, but by the impressions of the heart,
          and reflections of the heart upon God; without this, all the rich
          streams of grace will run beside us, and the growth of the soul be
          hindered and impaired. A “diligent hand makes rich,” saith the wise
          man; a diligent heart in spiritual worship, brings in rich incomes to
          the humble and spiritual soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. It renders the worship not only unacceptable, but abominable to
          God. It makes our gold to become dross, it soils our duties, and
          bespots our souls. A carnal and unsteady frame shows an indifferency
          of spirit at best; and lukewarmness is as ungrateful to God, as heavy
          and nauseous meat is to the stomach; he “spews them out of his mouth”
          (Rev. iii. 16). As our gracious God doth overlook infirmities where
          intentions are good, and endeavors serious and strong; so he loathes
          the services where the frames are stark naught (Ps. lxvi. 18): “If I
          regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.”
          Lukewarm and indifferent services stink in the nostrils of God. The
          heart seems to loathe God when it starts from him upon every occasion,
          when it is unwilling to employ itself about, and stick close to him:
          and can God be pleased with such a frame? The more of the heart and
          spirit is in any service, the more real goodness there is in it, and
          the more savory it is to God; the less of the heart and spirit, the
          less of goodness, and the more nauseous to God, who loves
          righteousness and “truth in the inward parts” (Ps. li. 6). And
          therefore infinite goodness and holiness cannot but hate worship
          presented to him with deceitful, carnal, and flitting affections; they
          must be more nauseous to God, than a putrefied carcass can be to man;
          they are the profanings of that which should be the habitation of the
          Spirit; they make the spirit, the seat of duty, a filthy dunghill; and
          are as loathsome to God, as money‑changers in the temple were to our
          Saviour. We see the evil of carnal frames, and the necessity and
          benefit of spiritual frames: for further help in this last, let us
          practise these following directions:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Keep up spiritual frames out of worship. To avoid low affections,
          we must keep our hearts as much as we can in a settled elevation. If
          we admit unworthy dispositions at one time, we shall not easily be rid
          of them in another;529 as he that would not be bitten with gnats in
          the night, must keep his windows shut in the day: when they are once
          entered, it is not easy to expel them; in which respect, one adviseth
          to be such out of worship as we would be in worship. If we mix
          spiritual affections with our worldly employments, worldly affections
          will not mingle themselves so easily with our heavenly engagements. If
          our hearts be spiritual in our outward calling, they will scarce be
          carnal in our religious service. If “we walk in the Spirit, we shall
          not fulfil the lusts of the flesh” (Gal. v. 16). A spiritual walk in
          the day will hinder carnal lustings in worship. The fire was to be
          kept alive upon the altar, when sacrifices were not offered, from
          morning till night, from night till morning, as well as in the very
          time of sacrifice. A spiritual life and vigor out of worship would
          render it at its season sweet and easy, and preserve a spontaneity and
          preparedness to it, and make it both natural and pleasant to us.
          Anything that doth unhinge and discompose our spirits, is inconsistent
          with religious services, which are to be performed with the greatest
          sedateness and gravity. All irregular passions disturb the serenity of
          the spirit, and open the door for Satan: saith the apostle (Eph. iv.
          26, 27), “Let not the sun go down upon your wrath; neither give place
          to the devil.” Where wrath breaks the lock, the devil will quickly be
          over the threshold; and though they be allayed, yet they leave the
          heart sometime after, like the sea rolling and swelling after the
          storm is ceased. Mixture with ill company leaves a tincture upon us in
          worship. Ephraim’s allying himself with the Gentiles, bred an
          indifferency in religion (Hos. vii. 8): “Ephraim hath mixed himself
          with the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned:” it will make our
          hearts, and consequently our services, half dough, as well as half
          baked; these and the like, make the Holy Spirit withdraw himself, and
          then the soul is like a wind‑bound vessel, and can make no way. When
          the sun departs from us, it carries its beams away with it; then “doth
          darkness spread itself over the earth, and the beasts of the forests
          creep out” (Ps. civ. 20). When the Spirit withdraws awhile from a good
          man, it carries away (though not habitual, yet) much of the exciting
          and assisting grace; and then carnal dispositions perk up themselves
          from the bosom of natural corruption. To be spiritual in worship, we
          must bar the door at other times against that which is contrary to it;
          as he that would not be infected with a contagious disease, carries
          some preservative about with him, and inures himself to good scents.
          To this end, be much in secret ejaculations to God; these are the
          purest nights of the soul, that have more of fervor and less of
          carnality; they preserve a liveliness in the spirit, and make it more
          fit to perform solemn stated worship with greater freedom and
          activity; a constant use of this would make our whole lives, lives of
          worship. As frequent sinful acts strengthen habits of sin, so frequent
          religious acts strengthen habits of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Excite and exercise particularly a love to God, and dependence on
          him. Love is a commanding affection, a uniting grace; it draws all the
          faculties of the soul to one centre. The soul that loves God, when it
          hath to do with him, is bound to the beloved object; it can mind
          nothing else during such impressions. When the affection is set to the
          worship of God, everything the soul hath will be bestowed upon it; as
          David’s disposition was to the temple (1 Chron. xxix. 3). Carnal
          frames, like the fowls, will be lighting upon the sacrifice, but not
          when it is inflamed; though the scent of the flesh invite them, yet
          the heat of the fire drives them to their distance. A flaming love
          will singe the flies that endeavor to interrupt and disturb us. The
          happiness of heaven consists in a full attraction of the soul to God,
          by his glorious influence upon it; there will be such a diffusion of
          his goodness throughout the souls of the blessed, as will unite the
          affections perfectly to him; these affections which are scattered
          here, will be there gathered into one flame, moving to him, and
          centering in him: therefore, the more of a heavenly frame possesses
          our affections here, the more settled and uniform will our hearts be
          in all their motions to God, and operations about him. Excite a
          dependence on him: (Prov. xvi. 3) “Commit thy works to the Lord, and
          thy thoughts shall be established.” Let us go out in God’s strength,
          and not in our own; vain is the help of man in anything, and vain is
          the help of the heart. It is through God only we can do valiantly in
          spiritual concerns as well as temporal; the want of this makes but
          slight impressions upon the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Nourish right conceptions of the majesty of God in your minds. Let
          us consider that we are drawing to God, the most amiable object, the
          best of beings, worthy of infinite honor, and highly meriting the
          highest affections we can give; a God that made the world by a word,
          that upholds the great frame of heaven and earth; a Majesty above the
          conceptions of angels; who uses not his power to strike us to our
          deserved punishment, but his love and bounty to allure us; a God that
          gave all the creatures to serve us, and can, in a trice, make them as
          much our enemies as he hath now made them our servants. Let us view
          him in his greatness, and in his goodness, that our hearts may have a
          true value of the worship of so great a majesty, and count it the most
          worthy employment with all diligence to attend upon him. When we have
          a fear of God, it will make our worship serious; when we have a joy in
          God, it will make our worship durable. Our affections will be raised
          when we represent God in the most reverential, endearing, and obliging
          circumstances. We honor the majesty of God, when we consider him with
          due reverence according to the greatness and perfection of his works,
          and in this reverence of his majesty doth worship chiefly consist. Low
          thoughts of God will make low frames in us before him. If we thought
          God an infinite glorious Spirit, how would our hearts be lower than
          our knees in his presence! How humbly, how believingly pleading is the
          Psalmist, when he considers God to be without comparison in the
          heavens; to whom none of the sons of the mighty can be likened; when
          there was none like to him in strength and faithfulness round about
          (Ps. lxxxix 6‒8). We should have also deep impressions of the
          omniscience of God, and remember we have to deal with a God that
          searcheth the heart and trieth the reins, to whom the most secret
          temper is as visible as the loudest words are audible; that though man
          judges by outward expressions, God judges by inward affections. As the
          law of God regulates the inward frames of the heart, so the eye of God
          pitches upon the inward intentions of the soul. If God were visibly
          present with us, should we not approach to him with strong affections,
          summon our spirits to attend upon him, behave ourselves modestly
          before him? Let us consider he is as really present with us, as if he
          were visible to us; let us, therefore, preserve a strong sense of the
          presence of God. No man, but one out of his wits, when he were in the
          presence of a prince, and making a speech to him, would break off at
          every period, and run after the catching of butterflies. Remember in
          all worship you are before the Lord, to whom all things are open and
          naked.

          4. Let us take heed of inordinate desires after the world. As the
          world steals away a man’s heart from the word, so it doth from all
          other worship; “It chokes the word” (Matt. xiii. 27); it stifles all
          the spiritual breathings after God in every duty; the edge of the soul
          is blunted by it, and made too dull for such sublime exercises. The
          apostle’s rule in prayer, when he joins “sobriety with watching unto
          prayer” (1 Pet. iv. 7), is of concern in all worship, sobriety in the
          pursuit and use of all worldly things. A man drunk with worldly fumes
          cannot watch, cannot be heavenly, affectionate, spiritual in service.
          There is a magnetic force in the earth to hinder our flights to
          heaven. Birds, when they take their first flights from the earth, have
          more flutterings of their wings, than when they are mounted further in
          the air, and got more without the sphere of the earth’s
          attractiveness: the motion of their wings is more steady, that you can
          perceive them stir; they move like a ship with a full gale. The world
          is a clog upon the soul, and a bar to spiritual frames; it is as hard
          to elevate the heart to God in the midst of a hurry of worldly
          affairs, as it is difficult to meditate when we are near a great noise
          of waters falling from a precipice, or in the midst of a volley of
          muskets. Thick clayey affections bemire the heart, and make it unfit
          for such high flights it is to take in worship; therefore, get your
          hearts clear from worldly thoughts and desires, if you would be more
          spiritual in worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Let us be deeply sensible of our present wants, and the supplies we
          may meet with in worship. Cold affections to the things we would have
          will grow cooler; weakness of desire for the communications in
          worship, will freeze our hearts at the time of worship, and make way
          for vain and foolish diversions. A beggar that is ready to perish, and
          knows he is next door to ruin, will not slightly and dully beg an
          alms, and will not be diverted from his importunity by every slight
          call, or the moving of an atom in the air. Is it pardon we would have?
          let us apprehend the blackness of sin, with the aggravations of it as
          it respects God; let us be deeply sensible of the want of pardon and
          worth of mercy, and get your affections into such a frame as a
          condemned man would do; let us consider, that as we are now at the
          throne of God’s grace, we shall shortly be at the bar of God’s
          justice; and if the soul should be forlorn there, how fixedly and
          earnestly would it plead for mercy! Let us endeavor to stir up the
          same affections now, which we have seen some dying men have, and which
          we suppose despairing souls would have done at God’s tribunal. We must
          be sensible that the life or death of our souls depends upon
          worship.530 Would we not be ashamed to be ridiculous in our carriage
          while we are eating; and shall we not be ashamed to be cold or garish
          before God, when the salvation of our souls, as well as the honor of
          God, is concerned? If we did see the heaps of sins, the eternity of
          punishment due to them; if we did see an angry and offended Judge; if
          we did see the riches of mercy, the glorious outgoings of God in the
          sanctuary, the blessed doles he gives out to men when they spiritually
          attend upon him, both the one and the other would make us perform our
          duties humbly, sincerely, earnestly, and affectionately, and wait upon
          him with our whole souls, to have misery averted, and mercy bestowed.
          Let our sense of this be encouraged by the consideration of our
          Saviour presenting his merits; with what affection doth he present his
          merits, his blood shed upon the cross, now in heaven? And shall our
          hearts be cold and frozen, flitting and unsteady, when his affections
          are so much concerned? Christ doth not present any man’s case and
          duties without a sense of his wants; and shall we have none of our
          own? Let me add this; let us affect our hearts with a sense of what
          supplies we have met with in former worship; the delightful
          remembrance of what converse we have had with God in former worship
          would spiritualize our hearts for the present worship. Had Peter had a
          view of Christ’s glory in the mount fresh in his thoughts, he would
          not so easily have turned his back upon his Master, nor would the
          Israelites have been at leisure for their idolatry, had they preserved
          the sense of the majesty of God discovered in his late thunders from
          Mount Sinai.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. If anything intrudes that may choke the worship, cast it speedily
          out. We cannot hinder Satan and our own corruption from presenting
          coolers to us, but we may hinder the success of them; we cannot hinder
          the gnats from buzzing about us when we are in our business, but we
          may prevent them from settling upon us. A man that is running on a
          considerable errand, will shun all unnecessary discourse, that may
          make him forget or loiter in his business. What though there may be
          something offered that is good in itself, yet if it hath a tendency to
          despoil God of his honor, and ourselves of the spiritual intentness in
          worship, send it away. Those that weed a field of corn, examine not
          the nature and particular virtues of the weeds, but consider only how
          they choke the corn, to which the native juice of the soil is
          designed. Consider what you are about; and if anything interpose that
          may divert you, or cool your affections in your present worship, cast
          it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. As to private worship, let us lay hold of the most melting
          opportunities and frames. When we find our hearts in a more than
          ordinary spiritual frame, let us look upon it as a call from God to
          attend him; such impressions and notions are God’s voice, inviting us
          into communion with him in some particular act of worship, and
          promising us some success in it. When the Psalmist had a secret motion
          to “seek God’s face” (Ps. xxvii. 8), and complied with it, the issue
          is the encouragement of his heart, which breaks out into an
          exhortation to others to be of good courage, and wait on the Lord (v.
          13, 14): “Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall
          strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.” One blow will do more
          on the iron when it is hot, than a hundred when it is cold; melted
          metals may be stamped with any impression; but, once hardened, will
          with difficulty be brought into the figure we intend.531
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Let us examine ourselves at the end of every act of worship, and
          chide ourselves for any carnality we perceive in them. Let us take a
          review of them, and examine the reason, why art thou so low and
          carnal, O my soul? as David did of his disquietedness (Ps. xlii. 5):
          “Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within
          me?” If any unworthy frames have surprised us in worship, let us seek
          them out after worship; call them to the bar; make an exact scrutiny
          into the causes of them, that we may prevent their incursions another
          time; let our pulses beat quick by way of anger and indignation
          against them; this would be a repairing what hath been amiss;
          otherwise they may grow, and clog an after‑worship more than they did
          a former. Daily examination is an antidote against the temptations of
          the following day, and constant examination of ourselves after duty is
          a preservative against vain encroachments in following duties; and
          upon the finding them out, let us apply the blood of Christ by faith
          for our cure, and draw strength from the death of Christ for the
          conquest of them, and let us also be humbled for them. God lifts up
          the humble; when we are humbled for our carnal frames in one duty, we
          shall find ourselves by the grace of God more elevated in the next.
