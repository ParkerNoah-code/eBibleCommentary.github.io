          1. Now all these [heretics] are of much later date than the bishops to
          whom the apostles committed the Churches; which fact I have in the
          third book taken all pains to demonstrate. It follows, then, as a
          matter of course, that these heretics aforementioned, since they are
          blind to the truth, and deviate from the [right] way, will walk in
          various roads; and therefore the footsteps of their doctrine are
          scattered here and there without agreement or connection. But the path
          of those belonging to the Church circumscribes the whole world, as
          possessing the sure tradition from the apostles, and gives unto us to
          see that the faith of all is one and the same, since all receive one
          and the same God the Father, and believe in the same dispensation
          regarding the incarnation of the Son of God, and are cognizant of the
          same gift of the Spirit, and are conversant with the same
          commandments, and preserve the same form of ecclesiastical
          constitution, and expect the same advent of the Lord, and await the
          same salvation of the complete man, that is, of the soul and body. And
          undoubtedly the preaching of the Church is true and stedfast, in which
          one and the same way of salvation is shown throughout the whole world.
          For to her is entrusted the light of God; and therefore the "wisdom"
          of God, by means of which she saves all men, "is declared in [its]
          going forth; it uttereth [its voice] faithfully in the streets, is
          preached on the tops of the walls, and speaks continually in the gates
          of the city." For the Church preaches the truth everywhere, and she is
          the seven-branched candlestick which bears the light of Christ.

          2. Those, therefore, who desert the preaching of the Church, call in
          question the knowledge of the holy presbyters, not taking into
          consideration of how much greater consequence is a religious man, even
          in a private station, than a blasphemous and impudent sophist. Now,
          such are all the heretics, and those who imagine that they have hit
          upon something more beyond the truth, so that by following those
          things already mentioned, proceeding on their way variously,
          inharmoniously, and foolishly, not keeping always to the same opinions
          with regard to the same things, as blind men are led by the blind,
          they shall deservedly fall into the ditch of ignorance lying in their
          path, ever seeking and never finding out the truth. It behoves us,
          therefore, to avoid their doctrines, and to take careful heed lest we
          suffer any injury from them; but to flee to the Church, and be brought
          up in her bosom, and be nourished with the Lord's Scriptures. For the
          Church has been planted as a garden (paradisus) in this world;
          therefore says the Spirit of God, "Thou mayest freely eat from every
          tree of the garden," that is, Eat ye from every Scripture of the Lord;
          but ye shall not eat with an uplifted mind, nor touch any heretical
          discord. For these men do profess that they have themselves the
          knowledge of good and evil; and they set their own impious minds above
          the God who made them. They therefore form opinions on what is beyond
          the limits of the understanding. For this cause also the apostle says,
          "Be not wise beyond what it is fitting to be wise, but be wise
          prudently," that we be not cast forth by eating of the "knowledge" of
          these men (that knowledge which knows more than it should do) from the
          paradise of life. Into this paradise the Lord has introduced those who
          obey His call, "summing up in Himself all things which are in heaven,
          and which are on earth;" but the things in heaven are spiritual, while
          those on earth constitute the dispensation in human nature (secundum
          hominem est dispositio). These things, therefore, He recapitulated in
          Himself: by uniting man to the Spirit, and causing the Spirit to dwell
          in man, He is Himself made the head of the Spirit, and gives the
          Spirit to be the head of man: for through Him (the Spirit) we see, and
          hear, and speak.<br />
