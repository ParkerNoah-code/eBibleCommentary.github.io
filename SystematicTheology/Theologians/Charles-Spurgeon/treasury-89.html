</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">TITLE. A Prayer of David. </p>
<p align="justify">We have here one of the five psalms entitled Tephillahs 
    or prayers. This psalm consists of praise as well as prayer, but it is in 
    all parts so directly addressed to God that it is most fitly called "a 
    prayer." A prayer is none the less but all the more a prayer because veins 
    of praise run through it. This psalm would seem to have been specially known 
    as David's prayer; even as the ninetieth is "the prayer of Moses." David 
    composed it, and no doubt often expressed himself in similar language; both 
    the matter and the wording are suitable to his varied circumstances and 
    expressive of the different characteristics of his mind. In many respects it 
    resembles Psalm 17:1-15, which bears the same title, but in other aspects it 
    is very different; the prayers of a good man have a family likeness, but 
    they vary as much as they agree. We may learn from the present psalm that 
    the great saints of old were accustomed to pray very much in the same 
    fashion as we do; believers in all ages are of one genus. The name of God 
    occurs very frequently in this psalm, sometimes it is Jehovah, but more 
    commomly Adonai, which it is believed by many learned scholars was written 
    by the Jewish transcribers instead of the sublimer title, because their 
    superstitious dread led them to do so: we, laboring under no such tormenting 
    fear, rejoice in Jehovah, our God. It is singular that those who were so 
    afraid of their God, that they dared not write his name, had yet so little 
    godly fear, that they dared to alter his word.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Bow down your ear, O Lord, hear me.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">In condescension to my littleness, and in pity to my 
    weakness, "bow down your ear, O Lord." When our prayers are lowly by reason 
    of our humility, or feeble by reason of our sickness, or without wing by 
    reason of our despondency, the Lord will bow down to them, the infinitely 
    exalted Jehovah will have respect unto them. Faith, when she has the 
    loftiest name of God on her tongue, and calls him Jehovah—yet dares to ask 
    from him the most tender and condescending acts of love. <i>Great as he is 
    he loves his children to be bold with him. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For I am poor and needy.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Doubly a son of poverty, because, first, poor and without 
    supply for my needs, and next needy, and so full of wants, though unable to 
    supply them. Our distress is a forcible reason for our being heard by the 
    Lord God, merciful, and gracious, for <i>misery is ever the master argument 
    with mercy</i>. Such reasoning as this would never be adopted by a proud 
    man, and when we hear it repeated in the public congregation by those great 
    ones of the earth who count the peasantry to be little better than the earth 
    they tread upon, it sounds like a mockery of the Most High. <i>Of all 
    despicable sinners those are the worst who use the language of spiritual 
    poverty while they think themselves to be rich and increased in goods.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. Preserve my soul.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let my life be safe from my enemies, and my spiritual 
    nature be secure from their temptations. <i>He feels himself unsafe except 
    he be covered by the divine protection. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For I am holy. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">I am set apart for holy uses, therefore do not let your 
    enemies commit a sacrilege by injuring or defiling me. I am clear of the 
    crimes laid to my charge, and in that sense innocent; therefore, I beseech 
    you, do not allow me to suffer from unjust charges. I am inoffensive, meek, 
    and gentle towards others, therefore deal mercifully with me as I have dealt 
    with my fellow men. </p>
<p align="justify">Any of these renderings may explain the text, perhaps all 
    together will expound it best. It is not self-righteous in godly men to 
    plead their innocence as a reason for escaping from the results of sins 
    wrongfully ascribed to them; penitents do not bedaub themselves with mire 
    for the love of it, or make themselves out to be worse than they are out of 
    compliment to Heaven. No, the humblest saint is not a fool, and he is as 
    well aware of the matters wherein he is clear as of those wherein he must 
    cry "peccavi." To plead guilty to offences we have never committed, is as 
    great a lie as the denial of our real faults. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O you my God, save your servant that trusts in you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Lest any man should suppose that David trusted in his own 
    holiness he immediately declared his trust in the Lord, and begged to be 
    saved as one who was not holy in the sense of being perfect—but was even yet 
    in need of the very elements of salvation. How sweet is that title, "my 
    God", when joined to the other, "your servant"; and how sweet is the hope 
    that on this ground we shall be saved; seeing that our God is not like the 
    Amalekitish master who left his poor sick servant to perish. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Be merciful unto me, O Lord. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The best of men need mercy, and appeal to mercy, yes to 
    nothing else but mercy; they need it for themselves, and crave it eagerly of 
    their God as a personal requisite. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For I cry unto you daily. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Is there not a promise that importunity shall prevail? 
    May we not, then, plead our importunity as an argument with God? He who 
    prays every day, and all the day, for so the word may mean, may rest assured 
    that the Lord will hear him in the day of his need. </p>
<p align="justify">If we cried sometimes to man, or other false confidences, 
    we might expect to be referred to them in the hour of our calamity—but if in 
    all former times we have looked to the Lord alone, we may be sure that he 
    will not desert us now. </p>
<p align="justify">See how David pleaded, first that he was poor and needy, 
    next that he was the Lord's set apart one, then that he was God's servant 
    and had learned to trust in the Lord, and lastly that he had been taught to 
    pray daily. Surely these are such holy pleadings as any tried believer may 
    employ when wrestling with a prayer hearing God, and with such weapons the 
    most trembling suppliant may hope to win the day.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. Rejoice the soul of your servant.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Make my heart glad, O my Maker, for I count it my honor 
    to call myself again and again your servant, and I reckon your favor to be 
    all the wages I could desire.<i> I look for all my happiness in you only</i>, 
    and therefore <b>unto you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. </b>As the 
    heliotrope looks to the sun for its smile, so turn I my heart to you. You 
    are as the brazen serpent to my sick nature, and I lift up my soul's eye to 
    you that I may live. I know that the nearer I am to you the greater is my 
    joy, therefore be pleased to draw me nearer while I am laboring to draw 
    near. It is not easy to lift a soul at all; it needs a strong shoulder at 
    the wheel when a heart sticks in the miry clay of despondency. It is less 
    easy to lift a soul up to the Lord, for the height is great as well as the 
    weight oppressive; but the Lord will take the will for the deed, and come in 
    with a hand of almighty grace to raise his poor servant out of the earth and 
    up to Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive.</p></b>

<p align="justify">Good at giving and forgiving; supplying us with his good, 
    and removing our evil. Here was the great reason why the Psalmist looked to 
    the Lord alone for his joy, because every joy-creating attribute is to be 
    found in perfection in Jehovah alone. Some men who would be considered good 
    are so self-exultingly indignant at the injuries done them by others, that 
    they cannot forgive; but we may rest assured that <i>the better a being is, 
    the more willing he is to forgive, and the best and highest of all is ever 
    ready to blot out the transgressions of his creatures</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And plenteous in mercy unto all those who call upon you.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God does not dispense his mercy from a slender store 
    which perhaps may be so impoverished as to give out altogether—but out of a 
    cornucopia he pours forth the infinite riches of his mercy: his goodness 
    flows forth in abounding streams towards those who pray and in adoring 
    worship make mention of his name. David seems to have stood in the cleft of 
    the rock with Moses, and to have heard the name of the Lord proclaimed even 
    as the great lawgiver did, for in two places in this psalm he almost quotes 
    verbatim the passage in Exodus 34:6, "The Lord God, merciful and gracious, 
    longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Even the glory which his spirit had beheld did not 
    withdraw him from his prayer—but rather urged him to be more fervent in it; 
    hence he implores the Lord to hear his requests. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Attend to the voice of my supplications. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here are repetitions—but not vain repetitions. When a 
    child cries it repeats the same note—but it is equally in earnest every 
    time, and so was it with the suppliant here. Note the expression, "the voice 
    of my supplications", as if they were not all voice but were partly made up 
    of inarticulate noise—yet amid much that was superfluous there really was a 
    distinct voice, an inner meaning, a living sense which was the heart's 
    intention. This he would have the Lord sift out from the chaff, and hear 
    amid the mingled din. May our prayers never be voiceless; may the soul's 
    intent always give them a live core of meaning.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. In the day of my trouble I will call upon you: 
    for you will answer me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A pious resolve backed by a judicious reason. It is 
    useless to cry to those who cannot or will not hear; <i>once convince men 
    that prayer has no effect upon God, and they will have no more of it. </i>In 
    these busy days and especially in troublous times, men cannot afford to 
    waste time in entreaties which must be unavailing. Our experience confirms 
    us in the belief that Jehovah the living God really does aid those who call 
    upon him, and therefore we pray and mean to pray, not because we are so 
    fascinated by prayer that for its own sake we would continue in it if it 
    proved to be mere folly and superstition, as vain philosophers assert; but 
    because we really, indeed, and of a truth, find it to be a practical and 
    effectual means of obtaining help from God in the hour of need. </p>
<p align="justify">There can be no reason for praying, if there be no 
    expectation of the Lord's answering. Who would make a conscience of pleading 
    with the winds, or find a solace in supplicating the waves?<i> The mercy 
    seat is a mockery if there be no hearing nor answering. </i>David, as the 
    following verses show, believed the Lord to be a living and potent God, and 
    indeed to be "God alone", and it was on that account that he resolved in 
    every hour of trouble to call upon him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Among the gods there is none like unto you, O 
    Lord. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There are gods by delegated office, such as kings and 
    magistrates—but they are as nothing in the presence of Jehovah; there are 
    also gods by the nomination of superstition—but these are vanity itself, and 
    cannot be compared with the living and true God. Even if the heathen idols 
    were gods, none of them in power or even in character, could be likened unto 
    the self-existent, all-creating God of Israel. If every imaginary deity 
    could start into actual existence, and become really divine—yet would we 
    choose Jehovah to be our God, and reject all others. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Neither are there any works like unto your works.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">What have the false gods ever made or unmade? What 
    miracles have they wrought? When did they divide a sea, or march through a 
    wilderness scattering bread from the skies? O Jehovah, in your person and in 
    your works, you are as far above all gods as the heavens are above the 
    nethermost abyss.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. All nations whom you have made.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">These include all mankind, since they all come of the 
    first Adam—your creature, and their lives are all distinct creations of your 
    omnipotence. All these shall come with penitent hearts, in your own way, to 
    your own self.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And worship before you, O Lord</p></b>. 
<p align="justify">Because you are thus above all gods, the people who have 
    been so long deceived shall at last discover your greatness, and shall 
    render you the worship which is your due: you have created them all, and 
    unto you shall they all yield homage. This was David's reason for resorting 
    to the Lord in trouble, for he felt that one day all men would acknowledge 
    the Lord to be the only God.</p>
<p align="justify">It makes us content to be in the minority today, when we 
    are sure that the majority will be with us tomorrow, ay, and that the truth 
    will one day be carried unanimously and heartily. David was not a believer 
    in the theory that the world will grow worse and worse, and that the 
    dispensation will wind up with general darkness, and idolatry. Earth's sun 
    is to go down amid tenfold night if some of our prophetic brethren are to be 
    believed. Not so do we expect—but we look for day when the dwellers in all 
    lands shall learn righteousness, shall trust in the Savior, shall worship 
    you alone, O God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And shall glorify your name</p></b>.
<p align="justify">The modern notion has greatly damped the zeal of the 
    church for missions, and the sooner it is shown to be unscriptural the 
    better for the cause of God. It neither consorts with prophecy, honors God, 
    nor inspires the church with ardor. Far hence be it driven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. For you are great. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He had before said, "you are good"; <i>it is a grand 
    thing when greatness and goodness are united; it is only in the Divine Being 
    that either of them exists absolutely, and essentially. </i>Happy is it for 
    us that they both exist in the Lord to an equal degree. To be great and not 
    good might lead to tyranny in the King; and for him to be good and not great 
    might involve countless calamities upon his subjects from foreign foes, so 
    that either alternative would be terrible; let the two be blended, and we 
    have a monarch in whom the nation may rest and rejoice. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And do wondrous things.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Being good, he is said to be ready to forgive: being 
    great, he works wonders: we may blend the two, for there is no wonder so 
    wonderful as the pardon of our transgressions. All that God does or makes 
    has wonder in it; he breathes, and the wind is mystery; he speaks, and the 
    thunder astounds us; even the commonest daisy is a marvel, and a pebble 
    enshrines wisdom. <i>Only to fools is anything which God has made 
    uninteresting. </i>The world is a world of wonders. Note that the verb do is 
    in the present, the Lord is doing wondrous things, they are transpiring 
    before our eyes. Where are they? Look upon the bursting buds of spring or 
    the maturing fruits of autumn, gaze on the sky or skim the sea, mark the 
    results of providence and the victories of grace, everywhere at all times 
    the great <i>worker of wonders </i>stretches forth his rod of power.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You are God alone. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Alone were you God before your creatures were; alone in 
    godhead still are you now that you have given life to throngs of beings; 
    alone forever shall you be, for none can ever rival you.<i> True religion 
    makes no compromises</i>, it does not admit Baal or Dagon to be a God; <i>it 
    is exclusive and monopolizing, claiming for Jehovah nothing less than all.
    </i>The vaunted liberality of certain professors of modern thought is not to 
    be cultivated by believers in the truth. "Philosophic breadth" aims at 
    building a Pantheon, and piles a Pandemonium; it is not for us to be helpers 
    in such an evil work. <i>Benevolently intolerant, we would, for the good of 
    mankind, as well as for the glory of God, undeceive mankind as to the value 
    of their compromises—they are mere treason to truth</i>. Our God is not to 
    be worshiped as one among many good and true beings—but as God alone; and 
    his gospel is not to be preached as one of several saving systems—but as the 
    one sole way of salvation. Lies can face each other beneath one common dome; 
    but in the temple of truth the worship is one and indivisible.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Teach me your way, O LORD. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Instruct me thus at all times, let me live in your 
    school; but teach me now especially since I am in trouble and perplexity. Be 
    pleased to show me the way which your wisdom and mercy have prepared for my 
    escape; behold I lay aside all willfulness, and only desire to be informed 
    as to your holy and gracious mind. Not my way give me—but your way teach me, 
    I would follow you and not be willful. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will walk in your truth. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">When taught I will practice what I know, truth shall not 
    be a mere doctrine or sentiment to me—but a matter of daily life. </p></i>The 
    true servant of God regulates his walk by his master's will, and hence he 
    never walks deceitfully, for God's way is ever truth. Providence has a way 
    for us, and it is our wisdom to keep in it. We must not be as the bullock 
    which needs to be driven and urged forward because it likes not the road—but 
    be as men who voluntarily go where their trusted friend and helper appoints 
    their path. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Unite my heart to fear your name. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Having taught me one way, give me one heart to walk 
    therein, for too often I feel a heart and a heart, two natures contending, 
    two principles struggling for sovereignty. </p>
<p align="justify">Our minds are apt to be divided between a variety of 
    objects, like trickling streamlets which waste their force in a hundred 
    runnels; our great desire should be to have all our life floods poured into 
    one channel and to have that channel directed towards the Lord alone. A man 
    of divided heart is weak, the man of one object is <i>the </i>man. God who 
    created the bands of our nature can draw them together, tighten, strengthen, 
    and fasten them, and so braced and inwardly knit by his uniting grace, we 
    shall be powerful for good—but not otherwise. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">To fear God is both the beginning, the growth, and the 
    maturity of wisdom, therefore should we be undividedly given up to it, 
    heart, and soul.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my 
    heart. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When my heart is one, I will give you all of it. <i>
    Praise should never be rendered with less than all our heart, and soul, and 
    strength, or it will be both unreal and unacceptable</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">This is the second time in the psalm that David calls the 
    Lord "my God", the first time he was in an agony of prayer (Psalm 86:2), and 
    now he is in an ecstasy of praise. If anything can make a man pray and 
    praise, it is the knowledge into that the Lord is his God. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And I will glorify your name for evermore.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Into eternity gratitude will prolong its praise. God has 
    never done blessing us, let us never have done blessing him. As he ever 
    gives us grace, let us ever render to him the glory of it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. For great is your mercy toward me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Personal experience is ever the master singer. Whatever 
    you are to others, <i>to me </i>your mercy is most notable. The psalmist 
    claims to sing among the loudest, because his debt to divine mercy is among 
    the greatest. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And you have delivered my soul from the lowest Hell. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">From the direst death and the deepest dishonor David had 
    been kept by God, for his enemies would have done more than send him to Hell 
    had they been able. <i>His sense of sin also made him feel as if the most 
    overwhelming destruction would have been his portion had not grace prevented</i>, 
    therefore does he speak of deliverance from the nethermost abode of lost 
    spirits. There are some alive now who can use this language sincerely, and 
    he who pens these lines most humbly confesses that he is one. Left to myself 
    to indulge my passions, to rush onward with my natural vehemence, and defy 
    the Lord with recklessness of levity, what a candidate for the lowest abyss 
    should I have made myself by this time. For me, there was but one 
    alternative, great mercy—or the lowest Hell. With my whole heart do I sing, 
    "Great is your mercy towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the 
    lowest Hell." The psalmist here again touches a bold and joyful note—but 
    soon he exchanges it for the mournful string.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. O God, the proud are risen against me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They could not let God's poor servant alone, his walk 
    with God was as smoke to their eyes, and therefore they determined to 
    destroy him. None hate godly men so fiercely as do the high minded and 
    domineering. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the assemblies of violent men have sought after my 
    soul.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Unitedly oppressors sought the good man's life; they 
    hunted in packs, with keen scent, and eager foot. In persecuting times many 
    a saint has used these words in reference to Papal bishops and inquisitors.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And have not set you before them.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">They would not have molested the servant if they had 
    cared one whit for the master. Those who fear not God are not afraid to 
    commit violent and cruel acts. <i>An atheist is a misanthrope. Irreligion is 
    akin to inhumanity.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. But you, O Lord. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">What a contrast! We get away from the hectorings and 
    blusterings of proud but puny men, to the glory and goodness of the Lord. We 
    turn from the boisterous foam of chafing waves to the sea of glass mingled 
    with fire, calm and serene. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Are a God full of compassion, and gracious, long 
    suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A truly glorious doxology, in which there is not one 
    redundant word. As we have before observed, it is mainly transcribed from 
    Exodus 34:6. Here is compassion for the weak and sorrowing, grace for the 
    undeserving, longsuffering for the provoking, mercy for the guilty, and 
    truth for the tried. God's love assumes many forms, and is lovely in them 
    all. Into whatever state we may be cast, there is a peculiar hue in the 
    light of love which will harmonize with our condition; love is one and yet 
    sevenfold, its white ray contains the chromatic scale. </p>
<p align="justify">Are we sorrowful? We find the Lord full of compassion.</p>
<p align="justify">Are we contending with temptation? His grace comes to our 
    aid. </p>
<p align="justify">Do we err? He is patient with us. </p>
<p align="justify">Have we sinned? He is plenteous in mercy. </p>
<p align="justify">Are we resting on his promise? He will fulfill it with 
    abundant truth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. O turn unto me. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As though the face of God had been before averted in 
    anger, the suppliant pleads for a return of conscious favor. One turn of 
    God's face will turn all our darkness into day. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And have mercy upon me.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">That is all he asks, for he is lowly in heart; that is 
    all he wants, for <i>mercy answers all a sinner's needs. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Give your strength unto your servant. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Gird me with it that I may serve you, guard me with it 
    that I may not be overcome. When the Lord gives us his own strength we are 
    sufficient for all emergencies, and have no cause to fear any adversaries.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And save the son of your handmaid. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He meant that he was a home born servant of God. As the 
    sons of slaves were their master's property by their birth, so he gloried in 
    being the son of a woman who herself belonged to the Lord. What others might 
    think a degrading illustration he uses with delight, to show how intensely 
    he loved the Lord's service; and also as a reason why the Lord should 
    interpose to rescue him, seeing that he was no newly purchased servant—but 
    had been in the house from his very birth.</p>

<p align="justify">Verse 17. Show to me a token for good. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Let me be assured of your mercy by being delivered out of 
    trouble.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">"Some token of your favor show,<br/>
    Some sign which all my foes may see; <br/>
    And filled with blank confusion know,<br/>
    My comfort and my help in Thee."</p>
<p align="justify">What bodes good to me shall make them quail and blush. 
    Disappointed and defeated, the foes of the good man would feel ashamed of 
    what they had designed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Because you, LORD, have helped me, and comforted me.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God does nothing by halves, those whom he helps he also 
    consoles, and so makes them not merely safe but joyful. This makes the foes 
    of the righteous exceedingly displeased—but it brings to the Lord double 
    honor. Lord, deal you thus with us evermore, so will we glorify you, world 
    without end. Amen.</p>
