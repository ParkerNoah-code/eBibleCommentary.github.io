        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.250)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 1st, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"Fight the Lord's battles." -- 1 Samuel 18:17.</p>
        <p>
          WE shall not take these words in their literal application, as coming
          from the lips of Saul, when he gave David his elder daughter, Merab,
          to wife; but shall accommodate the passage, and use it as an
          exhortation given to the church of Christ, and to every Soldier of
          Jesus: "Fight the Lord's battles." If this exhortation be not found in
          the selfsame words, coming from the lips of Jesus, nevertheless the
          whole tenor of the Word of God is to the same effect -- "Fight the
          Lord's battles."
        </p>
        <p>
          At the present crisis, the minds of men are exceedingly agitated with
          direful prospects of a terrible struggle. We know not whereunto this
          matter may grow. The signs of the times are dark and direful. We fear
          that the vials of God's wrath are about to be poured out, and that the
          earth will be deluged with blood. As long as there remains a hope, let
          us pray for peace, nay, even in the time of war let us still beseech
          the throne of God, crying, that he would "send us peace in our days."
        </p>
        <p>
          The war will be looked upon by different persons with different
          feelings. The Italian will consider, all through the controversy, his
          own country; the Sardinian will be looking continually to the progress
          or to the defeat of his own nation; while the German, having sympathy
          with his own race, will be continually anxious to understand the state
          of affairs. There is one power however, which is not represented in
          the congress and which seems to be silent, because the ears of men are
          deaf to aught that it hath to say To that power all our sympathies
          will be given, and our hearts will follow it with interest; and all
          through the war, the one question that we shall ask, will be "How will
          that kingdom prosper? "You all know to which kingdom I refer -- it is
          the kingdom of Jesus Christ upon earth; that little one which is even
          at this time growing, and which is to become a thousand, which is to
          break in pieces all the monarchies of earth, and to seat itself upon
          their ruins, proclaiming universal liberty and peace, under the banner
          of Jesus Christ. I am sure that we shall think far more of the
          interests of religion than of anything else, and our prayer will be,
          "O Lord, do what thou wilt with the earthen pitchers of men's
          monarchies, but let thy kingdom come, and let thy will be done on
          earth, even as it is in heaven!"
        </p>
        <p>
          While, however, we shall anxiously watch the contest, it will be quite
          as well if we mingle in it ourselves. Not that this nation of England
          should touch it; God forbid. If tyrants fight, let them fight; let
          free men stand aloof. Why should England have aught to do with all the
          coming battles? As God has cut us off from Europe by a boisterous sea,
          so let us be kept apart from all the broils and turmoils into which
          tyrants and their slaves may fall. I speak now, after a spiritual
          manner, to the church of Christ. I say, "Let us mingle in the fray;
          let us have something to do. We cannot be neutral; we never have been.
          Our host is ever in hostility to sin and Satan. "My voice is still for
          war." The senate of Christ's church can never talk of peace. For thus
          it is written: "The Lord will have war."
        </p>
        <p>
          This will bring us to the text, and here I shall consider first of
          all, the Lord's battles; we are not to fight our own; secondly, the
          Lord's soldiers; and thirdly, the King's command, "Fight the Lord's
          battles."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, THE LORD'S BATTLES, what are they? Not the garment rolled in
          blood, not the noise, and smoke, and din of human slaughter. These may
          be the devil's battles, if you please, but not the Lord's. They may be
          days of God's vengeance but in their strife the servant of Jesus may
          not mingle. We stand aloof. Our kingdom is not of this world; else
          would God's servants fight with sword and spear. Ours is a spiritual
          kingdom, and the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual,
          and mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds.
        </p>
        <p>
          What are God's battles? Let us here carefully distinguish between the
          battles of God, and our own. Oh, my brethren and sisters in Christ, it
          is not your business to fight your own battles, not even in defense of
          your own character. If you be maligned and slandered, let the
          slanderer alone. His malignity will but be increased by any attempt
          that you shall make to defend yourself. As a soldier of Christ you are
          to fight for your Master, not for yourself. You are not to carry on a
          private warfare for your own honor, but all your time and all your
          power is to be given to his defense and his war. You are not to have a
          word to speak for yourselves. Full often, when we get into little
          tempers, and our blood is roused, we are apt to think that we are
          fighting the cause of truth, when we are really maintaining our own
          pride. We imagine that we are defending our Master, but we are
          defending our own little selves. Too often the anger rises against an
          adversary not because his words reflect dishonor upon the glorious
          Christ, but because they dishonor us. Oh! let us not be so little as
          to fight our own battles! Depend upon it, the noblest means of
          conquest for a Christian in the matter of calumny and falsehood, is to
          stand still and see the salvation of God. Sheathe thine own sword, put
          away all thine own weapons, when thou comest to fight thine own
          battle, and let God fight for thee, and thou shalt be more than
          conqueror.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we must recollect that there is such a thing as fighting the
          battles of our own sect, when we ought to be fighting God's battles.
          We imagine that we are maintaining the church when we are only
          maintaining our section of it. I would always be very tender of the
          honor of the Christian body to which I belong, but I would rather see
          its honor stained, than that the glory of the entire church should be
          dimmed. Every soldier ought to love the peculiar legion in which he
          has enlisted, but better to see the colors of that legion rent to
          tatters, than to see the old standard of the cross trampled in the
          mire. Now I trust we are ready to say of our own denomination, Let its
          name perish, if Christ's name shall get ought of glory thereby." If
          the extinction of our sect should be the conquest of Christ and the
          promoting of his kingdom, then let it be wiped out of the book of
          record, and let not its name be heard any more. We should, I say, each
          of us defend the body to which we belong, for we have conscientiously
          joined it believing it to be the nearest to the old standard of the
          church of Christ, and God forbid that we should leave it for a worse.
          If we see a better, then would we sacrifice our prejudices to our
          convictions, but we cannot leave the old standard so long as we see it
          to be the very standard which floated in the hand of Paul, and which
          was handed by him through divers generations, through Chrysostom to
          Augustine, from Augustine to Calvin, and so on through the glorious
          race of mighty men who have not been ashamed of the gospel of Christ
          Jesus. But yet I say let our name. and let our sect, and let our
          denomination be absorbed, and let it sink, so that the battle of the
          Lord may but be well fought, and the time of Christ's triumph
          hastened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fight the Lord's battles." Then what are these? These are battles
          with sin and battles with error, and battles with war, and battles
          with worldliness. Fight ye these Christian. and ye shall have enough
          to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord's battle is first of all with sin. Seek grace to fight that
          battle in your own heart. Endeavour by divine grace to overcome those
          propensities which continually push you towards iniquity. On your
          knees wrestle against your besetting sins. As habits appear endeavor
          to break them by the battle-axe of strong resolution wielded by the
          arm of faith. Take all your lusts as they bestir themselves to the
          foot of the cross, and let the blood of Jesus fall upon those vipers
          and they must die. The blood of Christ shall spill the blood of sin.
          The death of Christ shall be the death of iniquity, the cross of
          Christ shall be the crucifixion of transgression. Labour with
          yourselves to drive the Canaanites out of your hearts. Spare none, let
          no petty lust escape. Put down pride and sloth, and lust, and unbelief
          and you have now a battle before you which may fill your hands, and
          more than fill them. Oh! cry unto God your strength, and look unto the
          hills from whence cometh your help, and then fight on again, and as
          each sin is overcome, each evil habit broken off, each lust denied go
          on to the rooting up of another, and the destruction of more of them,
          until ail being subdued, body soul and spirit shall be consecrated to
          Christ as a living sacrifice, purified by his Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while this battle is being fought, ay, and while it is still
          fighting, go out and fight with other men's sins. Smite them first
          with the weapon of holy example. Be yourselves what you would have
          others be. be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Be
          yourselves clean ere ye can hope to be the purifiers of the world; and
          then, having first sought the blessing of God, go out into the world
          and bear your witness against sin. Let your testimony be unflinching;
          never let a sin pass under your eye without rebuke. Slay utterly young
          and old; let not one escape. Speak sometimes sternly if the sinner be
          hardened in his sin, speak gently, if it be his first offense, seeking
          not to break his head but to break the head of his iniquity -- not to
          break his bones or wound his feelings, but to cut his sin in twain,
          and leave his iniquity dead before his eyes. Go ye forth where sin is
          the most rampant. Go down the dark alley, climb the creaking
          staircase; penetrate the dens of iniquity where the lion of the pit
          lies in his death lair, and go ye and pluck out of the mouth of the
          lion two legs and a piece of a ear, if that be all which you can save.
          Count it always your joy to follow the track of the lion, to beard him
          in his den, and fight him where he reigneth most secure. Protest
          daily, hourly, by act, by word, by pen, by tongue, against evil of
          every kind and shape. Be ye as burning and shining lights in the midst
          of darkness, and as two-edged swords in the midst of the hosts of sin.
          Why, a true Christian who lives near to God, and is filled with grace
          and is kept holy, may stand in the midst of sinners and do wonders.
          What a marvellous feat was that which Jonah did! There was the great
          city of Nineveh, having in it six score thousand souls that knew not
          their right hand from their left, and one man went against it -- Jonah
          -- and as he approached it he began to cry, "Yet forty days and
          Nineveh shall be overthrown." He entered the city -- perhaps he stood
          aghast for a moment at the multitude of its population, at its
          richness and splendor, but again he lilted up his sharp shrill voice,
          "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown." On he went, and the
          crowd increased around him as he passed through each street, but they
          heard nothing but the solemn monotony, "Yet forty days and Nineveh
          shall be overthrown;" and yet again, "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall
          be overthrown." And on he went, that solitary man, till he caused
          convulsion in the midst of myriads, and the king on his throne robed
          himself in sackcloth and proclaimed a fast, a day of mourning and of
          sadness. Yet on he went, "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be
          overthrown," "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown," till
          all the people bowed before him, and that one man was the conqueror of
          the myriad. Ah! believer, if you will go out and do the same, if you
          will go into the streets, the lanes, the by-ways the houses, and into
          the privacies of men, and still with this continued cry against sin
          and iniquity, say to them, "Look unto the cross and live, look unto
          the cross and live." Though there were but one earnest man in London
          who would continue that monotony of "Look unto the cross and live,"
          from end to end this city would shake, and the great leviathan
          metropolis would be made to tremble. Go forth then, believer, and cry
          against sin with all thy might.
        </p>
        <p>
          And even so must we cry against error. It is the preacher's business
          Sabbath after Sabbath, and week-day after week-day, to preach the
          whole gospel of God and to vindicate the truth as it is in Jesus from
          the opposition of man. Thousands are the heresies which now beset the
          church. O children of God! fight the Lord's battles for truth. I am
          astonished, and yet more astonished when I come to turn it over, at
          the want of earnestness that there is in the Protestantism of the
          present age. How do you imagine that Cardinal Wiseman pays for all his
          splendours, and that the Romish church is supported? Fools and slow of
          heart, ye find them much of their wealth. If he is to preach in any
          place, who is it that crowds the chapel full, and pays for admission?
          The Protestants; and the Protestantism of England is the pay-master of
          the Pope. I am ashamed that sons of the Reformers who have Smithfield
          still in their midst unbuilt upon, should bow themselves before the
          beast, and give so much as a single farthing to the shrine of the
          devil's firstborn son Take heed to yourselves, ye Protestants, lest ye
          be partakers of her plagues; touch her not, lest ye be defiled. Give a
          drachm to her, or a grain of incense to her censors, ye shall be
          partakers of her adulteries and partakers of her plagues. Every time
          you pass the house of Popery let a curse light upon her head: Thus
          saith the Lord: -- "Come out of her, my people, that ye be not
          partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her
          sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
          Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
          according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her
          double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
          much torment and sorrow give her; for she saith in her heart, I sit a
          queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her
          plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she
          shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who
          judgeth her." -- Revelation 18:4-8. How soft some men's minds are
          growing how effeminate in the battle. I hear then speaking of
          Puseyisrm, -- and what is that but Popery made worse than it was
          before by being more despicable and deceivable than even Popery
          itself. Do ye not hear men talk of the Puseyites in these days and
          say, "Ah! well, they differ a little from us." Do not the evangelical
          party in the Church of England seem at the present moment to make
          common cause and party with the Puseyite? Else how is it that the
          great preachings have been alternatively conducted by High and Low
          Church? It is all very well with that Church when it is separated from
          her heretical sons, and a great gulf fixed, but all that helps to
          bridge that gulf must mar her glory and destroy her power. We must
          have no truce, no treaty with Rome. War! war to the knife with her!
          Peace there cannot be. She cannot have peace with us -- we cannot have
          peace with her. She hates the true Church, and we can only say that
          the hatred is reciprocated. We would not lay a hand upon her priests;
          we would not touch a hair of their heads. Let them be free; but their
          doctrine we would destroy from the face of the earth as the doctrine
          of devils. So let it perish, O God, and let that evil thing become as
          the fat of lambs. Into smoke let it consume: yea into smoke let it
          consume away.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must fight the Lords battles against this giant error, whichever
          shape it takes; and so must we do with every error that pollutes the
          church. Slay it utterly; let none escape. "Fight the Lord's battles."
          Even though it be an error that is in an Evangelical Church, yet must
          we smite it. I love all those who love the Lord Jesus Christ, but,
          nevertheless, I cannot have any truce any treaty with divers errors
          that have crept into the church, nor would I have you regard them with
          complacency. We are one in Christ; let us be friends with one another;
          but let us never be friends with one another's error. If I be wrong,
          rebuke me sternly; I can bear it, and bear it cheerfully and if ye be
          wrong, expect the like measure from me, and neither peace nor parley
          with your mistakes. Let us all be true to one another, and true to
          Christ; and as soon as we perceive an error, though it be but as the
          shadow of one, let us root it out and drive it from us, lest it plague
          the whole body, and put leprosy into the entire fabric of the church.
          No peace with sin. no peace with falsehood. War, war, war without
          deliberation: war for ever with error and deceit!
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet again, it is the Christian's duty always to have war with war.
          To have bitterness in our hearts against any man that lives is to
          serve Satan. We must speak very hardly and sternly against error, and
          against sin; but against men we have not a word to say, though it were
          the Pope himself: I have no enmity in my heart against him as a man,
          but as anti-Christ. With men the Christian is one. Are we not every
          man's brother? "God hath made of one flesh all people that dwell upon
          the face of the earth." The cause of Christ is the cause of humanity.
          We are friends to all, and are enemies to none. We do not speak evil,
          even of the false prophet himself; as a man, but, as a false prophet.
          we are his sworn opponents. Now, Christians, ye have a difficult
          battle to fight, because ye fight with all evil and hostility between
          man and man: you are to be peacemakers. Go wherever you may, if you
          see a quarrel you are to abate it. You are to pluck firebrands out of
          the fire, and strive to quench them in the waters of lovingkindness.
          It is your mission to bring the nations together, and weld them into
          one. It is yours to make man love man, to make him no more the
          devourer of his kind. This you can only do by being the friends of
          purity. Peace with error is war with man: but war with error is peace
          with man. Smite error, smite sin, and you have done your best to
          promote happiness and union among mankind. Oh, go, Christian, in the
          Spirit's strength, and smite your own anger -- put that to the death,
          smite your own pride -- level that, and then smite every other man's
          anger. Make peace wherever you can; scatter peace with both your
          hands. Let this be the very air you breathe; let nothing drop from
          your lip but words of healing, words of tenderness, words which shall
          abate the strife and noise of this poor distracted world. And now you
          have a battle before you, -- a battle against sin and against error,
          and then, also, a battle against strife, -- the battle of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now FOR THE LORD'S SOLDIERS: who are they that are to fight
          the Lord's battle? Not everybody. The Lord has his army, his church:
          who are they? The Lord's soldiers are all of his own choosing. He has
          chosen them out of the world; and they are not of the world, even as
          Christ is not of the world. But if you want to know the Lord's
          soldiers, I will tell you how you may ascertain whether you are one.
          When the Lord Jesus enlists a soldier in his church, the first thing
          he does with him is, he tells him that he must first take off every
          rag of the old garments that he was wont to wear. "Now," saith Jesus
          to him, "thy rags must be relinquished; thy sins and thy
          self-righteousness must both be forsaken. Here is the regimental, here
          is the inner garment of my imputed righteousness, and here is the
          outward garment of divine sanctification. Put on these, and thou art
          mine. But in thine own robes, I will have nothing to do with thee,
          thou shalt still continue an heir of wrath, and I will not enlist thee
          among the heirs of grace." As soon as a man has his rags taken off, it
          Christ has enlisted him, the next thing he is required to do is, to
          wash. He is washed, from head to foot, in a matchless bath of blood;
          and when washed, he is arrayed, and clothed upon with the
          righteousness of Jesus Christ. This done, he is taken into the midst
          of the army and introduced to his comrades, and he is led to love the
          whole army. "Well," says one, "I love my own rank." Do you? Then you
          do not belong to it, if you do not love the other ranks too. He who is
          a true soldier of Christ, wears his regimentals, and he loves the
          whole army. He keeps to his own regiment, and he likes its banner --
          the flag that has braved so often the battle and the storm; still he
          loves the whole army, however much the colors may differ. He loves all
          them that serve the Lord Jesus Christ. "By this also ye shall know
          whether ye be his disciples, if ye love one another, even as Christ
          has loved you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Once brought into the army, there is one mark whereby you may know
          Christ's soldier, namely, that he is not his own. If you meet him, he
          will say, "From head to foot I belong to my Captain, every inch of me;
          and what is more, I have given up goods and chattels, wife and
          children, time and talents, everything to him. I am not my own, I am
          bought with a price." He is a consecrated man. Come, then, put these
          questions to yourselves. Have you been washed in the blood of Christ?
          Do you boast in the imputed righteousness of Christ? And are you
          clothed about with the sanctification of his Spirit? Have you given up
          everything for his cause, and for the love you bear his name are you
          willing to live or willing to die, as he shall please, if you may but
          promote his honor? Well, then, you are his soldier, and therefore I
          shall not need to draw any further lines of distinction; but go to the
          third point, which is --
        </p>
        <p>
          III. THE EXHORTATION -- "Fight!" "Fight the Lord's battles." If you
          are the soldier of the heavenly King; "To arms! to arms!" "Fight the
          Lord's battles."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I would observe, that there are some people who are very fond of
          looking on, and not fighting. Perhaps five out of every six of our
          church do little but look on. You go to see them, and you say, "Well,
          what is your church doing?" "Well, we bless God, we are doing a great
          deal; we have a Sabbath-school, with so many children; our minister
          preaches so many times, and so many members have been added to the
          churches. The sick are visited; the poor are relieved." And you stop
          them, and say, "Well, friend, I am glad to hear that you are doing so
          much; but which work is it that you take? Do you teach in the Sabbath
          school?" "No." "Do you preach in the street?" "No." "Do you visit the
          sick?" "No." Do you assist in the discipline of the church?" "No." "Do
          you contribute to the poor?" "No." Yet I thought you said you were
          doing so much. Stand out, sir, if you please, you are doing nothing at
          all. Be ashamed! Your master does not say, "Look on at the Lord's
          battles;" but "Fight" them. "Ah," says one. "but then, you know, I
          contribute towards the support of the ministers he has to do that."
          Oh! I see, you have made a mistake; you thought that you belonged to
          the English government, and not to Christ's government. You have been
          paying for a substitute, have you? You are not going to fight in
          person; you are paying, to keep a substitute to fight for you. Ah, ye
          have made a great mistake here. Christ will have all his soldiers
          fight. Why, I am not kept to do the fighting for you: I wilt endeavor
          to encourage you, and nerve you to the battle; but as to doing your
          duty, no, I thank you. The Romanist may believe that his priest does
          the work for him; I do not believe any such thing in my case, nor in
          the case of your ministers. Christ did not serve you by proxy, and you
          cannot serve him by proxy. No, "he his own self bare our sins in his
          own body," and you must work for Christ in your own body, your own
          self, with your own heart and with your own hands. I do hate that
          religion which another man can do for you. Depend upon it, it is good
          for nothing. True religion is a personal thing. O soldiers of the
          heavenly King, leave not our lieutenants and your officers to fight
          alone. Come on with us; we wave our swords in front. Come comrades,
          on! we are ready to mount the call, or lead the forlorn hope. Will you
          desert us? Come up the ladder with us. Let us show the enemy what
          Christian blood can do, and at the sword's point let us drive our foes
          before us. If you leave us to do all it will all be undone; we want
          all to do something, all to be laboring for Christ. Here, then, is the
          exhortation to each individual Christian -- "Fight the Lord's
          battles."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I will read you over the code martial -- the rules which
          Christ, the Captain, would have you obey in fighting his battles.
        </p>
        <p>Regulation I. -- NO COMMUNICATION NOR UNION WITH THE ENEMY!</p>
        <p>
          "Ye are not of the world." No truce, no league, no treaty, are you to
          make with the enemies of Christ. Come out from among them, and be ye
          separate, and touch not the unclean thing."
        </p>
        <p>Regulation II. -- NO QUARTER TO BE GIVEN OR TAKEN!</p>
        <p>
          You are not to say to the world, "There! believe me to be better than
          I am" -- and do not ever believe the world to be better than it is? Do
          not ask it to excuse you; do not excuse it. No parley with it
          whatever. If it praises you, do not care for its praise; if it scorns
          you laugh in its face. Have nought to do with its pretended
          friendship. Ask nothing at its hands; let it be crucified to you, and
          you to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulation III. -- NO WEAPONS OR AMMUNITION TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY ARE
          TO BE USED BY IMMANUEL'S SOLDIERS, BUT ARE TO BE UTTERLY BURNED WITH
          FIRE!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you beat them, and you find their guns lying on the ground, spike
          them and melt them; never fire them off: -- that is to say, never
          fight Christ's battles with the devil's weapons. If your enemy gets
          angry do not get angry with him; if he slanders you, do not slander
          him. One of the devil's long guns is slander: spike it and melt it; do
          not attempt to use it against the enemy. All kinds of bitterness --
          these are firebrands of death which Satan hurls against us: never hurl
          them beck at him. Remember you Master. "When he was reviled he reviled
          not again." Never meddle with the enemy's weapons, even if you can. If
          you think you can crush him by his own mode of warfare, do not do it.
          It was all very well for David to cut off Goliath's head with his own
          sword; but it would not have done for him to try that, until he had
          first of all split his head open with a stone. Try to get a stone out
          of the brook of truth, and throw it with the sling of faith, but have
          nothing to do with Goliath's sword; you will cut your fingers with it,
          and get no honor.
        </p>
        <p>Regulation IV. -- NO FEAR, TREMBLING, OR COWARDICE!</p>
        <p>
          "The children of Ephraim, being armed, turned their backs in the day
          of battles" but Christ wants no cowardice of you. Fear not. Remember,
          if any man be ashamed of Christ in this generation, of him will Christ
          be ashamed in the day when he comes in the glory of his Father and all
          his holy angels. "I say unto you, fear not him that can kill the body,
          but after that hath no more that he can do; but fear him who is able
          to cast both body and soul into hell; I say unto you, fear him."
        </p>
        <p>Regulation V. -- NO SLUMBERING, REST, EASE, OR SURRENDER!</p>
        <p>
          Be always at it, all at it, constantly at it, with all your might at
          it. No rest. Your resting time is to come, in the grave. Be always
          fighting the enemy. Ask every day for grace to win a victory, and each
          night sleep not unless you can feel that you have done something in
          the cause of Christ -- have helped to carry the standard a little
          further into the midst of the enemy's ranks. Oh! if we did but attend
          to these regulations how much might be done! But because we forget
          them, the cause of Christ is retarded and the victory is along.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, before I send you away, I would call out Christ's soldiers,
          and drill them for a minute or two. I see sometimes the captains
          marching their soldiers to and fro, and you may laugh and say they are
          doing nothing; but mark, all that manoeuvering, that forming into
          squares, and so forth, has its practical effect when they come into
          the field of battle. Suffer me, then, to put the Christian through his
          postures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first posture the Christian ought to take, and in which he ought.
          to be very well practiced, is this. DOWN UPON BOTH KNEES, HANDS UP,
          AND EYES UP TO HEAVEN! No posture like that. It is called the posture
          of prayer. When Christ's church has been beaten every way else, it has
          at last taken to its knees, and then the whole army of the enemy has
          fled before us, for on its knees Christ's church is more than
          conqueror. The praying legion is a legion of heroes. He who
          understands this posture has learned the first part of the heavenly
          drill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next posture is: FEET FAST, HANDS STILL, AND EYES UP! A hard
          posture that, though it looks very easy. "Stand still and see the
          salvation of God." I have known many men who could practice the first
          position who could not practice the: second. Perhaps that was the
          hardest thing that the children of Israel ever did. When they had the
          sea before them and Pharoah behind them, they were commanded to stand
          still. But if you must learn to stand still when you are provoked, to
          be silent when you are mocked, to wait under adverse providences, and
          still believe that in the darkest hour the sun is not dead, but will
          shine out again. Patient waiting for Christ's coming, may we all learn
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another posture is this: QUICK MARCH, CONTINUALLY GOING ONWARD! Ah!
          there are some Christians who are constantly sleeping on their guns;
          but they do not understand the posture of going onward. Quick march!
          Many Christians seem to be better skilled in the goose step of lifting
          up one foot after another and putting them down in the same place,
          rather than going onwards. Oh! I would we all knew how to progress --
          to "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
          Christ." Never think you are doing anything unless you are getting
          forwarder -- have more love, more hope, more joy, and are extending
          your sphere of usefulness. Soldiers of Christ, Quick march!" Speak to
          the children of Israel, that they go forward." Let them not go back;
          let them not stand still. On, on, on, soldiers of Christ! Go forward!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another posture is one that is very hard to learn indeed. It is what
          no soldier, I think, was ever told to do by his captain, except the
          soldier of Christ: EYES SHUT, AND EARS SHUT, AND HEART SHUT! That is
          when you go through Vanity Fair. Eyes shut, so as not to look upon
          temptation; ears shut, so as not to regard either the praise or the
          scoffs of the world; and heart shut against evil, with the great stone
          of precept. "Thy Word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin
          against thee." Roll a stone at the door of your heart, that sin may
          not come out of it. That is a hard posture; but you will never fight
          the battles of the Lord till you know how to maintain that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there is another posture: FEET FIRM, SWORD IN HAND. EYES
          OPEN; LOOKING AT YOUR ENEMY, WATCHING EVERY FEINT THAT HE MAKES, AND
          WATCHING TOO YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO LET FLY AT HIM SWORD IN HAND! That
          posture you must maintain every day. Guard against the darts of the
          enemy; hold up your shield, and be ready to run on him and give him a
          deadly wound. I need not explain that. You that have to do with
          business, you that are in the ministry, You that are serving God as
          deacons and elders, you know how often you have to ward off the dart
          and look well at your enemy, and meet him sword in hand, ready to rush
          in whenever your time shall come. Let no opportunity -- let no
          occasion pass by. Wound your enemy whenever you can; slay sin, slay
          error, and destroy bitterness, as often as ye have opportunity so to
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one other posture, which is a very happy one for the child of
          God to take up and I would have you remember to-day. HANDS WIDE OPEN,
          AND HEART WIDE OPEN, WHEN YOU ARE HELPING YOUR BRETHREN, a hand ready
          to give whate'er the church needs, and an eye ready to look up for
          help when you cannot give help with your hand, and ready to guide the
          hand whenever help is wanting; and a heart open to hear the tale of
          another's want, to "rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with
          them that weep."
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, the best posture for Christ's church, is that of PATIENT
          WAITING FOR THE ADVENT OF CHRIST, a looking-forward for his glorious
          appearance, who must come and will not tarry, but who will get unto
          himself the victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it you will go to your houses, and if divine grace shall help you
          to put yourselves through this form of drill, you will be mighty in
          the day of battle to put down the enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now suffer the word of exhortation, very brief, but hot and
          earnest. O Christian men and women, the more ye think of it the more
          will ye be ashamed or yourselves, and of the present church, that we
          do so little for Christ. Some eighteen hundred years ago, there were a
          handful of men and women in an upper room; and that handful! of men
          and women were so devoted to their master end so true to his cause,
          that within a hundred years they had overrun every nation of the
          habitable globe; yea, within fifty years they had preached the gospel
          in every land. And now look at this great host gathered here to-day.
          Probably there are not less than two or three thousand members of
          Christian churches, besides this mixed multitude and now what will you
          do in fifty years time? What does the church do in any year of its
          existence? Why, hardly anything at all. I sometimes wonder how long
          God will allow the church to be cooped up in England. I fear that we
          shall never see the world converted, till this country is invaded. If
          it should ever happen that our hearths and homes should be invaded,
          And that we should be scattered, north, south, east and west, all
          through the world, it will be the grandest thing that ever happened
          for the church of Christ. I would go down on my knees and pray night
          and day that it may not happen for the nation's sake; but nevertheless
          I sometimes think that the greatest disaster that can ever occur to
          our nation, will be the only way in which Christ's church will be
          spread. Look at it. Here you have your churches in almost every
          street, and despite the destitution of London, it is not destitute if
          you compare it with the nations of the world. Oh, ought we not as
          ministers of Christ to pour out in legions? and ought not our people
          to go everywhere in the habitable world, in ones, and twos, and
          threes, preaching the gospel? But would you have us leave wife, and
          house, and children? I would not have you do it; but if ye would do it
          then would Christ's power be seen, and then would the might of the
          church return to it once again. They were men without purse or scrip
          that went everywhere preaching the word, and God was with them, and
          the world heard them and was converted. Now we cannot go if we are not
          sent, and perhaps it is only reasonable that flesh and blood should
          not ask more. but still if the life of (hod were in the church, it
          would never stop in England long; it would send forth its bands and
          legions, rolling along in one tremendous stream; a new crusade would
          be preached against the heathen nations, and the sword of the Lord and
          of Gideon would smite the stoutest of our foemen, and Christ would
          reign, and his unsuffering kingdom then would come. Oh that the church
          had power with men, and power with God! Dear brothers and sisters,
          look out and see what you can do, every one of you. Do something
          to-day. Do not let this Sunday go without every one of you trying to
          be the means of winning a soul to God. Go to your Sunday Schools this
          afternoon; go to your preaching stations; go to your tract district
          each one in his sphere; go to your families, your mothers, fathers,
          brothers, sisters; go home and do something to-day. "Fight the Lord's
          battles." You can do nothing of yourselves; but God will be with you.
          If you have the will to serve him, he will give you the power. Go
          today, and seek to heal some breach, to put away some enmity, to slay
          some sin, or to drive out some error; and God being with you this
          shall be a happier day to your soul, and a holier day to the world
          than you have seen in all your experience before.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will have one blow, and then you may go. Sinner! I remember that
          thou art here this morning as well as the saint. Sinner! thou art not
          Christ's soldier; thou art a soldier of Satan; thou wilt have thy pay
          soon, man, when thou hast worn thy sword out, and worn thine arm out
          in fighting against Christ. Thou shalt have thy pay. Look at it and
          tremble. "The wages of sin is death," and damnation too. Will you take
          these two, or will you now renounce the black old tyrant, and enlist
          under the banner of Christ? O that God would give you the earnest
          money of free grace, and enlist you now as a soldier of the cross.
          Remember, Christ takes the very dregs to be his soldiers. Every man
          that was in debt, and every man that was discontented, came to David,
          and he became a captain over them. Now, if you are in debt this
          morning to God's law, and cannot pay, if you are discontented with the
          devil's service, jaded and worn out with pleasure, come to Christ, and
          he will receive you, make you a soldier of the cross, and a follower
          of the Lamb. God be with you and bless you, from this day forth, even
          for ever!
