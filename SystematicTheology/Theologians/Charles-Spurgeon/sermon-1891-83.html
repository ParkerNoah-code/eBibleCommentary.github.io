          1. With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege that Paul alone
          knew the truth, and that to him the mystery was manifested by
          revelation, let Paul himself convict them, when he says, that one and
          the same God wrought in Peter for the apostolate of the circumcision,
          and in himself for the Gentiles. Peter, therefore, was an apostle of
          that very God whose was also Paul; and Him whom Peter preached as God
          among those of the circumcision, and likewise the Son of God, did Paul
          [declare] also among the Gentiles. For our Lord never came to save
          Paul alone, nor is God so limited in means, that He should have but
          one apostle who knew the dispensation of His Son. And again, when Paul
          says, |How beautiful are the feet of those bringing glad tidings of
          good things, and preaching the Gospel of peace,| he shows clearly that
          it was not merely one, but there were many who used to preach the
          truth. And again, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, when he had
          recounted all those who had seen God after the resurrection, he says
          in continuation, |But whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so
          ye believed,| acknowledging as one and the same, the preaching of all
          those who saw God after the resurrection from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And again, the Lord replied to Philip, who wished to behold the
          Father, |Have I been so long a time with you, and yet thou hast not
          known Me, Philip? He that sees Me, sees also the Father; and how
          sayest thou then, Show us the Father? For I am in the Father, and the
          Father in Me; and henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.| To these
          men, therefore, did the Lord bear witness, that in Himself they had
          both known and seen the Father (and the Father is truth). To allege,
          then, that these men did not know the truth, is to act the part of
          false witnesses, and of those who have been alienated from the
          doctrine of Christ. For why did the Lord send the twelve apostles to
          the lost sheep of the house of Israel, if these men did not know the
          truth? How also did the seventy preach, unless they had themselves
          previously known the truth of what was preached? Or how could Peter
          have been in ignorance, to whom the Lord gave testimony, that flesh
          and blood had not revealed to him, but the Father, who is in heaven?
          Just, then, as |Paul [was] an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but
          by Jesus Christ, and God the Father,| [so with the rest;] the Son
          indeed leading them to the Father, but the Father revealing to them
          the Son.
        </p>

          3. But that Paul acceded to [the request of] those who summoned him to
          the apostles, on account of the question [which had been raised], and
          went up to them, with Barnabas, to Jerusalem, not without reason, but
          that the liberty of the Gentiles might be confirmed by them, he does
          himself say, in the Epistle to the Galatians: |Then, fourteen years
          after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus.
          But I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that Gospel
          which I preached among the Gentiles.| And again he says, |For an hour
          we did give place to subjection, that the truth of the gospel might
          continue with you.| If, then, any one shall, from the Acts of the
          Apostles, carefully scrutinize the time concerning which it is written
          that he went up to Jerusalem on account of the forementioned question,
          he will find those years mentioned by Paul coinciding with it. Thus
          the statement of Paul harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical
          with, the testimony of Luke regarding the apostles.<br />
