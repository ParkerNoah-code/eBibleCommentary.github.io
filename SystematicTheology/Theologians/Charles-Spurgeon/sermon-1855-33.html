        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.34)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 5, 1855, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for
          necessity is laid upon me; yea woe is unto me, if I preach not the
          gospel." -- 1 Corinthians 9:16.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE greatest man of Apostolic times was the apostle Paul. He was
          always great in everything. If you consider him as a sinner, he was
          exceeding sinful; if you regard him as a persecutor, he was exceeding
          mad against the Christians, and persecuted them even unto strange
          cities, if you take him as a convert, his conversion was the most
          notable one of which we read, worked by miraculous power, and by the
          direct voice of Jesus speaking from heaven -- "Saul, Saul, why
          persecutest thou me?" -- If we take him simply as a Christian, he was
          an extraordinary one, loving his Master more than others, and seeking
          more than others to exemplify the grace of God in his life. But if you
          take him as an apostle, and as a preacher of the Word, he stands out
          pre-eminent as the prince of preachers, and a preacher to kings -- for
          he preached before Agrippa, he preached before Nero Caesar -- he stood
          before emperors and kings for Christ's name's sake. It was the
          characteristic of Paul, that whatever he did, he did with all his
          heart. He was one of the men who could not allow one half of his frame
          to be exercised, while the other half was indolent but, when he set to
          work, the whole of his energies -- every nerve, every sinew -- were
          strained in the work to be done, be it bad work or be it good. Paul,
          therefore, could speak from experience concerning his ministry;
          because he was the chief of ministers. There is no nonsense in what he
          speaks; it is all from the depth of his soul. And we may be sure that
          when he wrote this, he wrote it with a strong unpalsied hand --
          "Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of, for necessity
          is laid upon me, yea, woe is me if I preach not the gospel."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, these words of Paul, I trust, are applicable to many ministers in
          the present day; to all those who are especially called, who are
          directed by the inward impulse of the Holy Spirit to occupy the
          position of gospel ministers. In trying to consider this verse, we
          shall have three inquiries this morning: -- First, What is it to
          preach the gospel? Secondly, Why is it that a minister has nothing to
          glorify of? And thirdly, What is that necessity and that woe, of which
          it is written, "Necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me, if I
          preach not the gospel?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first enquiry is, WHAT IS IT TO PREACH THE GOSPEL? There are a
          variety of opinions concerning this question, and possibly amongst my
          own audience -- though I believe we are very uniform in our doctrinal
          sentiments -- there might be found two or three very ready answers to
          this question: What is it to preach the gospel? I shall therefore
          attempt to answer it myself according to my own judgment, if God will
          help me; and if it does not happen to be the correct answer, you are
          at liberty to supply a better to yourselves at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The first answer I shall give to the question is this: To preach
          the gospel is to state every doctrine contained in God's Word, and to
          give every truth its proper prominence. Men may preach a part of the
          gospel; they may only preach one single doctrine of it; and I would
          not say that a man did not preach the gospel at all if he did but
          maintain the doctrine of justification by faith -- "By grace are ye
          saved through faith." I should put him down for a gospel minister, but
          not for one who preached the whole gospel. No man can be said to
          preach the whole gospel of God if he leaves it out, knowingly and
          intentionally, one single truth of the blessed God. This remark of
          mine must be a very cutting one, and ought to strike into the
          consciences of many who make it almost a matter of principle to keen
          back certain truths from the people, because they are afraid of them.
          In conversation, a week or two ago, with an eminent professor, he said
          to me, "Sir, we know that we ought not to preach the doctrine of
          election, because it is not calculated to convert sinners." "But,"
          said I to him, "who is the men that dares to find fault with the truth
          of God? You admit, with me, that it is a truth, and yet you say it
          must not be preached. I dare not have said that thing. I should reckon
          it supreme arrogance to have ventured to say that a doctrine ought not
          to be preached when the all-wise God has seen fit to reveal it.
          Besides, is the whole gospel intended to convert sinners? There are
          some truths which God blesses to the conversion of sinners; but are
          there not other portions which were intended for the comfort of the
          saint? and ought not these to be a subject of gospel ministry as well
          as the others? And shall I look at one and disregard the other? No: if
          God says, Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people' if election comforts
          God's people, then must I preach it." But I am not quite so sure, that
          after all, that doctrine is not calculated to convert sinners. For the
          great Jonathan Edwardes tells us, that in the greatest excitement of
          one of his revivals, he preached the sovereignty of God in the
          salvation or condemnation of man, and showed that God was infinitely
          just if he sent men to hell! that he was infinitely merciful if he
          saved any; and that it was all of his own free grace, and he said, "I
          found no doctrine caused more thought nothing entered more deeply into
          the heart than the proclamation of that truth." The same might be said
          of other doctrines. There are certain truths in God's word which are
          condemned to silence; they, forsooth, are not to be uttered, because,
          according to the theories of certain persons, looking at these
          doctrines, they are not calculated to promote certain ends. But is it
          for me to judge God's truth? Am I to put his words in the scale, and
          say, "This is good, and that is evil?' Am I to take God's Bible, and
          sever it and say, "this is husk, and this is wheat?" Am I to cast away
          any one truth, and say, "I dare not preach it?" No: God forbid.
          Whatsoever is written in God's Word is written for our instruction:
          and the whole of it is profitable, either for reproof, or for
          consolation, or for edification in righteousness. No truth of God's
          Word ought to be withheld, but every portion of it preached in its own
          proper order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some men purposely confine themselves to four or five topics
          continually. Should you step into their chapel, you would naturally
          expect to hear them preaching, either from this, "Not of the will of
          the flesh, but of the will of God," or else, "Elect according to the
          foreknowledge of God the Father." You know that the moment you step in
          you are sure to hear nothing but election and high doctrine that day.
          Such men err also, quite as much as others, if they give too great
          prominence to one truth to the neglect of the others. Whatsoever is
          here to be preached, "all it whatever name you please, write it high,
          write it low -- the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible,
          is the standard of the true Christian. Alas! alas! many make an iron
          ring of their doctrines, and he who dares to step beyond that narrow
          circle, is not reckoned orthodox. God bless heretics, then! God send
          us more of them! Many make theology into a kind of treadwheel,
          consisting of five doctrines, which are everlastingly rotated; for
          they never go on to anything else. There ought to be every truth
          preached. And if God has written in his word that "he that believeth
          not is condemned already," that is as much to be preached as the truth
          that "there is no condemnation to them that are in Jesus Christ." If I
          find it written, "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself," that man's
          condemnation is his own fault, I am to preach that as well as the next
          clause, "In me is thy help found." We ought, each of us who are
          entrusted with the ministry, to seek to preach all truth. I know it
          may be impossible to tell you all of it. That high hill of truth hath
          mists upon its summit. No mortal eye can see its pinnacle; nor hath
          the foot of man ever trodden it. But yet let us paint the mist, if we
          cannot paint the summit. Let us depict the difficulty itself if we
          cannot unravel it. Let us not hide anything, but if the mountain of
          truth be cloudy at the top, let us say, "Clouds and darkness are
          around him," Let us not deny it; and let us not think of cutting down
          the mountain to our own standard, because we cannot see its summit or
          cannot reach its pinnacle. He who would preach the gospel must preach
          all the gospel. He who would have it said he is a faithful minister,
          must not keep back any part of revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again, am I asked what it is to preach the gospel? I answer to
          preach the gospel is to exalt Jesus Christ. Perhaps this is the best
          answer that I could give. I am very sorry to see very often how little
          the gospel is understood even by some of the best Christians. Some
          time ago there was a young woman under great distress of soul; she
          came to a very pious Christian man, who said "My dear girl, you must
          go home and pray." Well I thought within myself, that is not the Bible
          way at all. It never says, "Go home and pray." The poor girl went
          home; she did pray, and she still continued in distress. Said he, "You
          must wait, you must read the Scriptures and study them." That is not
          the Bible way; that is not exalting Christ; find a great many
          preachers are preaching that kind of doctrine. They tell a poor
          convinced sinner, "You must go home and pray, and read the Scriptures;
          you must attend the ministry;" and so on. Works, works, works --
          instead of "By grace are ye saved through faith," If a penitent should
          come and ask me, "What must I do to be saved?" I would say, "Christ
          must save you -- believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." I
          would neither direct to prayer, nor reading of the Scriptures nor
          attending God's house; but simply direct to faith, naked faith on
          God's gospel. Not that I despise prayer -- that must come after faith.
          Not that I speak a word against the searching of the Scriptures --
          that is an infallible mark of God's children. Not that I find fault
          with attendance on God's word -- God forbid! I love to see people
          there. But none of those things are the way of salvation. It is
          nowhere written -- "He that attendeth chapel shall be saved," or, "He
          that readeth the Bible shall be saved." Nor do I read -- "He that
          prayeth and is baptised shall be saved;" but, "He that believeth," --
          he that has a naked faith on the "Man Christ Jesus," -- on his
          Godhead, on his manhood, is delivered from sin. To preach that faith
          alone saves, is to preach God's truth. Nor will I for one moment
          concede to any man the name of a gospel minister, if he preaches
          anything as the plan of salvation except faith in Jesus Christ, faith,
          faith, nothing but faith in his name. But we are, most of us, very
          much muddled in our ideas. We get so much work stored into our brain,
          such an idea of merit and of doing, wrought into our hearts, that it
          is almost impossible for us to preach justification by faith clearly
          and fully; and when we do, our people won't receive it. We tell them,
          "Believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
          saved." But they have a notion that faith is something so wonderful,
          so mysterious, that it is quite impossible that without doing
          something else they can ever get it. Now, that faith which unites to
          the Lamb is an instantaneous gift of God, and he who believes on the
          Lord Jesus is that moment saved, without anything else whatsoever. Ah!
          my friends, do we not want more exalting Christ in our preaching, and
          more exalting Christ in our living? Poor Mary said, "They have taken
          away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him," And she might
          say so now-a-days if she could rise from the grave. Oh! to have a
          Christ-exalting ministry! Oh! to have preaching that magnifies Christ
          in his person, that extols his divinity, that loves his humanity; to
          have preaching that shows him as prophet, priest, and king to his
          people! to have preaching whereby the spirit manifests the Son of God
          unto his children: to have preaching that says, "Look unto him and be
          ye saved all the ends of the earth," -- Calvary preaching, Calvary
          theology, Calvary books, Calvary sermons! These are the things we
          want, and in proportion as we have Calvary exalted and Christ
          magnified, the gospel is preached in our midst.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The third answer to the question is: to preach the gospel is to
          give every class of character his due. "You are only to preach to
          God's dear people, if you go into that pulpit," said a deacon once to
          a minister. Said the minister, "Have you marked them all on the back,
          that I may know them?" What is the good of this large chapel if I am
          only to preach to God's dear people? They are few enough. God's dear
          people might be held in the vestry. We have many more here besides
          God's dear people, and how am I to be sure, if I am told to preach
          only to God's dear people, that somebody else wont take it to himself?
          At another time some one might say, "Now, be sure you preach to
          sinners. If you do not preach to sinners this morning, you won't
          preach the gospel. We shall only hear you once; and we shall be sure
          you are not right if you do not happen to preach to sinner this
          particular morning, in this particular sermon." What nonsense, my
          friends! There are times when the children must be fed, and there are
          times when the sinner must be warned. There are different times for
          different objects. If a man is preaching to God's saints if it so
          happen that little is said to sinners, is he to be blamed for it,
          provided that at another time when he is not comforting the saints, he
          directs his attention specially to the ungodly? I heard a good remark
          from an intelligent friend of mine the other day. A person was finding
          fault with "Dr. Hawker's Morning and Evening Portions" because they
          were not calculated to convert sinners. He said to the gentleman, "Did
          you ever read; Grote's History of Greece?'" "Yes." Well, that is a
          shocking book, is it not? for it is not calculated to convert sinners.
          "Yes, but," said the other, "Grote's History of Greece' was never
          meant to convert sinners." "No," said my friend, "and if you had read
          the preface to Dr. Hawker's Morning and Evening Portion,' you would
          see that it was never meant to convert sinners, but to feed God's
          people, and if it answers its end the man has been wise, though he has
          not aimed at some other end." Every class of person is to have his
          due. He who preaches solely to saints at all times does not preach the
          gospel; he who preaches solely and only to the sinner; and never to
          the saint, does not preach the whole of the gospel. We have
          amalgamation here. We have the saint who is full of assurance and
          strong; we have the saint who is weak and low in faith; we have the
          young convert; we have the man halting between two opinions; we have
          the moral man; we have the sinner; we have the reprobate; we have the
          outcast. Let each have a word. Let each have a portion of meat in due
          season; not at every season, but in due season. He who omits one class
          of character does not know how to preach the entire gospel. What! Am I
          to be put into the pulpit and to be told that I am to confine myself
          to certain truths only, to comfort God's saints? I will not have it
          so. God gives men hearts to love their fellow-creatures, and are they
          to have no development for that heart? If I love the ungodly am I to
          have no means of speaking to them? May I not tell them of judgment to
          come, of righteousness, and of their sin? God forbid I should so
          stultify my nature and so brutalize myself, as to have a tearless eye
          when I consider the loss of my fellow creatures, and to stand and say
          "Ye are dead, I have nothing to say to you!" and to preach in effect
          if not in words that most damnable heresy, that if men are to be bayed
          they will be saved -- that if they are not to be saved they will not
          be saved; that necessarily, they must sit still and do nothing
          whatever; and that it matters not whether they live in sin or in
          righteousness -- some strong fate has bound them down with adamantine
          chains; and their destiny is so certain that they may live on in sin.
          I believe their destiny is certain -- that as elect, they will be
          saved, and if not elect they are damned for ever. But I do not believe
          the heresy that follows as an inference that therefore men are
          irresponsible and may sit still. That is a heresy against which I have
          ever protested, as being a doctrine of the devil and not of God at
          all. We believe in destiny; we believe in predestination; we believe
          in election and non-election: but, notwithstanding that, we believe
          that we must preach to men, He Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and ye
          shall be saved," but believe not on him and ye are damned.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. I had thought of giving one more answer to this question, but time
          fails me. The answer would have been somewhat like this -- that to
          preach the gospel is not to preach certain truths about the gospel,
          not to preach about the people, but to preach to the people. To preach
          the gospel is not to talk about what the gospel is, but to preach it
          into the heart, not by your own might, but by the influence of the
          Holy Ghost -- not to stand and talk as if we were speaking to the
          angel Gabriel, and telling him certain things, but to speak as man to
          man and pour our heart in to our fellow's heart. This I take it, is to
          preach the gospel, and not to mumble some dry manuscript over on
          Sunday morning or Sunday evening. To preach the gospel is not to send
          a curate to do your duty for you; it is not to put on your fine gown
          and then stand and give out some lofty speculation. To preach the
          gospel is not, with the hands of a bishop, to turn over some beautiful
          specimen of prayer, and then to go down again and leave it to some
          humbler person to speak. Nay; to preach the gospel is to proclaim with
          trumpet tongue and flaming zeal the unsearchable riches of Christ
          Jesus, so that men may hear, and understanding, may turn to God with
          full purpose of heart. This is to preach the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second question is -- How IS IT THAT MINISTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED
          TO GLORY? "For though I preach the gospel I have nothing to glorify
          it." There are some weeds that will grow anywhere; and one of them is
          Pride. Pride will grow on a rock as well as in a garden. Pride will
          grow in the heart of a shoe-black as well as in the heart of an
          alderman. Pride will grow in the heart of a servant girl and equally
          as well in the heart of her mistress. And pride will grow in the
          pulpit. It is a weed that is dreadfully rampant. It wants cutting down
          every week, or else we should stand up to our knees in it. This pulpit
          is a shocking bad soil for pride. It grows terribly; and I scarcely
          know whether you ever find a preacher of the gospel who will not
          confess that he has the greatest temptation to pride. I suppose that
          even those ministers of whom nothing is said, but that they are very
          good people, and who have a City church, with some six people
          attending it, have a temptation to pride. But whether that is so or
          not, I am quite sure wherever there is a large assembly, and wherever
          a great deal of noise and stir is made concerning any man there is a
          great danger of pride. And, mark you, the more proud a man is the
          greater will be his fall at last. If people will hold a minister up in
          their hands and do not keep hold of him, but let him go, what a fall
          he will have, poor fellow, when it is all over. It has been so with
          many. Many men have been held up by the arms of men, they have been
          held up by the arms of praise, and not of prayer; these arms have
          become weak, and down they have fallen. I say there is temptation to
          pride in the pulpit; but there is no ground for it in the pulpit;
          there is no soil for pride to grow on; but it will grow without any.
          "I have nothing to glorify of." But, notwithstanding, there often
          comes in some reason why we should glory, not real, but apparent to
          our ownselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Now, how is it that a true minister feels he has "nothing to
          glorify of." First, because he is very conscious of his own
          imperfections. I think no man will ever form a more just opinion of
          himself than he who is called constantly and incessantly to preach.
          Some man once thought he could preach, and on being allowed to enter
          the pulpit, he found his words did not come quite so freely as he
          expected, and in the utmost trepidation and fear, he leaned over the
          front of the pulpit and said "My friends, if you would come up here,
          it would take the conceit out of you all, I verily believe it would
          out of a great many, could they once try themselves whether they could
          preach. It would take their critical conceit out of them, and make
          them think that after all it was not such easy work. He who preaches
          best feels that he preaches worst. He who has set up some lofty model
          in his own mind of what eloquence should be, and what earnest appeal
          ought to be, will know how much he falls below it. He, best of all,
          can reprove himself when he knows his own deficiency. I do not believe
          when a man does a thing well, that therefore he will glory in it. On
          the other hand, I think that he will be the best judge of his own
          imperfections, and will see them most clearly. He knows what he ought
          to be: other men do not. They stare, and gaze, and think it is
          wonderful, when he thinks it is wonderfully absurd and retires
          wondering that he has not done better. Every true minister will feel
          that he is deficient. He will compare himself with such men as
          Whitfield, with such preachers as those of puritanical times, and he
          will say, "What am I? Like a dwarf beside a giant, an ant-hill by the
          side of the mountain." When he retires to rest on Sabbath-night, he
          will toss from side to side on his bed, because he feels that he has
          missed the mark, that he has not had that earnestness, that solemnity,
          that death-like intenseness of purpose which became his position. He
          will accuse himself of not having dwelt enough on this point, or for
          having shunned the other, or not having been explicit enough on some
          certain subject, or expanded another too much. He will see his own
          faults, for God always chastises his own children at night-time when
          they have done something wrong. We need not others to reprove us; God
          himself takes us in hand, The most highly honored before God will
          often feel himself dishonored in his own esteem.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again, another means of causing us to cease from all glory is the
          fact that God reminds us that all our gifts are borrowed. And
          strikingly have I this morning been reminded of that great truth --
          that all our gifts are borrowed, by reading in a newspaper to the
          following effect: --
        </p>
        <p>
          "Last week, the quiet neighborhood of New Town was much disturbed by
          an occurrence which has thrown a gloom over the entire neighborhood. A
          gentleman of considerable attainment, who has won an honorable degree
          at the university has for some months been deranged. He had kept an
          academy for young gentlemen, but his insanity had obliged him to
          desist from his occupation, and he has for some time lived alone in a
          house in the neighborhood. The landlord obtained a warrant of
          ejectment; and it being found necessary to handcuff him, he was, by
          sad mismanagement, compelled to remain on the steps, exposed to the
          gaze of a great crowd, until at last a vehicle arrived, which conveyed
          him to the asylum. One of his pupils (says the paper) is Mr.
          Spurgeon."
        </p>
        <p>
          The man from whom I learned whatever of human learning I have, has now
          become a raving lunatic in the Asylum! When I saw that, I felt I could
          bend my knee with humble gratitude and thank my God that not yet had
          my reason reeled, not yet had those powers departed. Oh! how thankful
          we ought to be that our talents are preserved to us, and that our mind
          is not gone! Nothing came nearer and closer to me than that. There was
          one who had taken all pains with me -- a man of genius and of ability;
          and yet there he is! how fallen! how fallen! How speedily does human
          nature come from its high estate and sink below the level of the
          brutes? Bless God my friends, for your talents! thank him for your
          reason! thank him for your intellect! Simple as it may be, it is
          enough for you, and if you lost it you would soon mark the difference.
          Take heed to yourself lest in aught you say. "This is Babylon that I
          have builded;" for, remember, both trowel and mortar must come from
          him. The life, the voice, the talent, the imagination, the eloquence
          -- all are the gift of God; and he who has the greatest gifts must
          feel that unto God belong the shield of the mighty, for he has given
          might to his people, and strength unto his servants.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. One more answer to this question. Another means whereby God
          preserves his ministers from glorying is this: He makes them feel
          their constant dependance upon the Holy Ghost. Some do not feel it, I
          confess. Some will venture to preach without the Spirit of God, or
          without entreating it. But I think that no man, who is really
          commissioned from on high, will ever venture to do so, but he will
          feel that he needs the Spirit. Once, while preaching in Scotland, the
          Spirit of God was pleased to desert me, I could not speak as usually I
          have done. I was obliged to tell the people that the chariot wheels
          were taken off; and that the chariot dragged very heavily along. I
          have felt the benefit of that ever since. It humbled me bitterly, for
          I could have crept into a nut-shell, and I would have hidden myself in
          any obscure corner of the earth. I felt as if I should speak no more
          in the name of the Lord, and then the thought came "Oh! thou art an
          ungrateful creature: hath not God spoken by thee hundreds of times?
          And this once, when he would not do so wilt thou upbraid him for it?
          Nay, rather thank him, that a hundred times he hath stood by thee;
          and, if once he hath forsaken thee, admire his goodness, that thus he
          would keep thee humble." Some may imagine that want of study brought
          me into that condition, but I can honestly affirm, that it was not so.
          I think that I am bound to give myself unto reading, and not tempt the
          Spirit by unthought-of effusions. Usually, I deem it a duty to seek a
          sermon of my Master and implore him to impress it on my mind, but on
          that occasion, I think I had even prepared more carefully then than I
          ordinarily do, so that unpreparedness was not the reason. The simple
          fact was this -- "The wind bloweth where it listeth;" and winds do not
          always blow hurricanes. Sometimes the winds themselves are still. And,
          therefore, if I rest on the Spirit, I cannot expect I should always
          feel its power alike. What could I do without the celestial influence,
          for to that I owe everything. By this thought God humbles his
          servants. God will teach us how much we want it. He will not let us
          think we are doing anything ourselves. "Nay, says he, "thou shalt have
          none of the glory. I will take thee down. Art thou thinking I am doing
          this?' I will show thee what thou art without me "Out goes Samson. He
          attacks the Philistines. He fancies he can slay them; but they are on
          him. His eyes are out. His glory is gone, because he trusted not in
          his God, but rested in himself. Every minister will be made to feel
          his dependence upon the Spirit; and then will he, with emphasis, say,
          as Paul did, "If I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glorify of."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now comes the third question, with which we are to finish WHAT IS
          THAT NECESSITY WHICH IS LAID UPON US TO PREACH THY GOSPEL?
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, a very great part of that necessity springs from the call
          itself: If a man be truly called of God to the ministry, I will defy
          him to withhold himself from it. A man who has really within him the
          inspiration of the Holy Ghost calling him to preach cannot help it. He
          must preach. As fire within the bones, so will that influence be until
          it blazes forth Friends may check him, foes criticise him, despisers
          sneer at him, the man is indomitable; he must preach if he has the
          call of heaven. All earth might forsake him; but he would preach to
          the barren mountain-tops. If he has the call of heaven, if he has no
          congregation, he would preach to the rippling waterfalls, and let the
          brooks hear his voice. He could not be silent. He would become a voice
          crying in the wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord." I no more
          believe it possible to stop ministers, than to stop the stars of
          heaven. I think it no more possible to make a man cease from
          preaching, if he is really called, than to stop some mighty cataract,
          by seeking, with an infant's cup, to drink its waters. The man has
          been moved of heaven, who shall stop him? He has been touched of God,
          who shall impede him? With an eagle's wing he must fly; who shall
          chain him to the earth? With seraph's voice he must speak, who shall
          stop his lips? Is not his word like a fire within me? Must I not speak
          if God has placed it there? And when a man does speak as the Spirit
          gives him utterance, he will feel a holy joy akin to heaven; and when
          it is over he wishes to be at his work again, and longs to be once
          more preaching. I do not think young men are called of God to any
          great work who preach once a week, and think they have done their
          duty. I think if God has called a man, he will impel him to be more or
          less constantly at it, and he will feel that he must preach among the
          nations the unsearchable riches of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But another thing will make us preach: we shall feel that woe is
          unto us if we preach not the gospel; and that is the sad destitution
          of this poor fallen world. Oh, minister of the gospel! stand for one
          moment and bethink thyself of thy poor fellow creatures! See them like
          a stream, rushing to eternity -- ten thousand to their endless home
          each solemn moment fly! See the termination of that stream, that
          tremendous cataract which dashes streams of souls into the pit! Oh,
          minister, bethink thyself that men are being damned each hour by
          thousands, and that each time thy pulse beats another soul lifts up
          its eyes in hell, being in torments; bethink thyself how men are
          speeding on their way to destruction, how "the love of many waxeth
          cold" and "iniquity doth abound." I say, is there not a necessity laid
          upon thee? Is it not woe unto thee if thou preachest not the gospel?
          Take thy walk one evening through the streets of London when the dusk
          has gathered, and darkness veils the people. Mark you not yon
          profligate hurrying on to her accursed work? See you not thousands and
          tens of thousands annually ruined? Up from the hospital and the asylum
          there comes a voice, "Woe is unto you if ye preach not the gospel." Go
          to that huge place built around with massive walls, enter the
          dungeons, and see the thieves who have for years spent their lives in
          sin. Wend your way sometimes to that sad square of Newgate, and see
          the murderer hanged. A voice shall come from each house of correction,
          from each prison, from each gallows, saying, "Woe is unto thee if thou
          preachest not the gospel." Go thou to the thousand death-beds, and
          mark how men are perishing in ignorance, not knowing the ways of God.
          See their terror as they approach their Judge, never having known what
          it was to be saved, not even knowing the way; and as you see them
          quivering before their Maker, hear a voice, "Minister, woe is unto
          thee if thou preachest not the gospel." Or take another course. Travel
          round this great metropolis, and stop at the door of some place where
          there is heard the tinkling of bells, chanting and music, but where
          the whore of Babylon hath her sway, and lies are preached for truth;
          and when thou comest home and thinkest of Popery and Puseyism, let a
          voice come to thee, "Minister woe is unto thee if thou preachest not
          the gospel." Or step into the hall of the infidel where he blasphemes
          thy Maker's name; or sit in the theater where plays, libidinous and
          loose are acted, and from all these haunts of vice there comes the
          voice, "Minister, woe is unto thee if thou preachest not the gospel."
          And take thy last solemn walk down to the chambers of the lost; let
          the abyss of hell be visited, and stand thou and hear
        </p>
        <p>"The sullen groans, the hollow moans,</p>
        <p>And shrieks of tortured ghosts."</p>
        <p>
          Put thine ear at hell's gate, and for a little while list to the
          commingled screams and shrieks of agony and fell despair that shall
          lend thine ear; and as thou comest from that sad place with that
          doleful music still affrighting thee, thou wilt hear the voice,
          "Minister! minister! woe is unto thee if thou preaches not the
          gospel." Only let us have these things before our eyes, and we must
          preach. Stop preaching! Stop preaching! Let the sun stop shining, and
          we will preach in darkness. Let the waves stop their ebb and flow, and
          still our voice shall preach the gospel, let the world stop its
          revolutions, let the planets stay their motion; we will still preach
          the gospel. Until the fiery center of this earth shall burst through
          the thick ribs of her brazen mountains, we shall still preach the
          gospel; till the universal conflagration shall dissolve the earth, and
          matter shall be swept away, these lips, or the lips of some others
          called of God, shall still thunder forth the voice of Jehovah. We
          cannot help it. "Necessity is laid upon us, yea woe is unto us if we
          preach not the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my dear hearers, one word with you. There are some persons in
          this audience who are verily guilty in the sight of God because they
          do not preach the gospel. I cannot think out of the fifteen hundred or
          two thousand persons now present, within the reach of my voice, there
          are none who are qualified to preach the gospel besides myself. I have
          not so bad an opinion of you as to conceive myself to be superior in
          intellect to one half of you, or even in the power of preaching God's
          Word: and even supposing I should be, I cannot believe that I have
          such a congregation that there are not among you many who have gifts
          and talents that qualify you to preach the Word. Among the Scotch
          Baptists it is the custom to call upon all the brethren to exhort on
          the Sabbath morning; they have no regular minister to preach on that
          occasion, but every man preaches who likes to get up and speak. That
          is all very well, only, I fear, many unqualified brethren would be the
          greatest speakers, since it is a known fact, that men who have little
          to say will often keep on the longest; and if I were chairman, I
          should say, "Brother, it is written, Speak to edification.' I am sure
          you would not edify yourself and your wife, you had better go and try
          that first, and if you cannot succeed, don't waste our precious time."
        </p>
        <p>
          But still I say, I cannot conceive but what there are some here this
          morning who are flowers "wasting their sweetness in the desert air,
          "gems of purest ray serene," lying in the dark caverns of ocean's
          oblivion. This is a very serious question. If there be any talent in
          the Church at Park Street, let it be developed. If there be any
          preachers in my congregation let them preach. Many ministers make it a
          point to check young men in this respect. There is my hand, such as it
          is, to help any one of you if you think you can tell to sinners round
          what a dear Saviour you have found. I would like to find scores of
          preachers among you; would to God that all the Lord's servants were
          prophets. There are some here who ought to be prophets, only they are
          half afraid -- well, we must devise some scheme of getting rid of
          their bashfulness. I cannot bear to think that while the devil sets
          all his servants to work there should be one servant of Jesus Christ
          asleep. Young man, go home and examine thyself, see what thy abilities
          are, and if thou findest that thou hast ability, then try in some poor
          humble room to tell to a dozen poor people what they must do to be
          saved. You need not aspire to become absolutely and solely dependent
          upon the ministry, but if it should please God, even desire it. He
          that desireth a bishopric desireth a good thing. At any rate seek in
          some way to be preaching the gospel of God. I have preached this
          sermon especially, because I want to commence a movement from this
          place which shall reach others. I want to find some in my church, if
          it be possible, who will preach the gospel. And mark you, if you have
          talent and power, woe is unto you if you preach not the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          But oh! my friends, if it is woe unto us if we preach not the gospel,
          what is the woe unto you if ye hear and receive not the gospel? May
          God give us both to escape from that woe! May the gospel of God be
          unto us the savor of life unto life, and not of death unto death.
