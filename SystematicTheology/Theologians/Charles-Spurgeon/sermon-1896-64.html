          bread.17. He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave.18.
          They afflicted his feet in the stocks: the iron entered into his

          16. And he called a famine upon the land Here the inspired writer
          recounts a most illustrious proof of divine providence towards the
          chosen people, at the time when the covenant might seem to be void and
          disannulled. The inheritance of the land of Canaan (as has been stated
          above) was added, as an earnest or pledge for confirmation. The
          descent of Jacob into Egypt, which deprived his house of the sight of
          the land, could not make the covenant to perish. In this the constancy
          of God shone forth the brighter; yea, by this trial he manifested more
          plainly how provident a father he was in preserving the seed of
          Abraham. But it is better to consider each particular in the verse. In
          the first place, it is taught, that the famine which drove Jacob into
          Egypt did not happen by chance. Although only one particular famine is
          here treated of, it is to be held as a general principle, that there
          is no other cause of any scarcity of sustenance except this, that God,
          in withdrawing his hand, takes away the means of support. The curse of
          God is expressed more emphatically, when it is said, that the famine
          was called; as if it were ready at his command, as a minister of his
          wrath. By this we are instructed, that famine, pestilence, and other
          scourges of God, do not visit men by chance, but are directed by his
          hand whither it pleases him, and are obedient to his will. The manner
          in which the famine was called is next stated, namely, when he brake
          the staff of bread The metaphor of staff is very appropriate; for God
          has put into bread the power and property of strengthening man, by a
          secret virtue which fits it to sustain us. So long as it pleases him
          to nourish us by such means, a staff as it were lies hidden within it.
          This staff is broken in two ways; either, first, when he takes away
          the supply of grain necessary for our nourishment, the sense in which
          it seems to be used in Ezekiel
        </p>
        <p>
          "Moreover, he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff
          of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with
          care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment;"
          Ezekiel 4:16
        </p>
        <p>
          or, secondly, when he breathes in anger upon the bread itself, so that
          those who would satisfy themselves by devouring it, instead of having
          their hunger thereby removed, remain famished still. And certainly to
          the barrenness of the earth this second is commonly added, namely,
          that he takes away the sustaining power which is in bread; for, as it
          is declared in Deuteronomy 8:3, bread does not give life of itself,
          but borrows its secret virtue from the mouth of God.

          17. He sent a man before them This whole passage graphically teaches
          us, that whatever befell that people was by the hand and counsel of
          God. The simple recital would have been to say, that the famine came
          upon the land, after Joseph had been sold by his brethren, and carried
          into Egypt. But the prophet speaks emphatically, declaring that Joseph
          by the divine counsel had been sent before into Egypt, to support his
          father's house, that afterwards the famine was called, and that then,
          by God's providence, a remedy was presented beyond all hope. This,
          indeed, is generally true in human affairs; but there is here
          commemorated a special care which God took in governing and nourishing
          his Church. Moreover, the prophet mentions that as second in place
          which was first in the order of time. Accordingly, in regard to the
          word send, the pluperfect tense would better express the sense, he had
          sent; implying that before God afflicted the land of Canaan with
          famine, he had prepared a remedy for his servant Jacob, and for his
          household, in having sent Joseph before as a steward to provide them
          with food. Here two contraries as it were are stated, to render the
          divine superintendence in the whole the more conspicuous. How was
          Joseph sent of God? It was in this way:- When he was doomed to death,
          it happened that his brethren preferred selling him to leaving him in
          his grave. This selling, if considered merely by itself, like a cloud
          interposed, obscured and concealed the divine providence. When counsel
          was taken to put Joseph to death, who would have expected that he was
          to be the sustainer of his father's house? Afterwards a kind of death
          was devised for him less cruel; but then he was cast into a well or
          pit, and in that situation how could he succor others? The last hope
          was, that at length being sold, he came forth from the pit. But again,
          he was well nigh rotting all his life long in prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who could think that processes so intricate and circuitous were
          controlled by divine providence? The prophet therefore meets this
          difficulty by saying, that in respect of men, he was indeed sold; but
          that he had nevertheless been previously sent by the divine purpose.
          The passage is worthy of notice, admirably vindicating, as it does,
          the providence of God against the perverse stupidity of our corrupt
          nature. Resting on the second causes which meet the eye, or ascribing
          to the direction of man whatever is done in this world, or thinking
          that all things happen by chance, very few trace them to the
          appointment of God. And yet the selling of Joseph is not here
          interposed as a veil to hide divine providence; but is rather set
          forth as a signal instance of it to teach us that whatever men may
          undertake, the issues are in the hand of God; or rather, that by a
          secret influence, he bends the hearts of men in whatever direction he
          pleases, that by their instrumentality, whether they will or no, he
          may bring to pass what he has determined should be done. Agreeably to
          this Joseph said to his brethren, "Now, therefore, be not grieved nor
          angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither; for God did send me
          before you to preserve life," (Genesis 45:5) Farther, God so governs
          human affairs by his secret controlling influence, and overrules men's
          wicked devices to a right end, as that his judgments are
          notwithstanding uncontaminated by the depravity of men. The brethren
          of Joseph wickedly conspire his death; they also wrongfully sell him:
          the fault is in themselves. Contemplate now how God directs and
          controls all. By the hand of these brethren he provides for the good
          both of themselves and of their father Jacob, yea for that of the
          whole Church. This holy purpose contracts no defilement or spot from
          the malice of those who aimed at an entirely opposite end; even as
          Joseph testified afterwards,
        </p>
        <p>
          "But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
          good, to bring to pass as it is this day, to save much people alive,"
          (Genesis 1:20)
        </p>
        <p>
          18 They afflicted his feet in the fetters It is not without cause that
          the Psalmist prosecutes the winding course of Jacob's early history,
          which might so confuse the minds of men as to prevent them from
          directing their attention to the counsel of God. What seemed less
          likely than to believe that God, by so directly opposite and
          circuitous a path, meant to accomplish what he had purposed? But his
          providence, by surmounting so many obstacles, is brought out more
          conspicuously, than if he had despatched the whole matter by a short
          and easy road. Had Joseph, as soon as he arrived in Egypt, been
          presented to the king, and made its governor, the way to what followed
          would have been easy. But when he was carried away to prison, and lay
          there separated from the society of men, living as one half-dead; and
          when his becoming known to the king was a long time subsequent to
          this, and beyond all expectation, such a sudden change renders the
          miracle much more evident. This circuitous course then, which the
          prophet recounts, serves not a little to illustrate the subject in
          hand. Joseph was many times dead before he was sold. Hence it follows,
          that God as often showed his care of his Church by delivering him who
          might be termed her father. When after, having been brought into
          Egypt, Joseph was conveyed from hand to hand till he descended into
          another grave, is it not the more clearly manifest from this that God,
          while he seems to be asleep in heaven, is all the while keeping the
          strictest watch over his servants, and that he is carrying forward his
          purpose more effectually by these various windings, than if he had
          gone straight forward, yea, than if he had run with rapid pace? For
          this reason the prophet affirms that his feet were afflicted in the
          fetters; a fact which, although not stated in the narrative of Moses,
          he speaks of as well known. And no doubt, many things were delivered
          by tradition to the Jews of which no mention is made in the
          Scriptures. It is also probable enough, that, instead of being put at
          first under mild restraint, as was afterwards the case, he was
          rigorously confined. Whether we read, his soul entered into the iron,
          or the iron entered into his soul, the meaning, which, in either case,
          is exactly the same, amounts to this, that the holy man was so galled
          with fetters, that it seemed as if his life had been given over to the
          sword. Whence it follows, that the safety of his life was as hopeless
          as the restoration of life to a dead body.
        </p>
        <p>
          19. Until the time that his word came Here the prophet teaches, that
          although, according to the judgment of the flesh, God seems to be too
          tardy in his steps, yet he holds supreme rule over all things, that he
          may at length accomplish in due time what he has determined. As to the
          term word, it is here doubtless to be taken, not for doctrine or
          instruction, but for a heavenly decree. The relative his admits of
          being understood as well of God himself as of Joseph; but its
          application to the latter appears to me to be preferable, implying
          that Joseph remained in prison until the issue of his affliction was
          manifested, which was hidden in the divine purpose. It is always to be
          kept in mind, that the prophet calls back the minds of men from that
          impious imagination, which would represent fortune as exercising a
          blind and capricious control over human affairs. Since nothing could
          be more involved in uncertainty than the welfare of the Church, whilst
          Joseph was accounted as a condemned person, the prophet here elevates
          our minds, and bids us look at the hidden word, that is, the decree,
          the proper opportunity and time for the manifestation of which had not
          yet arrived. After the same manner I explain what follows, the word of
          God tried him To expound it of Joseph's prophesying, as many do, seems
          too refined. Until the happy issue appeared, which God kept long
          hidden and in suspense, Joseph's patience was severely tried. What
          worldly men, who acknowledge not God to be the Governor of human
          affairs, call fate, the prophet distinguishes by a more appropriate
          name, terming it word, and the word of each man. Nor do I see any
          impropriety in using the French word destinée. When the Stoics
          dispute, or rather babble, about destiny, they not only involve
          themselves and the thing also of which they treat in intricate mazes,
          but, at the same time, involve in perplexity an indubitable truth; for
          in imagining a concatenation of causes, they divest God of the
          government of the world. It is an impious invention so to link
          together causes, interwoven with each other, as that God himself
          should be tied to them. Our faith then ought to mount up to his secret
          counsel, by which, uncontrolled, he directs all things to their end.
          This passage also teaches us that God will continue the afflictions of
          the godly only until they are thereby thoroughly proved.<br />
