          1. They proceed to tell us that the Propator of their scheme was known
          only to Monogenes, who sprang from him; in other words, only to Nous,
          while to all the others he was invisible and incomprehensible. And,
          according to them, Nous alone took pleasure in contemplating the
          Father, and exulting in considering his immeasurable greatness; while
          he also meditated how he might communicate to the rest of the Æons the
          greatness of the Father, revealing to them how vast and mighty he was,
          and how he was without beginning, -- beyond comprehension, and
          altogether incapable of being seen. But, in accordance with the will
          of the Father, Sige restrained him, because it was his design to lead
          them all to an acquaintance with the aforesaid Propator, and to create
          within them a desire of investigating his nature. In like manner, the
          rest of the Æons also, in a kind of quiet way, had a wish to behold
          the Author of their being, and to contemplate that First Cause which
          had no beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But there rushed forth in advance of the rest that Æon who was much
          the latest of them, and was the youngest of the Duodecad which sprang
          from Anthropos and Ecclesia, namely Sophia, and suffered passion apart
          from the embrace of her consort Theletos. This passion, indeed, first
          arose among those who were connected with Nous and Aletheia, but
          passed as by contagion to this degenerate Æon, who acted under a
          pretence of love, but was in reality influenced by temerity, because
          she had not, like Nous, enjoyed communion with the perfect Father.
          This passion, they say, consisted in a desire to search into the
          nature of the Father; for she wished, according to them, to comprehend
          his greatness. When she could not attain her end, inasmuch as she
          aimed at an impossibility, and thus became involved in an extreme
          agony of mind, while both on account of the vast profundity as well as
          the unsearchable nature of the Father, and on account of the love she
          bore him, she was ever stretching herself forward, there was danger
          lest she should at last have been absorbed by his sweetness, and
          resolved into his absolute essence, unless she had met with that Power
          which supports all things, and preserves them outside of the
          unspeakable greatness. This power they term Horos; by whom, they say,
          she was restrained and supported; and that then, having with
          difficulty been brought back to herself, she was convinced that the
          Father is incomprehensible, and so laid aside her original design,
          along with that passion which had arisen within her from the
          overwhelming influence of her admiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But others of them fabulously describe the passion and restoration
          of Sophia as follows: They say that she, having engaged in an
          impossible and impracticable attempt, brought forth an amorphous
          substance, such as her female nature enabled her to produce. When she
          looked upon it, her first feeling was one of grief, on account of the
          imperfection of its generation, and then of fear lest this should end
          her own existence. Next she lost, as it were, all command of herself,
          and was in the greatest perplexity while endeavouring to discover the
          cause of all this, and in what way she might conceal what had
          happened. Being greatly harassed by these passions, she at last
          changed her mind, and endeavoured to return anew to the Father. When,
          however, she in some measure made the attempt, strength failed her,
          and she became a suppliant of the Father. The other Æons, Nous in
          particular, presented their supplications along with her. And hence
          they declare material substance had its beginning from ignorance and
          grief, and fear and bewilderment.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Father afterwards produces, in his own image, by means of
          Monogenes, the above-mentioned Horos, without conjunction,
          masculo-feminine. For they maintain that sometimes the Father acts in
          conjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself
          independent both of male and female. They term this Horos both Stauros
          and Lytrotes, and Carpistes, and Horothetes, and Metagoges. And by
          this Horos they declare that Sophia was purified and established,
          while she was also restored to her proper conjunction. For her
          enthymesis (or inborn idea) having been taken away from her, along
          with its supervening passion, she herself certainly remained within
          the Pleroma; but her enthymesis, with its passion, was separated from
          her by Horos, fenced off, and expelled from that circle. This
          enthymesis was, no doubt, a spiritual substance, possessing some of
          the natural tendencies of an Æon, but at the same time shapeless and
          without form, because it had received nothing. And on this account
          they say that it was an imbecile and feminine production.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. After this substance had been placed outside of the Pleroma of the
          Æons, and its mother restored to her proper conjunction, they tell us
          that Monogenes, acting in accordance with the prudent forethought of
          the Father, gave origin to another conjugal pair, namely Christ and
          the Holy Spirit (lest any of the Æons should fall into a calamity
          similar to that of Sophia), for the purpose of fortifying and
          strengthening the Pleroma, and who at the same time completed the
          number of the Æons. Christ then instructed them as to the nature of
          their conjunction, and taught them that those who possessed a
          comprehension of the Unbegotten were sufficient for themselves. He
          also announced among them what related to the knowledge of the Father,
          -- namely, that he cannot be understood or comprehended, nor so much
          as seen or heard, except in so far as he is known by Monogenes only.
          And the reason why the rest of the Æons possess perpetual existence is
          found in that part of the Father's nature which is incomprehensible;
          but the reason of their origin and formation was situated in that
          which may be comprehended regarding him, that is, in the Son. Christ,
          then, who had just been produced, effected these things among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But the Holy Spirit taught them to give thanks on being all
          rendered equal among themselves, and led them to a state of true
          repose. Thus, then, they tell us that the Æons were constituted equal
          to each other in form and sentiment, so that all became as Nous, and
          Logos, and Anthropos, and Christus. The female Æons, too, became all
          as Aletheia, and Zoe, and Spiritus, and Ecclesia. Everything, then,
          being thus established, and brought into a state of perfect rest, they
          next tell us that these beings sang praises with great joy to the
          Propator, who himself shared in the abounding exaltation. Then, out of
          gratitude for the great benefit which had been conferred on them, the
          whole Pleroma of the Æons, with one design and desire, and with the
          concurrence of Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father also setting
          the seal of His approval on their conduct, brought together whatever
          each one had in himself of the greatest beauty and preciousness; and
          uniting all these contributions so as skilfully to blend the whole,
          they produced, to the honour and glory of Bythus, a being of most
          perfect beauty, the very star of the Pleroma, and the perfect fruit
          [of it], namely Jesus. Him they also speak of under the name of
          Saviour, and Christ, and patronymically, Logos, and Everything,
          because He was formed from the contributions of all. And then we are
          told that, by way of honour, angels of the same nature as Himself were
          simultaneously produced, to act as His body-guard.<br />
