        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.91)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 6th, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "This man, after he had offered on sacrifice for sins for ever, sat
          down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting till his
          enemies be made his footstool." -- Hebrews 10:12-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          AT THE LORD'S table we wish to have no subject for contemplation but
          our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, and we have been wont generally to
          consider him as the crucified One, "the Man of sorrows, and acquainted
          with grief," while we have had before us the emblems of his broken
          body, and of his blood shed for many for the remission of sins; but I
          am not quite sure that the crucified Saviour is the only appropriate
          theme, although, perhaps, the most so. It is well to remember how our
          Saviour left us -- by what road he travelled through the shadows of
          death; but I think it is quite as well to recollect what he is doing
          while he is away from us -- to remember the high glories to which the
          crucified Saviour has attained; and it is, perhaps, as much calculated
          to cheer our spirits to behold him on his throne as to consider him on
          his cross. We have seen him one his cross, in some sense; that is to
          say, the eyes of men on earth did see the crucified Saviour; but we
          have no idea of what his glories are above; they surpass our highest
          thought. Yet faith can see the Saviour exalted on his throne, and
          surely there is no subject that can keep our expectations alive, or
          cheer our drooping faith better than to consider, that while our
          Saviour is absent, he is absent on his throne, and that when he has
          left his Church to sorrow for him, he has not left us comfortless --
          he has promised to come to us -- that while he tarries he is reigning,
          and that while he is absent he is sitting high on his father's throne.

          The Apostle shews here the superiority of Christ's sacrifice over that
          of every other priest. "Every priest standeth daily ministering and
          offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
          sins; but this man," or priest -- for the word "man" is not in the
          original "after he had offered one sacrifice for sins," had finished
          his work, and for ever, he "sat down." You see the superiority of
          Christ's sacrifice rests in this, that the priest offered continually,
          and after he had slaughtered one lamb, another was needed; after one
          scape-goat was driven into the wilderness, a scape-goat was needed the
          next year, "but this man, when he had offered only one sacrifice for
          sins," did what thousands of scape-goats never did, and what hundreds
          of thousands of lambs never could effect. He perfected our salvation,
          and worked out an entire atonement for the sins of all his chosen
          ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall notice, in the first place, this morning, the completeness of
          the Saviour's work of atonement -- he has done it: we shall gather
          that from the context: secondly, the glory which the Saviour has
          assumed; and thirdly, the triumph which he expects. We shall dwell
          very briefly on each point, and endeavour to pack our thoughts as
          closely together as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We are taught here in the first place, THE COMPLETENESS OF THE
          SAVIOUR'S WORK. He has done all that was necessary to be done, to make
          an atonement and an end of sin. He has done so much, that it will
          never be needful for him again to be crucified. His side, once opened,
          has sent forth a stream deep, deep enough, and precious enough, to
          wash away all sin; and he needs not again that his side should be
          opened, or, that any more his hands should be nailed to the cross. I
          infer that his work is finished, from the fact that he is described
          here as sitting down. Christ would not sit down in heaven if he had
          more work to do. Sitting down is the posture of rest. Seldom he sat
          down on earth; he said, "I must be about my Father's business."
          Journey after journey, labour after labour, preaching after preaching,
          followed each other in quick succession. His was a life of incessant
          toil. Rest was a word which Jesus never spelled. he may sit for a
          moment on the well; but even there he preaches to the woman of
          Samaria. He goes into the wilderness, but not to sleep; he goes there
          to pray. His midnights are spent in labours as hard as those of the
          day -- labours of agonising prayer, wrestling with his Father for the
          souls of men. His was a life of continual bodily, mental, and
          spiritual labour; his whole man was exercised. But now he rests; there
          is no more toil for him now; here is no more sweat of blood, no more
          the weary foot, no more the aching head. No more has he to do. He sits
          still. But do you think my Saviour would sit still if he had not done
          all his work? Oh! no beloved; he said once, "For Zion's sake I will
          not rest until her glory goeth forth like a lamp that burneth." And
          sure I am he would not rest, or be sitting still, unless the great
          work of our atonement were fully accomplished. Sit still, blessed
          Jesus, while there is a fear of thy people being lost? Sit still,
          while their salvation is at hazard? No; alike thy truthfulness and thy
          compassion tell us, that thou wouldst still labour if the work were
          still undone. Oh! if the last thread had not been woven in the great
          garment of our righteousness, he would be spinning it now; if the last
          particle of our debt had not been paid, he would be counting it down
          now; and if all were not finished and complete, he would never rest,
          until, like a wise builder, he had laid the top-stone of the temple of
          our salvation. No; the very fact that he sits still, and rests, and is
          at ease, proves that his work is finished and is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then note again, that his sitting at the right hand of God
          implies, that he enjoys pleasure; for at God's right hand "there are
          pleasures for evermore." Now, I think, that the fact that Christ
          enjoys infinite pleasure has in it some degree of proof that he must
          have finished his work. It is true, he had pleasure with his Father
          ere that work was begun; but I cannot conceive that if, after having
          been incarnate, his work was still unfinished, he would rest. He might
          rest before he began the work, but as soon as ever he had begun it,
          you will remember, he said he had a baptism wherewith he must be
          baptised, and he appeared to be hastening to receive the whole of the
          direful baptism of agony. He never rested on earth till the whole work
          was finished; scarcely a smile passed his brow till the whole work was
          done. He was "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief," until he
          could say, "it is finished;" and I could scarcely conceive the Saviour
          happy on his throne if there were any more to do. Surely, living as he
          was on that great throne of his, there would be anxiety in his breast
          if he had not secured the meanest lamb of his fold, and if he had not
          rendered the eternal salvation of every blood-bought one as sacred as
          his own throne. The highest pleasure of Christ is derived from the
          fact, that he has become the "head over all things to his Church," and
          has saved that Church. He has joys as God; but as the man-God, his
          joys spring from the salvation of the souls of men. That is his joy,
          which is full, in the thought that he has finished his work and has
          cut it short in righteousness. I think there is some degree of proof,
          although not perhaps positive proof there, that Jesus must have
          finished his work.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, something else. The fact that it is said he has sat down for
          ever proves that he must have done it. Christ has undertaken to save
          all the souls of the elect. If he has not already saved them, he is
          bound to do something that will save them, fir he has given solemn
          oath and promise to his Father, that he will bring many souls unto
          glory, and that he will make them perfect through his own
          righteousness. He has promised to present our souls unblemished and
          complete, --
        </p>
        <p>"Before the glory of his face</p>
        <p>With joys divinely great."</p>
        <p>
          Well, if he has not done enough to do that, then he must come again to
          do it; but from the fact that he is to sit there for ever, that he is
          to wear no more the thorny crown, that he is never again to leave his
          throne, to cease to be king any more, that he is still to be girded by
          his grandeur and his glory, and sit for ever there, is proof that he
          has accomplished the great work of propitiation. It is certain that he
          must have done all, from the fact that he is to sit there for ever, to
          sit on his throne throughout all ages, more visibly in the ages to
          come, but never to leave it, again to suffer and again to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, the best proof is, that Christ sits at his Father's right hand at
          all. For the very fact that Christ is in heaven, accepted by his
          Father proves that his work must be done. Why, beloved, as long as an
          ambassador from our country is at a foreign court, there must be
          peace; and as long as Jesus Christ our Saviour is at his Father's
          court, it shows that there is real peace between his people and his
          Father. Well, as he will be there for ever, that shows that our peace
          must be continual, and like the waves of the sea, shall never cease.
          But that peace could not have been continual, unless the atonement had
          been wholly made, unless justice had been entirely satisfied; and,
          therefore, from that very fact it becomes certain that the work of
          Christ must be done. What! Christ enter heaven -- Christ sit on his
          Father's right hand before all the guilt of his people was rolled
          away? AH! no; he was the sinner's substitute; and unless he paid the
          sinner's doom, and died the sinner's death, there was no heaven in
          view for me. He stood in the sinner's place, and the guilt of all his
          elect was imputed to him. God accounted him as a sinner, and as a
          sinner, he could not enter heaven until he had washed all that sin
          away in a crimson flood of his own gore -- unless his own
          righteousness had covered up the sins which he had taken on himself,
          and unless his own atonement had taken away those sins which had
          become his by imputation; and the fact that the Father allowed him to
          ascend up on high -- that he gave him leave, as it were, to enter
          heaven, and that he said, "Sit thou on my right hand," proves that he
          must have perfected his Father's work, and that his Father must have
          accepted his sacrifice. But he could not have accepted it if it had
          been imperfect. Thus, therefore, we prove that the work must have been
          finished, since God the Father accepted it. Oh! glorious doctrine!
          This Man has done it; this Man has finished it: this Man has completed
          it. He was the Author, he is the Finisher; he was the Alpha, he is the
          Omega. Salvation is finished, complete; otherwise, he would not has
          ascended up on high, nor would he also sit at the right hand of God.
          Christian! rejoice! Thy salvation is a finished salvation; atonement
          is wholly made; neither stick nor stone of thine is wanted; not one
          stitch is required to that glorious garment of his -- not one patch to
          that glorious robe that he has finished. Tis done -- 'tis done
          perfectly; thou art accepted perfectly in his righteousness; thou art
          purged in his blood. "By one offering he hath perfected for ever them
          that are sanctified."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, our second point -- THE GLORY WHICH HE HAS ASSUMED.
          "After he has offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the
          right hand of God" -- the glory which Christ has assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, by this you are to understand the complex person of Christ; for
          Christ, as God, always was on his Father's throne; he always was God;
          and even when on earth he was still in heaven. The Son of God did not
          cease to be omnipotent and omnipresent, when he came wrapped in the
          garments of clay. He was still on his Father's throne; he never left
          it, never came down from heaven in that sense; he was still there,
          "God over all, blessed for ever." As he has said, "The Son of Man who
          came down from heaven, who, also," at that very moment, was "in
          heaven." But Jesus Christ, as the Man-God, has assumed glories and
          honors which once he had not; for as man, he did not at one time sit
          on his Father's throne; he was a man, a suffering man, a man full of
          pains and groans, more than mortals have ever known: but as God-man,
          he has assumed a dignity next to God; he sits at the right hand of
          God: at the right hand of the glorious Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy
          Ghost, sits the person of the man Jesus Christ, exalted at the right
          hand of the Majesty on High. From this we gather, that the dignity
          which Christ now enjoys is surpassing dignity. There is no honor,
          there is no dignity to be compared to that of Christ. No angel flies
          higher than he does. Save only the great Three-One God, there is none
          to be found in heaven who can be called superior to the person of the
          man Christ Jesus. He sits on the right hand of God, "Far above all
          angels, and principalities, and powers, and every name that is named."
          His Father "hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is
          above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
          things in heaven, and of things on earth, and of things under the
          earth." No dignity can shine like his. The sons of righteousness that
          have turned many to God, are but as stars compared with him, the
          brightest of the suns there. As for angels, they are but flashes of
          his own brightness, emanations from his own glorious self. He sits
          there, the great masterpiece of Deity.
        </p>
        <p>"God, in the person of his Son,</p>
        <p>Hath all his mightiest works outdone."</p>
        <p>
          That glorious man, taken into union with Deity, that mighty Man-God,
          surpasses everything in the glory of his majestic person. Christian!
          remember, thy Master has unsurpassed dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, Christ has real dignity. Some persons have mere
          empty titles, which confer but little power and little authority. But
          the Man-Christ Jesus, while he has many crowns and many titles, has
          not one tinsel crown or one empty title. While he sits there he sits
          not there pro forma; he does not sit there to have nominal honor done
          to him; but he has real honor and real glory. That Man-Christ, who
          once walked the streets of Jerusalem, now sits in heaven, and angels
          bow before him. That Man-Christ, who once hung on Calvary, and there
          expired in agonies the most acute, now, on his Father's throne exalted
          sins, and sways the sceptre of heaven -- nay, devils at his presence
          tremble, the whole earth owns the sway of his providence, and on his
          shoulders the pillars of the universe rest. "He upholdeth all things
          by the word of his power." He overruleth all mortal things, making the
          evil work a good, and the good produce a better, and a better still,
          in infinite progression. The power of the God-Man Christ is infinite;
          you cannot tell how great it is. He is "able to save unto the
          uttermost them that come unto God by him." He is "able to keep us from
          falling, and to present us spotless before his presence." He is able
          to make "all things work together for good." He is "able to subdue all
          things unto himself." He is able to conquer even death, for he hath
          the power of death, and he hath the power of Satan, who once had power
          over death; yea, he is Lord over all things, for his Father hath made
          him so. The glorious dignity of our Saviour! I cannot talk of it in
          words, beloved: all I can say to you must be simple repetition. I can
          only repeat the statements of Scripture. There is no room for flights;
          we must just keep where we ever have been, telling out the story that
          his Father hath exalted him to real honors and real dignities.
        </p>
        <p>
          And once more: this honor that Christ hath now received (I mean the
          Man-God Christ, not the God-Christ, for he already had that, and never
          lost it, and therefore could never obtain it; he was Man-God, and as
          such he was exalted;) was deserved honor; that dignity which his
          Father gave him he well deserved. I have sometimes thought, if all the
          holy spirits in the universe had been asked what should be done for
          the man whom the King delighteth to honor, they would have said,
          Christ must be the man whom God delighteth to honor, and he must sit
          on his Father's right hand. Why, if I might use such a phrase, I can
          almost suppose his mighty Father putting it to the vote of heaven as
          to whether Christ should be exalted, and that they carried it by
          acclamation, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive honor and
          glory for ever and ever." His Father gave him that; but still the
          suffrages of all the saints, and of all the holy angels, said to it,
          amen; and this thing I am certain of, that every heart here -- every
          Christian heart, says amen to it. Ah, beloved, we would exalt him, we
          would crown him, "crown him Lord of all;" not only will his Father
          crown him, but we, ourselves, would exalt him if we had the power; and
          when we shall have power to do it, we will cast our crowns beneath his
          feet, and crown him Lord of all. It is deserved honor. No other being
          in heaven deserves to be there; even the angels are kept there, and
          God "chargeth his angels with folly," and gives them grace, whereby he
          keeps them; and none of his saints deserve it; they feel that hell was
          their desert. But Christ's exaltation was a deserved exaltation. His
          father might say to him, "Well done, my Son, well done; thou hast
          finished the work which I had given thee to do; sit thou for ever
          first of all men, glorified by union with the person of the Son. My
          glorious co-equal Son, sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine
          enemies thy foot-stool."
        </p>
        <p>
          One more illustration, and we have done with this. We must consider
          the exaltation of Christ in heaven as being in some degree a
          representative exaltation. Christ Jesus exalted at the Father's right
          hand, though he has eminent glories, in which the saints must not
          expect to share, essentially he is the express image of the person of
          God, and the brightness of his Father's glory, yet, to a very great
          degree, the honors which Christ has in heaven he has as our
          representative there. Ah! brethren it is sweet to reflect, how
          blessedly Christ lives with his people. Ye all know that we were
        </p>
        <p>"One, when he died, one, when he rose,</p>
        <p>One, when he triumphed o'er his foes;</p>
        <p>One, when in heaven he took his seat,</p>
        <p>And angels sang all hell's defeat."</p>
        <p>
          To-day you know that you are one with him, now, in his presence. We
          are at this moment "raised up together," and may, afterwards, "sit
          together in heavenly places, even in him." As I am represented in
          parliament, and as you are, so is ever child of God represented in
          heaven; but as we are not one with our parliamentary representatives,
          that figure fails to set forth the glorious representation of us which
          our forerunner, Christ, carries on in heaven, for we are actually one
          with him; we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones,
          and his exaltation is our exaltation. He will give us to sit upon his
          throne, for as he has overcome, and is set down with his Father on his
          throne; he has a crown, and he will not wear his crown, unless he
          gives us crowns too; he has a throne, but he is not content with
          having a throne to himself; on his right hand there must be his bride
          in gold of Ophir. And he cannot be there without his bride; the
          Saviour cannot be content to be in heaven unless he has his Church
          with him, which is "the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
          Beloved, look up to Christ now; let the eye of your faith catch a
          sight of him; behold him there, with many crowns upon his head.
          Remember, as ye see him there, ye will one day be like him, and when
          ye shall see him as he is; ye shall not be as great as he is, ye shall
          not be as glorious in degree, but still ye shall, in a measure, share
          the same honors, and enjoy the same happiness and the same dignity
          which he possesses. Be then, content to live unknown for a little
          while; be content to bear the sneer, the jest, the joke, the ribald
          song; be content to walk your weary way, through the fields of
          poverty, or up the hills of affliction; by-and-bye ye shall reign with
          Christ, for he has "made us kings and priests unto God, and we shall
          reign for ever and ever." By-and-bye we shall share the glories of the
          Head; the oil has been poured on his head; it has not trickled down to
          us yet, save only in that faithful fellowship which we have; but
          by-and-bye that oil shall flow to the very skirts of the garments, and
          we, the meanest of his people, shall share a part in the glories of
          his house by being made kings with him, to sit on his throne, even as
          he sit on his Father's throne.

          III. And now, in the last place, WHAT ARE CHRIST'S EXPECTATIONS? We
          are told, he expects that his enemies shall be made his footstool. In
          some sense that is already done; the foes of Christ are, in some
          sense, his footstool now. What is the devil but the very slave of
          Christ? for he doth no more than he is permitted against God's
          children. What is the devil, but the servant of Christ, to fetch his
          children to his loving arms? What are wicked men, but the servants of
          God's providence unwittingly to themselves? Christ has even now "power
          over all flesh that he may give eternal life to as many as God has
          given him," in order that the purposes of Christ might be carried out.
          Christ died for all, and all are now Christ's property. There is not a
          man in this world who does not belong to Christ in that sense, for he
          is God over him and Lord over him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is either Christ's brother, or else Christ's slave, his unwilling
          vassal, that must be dragged out in triumph, if he follow him not
          willingly. In that sense all things are now Christ's.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be we expect greater things than these, beloved, at his coming, when
          all enemies shall be beneath Christ's feet upon earth. We are,
          therefore, many of us, "looking for that blessed hope; that glorious
          appearing of the kingdom of our Saviour Jesus Christ;" many of us are
          expecting that Christ will come; we cannot tell you when, we believe
          it to be folly to pretend to guess the time, but we are expecting that
          even in our life the Son of God will appear, and we know that when he
          shall appear he will tread his foes beneath his feet, and reign from
          pole to pole, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. Not
          long shall anti-christ sit on her seven hills; not long shall the
          false prophet delude his millions; not long shall idol gods mock their
          worshippers with eyes that cannot see, and hands that cannot handle,
          and ears that cannot hear --
        </p>
        <p>"Lo! he comes, with clouds descending;"</p>
        <p>
          In the winds I see his chariot wheels; I know that he approaches and
          when he approaches he "breaks the bow and cuts the spear in sunder,
          and burns the chariot in the fire;" and Christ Jesus shall then be
          king over the whole world. He is king now, virtually; but he is to
          have another kingdom; I cannot see how it is to be a spiritual one,
          for that is come already; he is as much king spiritually now as he
          ever will be in his Church, although his kingdom will assuredly be
          very extensive; but the kingdom that is to come, I take it, will be
          something even greater than the spiritual kingdom; it will be a
          visible kingdom of Christ on earth. Then kings must bow their necks
          before his feet; then at his throne the tribes of earth shall bend;
          then the rich and mighty, the merchants of Tyre, and the travellers
          where gold is found, shall bring their spices and myrrh before him,
          and lay their gold and gems at his feet;
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus shall reign where'er the sun,</p>
        <p>Does his successive journeys run;</p>
        <p>His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,</p>
        <p>Till moons shall wax and wane no more."</p>
        <p>
          Once more, beloved; Christ will have all his enemies put beneath his
          feet, in that great day of judgment. Oh! that will be a terrible
          putting of his foes beneath his feet, when at that second resurrection
          the wicked dead shall rise; when the ungodly shall stand before his
          throne, and his voice shall say, "Depart, ye cursed." Oh! rebel, thou
          that hast despised Christ, it will be a horrible thing for thee, that
          that man, that gibbeted, crucified man, whom thou hast often despised,
          will have power enough to speak thee into hell; that the man whom thou
          hast scoffed and laughed at, and of whom thou hast virtually said, "If
          he be the Son of God, let him come down from the cross," will have
          power enough, in two or three short words, to damn thy soul to all
          eternity: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
          for the devil and his angels." Oh! what a triumph that will be, when
          men, wicked men, persecutors, and all those who opposed Christ, are
          all cast into the lake that burneth! But, if possible, it will be a
          greater triumph, when he who led men astray shall be dragged forth.
        </p>
        <p>"Shall lift his brazen front, with thunder scarred,</p>
        <p>Receive the sentence, and begin anew his hell."</p>
        <p>
          Oh! when Satan shall be condemned, and when the saints shall judge
          angels, and the fallen spirits shall all be under the feet of Christ,
          "then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, he hath put
          all things under him." And when death, too, shall come forth, and the
          "death of death and hell's destruction" shall grind his iron limbs to
          powder, then shall it be said, "Death is swallowed up in victory," for
          the great shout of "Victory, victory, victory," shall drown the
          shrieks of the past; shall put out the sound of the howlings of death;
          and hell shall be swallowed up in victory. He is exalted on high -- he
          sitteth on his Father's right hand, "from henceforth expecting till
          his enemies be made his footstool."<br />
