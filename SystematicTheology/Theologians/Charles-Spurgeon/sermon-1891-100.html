          1. Again, as to their malignantly asserting that if heaven is indeed
          the throne of God, and earth His footstool, and if it is declared that
          the heaven and earth shall pass away, then when these pass away the
          God who sitteth above must also pass away, and therefore He cannot be
          the God who is over all; in the first place, they are ignorant what
          the expression means, that heaven is [His] throne and earth [His]
          footstool. For they do not know what God is, but they imagine that He
          sits after the fashion of a man, and is contained within bounds, but
          does not contain. And they are also unacquainted with [the meaning of]
          the passing away of the heaven and earth; but Paul was not ignorant of
          it when he declared, "For the figure of this world passeth away." In
          the next place, David explains their question, for he says that when
          the fashion of this world passes away, not only shall God remain, but
          His servants also, expressing himself thus in the 101st Psalm: "In the
          beginning, Thou, O Lord, hast founded the earth, and the heavens are
          the works of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure, and
          all shall wax old as a garment; and as a vesture Thou shalt change
          them, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years
          shall not fail. The children of Thy servants shall continue, and their
          seed shall be established for ever;" pointing out plainly what things
          they are that pass away, and who it is that doth endure for ever --
          God, together with His servants. And in like manner Esaias says: "Lift
          up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the
          heaven has been set together as smoke, and the earth shall wax old
          like a garment, and they who dwell therein shall die in like manner.
          But my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not
          pass away." <br />
