          1. [The apostle], foreseeing the wicked speeches of unbelievers, has
          particularized the works which he terms carnal; and he explains
          himself, lest any room for doubt be left to those who do dishonestly
          pervert his meaning, thus saying in the Epistle to the Galatians: "Now
          the works of the flesh are manifest, which are adulteries,
          fornications, uncleanness, luxuriousness, idolatries, witchcrafts,
          hatreds, contentions jealousies, wraths, emulations, animosities,
          irritable speeches, dissensions, heresies, envyings, drunkenness,
          carousings, and such like; of which I warn you, as also I have warned
          you, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
          God." Thus does he point out to his hearers in a more explicit manner
          what it is [he means when he declares], "Flesh and blood shall not
          inherit the kingdom of God." For they who do these things, since they
          do indeed walk after the flesh, have not the power of living unto God.
          And then, again, he proceeds to tell us the spiritual actions which
          vivify a man, that is, the engrafting of the Spirit; thus saying, "But
          the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness,
          benignity, faith, meekness, continence, chastity: against these there
          is no law." As, therefore, he who has gone forward to the better
          things, and has brought forth the fruit of the Spirit, is saved
          altogether because of the communion of the Spirit; so also he who has
          continued in the aforesaid works of the flesh, being truly reckoned as
          carnal, because he did not receive the Spirit of God, shall not have
          power to inherit the kingdom of heaven. As, again, the same apostle
          testifies, saying to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that the
          unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err," he
          says: "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
          effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor
          covetous, nor revilers, nor rapacious persons, shall inherit the
          kingdom of God. And these ye indeed have been; but ye have been
          washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the
          name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God." He shows
          in the clearest manner through what things it is that man goes to
          destruction, if he has continued to live after the flesh; and then, on
          the other hand, [he points out] through what things he is saved. Now
          he says that the things which save are the name of our Lord Jesus
          Christ, and the Spirit of our God.

          2. Since, therefore, in that passage he recounts those works of the
          flesh which are without the Spirit, which bring death [upon their
          doers], he exclaimed at the end of his Epistle, in accordance with
          what he had already declared, "And as we have borne the image of him
          who is of the earth, we shall also bear the image of Him who is from
          heaven. For this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
          the kingdom of God." Now this which he says, "as we have borne the
          image of him who is of the earth," is analogous to what has been
          declared, "And such indeed ye were; but ye have been washed, but ye
          have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God." When, therefore, did
          we bear the image of him who is of the earth? Doubtless it was when
          those actions spoken of as "works of the flesh" used to be wrought in
          us. And then, again, when [do we bear] the image of the heavenly?
          Doubtless when he says, "Ye have been washed," believing in the name
          of the Lord, and receiving His Spirit. Now we have washed away, not
          the substance of our body, nor the image of our [primary] formation,
          but the former vain conversation. In these members, therefore, in
          which we were going to destruction by working the works of corruption,
          in these very members are we made alive by working the works of the
          Spirit.
