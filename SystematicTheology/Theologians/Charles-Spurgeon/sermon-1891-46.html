          1. We may remark, in the first place, regarding their Triacontad, that
          the whole of it marvellously falls to ruin on both sides, that is,
          both as respects defect and excess. They say that to indicate it the
          Lord came to be baptized at the age of thirty years. But this
          assertion really amounts to a manifest subversion of their entire
          argument. As to defect, this happens as follows: first of all, because
          they reckon the Propator among the other Æons. For the Father of all
          ought not to be counted with other productions; He who was not
          produced with that which was produced; He who was unbegotten with that
          which was born; He whom no one comprehends with that which is
          comprehended by Him, and who is on this account [Himself]
          incomprehensible; and He who is without figure with that which has a
          definite shape. For inasmuch as He is superior to the rest, He ought
          not to be numbered with them, and that so that He who is impassible
          and not in error should be reckoned with an Æon subject to passion,
          and actually in error. For I have shown in the book which immediately
          precedes this, that, beginning with Bythus, they reckon up the
          Triacontad to Sophia, whom they describe as the erring Æon; and I have
          also there set forth the names of their [Æons]; but if He be not
          reckoned, there are no longer, on their own showing, thirty
          productions of Æons, but these then become only twenty-nine.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Next, with respect to the first production Ennoea, whom they also
          term Sige, from whom again they describe Nous and Aletheia as having
          been sent forth, they err in both particulars. For it is impossible
          that the thought (Ennoea) of any one, or his silence (Sige), should be
          understood apart from himself; and that, being sent forth beyond him,
          it should possess a special figure of its own. But if they assert that
          the (Ennoea) was not sent forth beyond Him, but continued one with the
          Propator, why then do they reckon her with the other Æons -- with
          those who were not one [with the Father], and are on this account
          ignorant of His greatness? If, however, she was so united (let us take
          this also into consideration), there is then an absolute necessity,
          that from this united and inseparable conjunction, which constitutes
          but one being, there should proceed an unseparated and united
          production, so that it should not be dissimilar to Him who sent it
          forth. But if this be so, then just as Bythus and Sige, so also Nous
          and Aletheia will form one and the same being, ever cleaving mutually
          together. And inasmuch as the one cannot be conceived of without the
          other, just as water cannot [be conceived of] without [the thought of]
          moisture, or fire without [the thought of] heat, or a stone without
          [the thought] of hardness (for these things are mutually bound
          together, and the one cannot be separated from the other, but always
          co-exists with it), so it behoves Bythus to be united in the same way
          with Ennoea, and Nous with Aletheia. Logos and Zoe again, as being
          sent forth by those that are thus united, ought themselves to be
          united, and to constitute only one being. But, according to such a
          process of reasoning, Homo and Ecclesia too, and indeed all the
          remaining conjunctions of the Æons produced, ought to be united, and
          always to co-exist, the one with the other. For there is a necessity
          in their opinion, that a female Æon should exist side by side with a
          male one, inasmuch as she is, so to speak, [the forthputting of] his
          affection.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. These things being so, and such opinions being proclaimed by them,
          they again venture, without a blush, to teach that the younger Æon of
          the Duodecad, whom they also style Sophia, did, apart from union with
          her consort, whom they call Theletus, endure passion, and separately,
          without any assistance from him, gave birth to a production which they
          name |a female from a female.| They thus rush into such utter frenzy,
          as to form two most clearly opposite opinions respecting the same
          point. For if Bythus is ever one with Sige, Nous with Aletheia, Logos
          with Zoe, and so on, as respects the rest, how could Sophia, without
          union with her consort, either suffer or generate anything? And if,
          again, she did really suffer passion apart from him, it necessarily
          follows that the other conjunctions also admit of disjunction and
          separation among themselves, -- a thing which I have already shown to
          be impossible. It is also impossible, therefore, that Sophia suffered
          passion apart from Theletus; and thus, again, their whole system of
          argument is overthrown. For they have yet again derived the whole of
          remaining [material substance], like the composition of a tragedy,
          from that passion which they affirm she experienced apart from union
          with her consort.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If, however, they impudently maintain, in order to preserve from
          ruin their vain imaginations, that the rest of the conjunctions also
          were disjoined and separated from one another on account of this
          latest conjunction, then [I reply that], in the first place, they rest
          upon a thing which is impossible. For how can they separate the
          Propator from his Ennoea, or Nous from Aletheia, or Logos from Zoe,
          and so on with the rest? And how can they themselves maintain that
          they tend again to unity, and are, in fact, all at one, if indeed
          these very conjunctions, which are within the Pleroma, do not preserve
          unity, but are separate from one another; and that to such a degree,
          that they both endure passion and perform the work of generation
          without union one with another, just as hens do apart from intercourse
          with cocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Then, again, their first and first-begotten Ogdoad will be
          overthrown as follows: They must admit that Bythus and Sige, Nous and
          Aletheia, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia, do individually dwell
          in the same Pleroma. But it is impossible that Sige (silence) can
          exist in the presence of Logos (speech), or again, that Logos can
          manifest himself in the presence of Sige. For these are mutually
          destructive of each other, even as light and darkness can by no
          possibility exist in the same place: for if light prevails, there
          cannot be darkness; and if darkness, there cannot be light, since,
          where light appears, darkness is put to flight. In like manner, where
          Sige is, there cannot be Logos; and where Logos is, there certainly
          cannot be Sige. But if they say that Logos simply exists within
          (unexpressed), Sige also will exist within, and will not the less be
          destroyed by the Logos within. But that he really is not merely
          conceived of in the mind, the very order of the production of their
          (Æons) shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Let them not then declare that the first and principal Ogdoad
          consists of Logos and Sige, but let them [as a matter of necessity]
          exclude either Sige or Logos; and then their first and principal
          Ogdoad is at an end. For if they describe the conjunctions [of the
          Æons] as united, then their whole argument fails to pieces. Since, if
          they were united, how could Sophia have generated a defect without
          union with her consort? If, on the other hand, they maintain that, as
          in production, each of the Æons possesses his own peculiar substance,
          then how can Sige and Logos manifest themselves in the same place? So
          far, then, with respect to defect.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. But again, their Triacontad is overthrown as to excess by the
          following considerations. They represent Horos (whom they call by a
          variety of names which I have mentioned in the preceding book) as
          having been produced by Monogenes just like the other Æons. Some of
          them maintain that this Horos was produced by Monogenes, while others
          affirm that he was sent forth by the Propator himself in His own
          image. They affirm further, that a production was formed by Monogenes
          -- Christ and the Holy Spirit; and they do not reckon these in the
          number of the Pleroma, nor the Saviour either, whom they also declare
          to be Totum (all things). Now, it is evident even to a blind man, that
          not merely thirty productions, as they maintain, were sent forth, but
          four more along with these thirty. For they reckon the Propator
          himself in the Pleroma, and those too, who in succession were produced
          by one another. Why is it, then, that those [other beings] are not
          reckoned as existing with these in the same Pleroma, since they were
          produced in the same manner? For what just reason can they assign for
          not reckoning along with the other Æons, either Christ, whom they
          describe as having, according to the Father's will, been produced by
          Monogenes, or the Holy Spirit, or Horos, whom they also call Soter
          (Saviour), and not even the Saviour Himself, who came to impart
          assistance and form to their Mother? Whether is this as if these
          latter were weaker than the former, and therefore unworthy of the name
          of Æons, or of being numbered among them, or as if they were superior
          and more excellent? But how could they be weaker, since they were
          produced for the establishment and rectification of the others? And
          then, again, they cannot possibly be superior to the first and
          principal Tetrad, by which they were also produced; for it, too, is
          reckoned in the number above mentioned. These latter beings, then,
          ought also to have been numbered in the Pleroma of the Æons, or that
          should be deprived of the honour of those Æons which bear this
          appellation (the Tetrad).
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Since, therefore, their Triacontad is thus brought to nought, as I
          have shown, both with respect to defect and excess (for in dealing
          with such a number, either excess or defect [to any extent] will
          render the number untenable, and how much more so great variations?),
          it follows that what they maintain respecting their Ogdoad and
          Duodecad is a mere fable which cannot stand. Their whole system,
          moreover, falls to the ground, when their very foundation is destroyed
          and dissolved into Bythus, that is, into what has no existence. Let
          them, then, henceforth seek to set forth some other reasons why the
          Lord came to be baptized at the age of thirty years, and [explain in
          some other way] the Duodecad of the apostles; and [the fact stated
          regarding] her who suffered from an issue of blood; and all the other
          points respecting which they so madly labour in vain.<br />
