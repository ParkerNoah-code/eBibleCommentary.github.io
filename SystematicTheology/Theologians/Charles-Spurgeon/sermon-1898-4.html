          THE investigation of that important and extensive subject which
          includes what have been usually designated as The Evidences of
          Revelation,' has prescriptively occupied a considerable space in the
          field of theological literature, especially as cultivated in England.
          There is scarcely one, perhaps, of our more eminent divines who has
          not in a greater or less degree distinguished himself in this
          department, and scarcely an aspirant for theological distinction who
          has not thought it one of the surest paths to that eminence, combining
          so many and varied motives of ambition, to come forward as a champion
          in this arena. At the present day it might be supposed the discussion
          of such a subject, taken up as it has been successively in all its
          conceivable different bearings, must be nearly exhausted. It must,
          however, be borne in mind, that, unlike the essential doctrines of
          Christianity, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever,' these
          external accessories constitute a subject which of necessity is
          perpetually taking somewhat at least of a new form, with the
          successive phases of opinion and knowledge. And it thus becomes not an
          unsatisfactory nor unimportant object, from time to time, to review
          the condition in which the discussion stands, and to comment on the
          peculiar features which at any particular epoch it most prominently
          presents, as indicative of strength or weakness -- of the advance and
          security of the cause -- if, in accordance with the real progress of
          enlightenment, its advocates have had the wisdom to rescind what
          better information showed defective, and to substitute views in
          accordance with higher knowledge; or, on the other hand, inevitable
          symptoms of weakness and inefficiency, if such salutary cautions have
          been neglected. To offer some general remarks of this kind on the
          existing state of these discussions will be the object of the present
          Essay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before proceeding to the main question we may, however, properly
          premise a brief reflection on the spirit and temper in which it should
          be discussed. In writings on these subjects it must be confessed we
          too often find indications of a polemical acrimony on questions where
          a calm discussion of arguments would be more becoming, as well as more
          consistent with the proposed object; the too frequent assumption of
          the part of the special partisan and ingenious advocate, when the
          character to be sustained should be rather that of the unbiassed
          judge; too much of hasty and captious objection on the one hand, or of
          settled and inveterate prejudice on the other; too strong a tendency
          not fairly to appreciate, or even to keep out of sight, the broader
          features of the main question, in the eagerness to single out
          particular salient points for attack; too ready a disposition to
          triumph in lesser details, rather than steadily to grasp more
          comprehensive principles, and leave minor difficulties to await their
          solution, or to regard this or that particular argument as if the
          entire credit of the cause were staked upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if on the one side there is often a just complaint that objections
          are urged in a manner and tone offensive to religious feeling and
          conscientious prepossessions, which are, at least, entitled to
          respectful consideration; so, on the other, there is too often evinced
          a want of sympathy with the difficulties which many so seriously feel
          in admitting the alleged evidences, and which many habitual believers
          do not appreciate, perhaps because they have never thought or enquired
          deeply on the subject; or, what is more, have believed it wrong and
          impious to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any appeal to argument must imply perfect freedom of conviction. It is
          a palpable absurdity to put reasons before a man, and yet wish to
          compel him to adopt them, or to anathematize him if he find them
          unconvincing; to repudiate him as an unbeliever, because he is careful
          to find satisfactory grounds for his belief; or to denounce him as a
          sceptic, because he is scrupulous to discriminate the truth; to assert
          that his honest doubts evince a moral obliquity; in a word, that he is
          no judge of his own mind; while it is obviously implied that his
          instructor is so -- or, in other words, is omniscient and infallible.
          When serious difficulties have been felt and acknowledged on any
          important subject, and a writer undertakes the task of endeavouring to
          obviate them, it is but a fair demand that, if the reader be one of
          those who do not feel the difficulties, or do not need or appreciate
          any further argument to enlighten or support his belief, he should not
          cavil at the introduction of topics, which may be valuable to others,
          though needless, or distasteful to himself. Such persons are in no way
          called upon to enter into the discussion, but they are unfair if they
          accuse those who do so of agitating questions of whose existence they
          have been unconscious; and of unsettling men's minds, because their
          own prepossessions have been long settled, and they do not perceive
          the difficulties of others, which it is the very aim of such
          discussion to remove.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps most of the various parties who have at all engaged in the
          discussion of these subjects are agreed in admitting a wide
          distinction between the influences of feeling and those of reason; the
          impressions of conscience and the deductions of intellect; the
          dictations of moral and religious sense, and the conclusions from
          evidence; in reference especially to the questions agitated as to the
          grounds of belief in Divine revelation. Indeed, when we take into
          account the nature of the objects considered, the distinction is
          manifest and undeniable; when a reference is made to matters of
          external fact (insisted on as such) it is obvious that reason and
          intellect can alone be the proper judges of the evidence of such
          facts. When, on the other hand, the question may be as to points of
          moral or religious doctrine, it is equally clear, other and higher
          grounds of judgment and conviction must be appealed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the questions now under consideration, both classes of arguments
          are usually involved. It is the professed principle of at least a
          large section of those who discuss the subject, that the question is
          materially connected with the truth and evidence of certain external
          alleged historical facts: while again, all will admit that the most
          essential and vital portion of the inquiry refers to matters of a
          higher -- of a more internal, moral, and spiritual kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while this distinction is clearly implied and even professedly
          acknowledged by the disputants, it is worthy of careful remark, bow
          extensively it is overlooked and kept out of sight in practice; how
          commonly -- almost universally, we find writers and reasoners taking
          up the question, even with much ability and eloquence, and arguing it
          out sometimes on the one, sometimes on the other ground, forgetful of
          their own professions, and in a way often quite inconsistent with
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we continually find the professed advocates of an external
          revelation and historical evidence, nevertheless making their appeal
          to conscience and feeling, and decrying the exercise of reason; and
          charging those who find critical objections in the evidence with
          spiritual blindness and moral perversity; and on the other hand we
          observe the professed upholders of faith and internal conviction as
          the only sound basis of religion, nevertheless regarding the external
          facts as not less essential truth which it would be profane to
          question. It often seems to be rather the want of clear apprehension
          in the first instance of the distinct kind and character of such
          inquiries, when on the one side directed to the abstract question of
          evidence, and when on the other pointing to the practical object of
          addressing the moral and religious feelings and affections, which
          causes so many writers on these subjects to betray an inconsistency
          between their professed purpose and their mode of carrying it out.
          They avow matter-of-fact inquiry -- a question of the critical
          evidence for alleged events -- yet they pursue it as if it were an
          appeal to moral sentiments; in which case it would be a virtue to
          assent, and a crime to deny: if it be the one, it should not be
          proposed as the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is the common language of orthodox writings and discourses to
          advise the believer, when objections or difficulties arise, not to
          attempt to offer a precise answer, or to argue the point, but rather
          to look at the whole subject as of a kind which ought to be exempt
          from critical scrutiny and be regarded with a submission of judgment,
          in the spirit of humility and faith. This advice may be very just in
          reference to practical impressions; yet if the question be one (as is
          so much insisted on) of external facts, it amounts to neither more nor
          less than a tacit surrender of the claims of external evidence and
          historical reality. We are told that we ought to investigate such high
          questions rather with our affections than with our logic, and approach
          them rather with good dispositions and right motives, and with a
          desire to find the doctrine true; and thus shall discover the real
          assurance of its truth in obeying it; suggestions which, however good
          in a moral and practical sense, are surely inapplicable if it be made
          a question of facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wore inquiring into historical evidence in any other case
          (suppose e.g. of Cæsar's landing in Britain) it would be little to the
          purpose to be told that we must look at the case through our desires
          rather than our reason, and exercise a believing disposition rather
          than rashly scrutinize testimony by critical cavils. Those who speak
          thus on the question of religious belief, in fact shift the basis all
          belief from the alleged evidence of facts to the influence of an
          internal persuasion; they virtually give up the evidential proof so
          strongly insisted on, and confess that the whole is, after all, a mere
          matter of feeling and sentiment, just as much as those to whose views
          they so greatly object as openly avowing the very same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We find certain forms of expression commonly stereotyped among a very
          large class of Divines, whenever a critical difficulty or a sceptical
          exception is urged, which are very significant as to the prevalent
          view of religious evidence. Their reply is always of this tenor: These
          are not subjects on which you can expect demonstrative evidence; you
          must be satisfied to accept such general proof or probability as the
          nature of the question allows: you must not inquire too curiously into
          these things; it is sufficient that we have a general moral evidence
          of the doctrines; exact critical discussion will always rake up
          difficulties, to which perhaps no satisfactory answer can be at once
          given. A precise sceptical caviller will always find new objections as
          soon as the first are refuted. It is in vain to seek to convince
          reason unless the conscience and the will be first well-disposed to
          accept the truth.' Such is the constant language of orthodox
          theologians. What is it but a mere translation into other phraseology,
          of the very assertions of the sceptical transcendentalist?
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, with many who take up these questions, they are almost
          avowedly placed on the ground of practical expediency rather than of
          abstract truth. Good and earnest men become alarmed for the dangerous
          consequences they think likely to result from certain speculations on
          these subjects, and thence in arguing against them, are led to assume
          a tone of superiority, as the guardians of virtue and censors of
          right, rather than as unprejudiced inquirers into the matters-of-fact
          on which, nevertheless, they professedly make the case rest. And thus
          a disposition has been encouraged to regard any such question as one
          of right or wrong, rather than one of truth or error: to treat all
          objections as profane, and to discard exceptions unanswered as
          shocking and immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
          If indeed the discussion were carried on upon the professed ground of
          spiritual impression and religious feeling, there would be a
          consistency in such a course; but when evidential arguments are
          avowedly addressed to the intellect, it is especially preposterous to
          shift the ground, and charge the rejection of them on moral motives;
          while those who impute such bad motives fairly expose themselves to
          the retort, that their own belief may be dictated by other
          considerations than the love of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, in such inquiries there is another material distinction very
          commonly lost sight of; the difference between discussing the truth of
          a conclusion, or opinion, and the mode or means of arriving at it; or
          the arguments by which it is supported. Either may clearly be impugned
          or upheld without implicating the other. We may have the best
          evidence, but draw a wrong conclusion from it; or we may support an
          incontestible truth by very fallacious arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The present discussion is not intended to be of a controversial kind,
          it is purely contemplative and theoretical; it is rather directed to a
          calm and unprejudiced survey of the various opinions and arguments
          adduced, whatever may be their ulterior tendency, on these important
          questions; and to the attempt to state, analyse, and estimate them
          just as they may seem really conducive to the high object professedly
          in view.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of a positive external Divine revelation of some kind has
          formed the very basis of all hitherto received systems of Christian
          belief. The Romanist indeed regards that revelation as of the nature
          of a standing oracle accessible in the living voice of the Church;
          which being infallible, of course sufficiently accredits all the
          doctrines it announces, and constitutes them Divine. A more modified
          view has prevailed among a considerable section of Anglican
          theologians, who ground their faith on the same principles of Church
          authority, divested of its divine and infallible character. Most
          Protestants, with more or less difference of meaning, profess to
          regard revelation as once for all announced, long since finally
          closed, permanently recorded, and accessible only in the written
          Divine word contained in the Scriptures. And the discussion with those
          outside the pale of belief has been entirely one as to the validity of
          those external marks and attestations by which the truth of the
          alleged fact of such communication of the Divine will, was held to be
          substantiated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope and character of the various discussions raised on the
          evidences of religion,' have varied much in different ages, following
          of course both the view adopted of revelation itself, the nature of
          the objections which for the time seemed most prominent, or most
          necessary to be combated, and stamped with the peculiar intellectual
          character, and reasoning tone, of the age to which they belonged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early apologists were rather defenders of the Christian cause
          generally; but when they entered on evidential topics, naturally did
          so rather in accordance with the prevalent modes of thought, than with
          what would now be deemed a philosophic investigation of alleged facts
          and critical appreciation of testimony in support of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In subsequent ages, as the increasing claims of infallible Church
          authority gained ground, to discuss evidence became superfluous, and
          even dangerous and impious; accordingly, of this branch of theological
          literature (unless in the most entire subjection to ecclesiastical
          dictation) the mediæval church presented hardly any specimens.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not perhaps till the 15th century, that any works bearing the
          character of what are now called treatises on the evidences' appeared;
          and these were probably elicited by the sceptical spirit which had
          already begun to show itself, arising out of the subtilties of the
          schoolmen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in modern times, and under Protestant auspices, a greater
          disposition to follow up this kind of discussion has naturally been
          developed. The sterner genius of Protestantism required definition,
          argument, and proof, where the ancient church had been content to
          impress by the claims of authority, veneration, and prescription, and
          thus left the conception of truth to take the form of a mere
          impression of devotional feeling or exalted imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protestantism sought something more definite and substantial, and its
          demands were seconded and supported, more especially by the spirit of
          metaphysical reasoning which so widely extended itself in the 17th
          century, even into the domains of theology; and divines, stirred up by
          the allegations of the Deists, aimed at formal refutations of their
          objections, by drawing out the idea and the proofs of revelation into
          systematic propositions supported by logical arguments. In that and
          the subsequent period the same general style of argument on these
          topics prevailed among the advocates of the Christian cause. The
          appeal was mainly to the miracles of the Gospels, and here it was
          contended we want merely the same testimony of eye-witnesses which
          would suffice to substantiate any ordinary matter of fact;
          accordingly, the narratives were to be traced to writers at the time,
          who were either themselves eye-witnesses, or recorded the testimony of
          those who were so, and the direct transmission of the evidence being
          thus established, everything was held to be demonstrated. If any
          antecedent question was raised, a brief reference to the Divine
          Omnipotence to work the miracles, and to the Divine goodness to
          vouchsafe the revelation and confirm it by such proofs, was all that
          could be required to silence sceptical cavils.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true, indeed, that some consideration of the internal evidence
          derived from the excellence of the doctrines and morality of the
          Gospel was allowed to enter the discussion, but it formed only a
          subordinate branch of the evidences of Christianity. The main and
          essential point was always the consideration of external facts, and
          the attestations of testimony offered in support of them. Assuming
          Christianity to be essentially connected with certain outward and
          sensible events, the main thing to be inquired into and established,
          was the historical evidence of those events, and the genuineness of
          the records of them; if this were satisfactorily made out, then it was
          considered the object was accomplished. The external facts simply
          substantiated, the intrinsic doctrines and declarations of the Gospel
          must by necessary consequence be Divine truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we compare the general tone, character, and pretensions of those
          works which, in our schools and colleges, have been regarded as the
          standard authorities on the subject of the evidences,' we must
          acknowledge a great change in the taste or opinions of the times from
          the commencement of the last century to the present day; which has led
          the student to turn from the erudite folios of Jackson and
          Stillingfleet, or the more condensed arguments of Clarke On the
          Attributes, Grotius de Veritate, and Leslie's Method with the Deists,
          the universal textbooks of a past generation, to the writings of
          Lardner and Paley; the latter of whom, in the beginning of the present
          century, reigned supreme, the acknowledged champion of revelation, and
          the head of a school to which numerous others, as Campbell, Watson,
          and Douglas, contributed their labours. But more recently, these
          authors have been in an eminent degree superseded, by a recurrence to
          the once comparatively neglected resources furnished by Bishop Butler;
          of so much less formal, technical, and positive a kind, yet offering
          wider and more philosophical views of the subject; still, however,
          confessedly not supplying altogether that comprehensive discussion
          which is adapted to the peculiar tone and character of thought and
          existing state of knowledge in our own times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state of opinion and information in different ages is peculiarly
          shown in the tone and character of those discussions which have
          continually arisen, affecting the grounds of religious belief. The
          particular species of difficulty or objection in the reception of
          Christianity, and especially of its external manifestations, which
          have been found most formidable, have varied greatly in different ages
          according to the prevalent modes of thought and the character of the
          dominant philosophy. Thus, the difficulties with respect to miraculous
          evidence in particular, will necessarily be very differently viewed in
          different stages of philosophical and physical information.
          Difficulties in the idea of suspensions of natural laws, in former
          ages were not at all felt, canvassed, or thought of. But in later
          times they have assumed a much deeper importance. In an earlier period
          of our theological literature, the critical investigation of the
          question of miracles was a point scarcely at all appreciated. The
          attacks of the Deists of the 17th and early part of the 18th century
          were almost wholly directed to other points. But the speculations of
          Woolston, and still more the subsequent influence of the celebrated
          Essay of Hume, had the effect of directing the attention of divines
          more pointedly to the precise topic of miraculous evidence; and to
          these causes was added the agitation of the question of the
          ecclesiastical miracles, giving rise to the semi-sceptical discussions
          of Middleton, which called forth a more exact spirit of examination
          into such distinctions as were needed to preserve the miracles of the
          Gospels from the criticisms applied to those of the Church. This
          distinction, in fact, involves a large part of the entire question;
          and towards marking it out effectually, various precautionary rules
          and principles were laid down by several writers. Thus, Bishop
          Warburton suggested as a criterion the necessity of the miracles to
          the ends of the dispensation, which he conceived answered the demands
          of Middleton. Bishop Douglas made it the test -- to connect miracles
          with inspiration in those who wrought them; this, he thought, would
          exclude the miracles of the Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was long since perceived that the argument from necessity of
          miracles is at best a very hazardous one, since it implies the
          presumption of constituting ourselves judges of such necessity, and
          admits the fair objection -- when were miracles more needed than at
          the present day, to indicate the truth amid manifold error, or to
          propagate the faith? And again, in the other case, how is the
          inspiration to be ascertained apart from the miracles? or, if it be,
          what is the use of the miracles? In fact, in proportion as external
          evidence to facts is made the professed demand, it follows that we can
          only recur to those grounds and roles by which the intellect always
          proceeds in the satisfactory investigation of any questions of fact
          and evidence, especially those of physical phenomena. By an adherence
          to those great principles on which all knowledge is acquired -- by a
          reference to the fixed laws of belief, and our convictions of
          established order and analogy -- we estimate the credibility of
          alleged events and the value of testimony, and weigh them more
          carefully in proportion as the matter may appear of greater moment or
          difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          In appreciating the evidence for any events of a striking or wonderful
          kind, we must bear in mind the extreme difficulty which always occurs
          in eliciting the truth, dependent not on the uncertainty in the
          transmission of testimony, but even in cases where we were ourselves
          witnesses, on the enormous influence exerted by our prepossessions
          previous to the event, and by the momentary impressions consequent
          upon it. We look at all events, through the medium of our prejudices,
          or even where we may have no prepossessions, the more sudden and
          remarkable any occurrence may be, the more unprepared we are to judge
          of it accurately or to view it calmly; our after representations,
          especially of any extraordinary and striking event, are always at the
          best mere recollections of our impressions, of ideas dictated by our
          emotions at the time, of surprise and astonishment which the
          suddenness and hurry of the occurrence did not allow us time to reduce
          to reason, or to correct by the sober standard of experience or
          philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Questions of this kind are often perplexed for want of due attention
          to the laws of human thought and belief, and of due distinction in
          ideas and terms. The proposition that an event may be so incredible
          intrinsically as to set aside any degree of testimony,' in no way
          applies to or affects the honesty or veracity of that testimony, or
          the reality of the impressions on the minds of the witnesses, so far
          as it relates to the matter of sensible fact simply. It merely means
          this: that from the nature of our antecedent convictions, the
          probability of some kind of mistake or deception somewhere, though we
          know not where, is greater than the probability of the event really
          happening in the way and from the causes assigned.
        </p>
        <p>
          This of course turns on the general grounds of our antecedent
          convictions. The question agitated is not that of mere testimony, of
          its value, or of its failures. It refers to those antecedent
          considerations which must govern our entire view of the subject, and
          which being dependent on higher laws of belief, must be paramount to
          all attestation, or rather belong to a province distinct from it. What
          is alleged is a case of the supernatural; but no testimony can reach
          to the supernatural; testimony can apply only to apparent sensible
          facts; testimony can only prove an extraordinary and perhaps
          inexplicable occurrence or phenomenon: that it is due to supernatural
          causes is entirely dependent on the previous belief and assumptions of
          the parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If at the present day any very extraordinary and unaccountable fact
          were exhibited before the eyes of an unbiassed, educated,
          well-informed individual, and supposing all suspicion of imposture put
          out of the question, his only conclusion would be that it was
          something he was unable at present to explain; and if at all versed in
          physical studies, he would not for an instant doubt either that it was
          really due to some natural cause, or that if properly recorded and
          examined, it would at some future time receive its explanation by the
          advance of discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is thus the prevalent conviction that at the present day miracles
          are not to be expected, and consequently alleged marvels are commonly
          discredited.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as exceptions proving the rule, it cannot be denied that amid the
          general scepticism, instances sometimes occur of particular persons
          and parties who, on peculiar grounds, firmly believe in the occurrence
          of certain miracles even in our own times. But we invariably find that
          this is only in connexion with their own particular tenets, and
          restricted to the communion to which they are attached. Such
          manifestations of course are believed to have a religious object, and
          afford to the votaries a strong confirmation of their belief, or are
          regarded as among the high privileges vouchsafed to an earnest faith.
          Yet even such persons, almost as a matter of course, utterly discredit
          all such wonders alleged as occurring within the pale of any religion
          except their own; while those of other communions as unhesitatingly
          reject the belief in theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To take a single instance, we may refer to the alleged miraculous
          tongues' among the followers of the late Mr. Irving some years ago. It
          is not, and was not, a question of records or testimony, or
          fallibility of witnesses, or exaggerated or fabulous narratives. At
          the time, the matter was closely scrutinized and inquired into, and
          many perfectly unprejudiced, and even sceptical persons, themselves
          witnessed the effects, and were fully convinced, as, indeed, were most
          candid inquirers at the time, that after all reasonable or possible
          allowance for the influence of delusion or imposture, beyond all
          question, certain extraordinary manifestations did occur. But just as
          little as the mere fact could be disputed, did any sober-minded
          person, except those immediately interested, or influenced by peculiar
          views, for a moment believe those effects to be miraculous. Even
          granting that they could not be explained by any known form of nervous
          affection, or on the like physiological grounds, still that they were
          in some way to be ascribed to natural causes, as yet perhaps little
          understood, was what no one of ordinarily cultivated mind, or
          dispassionate judgment, ever doubted.
        </p>
        <p>
          On such questions we can only hope to form just and legitimate
          conclusions from an extended and unprejudiced study of the laws and
          phenomena of the natural world. The entire range of the inductive
          philosophy is at once based upon, and in every instance tends to
          confirm, by immense accumulation of evidence, the grand truth of the
          universal order and constancy of natural causes, as a primary law of
          belief; so strongly entertained and fixed in the mind of every truly
          inductive inquirer, that he can hardly even conceive the possibility
          of its failure. Yet we sometimes hear language of a different kind.
          There are still some who dwell on the idea of Spinoza, and contend
          that it is idle to object to miracles as violations of natural laws,
          because we know not the extent of nature; that all inexplicable
          phenomena are, in fact, miracles, or at any rate mysteries; that we
          are surrounded by miracles in nature, and on all sides encounter
          phenomena which baffle our attempts at explanation, and limit the
          powers of scientific investigation; phenomena whose causes or nature
          we are , not, and probably never shall be, able to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such are the arguments of those who have failed to grasp the positive
          scientific idea of the power of the inductive philosophy, or the order
          of nature. The boundaries of nature exist only where our present
          knowledge places them; the discoveries of to-morrow will alter and
          enlarge them. The inevitable progress of research must, within a
          longer or shorter period, unravel all that seems most marvellous, and
          what is at present least understood will become as familiarly known to
          the science of the future, as those points which a few centuries ago
          were involved in equal obscurity, but are now thoroughly understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of these, or the like instances, are at all of the same kind, or
          have any characteristics in common with the idea of what is implied by
          the term miracle,' Which is asserted to mean something at variance
          with nature and law; there is not the slightest analogy between an
          unknown or inexplicable phenomenon, and a supposed suspension of a
          known law: even an exceptional case of a known law is included in some
          larger law. Arbitrary interposition is wholly different in kind; no
          argument from the one can apply to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enlarged critical and inductive study of the natural world, cannot
          but tend powerfully to evince the inconceivableness of imagined
          interruptions of natural order, or supposed suspensions of the laws of
          matter, and of that vast series of dependent causation which
          constitutes the legitimate field for the investigation of science,
          whose constancy is the sole warrant for its generalizations, while it
          forms the substantial basis for the grand conclusions of natural
          theology. Such would be the grounds on which our convictions would be
          regulated as to marvellous events at the present day; such the rules
          which we should apply to the like eases narrated in ordinary history.
        </p>
        <p>
          But though, perhaps, the more general admission at the present day of
          critical principles in the study of history, as well as the extension
          of physical knowledge, has done something to diffuse among the better
          informed class more enlightened notions on this subject, taken
          abstractedly, yet they may be still much at a loss to apply such
          principles in all cases: and readily conceive that there are possible
          instances in which large exceptions must be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above remarks may be admitted in respect to events at the present
          day and those narrated in ordinary history; but it will be said there
          may be, and there are, cases which are not like those of the present
          times nor of ordinary history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus if we attempt any uncompromising, rigid scrutiny of the Christian
          miracles, on the same grounds on which we should investigate any
          ordinary narrative of the supernatural or marvellous, we are stopped
          by the admonition not to make an irreverent and profane intrusion into
          what ought to be held sacred and exempt from such unhallowed criticism
          of human reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the champions of the Evidences' of Christianity have professedly
          rested the discussion of the miracles of the New Testament on the
          ground of precise evidence of witnesses, insisting on the historical
          character of the Gospel records, and urging the investigation of the
          truth of the facts on the strict principles of criticism, as they
          would be applied to any other historical narrative. On these grounds,
          it would seem impossible to exempt the miraculous parts of those
          narratives, from such considerations as those which must be resorted
          to in regard to marvellous or supposed supernatural events in general.
          Yet there seems an unwillingness to concede the propriety of such
          examination, and a disposition to regard this as altogether an
          exceptional case. But in proportion as it is so regarded, it must be
          remembered its strictly historical character is forfeited, or at least
          tampered with; and those who would shield it from the criticisms to
          which history and fact are necessarily amenable, cannot in consistency
          be offended at the alternative involved, of a more or less mythical
          interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In history generally our attention is often called to narratives of
          the marvellous: and there is a sense in which they may be viewed with
          reference to its general purport and in connexion with those
          influences on human nature which play so conspicuous a part in many
          events. Thus it has been well remarked by Dean Milman -- History to be
          true must condescend to speak the language of legend; the belief of
          the times is part of the record of the times; and though there may
          occur what may baffle its more calm and searching philosophy, it must
          not disdain that which was the primal, almost universal motive of
          human life.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet in a more general point of view, when we consider the strict
          office of the critical historian, it is obvious that such cases are
          fair subjects of analysis, conducted with the view of ascertaining
          their real relation to nature and fact.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the general maxim that all history is open to criticism as to its
          grounds of evidence, no professed history can be exempt without
          forfeiting its historical character; and in its contents, what is
          properly historical, is, on the same grounds, fairly to be
          distinguished from what may appear to be introduced on other authority
          and with other objects. Thus, the general credit of an historical
          narrative does not exclude the distinct scrutiny into any statements
          of a supernatural kind which it may contain; nor supersede the careful
          estimation of the value of the testimony on which they rest -- the
          directness of its transmission from eye-witnesses, as well as the
          possibility of misconception of its tenor, or of our not being in
          possession of all the circumstances on which a correct judgment can be
          formed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must, however, be confessed that the propriety of such
          dispassionate examination is too little appreciated, or the fairness
          of weighing well the improbabilities on one side, against possible
          openings to misapprehension on the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nature of the laws of all human belief, and the broader grounds of
          probability and credibility of events, have been too little
          investigated, and the great extent to which all testimony must be
          modified by antecedent credibility as determined by such general laws,
          too little commonly understood to be readily applied or allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formerly (as before observed) there was no question as to general
          credibility. But in later times the most orthodox seem to assume that
          interposition would be generally incredible; yet endeavour to lay down
          rules and criteria by which it may be rendered probable, in cases of
          great emergency. Miracles were formerly the rule, latterly the
          exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arguments of Middleton and others, all assume the antecedent
          incredibility of miracles in general, in order to draw more precisely
          the distinction that in certain cases of a very special nature that
          improbability may be removed, as in the case of authenticating a
          revelation. Locke expressly contends that it is the very extraordinary
          nature of such an emergency which renders an extraordinary
          interposition requisite and therefore credible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The belief in Divine interposition must be essentially dependent on
          what we previously admit or believe with respect to the Divine
          attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was formerly argued that every Theist must admit the credibility of
          miracles; but this, it is now seen, depends on the nature and degree
          of his Theism, which may vary through many shades of opinion. It
          depends, in fact, on the precise view taken of the Divine attributes;
          such, of course, as is attainable prior to our admission of
          revelation, or we fall into an argument in a vicious circle. The older
          writers on natural theology, indeed, have professed to deduce very
          exact conclusions as to the Divine perfections, especially
          Omnipotence; conclusions which, according to the physical argument
          already referred to, appear carried beyond those limits to which
          reason or science are competent to lead us; while, in fact, all our
          higher and more precise ideas of the Divine perfections are really
          derived from that very revelation, whose evidence is the point in
          question. The Divine Omnipotence is entirely an inference from the
          language of the Bible, adopted on the assumption of a belief in
          revelation. That with God nothing is impossible,' is the very
          declaration of Scripture; yet on this, the whole belief in miracles is
          built, and thus, with the many, that belief is wholly the result, not
          the antecedent of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          But were these views of the Divine attributes, on the other hand, ever
          so well established, it must be considered that the Theistic argument
          requires to be applied with much caution; since most of those, who
          adopted such theories of the Divine perfections, on abstract grounds,
          have made them the basis of a precisely opposite belief, rejecting
          miracles altogether; on the plea, that our ideas of the Divine
          perfections must directly discredit the notion of occasional
          interposition; that it is derogatory to the idea of Infinite power and
          wisdom, to suppose an order of things so imperfectly established that
          it must be occasionally interrupted and violated when the necessity of
          the case compelled, as the emergency of a revelation was imagined to
          do. But all such Theistic reasonings are but one-sided, and if pushed
          further must lead to a denial of all active operation of the Deity
          whatever; as inconsistent with unchangeable, infinite perfection. Such
          are the arguments of Theodore Parker, who denies miracles because
          everywhere I find law the constant mode of operation of an infinite
          God,' or that of Wegscheider, that the belief in miracles is
          irreconcilable with the idea of an eternal God consistent with
          himself, &amp;c.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paley's grand resource is once believe in a God, and all is easy.'
          Now, no men have evinced a more deep-seated and devout belief in the
          Divine perfections than the writers just named, or others differing
          from them by various shades of opinion, as the late J. Sterling, Mr.
          Emerson, and Professor F. W. Newman. Yet these writers have agreed in
          the inference that the entire view of Theistic principles, in their
          highest spiritual purity, is utterly at variance with all conception
          of suspensions of the laws of nature, or with the idea of any kind of
          external manifestation addressed to the senses, as overruling the
          higher, and as they conceive, sole worthy and fitting convictions of
          moral sense and religious intuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          We here speak impartially and disinterestedly, since we are far from
          agreeing in their reasonings, or even their first principles. But we
          think it deeply incumbent on all who would fairly reason out the case
          of miraculous evidence at the present day, to give a full and patient
          discussion to this entire class of arguments which now command so many
          adherents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In advancing from the argument for miracles to the argument from
          miracles; it should, in the first instance, be considered that the
          evidential force of miracles (to whatever it may amount) is wholly
          relative to the apprehensions of the parties addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, in an evidential' point of view, it by no means follows,
          supposing we at this day were able to explain what in an ignorant age
          was regarded as a miracle, that therefore that event was not equally
          evidential to those immediately addressed.. Columbus's prediction of
          the eclipse to the native islanders was as true an argument to them as
          if the event had really been supernatural.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a consideration adopted by some eminent divines that in the very
          language of the Gospels the distinction is always kept up between mere
          wonders' (tirata) and miracles' or signs' (semeia); that is to say,
          the latter were occurrences not viewed as mere matters of wonder or
          astonishment, but regarded as indications of other truths, specially
          adapted to convince those to whom they were addressed in their
          existing stage of enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archbishop Whately, besides dwelling on this distinction, argues that
          the apostles would not only not have been believed but not even
          listened to, if they had not first roused men's attention by working,
          as we are told they did, special (remarkable) miracles.' (Acts
          xix.11.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have gone further, and have considered the application of
          miracles as little more than is expressed in the ancient proverb,
          thaumata morois' -- which is supposed to be nearly equivalent to the
          rebuke, an evil generation seeketh a sign, &amp;c. (Matt. xii.38.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Schleiermacher regards the miracles as only relatively or apparently
          such, to the apprehensions of the age. By the Jews we know such
          manifestations, especially the power of healing, were held to
          constitute the distinctive marks of the Messiah, according to the
          prophecies of their Scriptures. Signs of an improper or irrelevant
          kind were refused, and even those which were granted were not
          necessarily nor universally conclusive. With some they were so, but
          with the many the case was different. The Pharisees set down the
          miracles of Christ to the power of evil spirits; and in other cases no
          conviction was produced, not even on the apostles. Even Nicodemus,
          notwithstanding his logical reasoning, was but half convinced. While
          Jesus himself, especially to his disciples in private, referred to his
          works as only secondary and subsidiary to the higher evidence of his
          character and doctrine, which was so conspicuous and convincing even
          to his enemies as to draw forth the admission, Never man spake like
          this man.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The later Jews adopted the strange legend of the Sepher Toldeth Yehsu'
          (Book of the Generation of Jesus), which describes his miracles
          substantially as in the Gospels, but says that he obtained his power
          by hiding himself in the Temple, and possessing himself of the secret
          ineffable name, by virtue of which such wonders could be wrought.
        </p>
        <p>
          All moral evidence must essentially have respect to the parties to be
          convinced. Signs' might be adapted peculiarly to the state of moral or
          intellectual progress of one age, or one class of persons, and not be
          suited to that of others. With the cotemporaries of Christ and the
          Apostles, it was not a question of testimony or credibility; it was
          not the mere occurrence of what they all regarded as a supernatural
          event, as such, but the particular character to be assigned to it,
          which was the point in question. And it is to the entire difference in
          the ideas, prepossession, modes, and grounds of belief in those times
          that we may trace the reason why miracles, which would be incredible
          now, were not so in the age and under the circumstances in which they
          are stated to have occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force and function of all moral evidence is nullified and
          destroyed if we seek to apply that kind of argument which does not
          find a response in the previous views or impressions of the individual
          addressed; all evidential reasoning is essentially an adaptation to
          the conditions of mind and thought of the parties addressed, or it
          fails in its object. An evidential appeal which in a long past age was
          convincing as made to the state of knowledge in that age, might have
          not only no effect, but even an injurious tendency, if urged in the
          present, and referring to what is at variance with existing scientific
          conceptions; just as the arguments of the present age would have been
          unintelligible to a former.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his earlier views of miracles Dr. J. H. Newman maintained (agreeing
          therein with Paulus and Rosenmüller,) that most of the Christian
          miracles could only be evidential at the time they were wrought, and
          am not so at present, a view in which a religious writer of a very
          different school, Athanase Coquerel, seems to concur, alleging that
          they can avail only in founding a faith -- not in preserving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also the argument of several of the Reformers, as Luther,
          Huss, and others have reasonably contemplated the miracles as a part
          of the peculiarities of the first outward manifestation and
          development of Christianity; like all other portions of the Divine
          dispensations specially adapted to the age and the condition of those
          to whom they were immediately addressed: but restricted apparently to
          those ages, and at any rate, not in the same form continued to
          subsequent times, when the application of them would be inappropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force of the appeal to miracles must ever be essentially dependent
          on the preconceptions of the parties addressed. Yet even in an age, or
          among a people, entertaining an indiscriminate belief in the
          supernatural, the allegation of particular miracles as evidential may
          be altogether vain; the very extent of their belief may render it
          ineffective in furnishing proofs to authenticate the communications of
          any teacher as a Divine message. The constant belief in the miraculous
          may neutralize all evidential distinctions which it may be attempted
          to deduce. Of this we have a striking instance on record, in the
          labours of the missionary, Henry Martyn, among the Persian Mahometans.
          They believed readily all that he told them of the Scripture miracles,
          but directly paralleled them by wonders of their own; they were proof
          against any argument from the resurrection, because they held that
          their own Sheiks had the power of raising the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also stated that the later Jewish Rabbis, on the same plea that
          miracles were believed to be wrought by so many teachers, of the most
          different doctrines, denied their evidential force altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          By those who take a more enlarged survey of the subject, it cannot
          fail to be remarked how different has been the spirit in which
          miracles were contemplated as they are exhibited to us in the earlier
          stages of ecclesiastical literature, from that in which they have been
          regarded in modern times; and this especially in respect to that
          particular view which has so intimately connected them with precise
          evidential arguments;' and by a school of writers, of whom Paley may
          be taken as the type, and who regard them as the sole external proof
          and certificate of a Divine revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at the present day this evidential' view of miracles as the sole
          or even the principal external attestation to the claims of a Divine
          revelation, is a species of reasoning which appears to have lost
          ground even among the most earnest advocates of Christianity. It is
          now generally admitted that Paley took too exclusive a view in
          asserting that we cannot conceive a revelation substantiated in any
          other way. And it has been even more directly asserted by some zealous
          supporters of Christian doctrine that the external evidences are
          altogether inappropriate and worthless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus by a school of writers of the most highly orthodox pretensions,
          it is elaborately argued, to the effect, that revelation ought to be
          believed though destitute of strict evidence, either internal or
          external; and though we neither see it nor know it. And again, We must
          be as sure that the bishop is Christ's appointed representative, as if
          we actually saw him work miracles as St. Peter and St. Paul did.'
          Another writer of the same school exclaims, As if evidence to the Word
          of God were a thing to be tolerated by a Christian; except as an
          additional condemnation for those who reject it, or as a sort of
          exercise and indulgence for a Christian understanding.' Thus while the
          highest section of Anglican orthodoxy does not hesitate openly to
          disavow the old evidential argument; referring everything to the
          authority of the Church, the more moderate virtually discredit it by a
          general tone of vacillation between the antagonistic claims of reason
          and faith; -- intuition and evidence; -- while the extreme
          evangelical' school, strongly asserting the literal truth of the
          Bible, seeks its evidence wholly in spiritual impressions, regarding
          all exercise of the reason as partaking in the nature of sin. But even
          among less prejudiced thinkers, we find indications of similar views,
          thus a very able critic writing in express defence of the Christian
          cause, speaks of that accumulation of historical testimonies,' which
          the last age erroneously denominated the evidences of Christianity.'
          And the poet Coleridge, than whom no writer has been more earnest in
          upholding and defending Christianity, even in its most orthodox form,
          in speaking of its external attestations, impatiently exclaims,
          Evidences of Christianity! I am weary of the word: make a man feel the
          want of it . . . and you may safely trust it to its own evidence.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But still further: Paley's well-known conclusion to the 5th book of
          his Moral Philosophy, pronounced by Dr. Parr to be the finest prose
          passage in English literature, more especially his final summing up of
          the evidential argument in the words, He alone discovers who proves:
          and no man can prove this point (a future retribution), but the
          teacher who testifies by miracles that his doctrine comes from God,'
          -- calls forth from Coleridge an emphatic protest against the entire
          principle, as being at variance with that moral election which he
          would make the essential basis of religious belief; to which he adds,
          in another place, The cordial admiration with which I peruse the
          preceding passage as a masterpiece of composition would, could I
          convey it, serve as a measure of the vital importance I attach to the
          convictions which impelled me to animadvert on the same passage as
          doctrine.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the most strenuous assertors of miracles have been foremost to
          disclaim the notion of their being the sole certificate of Divine
          communication, and have maintained that the true force of the
          Christian evidences lies in the union and combination of the external
          testimony of miracles, with the internal excellence of the doctrine;
          thus, in fact, practically making the latter the real test of the
          admissibility of the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          The necessity for such a combination of the evidence of miracles with
          the test of the doctrine inculcated is acknowledged in the Bible, both
          under the old and the new dispensations. We read of false prophets who
          might predict signs and wonders, which might come to pass; but this
          was to be of no avail if they led their hearers after other gods.'
        </p>
        <p>
          In like manner, if an angel from heaven' preached any other gospel to
          the Galatians, they were to reject it. And even according to Christ's
          own admonitions, false Christs and false prophets should show signs
          and wonders such as might deceive, if possible, the very elect.'
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this view, the main ground of the admissibility of
          external attestations is the worthiness of their object -- the
          doctrine; its unworthiness will discredit even the most distinctly
          alleged apparent miracles, and such worthiness or unworthiness appeals
          solely to our moral judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          No man has dwelt more forcibly on miraculous evidence than Archbishop
          Whately; yet in relation to the character of Christ as conspiring with
          the external attestations of his mission, he strongly remarks
          (speaking, of some who would ascribe to Christ an unworthy doctrine,
          an equivocal mode of teaching), If I could believe Jesus to have been
          guilty of such subterfuges . . . . . . I not only could not
          acknowledge him as sent from God, but should reject him with the
          deepest moral indignation.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Dean Lyall enters largely into this important qualification in his
          defence of the miraculous argument, applying it in the most unreserved
          manner to the ecclesiastical miracles, which he rejects at once as
          having no connexion with doctrine. We have also on record the remark
          of Dr. Johnson: -- Why, sir, Hume, taking the proposition simply, is
          right; but the Christian revelation is not proved by miracles alone,
          but as connected with prophecies and with the doctrines in
          confirmation of which miracles were wrought.'
        </p>
        <p>
          This has, indeed, been the common argument of the most approved
          divines: it is that long ago urged by Dr. S. Clarke, and recently
          supported by Dean Trench. Yet what is it but to acknowledge the right
          of an appeal, superior to that of all miracles, to our own moral
          tribunal, to the principle that the human mind is competent to sit in
          moral and spiritual tribunal on a professed revelation,' in virtue of
          which Professor F. Newman, as well as many other inquirers, have come
          to so very opposite a conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it has been strongly urged by the last-named writer, if
          miracles are made the sole criterion, then amid the various
          difficulties attending the scrutiny of evidence, and the detection of
          imposture, an advantage is clearly given to the shrewd sceptic over
          the simple-minded and well-disposed disciple, utterly fatal to the
          purity of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          The view of miraculous evidence which allows it to be taken only in
          connexion with, and in fact in subserviency to, the moral and internal
          proof derived from the character of the doctrine, has been pushed to a
          greater extent by the writer last named; who asks, What is the value
          of faith at second hand?' -- Ought any external testimony to overrule
          internal conviction? Ought any moral truth to be received in mere
          obedience to a miracle of sense? and observes that a miracle can only
          address itself to our external senses, and that internal and moral
          impressions must be deemed of a kind paramount to external and
          sensible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it be alleged that this internal sense may be delusive, not less
          so, it is replied, may the external senses deceive us as to the world
          of sense and external evidence. The same author however expressly
          allows that the claims of the historical' and the spiritual,' the
          proofs addressed to reason' and to the internal sense,' may each be
          properly entertained in their respective provinces -- the danger lies
          in confounding them or mistaking the one for the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in the estimation of external evidence, everything depends on our
          preliminary moral convictions, and upon deciding in the first instance
          whether, on the one hand, we are to abandon moral conviction at the
          bidding of a miracle,' or, on the other, to make conformity with moral
          principles the sole test both of the evidences and of the doctrines of
          revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In point of fact, lie contends that the main actual appeal of the
          Apostles, especially of St. Paul, was not to outward testimony or
          logical argument, but to spiritual assurances: -- that even when St.
          Paul does enter on a sort of evidential discussion, his reasoning is
          very unlike what a Paley would have exacted: -- that all real evidence
          is of the spirit -- which alone can judge of spiritual things; that
          the Apostles did not go about proclaiming an infallible book, but the
          convert was to be convinced by his own internal judgment, not called
          on to resign it to a systematized and dogmatic creed. And altogether
          the reasoning of the Apostles (wherever they enter upon the department
          of reasoning), was not according to our logic, but only in accordance
          with the knowledge and philosophy of the age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus in this fundamental assumption of internal evidence, some of the
          most orthodox writers are in fact in close agreement with those
          nominally of a very opposite school.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the argument of Döderlein, that the truth of the doctrine does
          not depend on the miracles, but we must first be convinced of the
          doctrine by its internal evidence.'
        </p>
        <p>
          De Wette and others of the rationalists expressly contend, that the
          real evidence of the divinity of any doctrine can only be its
          accordance with the dictations of this moral sense, and this,
          Wegscheider further insists, was in fact the actual appeal of Christ
          in his teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a word, on this view, it would follow that all external attestation
          would seem superfluous if it concur with, or to be rejected if it
          oppose, these moral convictions. Thus a considerable school have been
          disposed to look to the intrinsic evidence only, and to accept the
          declarations of the Gospel solely on the ground of their intrinsic
          excellence and accordance with our best and highest moral and
          religious convictions; a view which would approach very nearly to
          rejecting its peculiarities altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus considerations of a very different nature are now introduced from
          those formerly entertained; and of a kind which affect the entire
          primary conception of a revelation' and its authority, and not merely
          any alleged external attestations of its truth. Thus any discussion of
          the evidences' at the present day, must have a reference equally to
          the influence of the various systems whether of ancient precedent or
          of modern illumination, which so widely and powerfully affect the
          state of opinion or belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          In whatever light we regard the evidences' of religion, to be of any
          effect, whether external or internal, they must always have a special
          reference to the peculiar capacity and apprehension of the party
          addressed. Points which may be seen to involve the greatest difficulty
          to more profound inquirers, are often such as do not occasion the
          least perplexity to ordinary minds, but are allowed to pass without
          hesitation. To them all difficulties are smoothed down, all objections
          (if for a moment raised) are at once answered by a few plausible
          commonplace generalities, which to their minds see invested with the
          force of axiomatic truths, and to question which they would regard as
          at once idle and impious.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, exceptions held forth as fatal by the shallow
          caviller are seen by the more deeply reflecting in all their actual
          littleness and fallacy. But for the sake of all parties, at the
          present day, especially those who at least profess a disposition for
          pursuing the serious discussion of such momentous subjects, it becomes
          imperatively necessary, that such views of it should be suggested as
          may be really suitable to better informed minds, and may meet the
          increasing demands of an age pretending at least to greater
          enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who have reflected most deeply on the nature of the argument
          from external evidence, will admit that it would naturally possess
          very different degrees of force as addressed to different ages; and in
          a period of advanced physical knowledge the reference to what was
          believed in past times, if at variance with principles now
          acknowledged, could afford little ground of appeal: in fact, would
          damage the argument rather than assist it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even some of the older writers assign a much lower place to the
          evidence of miracles, contrasting it with the conviction of real
          faith, as being merely a preparatory step to it. Thus, an old divine
          observes: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Adducuntur primum ratione exteri ad fidem, et quasi præparantur; . . .
          . . . . signis ergo et miraculis via fidei per sensus et rationem
          sternitur.'
        </p>
        <p>
          And here it should be especially noticed, as characteristic of the
          ideas of his age, that this writer classes the sensible evidence of
          miracles along with the convictions of reason, the very opposite to
          the view which would now be adopted, indicative of the difference in
          physical conceptions, which connects miracles rather with faith as
          they are seen to be inconceivable to reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          These prevalent tendencies in the opinions of the age cannot but be
          regarded as connected with the increasing admission of those broader
          views of physical truth and universal order in nature, which have been
          followed out to higher contemplations, and point to the acknowledgment
          of an overruling and all-pervading supreme intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In advancing beyond these conclusions to the doctrines of revelation,
          we must recognise both the due claims of science to decide on points
          properly belonging to the world of matter, and the independence of
          such considerations which characterizes the disclosure of spiritual
          truth, as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          All reason and science conspire to the confession that beyond the
          domain of physical causation and the possible conceptions of intellect
          or knowledge, there lies open the boundless region of spiritual
          things, which is the sole dominion of faith. And while intellect and
          philosophy are compelled to disown the recognition of anything in the
          world of matter at variance with the first principle of the laws of
          matter -- the universal order and indissoluble unity of physical
          causes -- they are the more ready to admit the higher claims of divine
          mysteries in the invisible and spiritual world. Advancing knowledge,
          while it asserts the dominion of science in physical things, confirms
          that of faith in spiritual; we thus neither impugn the generalizations
          of philosophy, nor allow them to invade the dominion of faith, and
          admit that what is not a subject for a problem may hold its place in a
          creed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an evidential point of view it has been admitted by some of the
          most candid divines that the appeal to miracles, however important in
          the early stages of the Gospel, has become less material in later
          times, and others have even expressly pointed to this as the reason
          why they have been withdrawn; whilst at the present day the most
          earnest advocates of evangelical faith admit that outward marvels are
          needless to spiritual conviction, and triumph in the greater moral
          miracle of a converted and regenerate soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          They echo the declaration of St. Chrysostom -- If you are a believer
          as you ought to be, and love Christ as you ought to love him, you have
          no need of miracles, for these are given to unbelievers.'
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, the evidential argument has but little actual weight with
          the generality of believers. The high moral convictions often referred
          to for internal evidence are, to say the least, probably really felt
          by very few, and the appeal made to miracles as proofs of revelation
          by still fewer; a totally different feeling actuates the many, and the
          spirit of faith is acknowledged where there is little disposition to
          reason at all, or where moral and philosophical considerations are
          absolutely rejected on the highest religious grounds, and everything
          referred to the sovereign power of divine grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matters of clear and positive fact, investigated on critical grounds
          and supported by exact evidence, are properly matters of knowledge,
          not of faith. It is rather in points of less definite character that
          any exercise of faith can take place; it is rather with matters of
          religious belief belonging to a higher and less conceivable class of
          truths, with the mysterious things of the unseen world, that faith
          owns a connexion, and more readily associates itself with spiritual
          ideas, than with external evidence, or physical events and it is
          generally admitted that many points of important religious
          instruction, even conveyed under the form of fictions (as in the
          instances of doctrines inculcated through parables) are more congenial
          to the spirit of faith than any relations of historical events could
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more knowledge advances, the more it has been, and will be,
          acknowledged that Christianity, as a real religion, must be viewed
          apart from connexion with physical things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first dissociation of the spiritual from the physical was rendered
          necessary by the palpable contradictions disclosed by astronomical
          discovery with the letter of Scripture. Another still wider and more
          material step has been effected by the discoveries of geology. More
          recently the antiquity of the human race, and the development of
          species, and the rejection of the idea of creation,' have caused new
          advances in the same direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all these cases there is, indeed, a direct discrepancy between what
          had been taken for revealed truth and certain undeniable existing
          monuments to the contrary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these monuments were interpreted by science and reason, and there
          are other deductions of science and reason referring to alleged
          events, which, though they have left no monuments or permanent effects
          behind them, are not the less legitimately subject to the conclusions
          of positive science, and require a similar concession and recognition
          of the same principle of the independence of spiritual and of physical
          truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far our observations are general: but at the present moment some
          recent publications on the subject seem to call for a few more
          detailed remarks. We have before observed that the style and character
          of works on the evidences' has of necessity varied in different ages,
          Those of Leslie and Grotius have, by common consent, been long since
          superseded by that of Paley. Paley was long the text-book at
          Cambridge; his work was never so extensively popular at Oxford -- it
          has, of late, been entirely disused there. By the public at large
          however once accepted, we do not hesitate to express our belief, that
          before another quarter of a century has elapsed it will be laid on the
          shelf with its predecessors; not that it is a work destitute of high
          merit -- as is pre-eminently true also of those it superseded, and of
          others again anterior to them; but they have all followed the
          irreversible destiny that a work, suited to convince the public mind
          at any one particular period, must be accommodated to the actual
          condition of knowledge, of opinion, and mode of thought of that
          period. It is not a question of abstract excellence, but of relative
          adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paley caught the prevalent tone of thought in his day. Public opinion
          has now taken a different turn; and, what is more important, the style
          and class of difficulties and objections honestly felt has become
          wholly different. New modes of speculation -- new forms of scepticism
          -- have invaded the domain of that settled belief which a past age had
          been accustomed to rest on the Paleyan syllogism. Yet, among several
          works which have of late appeared on the subject, we recognise few
          which at all meet these requirements of existing opinion. Of some of
          the chief of these works, even appearing under the sanction of eminent
          names, we are constrained to remark that they are altogether behind
          the age; that amid much learned and acute remark on matters of detail,
          those material points on which the modern difficulties chiefly turn,
          as well as the theories advanced to meet them, are, for the most part,
          not only ignored and passed over without examination or notice, but
          the entire school of those writers who, with infinitely varied shades
          of view, have dwelt upon these topics and put forth their attempts,
          feeble or powerful as the case may be -- to solve the difficulties --
          to improve the tone of discussion, to reconcile the difficulties of
          reason with the high aspirations and demands of faith -- are all
          indiscriminately confounded in one common category of censure; their
          views dismissed with ridicule as sophistical and fallacious, abused as
          infinitely dangerous, themselves denounced as heretics and infidels,
          and libelled as scoffers and atheists.
        </p>
        <p>
          In truth, the majority of these champions of the evidential logic
          betray an almost entire unconsciousness of the advance of opinion
          around them. Having their own ideas long since cast in the stereotyped
          mould of the past, they seem to expect that a progressing age ought
          still to adhere to the same type, and bow implicitly to a solemn and
          pompous, but childish parade and reiteration, of the one-sided dogmas
          of an obsolete school, coupled with awful denunciations of heterodoxy
          on all who refuse to listen to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paley clearly, as some of his modern commentators do avowedly,
          occupied the position of an advocate, not of a judge. They professedly
          stand up on one side, and challenge the counsel on the other to reply.
          Their object is not truth, but their client's case. The whole argument
          is one of special pleading; we may admire the ingenuity, and confess
          the adroitness with which favourable points are seized, unfavourable
          ones dropped, evaded, or disguised; but we do not find ourselves the
          more impressed with those high and sacred convictions of truth, which
          ought to result rather from the wary, careful, dispassionate
          summing-up on both sides, which is the function of the impartial and
          inflexible judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one topic constantly insisted on as essential to the grounds of
          belief, considered as based on outward historical evidence, is that of
          the credibility of external facts as supported by testimony. This has
          always formed the most material point m the reasonings of the
          evidential writers of former times, however imperfectly and
          unsatisfactorily to existing modes of thought they treated it. And to
          this point, their more recent followers have still almost as
          exclusively directed their attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the representations which they constantly make, we cannot but
          notice a strong apparent tendency and desire to uphold the mere
          assertion of witnesses as the supreme evidence of fact, to the utter
          disparagement of all general grounds of reasoning, analogy, and
          antecedent credibility, by which that testimony may be modified or
          discredited. Yet we remark, that all the instances they adduce, when
          carefully examined, really tend to the very conclusion they are so
          anxious to set aside. Arguments of this kind are sometimes deduced
          from such cases as, e. g., the belief accorded on very slight ground
          of probability in all commercial transactions dependent on the assumed
          credit and character of the negotiating parties; from the conclusions
          acted upon in life assurances, notwithstanding the proverbial
          instability of life; -- and the like: in all which we can see no other
          real drift or tendency than to substantiate instead of disparage the
          necessity for some deeply-seated conviction of permanent order as the
          basis of all probability.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great source of misapprehension in this class of arguments has been
          the undue confusion between the force of testimony in regard to human
          affairs and events in history, and in regard to physical facts. It may
          be true that some of the most surprising occurrences in ordinary
          history are currently, and perhaps correctly accepted, on but slight
          grounds of real testimony; but then they relate to events of a kind
          which, however singular in their particular concomitant circumstances,
          are not pretended to be beyond natural causes, or to involve higher
          questions of intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most seemingly improbable events in human history may be perfectly
          credible, on sufficient testimony, however contradicting ordinary
          experience of human motives and conduct -- simply because we cannot
          assign any limits to the varieties of human dispositions, passions, or
          tendencies, or the extent to which they may be influenced by
          circumstances of which, perhaps, we have little or no knowledge to
          guide us. But no such cases would have the remotest applicability to
          alleged violations of the laws of matter, or interruptions of the
          course of physical causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case of the alleged external attestations of Revelation, is one
          essentially involving considerations of physical evidence. It is not
          one in which such reflexions and habits of thought as arise out of a
          familiarity with human history, and moral argument, will suffice.
          These no doubt and other kindred topics, with which the scholar and
          the moralist are familiar, are of great and fundamental importance to
          our general views of the whole subject of Christian evidence; but the
          particular case of miracles, as such, is one specially bearing on
          purely physical contemplations, and on which no general moral
          principles, no common rules of evidence or logical technicalities, can
          enable us to form a correct judgment. It is not a question which can
          be decided by a few trite and commonplace generalities as to the moral
          government of the world and the belief in the Divine Omnipotence -- or
          as to the validity of human testimony, or the limits of human
          experience. It involves, and is essentially built upon, those grander
          conceptions of the order of nature, those comprehensive primary
          elements of all physical knowledge, those ultimate ideas of universal
          causation, which can only be familiar to those thoroughly versed
          cosmical philosophy in its widest sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an age of physical research like the present, all highly cultivated
          minds and duly advanced intellects have imbibed, more or less, the
          lessons of the inductive philosophy, and have at least in some measure
          learned to appreciate the grand foundation conception of universal law
          -- to recognise the impossibility even of any two material atoms
          subsisting together without a determinate relation -- of any action of
          the one on the other, whether of equilibrium or of motion, without
          reference to a physical cause -- of any modification whatsoever in the
          existing conditions of material agents, unless through the invariable
          operation of a series of eternally impressed consequences, following
          in some necessary chain of orderly connexion -- however imperfectly
          known to us. So clear and indisputable indeed has this great truth
          become -- so deeply seated has it been now admitted to be, in the
          essential nature of sensible things and of the external world, that
          not only do all philosophical inquirers adopt it, a primary principle
          and guiding maxim of all their researches -- but, what is most worthy
          of remark, minds of a less comprehensive capacity, accustomed to
          reason on topics of another character, and on more contracted views,
          have at the present day been constrained to evince some concession to
          this grand principle, even when seeming to oppose it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among writers on these questions, Dean Trench has evinced a higher
          view of physical philosophy than we might have expected from the mere
          promptings of philology and literature, when he affirms that we
          continually behold lower laws held in restraint by higher; mechanic by
          dynamic -- chemical by vital, physical by moral;' remarks which, if
          only followed out, entirely accord with the conclusion of universal
          subordination of causation; though we must remark in passing that the
          meaning of moral laws controlling physical,' is not very clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is for the most part hazardous ground for any general moral
          reasoner to take, to discuss subjects of evidence which essentially
          involve that higher appreciation of physical truth which can be
          attained only from an accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with the
          connected series of the physical and mathematical sciences. Thus, for
          example, the simple but grand truth of the law of conservation, and
          the stability of the heavenly motions, now well understood by all
          sound cosmical philosophers, is but the type of the universal
          self-sustaining and self-evolving powers which pervade all nature. Yet
          the difficulty of conceiving this truth in its simplest
          exemplification was formerly the chief hindrance to the acceptance of
          the solar system -- from the prepossession of the peripatetic dogma
          that there must be a constantly acting moving force to keep it going.
          This very exploded chimera, however, by a singular infatuation, is now
          actually revived as the ground of argument for miraculous
          interposition by redoubtable champions who, to evince their profound
          knowledge of mechanical philosophy, inform us that the whole of nature
          is like a mill, which cannot go on without the continual application
          of a moving power!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these would-be philosophers, we find many anxiously dwelling on the
          topic, so undeniably just in itself, of the danger of incautious
          conclusions -- of the gross errors into which men fall by over-hasty
          generalizations. They recount with triumph the absurd mistakes into
          which some even eminent philosophers have fallen in prematurely
          denying what experience has since fully shown to be true, because in
          the then state of knowledge it seemed incredible. They feel an
          elevating sense of superiority in putting down the arrogance of
          scientific pretensions by alleging the shortsighted dogmatism with
          which men of high repute in science have evinced a scepticism in
          points of vulgar belief, in which, after all, the vulgar belief has
          proved right. They even make a considerable display of reasoning on
          such cases; but we cannot say that those reasonings are particularly
          distinguished for consistency, force, or originality. The philosopher
          (for example) denies the credibility of alleged events professedly in
          their nature at variance with all physical analogy. These writers, in
          reply, affect to make a solemn appeal to the bar of analogy, and
          support it by instances which precisely defeat their own conclusion.
          Thus they advance the novel and profoundly instructive story of an
          Indian who denied the existence of ice as at variance with experience;
          and still more from the contradiction that being solid, it could not
          float in water. In like manner they dwell upon other equally
          interesting stories of a butterfly, who from the experience of his
          ephemeral life in summer, denied that the leaves were ever brown or
          the ground covered with snow; of a child who watched a clock made to
          strike only at noon through many hours, and therefore concluded it
          could never strike; of a person who had observed that fish are
          organised to swim, and therefore concluded there could be no such
          animals as flying fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          These, with a host of other equally recondite, novel, startling, and
          conclusive instances are urged in a tone of solemn wisdom, to prove:
          -- what? That water is converted into ice by a regular known law; that
          it has a specific gravity less than water by some law at present but
          imperfectly understood; that without violation of analogy, fins may be
          modified into wings; that it is part of the great law of climate that
          in winter leaves are brown and the ground sometimes white -- that
          machinery may be made with action intermitting by laws as regular as
          those of its more ordinary operation. In a word, that the philosopher
          who looks to an endless subordinating series of laws of successively
          higher generality, is inconsistent in denying events at variance with
          that subordination!
        </p>
        <p>
          It is indeed curious to notice the elaborate multiplication of
          instances adduced by some of the writers referred to, all really
          tending to prove the subordination of facts to laws, clearly evinced
          as soon as the cases were well understood, though, till then, often
          regarded in a sceptical spirit; while of that scepticism they furnish
          the real and true refutation in the principle of law ultimately
          established, under whatever primary appearance and semblance of
          marvellous discordance from all law. It would be beyond our limits to
          notice in detail such instances as are thus dwelt upon, and apparently
          regarded as of sovereign value and importance, to discredit
          philosophical generalization: -- such as the disbelief in the marvels
          recounted by Marco Polo; of the miracle of the martyrs who spoke
          articulately after their tongues were cut out; the angel seen in the
          air by 2000 persons at Milan; the miraculous balls of fire on the
          spires at Plausac; Herodotus's story of the bird in the mouth of the
          crocodile; narratives of the sea-serpent, marvels of mesmerism and
          electro-biology; all discredited formerly as fables; vaccination
          observed and attested by peasants, but denied and ridiculed by medical
          men: --
        </p>
        <p>
          These and the like cases are all urged as triumphant proofs, of what?
          -- that some men have always been found of unduly sceptical
          tendencies; and sometimes of a rationally cautious turn; who have
          heard strange, and, perhaps, exaggerated narratives, and have
          maintained sometimes a wise, sometimes an unwise, degree of reserve
          and caution in admitting them; though they have since proved in
          accordance with natural causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hallam and Rogers are cited as veritable witnesses to the truth of
          certain effects of mesmerism in their day generally disbelieved; and
          for asserting which they were met with all but an imputation of the
          lie direct.' They admitted, however, that their assertion was founded
          on experience so rare as to be had only once in a century;' but that
          experience has been since universally borne out by all who have
          candidly examined the question, and the apparently isolated and
          marvellous cases have settled down into examples of broad and general
          laws, now fully justified by experience and analogy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physiological evidence is adduced (which we will suppose well
          substantiated) to show that the excision of the whole tongue does not
          take away the power of speech, though that of the extremity does so;
          hence the denial of the story from imperfect experience. So of other
          cases: the angel at Milan was the aerial reflexion of an image on a
          church; the balls of fire, at Plausac, were electrical; the
          sea-serpent was a basking shark, or a stem of sea-weed. A committee of
          the French Academy of Sciences, with Lavoisier at its head, after a
          grave investigation, pronounced the alleged fall of aërolites to be a
          superstitious fable. It is, however, now substantiated, not as a
          miracle, but as a well-known natural phenomenon. Instances of undue
          philosophical scepticism are unfortunately common; but they are the
          errors, not the correct processes, of inductive inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Granting all these instances, we merely ask -- what do they prove? --
          except the real and paramount dominion of the rule of law and order,
          of universal subordination of physical causes, as the sole principle
          and criterion of proof and evidence in the region of physical and
          sensible truth; and nowhere more emphatically than in the history of
          marvels and prodigies, do we find a verification of the truth,
          opinionum commenta delet dies, naturæ judicia confirmat.'
        </p>
        <p>
          This in fact is the sole real result of all the profound parallelisms
          and illustrative anecdotes so confidently but unconsciously adduced by
          these writers with an opposite design.

          What is the real conclusion from the far-famed Historic Doubts and the
          Chronicles of Ecnarf? but simply this -- there is a rational solution,
          a real conformity to analogy and experience, to whatever extent a
          partially informed inquirer might be led to reject the recounted
          apparent wonders on imperfect knowledge, and from too hasty inference;
          these delightful parodies on Scripture (if they prove anything), would
          simply prove that the Bible narrative is no more properly miraculous
          than the marvellous exploits of Napoleon I., or the paradoxical events
          of recent history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a similar scepticism has been evinced by nearly all the first
          physiologists of the day, who have joined in rejecting the development
          theories of Lamarck and the Vestiges; and while they have strenuously
          maintained successive creations, have denied and denounced the alleged
          production of organic life by Messrs. Crosse and Weekes, and stoutly
          maintained the impossibility of spontaneous generation, on the alleged
          ground of contradiction to experience. Yet it is now acknowledged
          under the high sanction of the name of Owen, that creation' is only
          another name for our ignorance of the mode of production; and it has
          been the unanswered and unanswerable argument of another reasoner that
          new species must have originated either out of their inorganic
          elements, or out of previously organized forms; either development or
          spontaneous generation must be true: while a work has now appeared by
          a naturalist of the most acknowledged authority, Mr. Darwin's masterly
          volume on The Origin of Species by the law of natural selection,' --
          which now substantiates on undeniable grounds the very principle so
          long denounced by the first naturalists, -- the origination of new
          species by natural causes: a work which must soon bring about an
          entire revolution of opinion in favour of the grand principle of the
          self-evolving powers of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          By parity of reason it might just as well be objected to Archbishop
          Whately's theory of civilization, we have only for a few centuries
          known anything of savages; how then can we pretend to infer that they
          have never civilized themselves? never, in all that enormous length of
          time which modern discovery has now indisputably assigned to the
          existence of the human race! This theory, however, is now introduced
          as a comment on Paley in support of the credibility of revelation; and
          an admirable argument no doubt it is, though perhaps many would apply
          it in a sense somewhat different from that of the author. If the use
          of fire, the cultivation of the soil, and the like, were Divine
          revelations, the most obvious inference would be that so likewise are
          printing and steam. If the boomerang was divinely communicated to
          savages ignorant of its principle, then surely the disclosure of that
          principle in our time by the gyroscope, was equally so. But no one
          denies revelation in this sense; the philosophy of the age does not
          discredit the inspiration of Prophets and Apostles, though it may
          sometimes believe it in poets, legislators, philosophers, and others
          gifted with high genius. At all events, the revelation of civilization
          does not involve the question of external miracles, which is here the
          sole point in dispute. The main assertion of Paley is that it is
          impossible to conceive a revelation given except by means of miracles.
          This is his primary axiom; but this is precisely the point which the
          modern turn of reasoning most calls in question, and rather adopts the
          belief that a revelation is then most credible, when it appeals least
          to violations of natural causes. Thus, if miracles were in the
          estimation of a former age among the chief supports of Christianity,
          they are at present among the main difficulties, and hindrances to its
          acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first inductive philosophers of the age, Professor Faraday,
          has incurred the unlimited displeasure of these profound
          intellectualists, because he has urged that the mere contracted
          experience of the senses is liable to deception, and that we ought to
          be guided in our conclusions -- and, in fact, can only correct the
          errors of the senses -- by a careful recurrence to the consideration
          of natural laws and extended analogies. In opposition to this
          heretical proposition, they set in array the dictum of two great
          authorities of the Scottish school, Drs. Abercrombie and Chalmers,
          that on a certain amount of testimony we might believe any statement,
          however improbable;' so that if a number of respectable witnesses were
          to concur in asseverating that on a certain occasion they had seen two
          and two make five, we should be bound to believe them!
        </p>
        <p>
          This, perhaps it will be said, is an extreme case. Let us suppose
          another: -- if a number of veracious witnesses were to allege a real
          instance of witchcraft at the present day, there might no doubt be
          found some infatuated persons who would believe it; but the strongest
          of such assertions to any educated man would but prove either that the
          witnesses were cunningly imposed upon, or the wizard himself deluded.
          If the most numerous ship's company were all to asseverate that they
          had seen a mermaid, would any rational persons at the present day
          believe them? That they saw something which they believed to be a
          mermaid, would be easily conceded. No amount of attestation of
          innumerable and honest witnesses, would ever convince any one versed
          in mathematical and mechanical science, that a person had squared the
          circle or discovered perpetual motion. Antecedent credibility depends
          on antecedent knowledge, and enlarged views of the connexion and
          dependence of truths; and the value of any testimony will be modified
          or destroyed in different degrees to minds differently enlightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testimony, after all, is but a second-hand assurance; -- it is but a
          blind guide; testimony can avail nothing against reason. The essential
          question of miracles stands quite apart from any consideration of
          testimony; the question would remain the same, if we had the evidence
          of our own senses to an alleged miracle, that is, to an extraordinary
          or inexplicable fact. It is not the mere fact, but the cause or
          explanation of it, which is the point at issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case, indeed, of the antecedent argument of miracles is very
          clear, however little some are inclined perceive it. In nature and
          from nature, by science and by reason, we neither have nor can
          possibly have any evidence of a Deity working miracles; -- for that,
          we must go out of nature and beyond reason. if we could have any such
          evidence from nature, it could only prove extraordinary natural
          effects, which would not be miracles in the old theological sense, as
          isolated unrelated, and uncaused; whereas no physical fact can be
          conceived as unique, or without analogy and relation to others, and to
          the whole system of natural causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, an alleged miracle can only be regarded in one of two
          ways; -- either (1) abstractedly as a physical event, and therefore to
          be investigated by reason and physical evidence, and referred to
          physical causes, possibly to known causes, but at all events to some
          higher cause or law, if at present unknown; it then ceases to be
          supernatural, yet still might be appealed to in support of religious
          truth, especially as referring to the state of knowledge and
          apprehensions of the parties addressed in past ages; or (2) as
          connected with religious doctrine, regarded in a sacred light,
          asserted on the authority of inspiration. In this case it ceases to be
          capable of investigation by reason, or to own its dominion; it is
          accepted on religious grounds, and can appeal only to the principle
          and influence of faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus miraculous narratives become invested with the character of
          articles of faith, if they be accepted in a less positive and certain
          light, or perhaps as involving more or less of the parabolic or mythic
          character; or at any rate as received in connexion with, and for the
          sake of the doctrine inculcated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the most strenuous advocates of the Christian evidences'
          readily avow, indeed expressly contend, that the attestation of
          miracles is, after all, not irresistible; and that in the very
          uncertainty which confessedly remains lies the trial of faith,' which
          it is thus implied must really rest on some other independent moral
          conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the popular acceptation, it is clear the Gospel miracles are always
          objects, not evidences of faith; and when they are connected specially
          with doctrines, as in several of the higher mysteries of the Christian
          faith, the sanctity which invests the point of faith itself is
          extended to the external narrative in which it is embodied; the
          reverence due to the mystery renders the external events sacred from
          examination, and shields them also within the pale of the sanctuary;
          the miracles are merged in the doctrines with which they are
          connected, and associated with the declarations of spiritual things
          which are, as such, exempt from those criticisms to which physical
          statements would be necessarily amenable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even in a reasoning point of view, those who insist most on the
          positive external proofs, allow that moral evidence is distinguished
          from demonstrative, not only in that it admits of degrees, but snore
          especially in that the same moral argument is of different force to
          different minds. And the advocate of Christian evidence triumphs in
          the acknowledgment that the strength of Christianity lies in the
          variety of its evidences, suited to all varieties of apprehension;
          and, that, amid all the diversities of conception, those who cannot
          appreciate some one class of proofs, will always find cone other
          satisfactory, is itself the crowning evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a firm belief in constant supernatural interposition, the
          cotemporaries of the Apostles were as much blinded to the reception of
          the gospel, as, with an opposite persuasion, others have been at a
          later period. Those who had access to living Divine instruction were
          not superior to the prepossessions and ignorance of their times. There
          never existed an infallible age' of exemption from doubt or prejudice.
          And if to later times records written in the characters of a long past
          epoch are left to be deciphered by the advancing light of learning and
          science, -- the spirit of faith covers continually increasing
          attestation of the Divine authority of the truths they include.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason of the hope that is in us' is not restricted to external
          signs, nor to any one kind of evidence, but consists of such assurance
          as may be most satisfactory to each earnest individual inquirer's own
          mind. And the true acceptance of the entire revealed manifestation of
          Christianity will be most worthily and satisfactorily based on that
          assurance of faith,' by which the Apostle affirms we stand,' (2 Cor.
          ii.4), and which, in accordance with his emphatic declaration, must
          rest, not in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God.' (1 Cor.
          ii.5.)<br />
