          TITLE. Here is a lengthy title, but it helps us much to expound the
          Psalm. To the Chief Musician upon Shushaneduth, or the Lily of
          Testimony. The forty-fifth was on the lilies, and represented the
          kingly warrior in his beauty going forth to war; here we see him
          dividing the spoil and bearing testimony to the glory of God.

          Tunes have strange names apparently, but this results from the fact
          that we do not know what was in the composer's mind, else they might
          seem to be touchingly appropriate; perhaps the music or the musical
          instruments have more to do with this title than the Psalm itself.

        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1.</p></b>Before the days of Saul, Israel
        had been brought very low; during his government it had suffered from
        internal strife, and his reign was closed by an overwhelming disaster at
        Gibeon. David found himself the possessor of a tottering throne,
        troubled with the double evil of factions at home, and invasion from
        abroad. He traced at once the evil to its true source, and began at the
        fountainhead. His were the politics of piety, which after all are the
        wisest and most profound. He knew that the displeasure of the Lord had
        brought calamity upon the nation, and to the removal of that displeasure
        he set himself by earnest prayer.
        <b> <p align="justify">O God, you have cast us off.</p></b> You have
        treated us as foul and offensive things, to be put away; as mean and
        beggarly people, to be shunned with contempt; as useless dead boughs, to
        be torn away from the tree, which they disfigure.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            To be cast off by God is the worst calamity that can befall a man
          </p></i
        >
        or a people; but the worst form of it is when the person is not aware of
        it and is indifferent to it. When the divine desertion causes mourning
        and repentance, it will be but partial and temporary. When a cast off
        soul sighs for its God, it is indeed not cast off at all.
        <b> <p align="justify">You has scattered us.</p></b>David clearly sees
        the fruits of the divine anger, he traces the flight of Israel's
        warriors, the breaking of her power, the division in her body politic,
        to the hand of God.<i>
          Whoever might be the secondary agent of these disasters, he beholds
          the Lord's hand as the prime moving cause, and pleads with the Lord
          concerning the matter.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          Israel was like a city with a breach made in its wall, because her God
          was wroth with her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          These first two verses, with their depressing confession, must be
          regarded as greatly enhancing the power of the faith which in the
          after verses rejoices in better days, through the Lord's gracious
          return unto his people.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">You have been displeased.</p></b> This is the
        secret of our miseries. Had we pleased you, you would have pleased us;
        but as we have walked contrary to you, you have walked contrary to us.
        <b> <p align="justify">O turn yourself to us again.</p></b>Forgive the
        sin and smile once more. Turn us to you, turn to us. Aforetime your face
        was towards your people, be pleased to look on us again with your favor
        and grace.
        <p align="justify">
          Some read it, "You will turn to us again," and it makes but slight
          difference which way we take it, for a true hearted prayer brings a
          blessing so soon that it is no presumption to consider it already
          obtained. There was more need for God to turn to his people than for
          Judah's troops to be brave, or Joab and the commanders wise.
          <i>God with us </i>is better than strong battalions.
          <i>God displeased </i>is more terrible than all the Edomites that ever
          marched into the valley of salt, or all the devils that ever opposed
          the church.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          If the Lord turn to us, what care we for death or Hell? but if he
          withdraws his presence we tremble at the fall of a leaf.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 2. You have made the earth to tremble.</p></b
        >
        Things were as unsettled as though the solid earth had been made to
        quake; nothing was stable; the priests had been murdered by Saul, the
        worst men had been put in office, the military power had been broken by
        the Philistines, and the civil authority had grown despicable through
        insurrections and internal contests.
        <b> <p align="justify">You have broken it.</p></b> As the earth cracks,
        and opens itself in rifts during violent earthquakes, so was the kingdom
        rent with strife and calamity.
        <b> <p align="justify">Heal the breaches thereof.</p></b>As a house in
        time of earthquake is shaken, and the walls begin to crack, and gape
        with threatening fissures, so was it with the kingdom.
        <b> <p align="justify">For it shakes.</p></b> It tottered to a fall; if
        not soon propped up and repaired it would come down in complete ruin. So
        far gone was Israel, that only God's interposition could preserve it
        from utter destruction. How often have we seen churches in this
        condition, and how suitable is the prayer before us, in which the
        extremity of the need is used as an argument for help.
        <p align="justify">
          The like may be said of our personal religion, it is sometimes so
          tried, that like a house shaken by earthquake it is ready to come down
          with a crash, and none but the Lord himself can repair its breaches,
          and save us from utter destruction.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. You have showed your people hard things.
          </p></b
        >
        Hardships had been heaped upon them, and the psalmist traces these
        rigorous providences to their fountainhead.
        <i
          >Nothing had happened by chance, but all had come by divine design and
          with a purpose</i
        >—yet for all that things had gone hard with Israel. The psalmist claims
        that they were still the Lord's own people, though in the first verse he
        had said, "you have cast us off." The language of complaint is usually
        confused, and faith in time of trouble before long contradicts the
        desponding statements of the flesh.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            You have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
          </p></b
        >
        Our afflictions have made us like men drunken with some potent and
        bitter wine; we are in amazement, confusion, delirium; our steps reel,
        and we stagger as those about to fall.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">

            their abounding and deep-seated diseases.

        >Astonishing evils bring with them astonishing results. The grapes of
        the vineyard of sin produce a wine which fills the most hardened with
        anguish when justice compels them to quaff the cup. There is a fire
        water of anguish of soul which even to the righteous makes a cup of
        trembling, which causes them to be exceeding sorrowful almost unto
        death. When grief becomes so habitual as to be our drink, and to take
        the place of our joys, becoming our only wine, then are we in an evil
        case indeed. <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4.</p></b> Here the strain
        takes a turn. The Lord has called back to himself his servants, and
        commissioned them for his service, presenting them with a standard to be
        used in his wars.
        <b>

        fitted for the Lord's favor, he gave them an ensign, which would be both
        a rallying point for their hosts, a proof that he had sent them to
        fight, and a guarantee of victory.
        <p align="justify">
          The bravest men are usually entrusted with the banner, and it is
          certain that
          <i>those who fear God must have less fear of man than any others. </i
          >The Lord has given us the standard of the gospel, let us live to
          uphold it, and if needful die to defend it. Our right to contend for
          God, and our reason for expecting success, are found in the fact that
          the faith has been once committed to the saints, and that by the Lord
          himself.

        Banners are for the breeze, the sun, the battle. Israel might well come
        forth boldly, for a sacred standard was borne aloft before them.
        <p align="justify">
          To publish the gospel is a sacred duty, to be ashamed of it is a
          deadly sin.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The truth of God was involved in the triumph of David's armies, he had
          promised them victory; and so in the proclamation of the gospel we
          need feel no hesitancy, for as surely as God is true he will give
          success to his own word. For the truth's sake, and because the true
          God is on our side, let us in these modern days of warfare emulate the
          warriors of Israel, and unfurl our banners to the breeze with
          confident joy. Dark signs of present or coming ill must not dishearten
          us; if the Lord had meant to destroy us he would not have given us the
          gospel; the very fact that he has revealed himself in Christ Jesus
          involves the certainty of victory.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> There is so much in the fact of a
        banner being given to the hosts of Israel, so much of hope, of duty, of
        comfort, that a pause is fitly introduced. The sense justifies it, and
        the more joyful strain of the music necessitates it.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 5. That your beloved may be delivered.</p></b
        >
        David was the Lord's beloved, his name signifies "dear, or beloved," and
        there was in Israel a remnant according to the election of grace, who
        were the beloved of the Lord; for their sakes the Lord wrought great
        marvels, and he had an eye to them in all his mighty acts.
        <i
          >God's beloved are the inner seed, for whose sake he preserves the
          entire nation, which acts as a husk to the vital part.
        </i>
        <p align="justify">
          This is the main design of providence,
          <b>That your beloved may be delivered</b>; if it were not for their
          sakes he would neither give a banner nor send victory to it.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Save with your right hand, and hear me.</p></b>
        Save at once, before the prayer is over; the case is desperate unless
        there be immediate salvation. Tarry not, O Lord, until I have done
        pleading: save first and hear afterwards. The salvation must be a right
        royal and eminent one, such as only the omnipotent hand of God linked
        with his dexterous wisdom can achieve.
        <p align="justify">
          Urgent distress puts men upon pressing and bold petitions such as
          this. We may by faith ask for and expect that
          <i>our extremity will be God's opportunity</i>; special and memorable
          deliverances will be wrought out when dire calamities appear to be
          imminent.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Here is one suppliant for many, even as in the case of our Lord's
          intercession for his saints. He, <i>the Lord's David</i>, pleads for
          the rest of the beloved, beloved and accepted in him the Chief
          Beloved. He seeks salvation as though it were for himself, but his eye
          is ever upon all those who are one with him in the Father's love. When
          divine interposition is necessary for the rescue of the elect it must
          occur, for the first and greatest necessity of providence is the honor
          of God, and the salvation of his chosen people. This is fixed fate,
          the center of the immutable decree, the inmost thought of the
          unchangeable Jehovah.

        providences say what they will, the voice of a faithful God drowns every
        sound of tear.
        <p align="justify">
          God had promised Israel victory, and David the kingdom; the holiness
          of God secured the fulfillment of his own covenant, and therefore the
          king spoke confidently. The goodly land had been secured to the tribes
          by the promise made to Abraham, and that divine grant was an
          abundantly sufficient warrant for the belief that Israel's arms would
          be successful in battle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Believer make good use of this, and banish doubts while promises
          remain.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">I will rejoice</p></b>, or "I will triumph."
        Faith regards the promise not as fiction but fact, and therefore drinks
        in joy from it, and grasps victory by it. "God has spoken; I will
        rejoice:" here is a fit motto for every soldier of the cross.
        <b> <p align="justify">I will divide Shechem.</p></b> As a victor David
        would allot the conquered territory to those to whom God had given it by
        lot. Shechem was an important portion of the country, which as yet had
        not yielded to his government; but he saw that by Jehovah's help it
        would be, and indeed was all his own. Faith divides the spoil, she is
        sure of what God has promised, and enters at once into possession.
        <b> <p align="justify">And mete out the valley of Succoth.</p></b> As

          Perhaps he would throw his shoe as nowadays men throw their glove, as
          a challenge to them to dare dispute his sway. He did not need draw a
          sword to smite his now crippled and utterly despondent adversary, for
          if he dared revolt he would only need to throw his slipper at him, and
          he would tremble.

        shall never be able to rejoice over Israel again; but if you must needs
        triumph it must be with me, and not against me. Or rather is it a
        taunting defiance, a piece of irony? O proud Philistia, where are your
        vaunts? Where now your haughty looks, and promised conquests? Thus dare
