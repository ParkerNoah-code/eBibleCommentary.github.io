        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.924)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-Day Morning, April 3rd, 1870, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus
          only." -- Matthew 17:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last words will suffice us for a text, "Jesus only." When Peter
          saw our Lord with Moses and Elias, he exclaimed, "Master, it is good
          to be here," as if he implied that it was better to be with Jesus, and
          Moses, and Elias, than to be with Jesus only. Now it was certainly
          good that for once in his life he should see Christ transfigured with
          the representatives of the law and the prophets; it might be for that
          particular occasion the best sight that he could see, but as an
          ordinary thing an ecstasy so sublime would not have been good for the
          disciples; and Peter himself very soon found this out, for when the
          luminous cloud overshadowed him, and the voice was heard out of
          heaven, we find that he with the rest became sore afraid. The best
          thing after all for Peter, was not the excessive strain of the
          transfiguration, nor the delectable company of the two great spirits
          who appeared with Jesus, but the equally glorious, but less exciting
          society of "Jesus only." Depend on it, brethren, that ravishing and
          exciting experiences and transporting enjoyments, though they may be
          useful as occasional refreshments, would not be so good for every day
          as that quiet but delightful ordinary fellowship with "Jesus only,"
          which ought to be the distinguishing mark of all Christian life. As
          the disciples ascended the mountain side with Jesus only, and as they
          went back again to the multitude with Jesus only, they were in as good
          company as when they were on the mountain summit, Moses and Elias
          being there also; and although Jesus Christ in his common habiliments
          and in his ordinary attire might not so dazzle their eyes as when they
          saw his raiment bright as the light, and his face shining as the sun,
          yet he really was quite as glorious, and his company quite as
          beneficial. When they saw him in his everyday attire, his presence was
          quite as useful to them as when he robed himself in splendor. "Jesus
          only," is after all upon the whole a better thing than Jesus, Moses,
          and Elias. "Jesus only," as the common Jesus, the Christ of every day,
          the man walking among men, communing in secret with his disciples, is
          a better thing for a continuance while we are in this body, than the
          sight even of Jesus himself in the excellence of his majesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning, in trying to dwell upon the simple sight of "Jesus
          only," we shall hold it up as beyond measure important and delightful,
          and shall bear our witness that as it was said of Goliath's sword,
          "there is none like it," so may it be said of fellowship with "Jesus
          only." We shall first notice what might have happened to the disciples
          after the transfiguration; we shall then dwell on what did happen; and
          then, thirdly, we shall speak on what we anxiously desire may happen
          to those who hear us this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED to the three disciples after
          they had seen the transfiguration.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were four things, either of which might have occurred. As a
          first supposition, they might have seen nobody with them on the holy
          mount; they might have found all gone but themselves. When the cloud
          had overshadowed them, and they were sore afraid, they might have
          lifted up their eyes and found the entire vision melted into thin air;
          no Moses, no Elias, and no Jesus. In such a case they would have been
          in a sorry plight, like those who having begun to taste of a banquet,
          suddenly find all the viands swept away; like thirsty men who have
          tasted the cooling crystal drops, and then seen the fountain dried up
          before their eyes. They would not have gone down the mountain side
          that day asking questions and receiving instruction, for they would
          have had no teacher left them. They would have descended to face a
          multitude and to contend with a demon; not to conquer Satan, but to
          stand defeated by him before the crowd; for they would have had no
          champion to espouse their cause and drive out the evil spirit. They
          would have gone down among Scribes and Pharisees to be baffled with
          their knotty questions, and to be defeated by their sophistries, for
          they would have had no wise man, who spake as never man spake, to
          untie the knots and disentangle the snarls of controversy. They would
          have been like sheep without a shepherd, like orphan children left
          alone in the world. They would henceforth have reckoned it an unhappy
          day on which they saw the transfiguration; because having seen it,
          having been led to high thoughts by it, and excited to great
          expectations, all had disappeared like the foam upon the waters, and
          left no solid residuum behind. Alas! For those who have seen the image
          of the spirits of just men made perfect, and beheld the great Lord of
          all such spirits, and then have found themselves alone, and all the
          high companionship forever gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear brethren and sisters, there are some in this world and we
          ourselves have been among them, to whom something like this has
          actually occurred. You have been under a sermon, or at a gospel
          ordinance, or in reading the word of God, for a while delighted,
          exhilarated, lifted up to the sublimer regions, and then afterwards
          when it has all been over, there has been nothing left of joy or
          benefit, nothing left of all that was preached and for the moment
          enjoyed, nothing, at any rate, that you could take with you into the
          conflicts of every-day life. The whole has been a splendid vision and
          nothing more. There has been neither Moses not Elias, nor Jesus left.
          You did remember what you saw, but only with regret, because nothing
          remained with you. And, indeed, this which happens sometimes to us, is
          a general habit of that portion of this ungodly world which hears the
          gospel and perceives not its reality; it listens with respect to
          gospel histories as to legends of ancient times; it hears with
          reverence the stories of the days of miracles; it venerates the
          far-off ages and their heroic deeds, but it does not believe that
          anything is left of all the vision, any thing for to-day, for common
          life, and for common men. Moses it knows, and Elias it knows, and
          Christ it knows, as shadows that have passed across the scene and have
          disappeared, but it knows nothing of any one of these as abiding in
          permanent influence over the mind and the spirit of the present. All
          come and all gone, all to be reverenced, all to be respected, but
          nothing more; there is nothing left, so far as they are concerned, to
          influence or bless the present hour. Jesus and his gospel have come
          and gone, and we may very properly recollect the fact, but according
          to certain sages there is nothing in the New Testament to affect this
          advanced age, this enlightened nineteenth century; we have got beyond
          all that. Ah! Brethren, let those who can be content to do so, put up
          with this worship of moral relics and spiritual phantoms; to us it
          would be wretchedness itself. We, on the other hand, say, blessing the
          name of the Lord that we can say it, that there abides with us our
          Lord Jesus. At this day he is with us, and will be with us even to the
          end of the world. Christ's existence is not a fact confined to
          antiquity or to remote distance. By his Spirit he is actually in his
          church; we have seen him, though not with eyes; we have heard him,
          though not with ears; we have grasped him, though not with hands; and
          we feed upon his flesh, which is meat indeed, and his blood, which is
          drink indeed. We have with us at this very day Jesus our friend, to
          whom we make known our secrets, and who beareth all our sorrows. We
          have Jesus our interpreting instructor, who still reveals his secrets
          to us, and leads us into the mind and name of God. We have Jesus still
          with us to supply us with strength, and in his power we still are
          mighty. We confess his reigning sovereignty in the church, and we
          receive his all-sufficient succors. The church is not decapitated, her
          Head abides in vital union with her; Jesus is no myth to us, whatever
          he may be to others; he is no departed shade, he is no heroic
          personification: in very deed there is a Christ, and though others see
          him not, and even we with these eyes see him not, yet in him believing
          we rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Oh, I trust it will
          never be so with us, that as we go about our life work our religion
          shall melt into fiction and become nothing but mere sentiment, nothing
          but thought, and dream, and vision; but may our religion be a matter
          of fact, a walking with the living and abiding Saviour. Though Moses
          may be gone, and Elias may be gone, yet Jesus Christ abideth with us
          and in us, and we in him, and so shall it be evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there was a second thing that might have happened to the
          disciples. When they lifted up their eyes they might have seen Moses
          only. It would certainly have been a very sad exchange for what they
          did see, to have seen Moses only. The face of Moses would have shone,
          his person would have awed them, and it would have been no mean thing
          for man of humble origin like themselves to walk down the mountain
          with that mighty king in Jeshurun, who had spoken with God face to
          face, and rested with him in solemn conclave by the space of forty
          days at a time. But yet who would exchange the sun for the moon? Who
          would exchange the cold moonbeams of Moses and the law for the sunny
          rays of the Saviour's divine affection? It would have been an unhappy
          exchange for them to have lost their Master whose name is love, and to
          have found a leader in the man whose name is synonymous with law.
          Moses, the man of God, cannot be compared with Jesus, the Son of God.
          Yet dear brethren, there are some who see Moses only. After all the
          gospel preaching that there has been in the world, and the declaration
          of the precious doctrines of grace every Sabbath day; after the clear
          revelations of Scripture, and the work of the Holy Spirit in men's
          hearts; yet we have among us some who persist in seeing nothing but
          Moses only. I mean this, there are some who will see nothing but
          shadows still, mere shadows still. As I read my Bible I see there that
          the age of the symbolical, the typical, the pictorial, has passed
          away. I am glad of the symbols, and types, and pictures, for they
          remain instructive to me; but the age in which they were in the
          foreground has given way to a clearer light, and they are gone
          forever. There are, however, certain persons who profess to read the
          Bible and to see very differently, and they set up a new system of
          types and shadows -- a system, let me say, ridiculous to men of sense,
          and obnoxious to men of spiritual taste. There are some who delight in
          outward ordinances; they must have rubric and ritual, vestments and
          ceremonial, and this superabundantly, morning, noon and night. They
          regard days, and seasons, and forms of words and postures. They
          consider one place holy above another. They regard a certain caste of
          men as being priestly above other believers, and their love of symbols
          is seen in season and out of season. One would think, from their
          teachings, that the one thing needful was not "Jesus only," but
          custom, antiquity, outward performance, and correct observance! Alas!
          for those who talk of Jesus, but virtually see Moses, and Moses only.
          Ah! unhappy change for the heart if it could exchange spiritual
          fellowship with Jesus for outward acts and symbolical representations.
          It would be an unhappy thing for the Christian church if she could
          ever be duped out of the priceless boons which faith wins from her
          living Lord in his fullness of grace and truth, to return to the
          beggarly elements of carnal ordinances. Unhappy day, indeed, if Popish
          counterfeits of legal shadows should supplant gospel fact and
          substance. Blessed be God, we have not so learned Christ. We see
          something better than Moses only.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are too many who see Moses only, inasmuch as they see nothing
          but law, nothing but duty and precept in the Bible. I know that some
          here, though we have tried to preach Christ crucified as their only
          hope, yet whenever they read the Bible, or hear the Gospel, feel
          nothing except a sense of their own sinfulness, and, arising out of
          that sense of sinfulness, a desire to work out a righteousness of
          their own. They are continually measuring themselves by the law of
          God, they feel their shortcomings, they mourn over their
          transgressions, but they go no further. I am glad that they see Moses,
          may the stern voice of the lawgiver drive them to the lawfulfiller;
          but I grieve that they tarry so long in legal servitude, which can
          only bring them sorrow and dismay. The sight of Sinai, what is it but
          despair? God revealed in flaming fire, and proclaiming with thunder
          his fiery law, what is there here to save the soul? To see the Lord
          who will by no means spare the guilty, but will surely visit
          transgression with eternal vengeance, is a sight which never should
          eclipse Calvary, where love makes recompense to justice. O that you
          may get beyond the mount that might be touched, and come to Calvary,
          where God in vengeance is clearly seen, but where God in mercy fills
          the throne. Oh how blessed is it to escape from the voice of command
          and threatening and come to the blood of sprinkling, where "Jesus
          only" speaketh better things!
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses only, however, has become a sight very common with some of you
          who write bitter things against yourselves. You never read the
          Scriptures or hear the gospel without feeling condemned. You know your
          duty, and confess how short you have fallen of it, and therefore you
          abide under conscious condemnation, and will not come to him who is
          the propitiation for your sins. Alas, that there should be so many who
          with strange perversity of unbelief twist every promise into a
          threatening, and out of every gracious word that drips with honey
          manage to extract gall and wormwood. They see the dark shadow of Moses
          only; the broken tablets of the law, the smoking mount, and the
          terrible trumpet are ever with them, and over all an angry God. They
          had a better vision once, they have it sometimes now; for now and then
          under the preaching of the gospel they have glimpses of hope and
          mercy, but they relapse into darkness, they fall again into despair,
          because they have chosen to see Moses only. I pray that a change may
          come over the spirit of their dream, and that yet like the apostles
          they may see "Jesus only."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, my brethren, there was a third alternative that might have
          happened to the disciples, they might have seen Elijah only. Instead
          of the gentle Saviour, they might have been standing at the side of
          the rough-clad and the stern-spirited Elias. Instead of the Lamb of
          God, there might have remained to them only the lion who roared like
          the voice of God's own majesty in the midst of sinful Israel. In such
          a case, with such a leader, they would have gone down from the mount,
          and I wot that if John had said, "Command fire from heaven," Elias
          would have consumed his foes; the Pharisees, like the priests of Baal,
          would have found a speedy end; Herod's blood, like Ahab's, would have
          been licked up by dogs; and Herodias, like another Jezebel, would have
          been devoured of the same. But all this power for vengeance would have
          been a poor exchange for the gracious omnipotence of the Friend of
          sinners. Who would prefer the slayer of the priests to the Saviour of
          men? The top of Carmel was glorious when its intercession brought the
          rain for Israel, but how poor it is compared with Gethsemane, whose
          pleadings bring eternal life to millions! In company with Jesus we are
          at Elim beneath the palm tree, but with Elias we are in the wilderness
          beneath the stunted juniper. Who would exchange the excellency of
          Olivet for the terrors of Horeb? Yet I fear there are many who see
          Elias only. Prophecies of future woe fascinate them rather than
          thoughts of present salvation. Elias may be taken representatively as
          the preparer of Christ, for our Lord interpreted the prophecy of the
          coming of Elias as referring to John the Baptist. There are not a few
          who abide in the seeking, repenting, and preparing state, and come not
          to "Jesus only." I am not myself fond of even using the term
          "preparing for Christ," for it seems to me that those are best
          prepared for Christ who most feel themselves unprepared; but there is
          no doubt a state of heart which prepares for faith -- a sense of need,
          a consciousness of sin, a hatred of sin, all these are preparations
          for actual peace and comfort in Christ Jesus, and oh! How many there
          are who continue year after year merely in that preliminary condition,
          choosing the candle and refusing the sun. They do not become
          believers, but are always complaining that they do not feel as yet fit
          to come to Christ. They want Christ, they desire Christ, they would
          fain have Christ, but they stay in desire and longing and go no
          further. They never get so far as to behold "the Lamb of God that
          taketh away the sin of the world." The voice from heaven to them they
          always interpret as crying, "The axe is laid unto the root of the
          trees; bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance." Their
          conscience is thrilled, and thrilled again, by the voice that crieth
          in the wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord." Their souls are
          rent and torn by Elijah's challenge, "If the Lord be God, follow him:
          but if Baal, then follow him;" but they remain still halting between
          two opinions, trembling before Elias and not rejoicing before the
          Saviour. Unhappy men and women, so near the kingdom, and yet out of
          it; so near the feast, and yet perishing for want of the living bread.
          The word is near you(ah, how near!), and yet you receive it not.
          Remember, I pray you, that merely to prepare for a Saviour is not to
          be saved; that to have a sense of sin is not the same thing as being
          pardoned. Your repentance, unless you also believe in Jesus, is a
          repentance that needs to be repented of. At the girdle of John the
          Baptist the keys of heaven did never hang; Elias is not the door of
          salvation; preparation for Christ is not Christ, despair is not
          regeneration, doubt is not repentance. Only by faith in Jesus can you
          be saved, but complaining of yourselves is not faith. "Jesus only" is
          the way, the truth, and the life. "Jesus only" is the sinner's
          Saviour. O that your eyes may be opened, not to see Elias, not to see
          Moses, but to see "Jesus only."
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, then, these three alternatives, but there was also another: a
          fourth thing might have happened when the disciples opened their eyes
          -- they might have seen Moses and Elias with Jesus, even as in the
          transfiguration. At first sight it seems as if this would have been
          superior to that which they did enjoy. To walk down the mountain with
          that blessed trio, how great a privilege! How strong might they have
          been for the accomplishment of the divine purposes! Moses could preach
          the law and make men tremble, and then Jesus could follow with his
          gospel of grace and truth. Elias could flash the thunderbolt in their
          faces, and then Christ could have uplifted the humble spirits. Would
          not the contrast have been delightful, and the connection inspiriting?
          Would not the assemblage of such divers kinds of forces have
          contributed to the greatest success? I think not. It is a vastly
          better thing to see "Jesus only," as a matter of perpetuity, than to
          see Moses and Elias with Jesus. It is night, I know it, for I see the
          moon and stars. The morning cometh, I know it cometh, for I see no
          longer many stars, only one remains, and that the morning star. But
          the full day has arrived, I know it has, for I cannot even see the
          morning star; all those guardians and comforters of the night have
          disappeared; I see the sun only. Now, inasmuch as every man prefers
          the moon to midnight and to the twilight of dawn, the disappearance of
          Moses and Elias, indicating the full noontide of light, was the best
          thing that could happen. Why should we wish to see Moses? The
          ceremonials are all fulfilled in Jesus; the law is honored and
          fulfilled in him. Let Moses go, his light is already in "Jesus only."
          And why should I wish to retain Elias? The prophecies are all
          fulfilled in Jesus, and the preparation of which Elias preached Jesus
          brings with himself. Let, then, Elias go, his light also is in "Jesus
          only." It is better to see Moses and Elias in Christ, than to see
          Moses and Elias with Christ. The absence of some things betokens a
          higher state of things than their presence. In all my library I do not
          know that I have a Lennie's English Grammar, or a Mavor's Spelling
          Book, or a Henry's First Latin Exercises, nor do I regret the absence
          of those valuable works, because I have got beyond the need of them.
          So the Christian wants not the symbols of Moses, or the preparations
          of Elias, for Christ is all, and we are complete in him. He who is
          conversant with the higher walks of sacred literature and reads in the
          golden book of Christ's heart, may safely lay the legal school-book
          by; this was good enough for the church's infancy, but we have now put
          away childish things. "We, when we were children, were in bondage
          under the elements of the world: but when the fullness of the time was
          come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law to
          redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
          adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the
          Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore
          thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of
          God through Christ." My brethren, the principle may be carried still
          further, for even the most precious things we treasure here below will
          disappear when fully realized in heaven. Beautiful for situation was
          the temple on Mount Zion, and though we believe not in the sanctity of
          buildings under the gospel, we love the place of solemn meeting where
          we are accustomed to offer prayer and praise; but when we enter into
          perfection we shall find no temple in heaven. We delight in our
          Sabbaths, and we would not give them up. O may England never lose her
          Sabbaths! but when we reach the Jerusalem above, we shall not observe
          the first day of the week above the rest, for we shall enjoy one
          everlasting Sabbath. No temple, because all temple; and no Sabbath
          day, because all Sabbath in heaven. Thus, you see, the losing of some
          things is gain: it proves that we have got beyond their help. Just as
          we get beyond the nursery and all its appurtenances, and never regret
          it because we have become men, so do Moses and Elias pass away, but we
          do not miss them, for "Jesus only" indicates our manhood. It is a sign
          of a higher growth when we can see Jesus only. My brethren, much of
          this sort of thing takes place with all Christians in their spiritual
          life. Do you remember when you were first of all convinced and
          awakened, what a great deal you thought of the preacher, and how much
          of the very style in which he spoke the gospel! But now, though you
          delight to listen to his voice, and find that God blesses you through
          him, yet you have sunk the thought of the preacher in the glory of the
          Master, you see no man save "Jesus only." And as you grow in grace you
          will find that many doctrines and points of church government which
          once appeared to you to be all important, though you will still value
          them, will seem but of small consequence compared with Christ himself.
          Like the traveller ascending the Alps to reach the summit of Mont
          Blanc; at first he observes that lord of the hills as one born among
          many, and often in the twistings of his upward path he sees other
          peaks which appear more elevated than that monarch of mountains; but
          when at last he is near the summit, he sees all the rest of the hills
          beneath his feet, and like a mighty wedge of alabaster Mount Blanc
          pierces the very clouds. So, as we grow in grace, other things sink
          and Jesus rises. They must decrease, but Christ must increase; until
          he alone fills the full horizon of your soul, and rises clear and
          bright and glorious up into the very heaven of God. O that we may thus
          see "Jesus only!"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Time hastens so rapidly, this morning, that I know not how I shall
          be able to compress the rest of my discourse into the allotted space.
          We must in the most rapid manner speak upon WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They saw no man, save Jesus only." This was all they wanted to see
          for their comfort. They were sore afraid: Moses was gone, and he could
          give them no comfort; Elias was gone, he could speak no consolatory
          word; yet when Jesus said, "Be not afraid," their fears vanished. All
          the comfort, then, that any troubled heart wants, it can find in
          Christ. Go not to Moses, nor Elias, neither to the old covenant, not
          to prophecy: go straight away to Jesus only. He was all the Saviour
          they wanted. Those three men all needed washing from sin; all needed
          to be kept and held on their way, but neither Moses nor Elias could
          have washed them from sin, nor have kept them from returning to it.
          But Jesus only could cleanse them, and did; Christ could lead them on,
          and did. Ah! brethren, all the Saviour we want, we find in Jesus only.
          The priests of Rome and their Anglican mimics officiously offer us
          their services. How glad they would be if we would bend our necks once
          again to their yoke! But we thank God we have seen "Jesus only," and
          if Moses has gone, and if Elias has gone, we are not likely to let the
          shavelings of Rome come in and fill up the vacancy. "Jesus only," is
          enough for our comfort, without either Anglican, Mosaic, or Roman
          priestcraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          He, again, was to them, as they went afterwards into the world, enough
          for a Master. "No man can serve two masters," and albeit, Moses and
          Elias might sink into the second rank, yet might there have been some
          difficulty in the follower's mind if the leadership were divided. But
          when they had no leader but Jesus, his guidance, his direction and
          command were quite sufficient. He, in the day of battle, was enough
          for their captain; in the day of difficulty, enough for their
          direction. They wanted none but Jesus. At this day, my brethren, we
          have no Master but Christ; we submit ourselves to no vicar of God; we
          bow down ourselves before no great leader of a sect, neither to
          Calvin, nor to Arminius, to Wesley, or Whitfield, "One is our Master,"
          and that one is enough, for we have learned to see the wisdom of God
          and the power of God in Jesus only.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was enough as their power for future life, as well as their Master.
          They needed not ask Moses to lend them official dignity, nor to ask
          Elias to bring them fire from heaven: Jesus would give them of his
          Holy Spirit, and they should be strong enough for every enterprise.
          And, brethren, all the power you and I want to preach the gospel, and
          to conquer souls to the truth, we can find in Jesus only. You want no
          sacred State prestige, no pretended apostolical succession, no
          prelatical unction; Jesus will anoint you with his Holy Spirit, and
          you shall be plenteously endowed with power from on high, so that you
          shall do great things and prevail. "Jesus only." Why, they wanted no
          other motive to constrain them to use their power aright. It is enough
          incentive to a man to be allowed to live for such a one as Christ.
          Only let the thought of Christ fill the enlightened intellect, and it
          must conquer the sanctified affections. Let but Jesus be well
          understood as the everlasting God who bowed the heavens, and came down
          and suffered shame and ignominy, that he might redeem us from the
          wrath to come; let us get but a sight of the thorn-crowned head, and
          those dear eyes all red with weeping, and those sweet cheeks bruised
          and battered by the scoffer's fists; let us but look into the tender
          heart that was broken with griefs unutterable for our sakes, and the
          love of Christ must constrain us, and we shall thus "judge, that if
          one died for all, then were wll dead: and that he died for all, that
          they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto
          him which died for them and rose again." In the point of motive,
          believers do not need the aid of Moses. That you ought to do such a
          thing because otherwise you will be punished, will but little
          strengthen you, nor will you be much aided by the spirit of prophecy
          which leads you to hope that in the millennial period you will be made
          a ruler over many cities. It will be enough to you that you serve the
          Lord Christ; it suffices you if you may be enabled to honor him, to
          deck his crown, to magnify his name. Here is a stimulus sufficient for
          martyrs and confessors, "Jesus only." Brethren, it is all the gospel
          we have to preach -- it is all the gospel we want to preach -- it is
          the only ground of confidence which we have for ourselves; it is all
          the hope we have to set before others. I know that in this age there
          is an overweening desire for that which has the aspect of being
          intellectual, deep, and novel; and we are often informed that there
          are to be developments in religion, even as in science; and we are
          despised as being hardly men, certainly not thinking men, if we preach
          today what was preached two hundred years ago. Brethren, we preach
          to-day what was preached eighteen hundred years ago, and wherein
          others make alterations, they create deformities, and not
          improvements. We are not ashamed to avow that the old truth of Christ
          alone is everlasting; all else has gone or shall go, but the gospel
          towers above the wrecks of time: to us "Jesus only" remains as the
          sole topic of our ministry, and we want nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
          For "Jesus only" shall be our reward, to be with him where he is, to
          behold his glory, to be like him when we shall see him as he is, we
          ask no other heaven. No other bliss can our soul conceive of. The Lord
          grant that we may have a fullness of this, and "Jesus only" shall be
          throughout eternity our delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was here space to have dilated at great length, but we have
          rather given you the heads of thought, than the thoughts themselves.
          Though the apostles saw "Jesus only," they saw quite sufficient, for
          Jesus is enough for time and eternity, enough to live by and enough to
          die by.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I must close, though I fain would linger. Brethren, let us think
          of WHAT WE DESIRE MAY HAPPEN to all now present.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do desire for my fellow Christians and for myself, that more and
          more the great object of our thoughts, motives, and acts may be "Jesus
          only." I believe that whenever our religion is most vital, it is most
          full of Christ. Moreover, when it is most practical, downright, and
          common sense, it always gets nearest to Jesus. I can bear witness that
          whenever I am in deeps of sorrow, nothing will do for me but "Jesus
          only." I can rest in some degree in the externals of religion, its
          outward escarpments and bulwarks, when I am in health; but I retreat
          to the innermost citadel of our holy faith, namely, to the very heart
          of Christ, when my spirit is assailed by temptation, or besieged with
          sorrow and anguish. What is more, my witness is that whenever I have
          high spiritual enjoyments, enjoyments right, rare, celestial, they are
          always connected with Jesus only. Other religious things may give some
          kind of joy, and joy that is healthy too, but the sublimest, the most
          inebriating, the most divine of all joys, must be found in Jesus only.
          In fine, I find if I want to labor much, I must live on Jesus only; if
          I desire to suffer patiently, I must feed on Jesus only; if I wish to
          wrestle with God successfully, I must plead Jesus only; if I aspire to
          conquer sin, I must use the blood of Jesus only; if I pant to learn
          the mysteries of heaven, I must seek the teachings of Jesus only. I
          believe that any thing which we add to Christ lowers our position, and
          that the more elevated our soul becomes, the more nearly like what it
          is to be when it shall enter into the religion of the perfect, the
          more completely every thing else will sink, die out, and Jesus, Jesus,
          Jesus only, will be first and last, and midst and without end, the
          Alpha and Omega of every thought of head and pulse of heart. May it be
          so with every Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are others here who are not yet believers in Jesus, and our
          desire is that this may happen to them, that they may see "Jesus
          only." "Oh," saith one, "Sir, I want to see my sins. My heart is very
          hard, and very proud; I want to see my sins." Friend, I also desire
          that you should, but I desire that you may see them not on yourself,
          but on Jesus only. No sight of sin ever brings such true humiliation
          of spirit as when the soul sees its sins laid on the Saviour. Sinner,
          I know you have thought of sins as lying on yourself, and you have
          been trying to feel their weight, but there is a happier and better
          view still. Sin was laid on Jesus, and it made him to be covered with
          a bloody sweat; it nailed him to the cross; it made him cry, "Lama
          Sabachthani;" it bowed him into the dust of death. Why, friend, if you
          see sin on Jesus you will hate it, you will bemoan it, you will abhor
          it. You need not look evermore to sin as burdening yourself, see Jesus
          only, and the best kind of repentance will follow. "Ah, but," saith
          another, "I want to feel my need of Christ more." You will see your
          need all the better if you look at Jesus only. Many a time an appetite
          for a thing is created by the sight of it. Why, there are some of us
          who can hardly be trusted in a bookseller's shop, because though we
          might have done very well at home without a certain volume, we no
          sooner see it than we are in urgent need of it. So often is it with
          some of you about other matters, so that it becomes most dangerous to
          let you see, because you want as soon as you see. A sight of Jesus, of
          what he is to sinners, of what he makes sinners, of what he is in
          himself, will more tend to make you feel your need of him than all
          your poring over your poor miserable self. You will get no further
          there, look to "Jesus only." "Ay," saith another, "but I want to read
          my title clear, I want to know that I have an interest in Jesus." you
          will best read your interest in Christ, by looking at him. If I want
          to know whether a certain estate is mine, do I look into my own heart
          to see if I have a right to it? But I look into the archives of the
          estate, I search testaments and covenants. Now, Christ Jesus is God's
          covenant with the people, a leader and commander to the people.
          To-day, I personally can read my title clear to heaven, and shall I
          tell you how I read it? Not because I feel all I wish to feel, nor
          because I am what I hope I yet shall be, but I read in the word that
          "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners," I am a sinner,
          even the devil cannot tell me I am not. O precious Saviour, then thou
          hast come to save such as I am. Then I see it written again, "He that
          believeth and is baptized, shall be saved." I have believed, and have
          been baptized; I know I trust alone in Jesus, and that is believing.
          As surely then as there is a God in heaven I shall be in heaven one
          day. It must be so, because unless God be a liar, he that believeth
          must be saved. You see it is not by looking within, it is by looking
          to Jesus only that you perceive at last your name graven on his hands.
          I wish to have Christ's name written on my heart, but if I want
          assurance, I have to look at his heart till I see my name written
          there. O turn your eye away from your sin and your emptiness to his
          righteousness and his fullness. See the sweat drops bloody as they
          fall in Gethsemane, see his heart pierced and pouring out blood and
          water for the sins of men upon Calvary! There is life in a look at
          him! O look to him, and though it be Jesus only, though Moses should
          condemn you, and Elias should alarm you, yet "Jesus only" shall be
          enough to comfort and enough to save you. May God grant us grace every
          one of us to take for our motto in life, for our hope in death, and
          for our joy in eternity, "Jesus only." May God bless you for the sake
          of "Jesus only." Amen.
