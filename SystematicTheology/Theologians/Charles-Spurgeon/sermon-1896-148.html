          105. Thy word is a lamp to my feet. In this verse the Psalmist
          testifies that the Divine Law was his schoolmaster and guide in
          leading a holy life. He thus, by his own example, prescribes the same
          rule to us all; and it is highly necessary to observe this rule; for
          while each of us follows what seems good in his own estimation, we
          become entangled in inextricable and frightful mazes. The more
          distinctly to understand his intention, it is to be noted, that the
          word of God is set in opposition to all human counsels. What the world
          judges right is often crooked and perverse in the judgment of God, who
          approves of no other manner of living, than that which is framed
          according to the rule of his law. It is also to be observed, that
          David could not have been guided by God's word, unless he had first
          renounced the wisdom of the flesh, for it is only when we are brought
          to do this, that we begin to be of a teachable disposition. But the
          metaphor which he uses implies something more; namely, that unless the
          word of God enlighten men's path, the whole of their life is enveloped
          in darkness and obscurity, so that they cannot do anything else than
          miserably wander from the right way; and again, that when we submit
          ourselves with docility to the teaching of God's law, we are in no
          danger of going astray. Were there such obscurity in God's word, as
          the Papists foolishly talk about, the commendation with which the
          prophet here honors the law would be altogether undeserved. Let us,
          then, be assured that an unerring light is to be found there, provided
          we open our eyes to behold it. The Apostle Peter (2 Peter 1:19) has
          more plainly expressed the same sentiment, when he commends the
          faithful for taking heed to the word of prophecy, "as unto a light
          that shineth in a dark place."
        </p>
        <p>
          106. I have sworn, and will perform Here the Psalmist speaks of his
          own constancy. He had declared a little before, that during the whole
          course of his life, he had not declined from God's law, and now he
          speaks of the purpose of his mind. By the word swear, he intimates
          that he had solemnly pledged himself to God not to alter his
          determination. The true manner of keeping God's law is to receive and
          embrace what he commands heartily, and, at the same time, uniformly,
          that our ardor may not forthwith abate, as is often the case. This
          also is the proper rule of vowing, that we may offer ourselves to God,
          and dedicate our life to him. It may, however, be asked, whether the
          prophet's oath may not be condemned as rash, inasmuch as he presumed
          to engage to do far more than man's ability is equal to; for who is
          able to keep the law? The man, then, it may be alleged, vows rashly,
          who promises to God a thing which it is beyond his power to
          accomplish. The answer is obvious: Whenever the faithful vow to Him,
          they do not look to what they are able to do of themselves, but they
          depend upon the grace of God, to whom it belongs to perform what he
          requires from them, in the way of supplying them with strength by his
          Holy Spirit. When the question is in reference to service to be
          rendered to God, they cannot vow anything without the Holy Spirit;
          for, as Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:5,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not that are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of
          ourselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          But when God stretches forth his hand to us, he bids us be of good
          courage, and promises that he will never fail us; and this is the
          source from which the boldness to swear, here spoken of, proceeds. Nor
          is it any rashness at all, when, confiding in his promises, by which
          he anticipates us, we, on our part, offer ourselves to his service.
          The question, however, still remains unsolved; for although the
          children of God ultimately prove victorious over all temptations by
          the grace of the Holy Spirit, yet there is always some infirmity about
          them. But it is to be observed, that the faithful, in making vows and
          promises, have a respect not only to that article of the covenant, by
          which God has promised that he will cause us to walk in his
          commandments, but also to that other article which is, at the same
          time, added concerning the free forgiveness of their sins, Ezekiel
          11:20; 36:27; Psalm 103:13. David, therefore, according to the measure
          of grace given him, bound himself by oath to keep God's la encouraged
          by these words of the prophet,
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him,"
          Malachi 3:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          107. I am greatly afflicted, O Jehovah! This verse teaches, that God
          did not cherish the fathers under the law in his bosom so delicately
          as not to exercise them with grievous temptations; for the Psalmist
          declares that he was not afflicted lightly, or in an ordinary degree,
          but above measure. His prayer to be quickened implies that he was at
          the point of death. He, however, at the same time, shows, that though
          he was besieged by death, he yet fainted not, because he leaned upon
          God -- a point worthy of special notice; for though, at the beginning,
          we may call upon God with much alacrity, yet when the trial increases
          in severity, our hearts quail, and, in the extremity of fear, our
          confidence is extinguished. Yet the prophet implores God for grace,
          not in order to his life being preserved in safety, but in order to
          his recovering the life he had lost, which indicates both the low
          condition to which he was reduced, and his continued confidence in
          God. We must also observe attentively the last part of the clause,
          according to thy word We will pray coldly, or rather we will not pray
          at all, if God's promise does not inspire us with courage in our
          sorrow and distress. In short, as we have said elsewhere, it is
          indispensably necessary that we should have this key at hand, in order
          to our having free access to the throne of grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          108. O Jehovah! I beseech thee, let the flee-will-offerings of my
          mouth. This verse may be read in one connected sentence, as well as
          divided into two members. According to the former view, the sense will
          be, Receive, e Lord, my sacrifices, to this end, that thou mayest
          teach me thy commandments. If we prefer dividing the verse into two
          clauses, then it will consist of two separate prayers; first, a prayer
          that God would accept the prophet's sacrifices; and, secondly, a
          prayer that he would instruct him in the doctrine of the law. I am
          rather inclined to follow the first opinion. The prophet affirms, as
          we have seen elsewhere, that nothing was more precious to him than to
          understand the doctrine of the law. Lord, as if he had said, do thou,
          according to thy good pleasure, accept the sacrifices which I offer
          thee; and as my chief desire is, to be instructed aright in thy law,
          grant that I may be a partaker of this blessing, which I am so anxious
          to obtain. We should mark all the places in which the knowledge of
          divine truth is preferred to all the other benefits bestowed upon
          mankind; and doubtless, since it contains in it the pledge of
          everlasting salvation, there is good reason why it should be esteemed
          as an inestimable treasure. Yet the prophet begins at a point remote
          from this, praying that God would vouchsafe to approve of and accept
          his services. By the word ndvvt, nidboth, I have no doubt he denotes
          the sacrifices which were called free-will-offerings. I indeed grant
          that he speaks properly of vows and prayers; but as the chosen people
          to propitiate God, were wont to offer sacrifices, according as every
          man had ability, he alludes to that custom which prevailed under the
          law; even as Hosea (Hosea 14:2) designates the praises of God "the
          calves of the lips." It was the design of God, by that ceremony, to
          testify to the fathers that no prayers were acceptable to him, but
          those which were joined with sacrifice, that they might always turn
          their minds to the Mediator. In the first place, he acknowledges that
          he was unworthy of obtaining any thing by his prayers, and that, if
          God heard him, it proceeded from his free and unmerited grace. In the
          second place, he desires that God would be favorable to him in the way
          of enabling him to profit aright in the doctrine of the law. The verb,
          rtsh ratsah, which he uses: signifies to favor of mere good will.
          Whence it follows, that there is nothing meritorious in our prayers,
          and that, whenever God hears them, it is in the exercise of his free
          goodness.
        </p>
        <p>
          109. My soul is continually in my hand. He declares, that no
          calamities, afflictions, or dangers, which he had experienced: had
          withdrawn him from the service of God, and the observance of his law.
          To bear his soul in his hand, is equivalent to his being in danger of
          his life, so that the soul was, as it were abandoned to the wind. Thus
          Job, (Job 13:14,) when he pines in his miseries: and is looking for
          death every moment, and dreading it, complains that his soul was in
          his hand; as if he had said, It is plucked from its own
          dwelling-place: and is under the dominion of death. This form of
          expression is therefore unhappily wrested to an absurd meaning by
          ignorant people, who understand the prophet as intimating, that it was
          in his own power to govern his life as he pleased. So far from
          intending to convey such an idea, by this circumstance he commends his
          own piety, declaring, that although he was tossed among shipwrecks,
          and death in a hundred forms hovered before his eyes, so that he could
          not rest in security for a single moment, yet he had not cast from him
          the love and study of the Divine law. Here, again, it is well to
          notice the severe and arduous conflicts by which the fathers, under
          the law, were tried, that dangers and fears may not frighten us, or,
          by the weariness they produce, deprive us of courage, and thus prevent
          the remembrance of the Divine law from remaining impressed on our
          hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          110. The wicked have laid a snare for me The meaning of this verse is
          similar to that of the preceding. The prophet shows more definitely in
          what respect he carried his life in his hand; namely, because, being
          hemmed in on all sides by the snares of the wicked, he saw scarcely
          any hope of life. We have previously observed how difficult it is to
          avoid wandering from the ways of the Lord, when our enemies, by their
          subtle arts, endeavor to effect our destruction. The depraved desire
          of our fallen nature incites us to retaliate, nor do we see any way of
          preserving our life, unless we employ the same arts by which they
          assail us; and we persuade ourselves that it is lawful for us to howl
          among wolves. Such being the ease, we ought, with the more attention,
          to meditate upon this doctrine, That, when the wicked environ and
          besiege us by their wiles, the best thing we can do is to follow
          whither God calls us, and to attempt nothing but what is agreeable to
          his will.
        </p>
        <p>
          111. I have thy testimonies as an inheritance for ever. He again
          confirms the sentiment, which cannot be too often repeated, That the
          law of God was more precious to him than all the pleasures, riches,
          and possessions, of the world. I have said, that it is not in vain
          that these things are so often repeated; for we see how violently the
          men of the world boil to gratify their unruly lusts, with what
          multiplied anxieties they are agitated, while they are unceasingly
          coveting innumerable objects; and, in the meantime, scarcely one in a
          hundred is, in a moderate degree, aiming to apply his mind to the
          study of the Divine law. The prophet, then, to stir us up by his own
          example, asserts, that he took such pleasure in God's, testimonies as
          to esteem nothing more precious. It is love only which leads us to set
          a value on any object; and, therefore, it is requisite, in order to
          our observing the Divine law with the reverence due to it, that we
          begin with this delight in it. It is not wonderful, if God's
          testimonies convey to our minds a joy, which, causing us to reject and
          despise all other things, holds our affections fast bound to them.
          What can be sweeter than to have heaven opened to us, that we may come
          freely into the presence of God, when, adopting us to be his children,
          he pardons our sins? What can be more desirable than to hear that he
          is so pacified towards us, as to take upon himself the care of our
          life? This I have thought good to observe briefly, that we might not
          think it strange to find David rejoicing so greatly in God's law. The
          similitude of inheritance is of frequent occurrence in the Scriptures;
          and we apply the designation of inheritance to that which we hold in
          the highest estimation, so that we are contented to be deprived of all
          other things, provided we retain the safe and full possession of that
          one thing. Accordingly, the prophet intimates, that whatever good
          things he had obtained he accounted them as adventitious, and that the
          truths revealed in God's word alone were to him as an inheritance.
          Without the Divine word all other things were in his estimation as
          nothing; so that he could willingly leave to others, riches, honors,
          comforts, and pleasures, provided he possessed this incomparable
          treasure. It is not meant to say that he; altogether despised the
          temporal benefits which God bestows, but his mind was not bound fast
          to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          112. I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes. In this verse
          he describes the right observance of the law, which consists in Our
          cheerfully and heartily preparing ourselves for doing what the law
          commands. Slavish and constrained obedience differs little from
          rebellion. The prophet, therefore, in order briefly to define what it
          is to serve God, asserts, that he applied not only his hands, eyes, or
          feet, to the keeping of the law, but that he began with the affection
          of the heart. Instead of the verb incline, the verb extend might with
          propriety be employed; but I am inclined to rest in the more generally
          received interpretation, which is, that he devoted himself with
          sincere affection of heart to the observance of the law. This
          inclination of the heart is oppose to the wandering lusts which rise
          up against God, and drag us any where rather than incline us to a
          virtuous life. The attempt of the Papists to defend from this passage
          their doctrine of free will is mere trifling. They infer from the
          words of the prophet, that it is in the power of man to bend his own
          heart in whatever way he pleases. But the answer is easy. The prophet
          does not here boast of what he had done by his own strength, for he
          now repeats the very same word which he had employed before, when he
          said, Incline my heart to these testimonies. If that prayer was not
          feigned, he doubtless acknowledged by it that it was the peculiar work
          of the Holy Spirit to incline and frame our hearts to God. But it is
          no new thing for that to be ascribed to us which God works in us:
          Paul's statement to this effect is very plain,
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is God who worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good
          pleasures" (Philippians 2:13.)
        </p>
        <p>
          When the prophet says of himself that he inclined his heart, he does
          not separate his own endeavor from the grace of the Holy Spirit, by
          whose inspiration he has previously declared that the whole was done.
          At the same time, he distinguishes the constancy of his pious
          affection from the transient favor of others. Thus, that he might not
          fail in the midst of his course, or even go backward, he affirms that
          he had resolved to continue in the same course during the whole of his
          life. The word qv, ekeb, to the end, in my opinion, is added to the
          word lvlm, leolam, for ever, by way of exposition; and to show us that
          he struggled manfully against all obstacles and difficulties, that
          they might not break his constancy; for no man perseveres in the
          service of God without arduous exertions. Some take the word as
          denoting a reward; but this seems too foreign to the design of the
          passage.
