          James, the Lord's brother, succeeds to the government of the Church,
          in conjunction with the apostles. He has been universally called the
          Just, from the days of the Lord down to the present time. For many
          bore the name of James; but this one was holy from his mother's womb.
          He drank no wine or other intoxicating liquor, nor did he eat flesh;
          no razor came upon his head; he did not anoint himself with oil, nor
          make use of the bath. He alone was permitted to enter the holy place:
          for he did not wear any woollen garment, but fine linen only. He
          alone, I say, was wont to go into the temple: and he used to be found
          kneeling on his knees, begging forgiveness for the people -- so that
          the skin of his knees became horny like that of a camel's, by reason
          of his constantly bending the knee in adoration to God, and begging
          forgiveness for the people. Therefore, in consequence of his
          pre-eminent justice, he was called the Just, and Oblias, which
          signifies in Greek Defence of the People, and Justice, in accordance
          with what the prophets declare concerning him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now some persons belonging to the seven sects existing among the
          people, which have been before described by me in the Notes, asked
          him: "What is the door of Jesus?" And he replied that He was the
          Saviour. In consequence of this answer, some believed that Jesus is
          the Christ. But the sects before mentioned did not believe, either in
          a resurrection or in the coming of One to requite every man according
          to his works; but those who did believe, believed because of James.
          So, when many even of the ruling class believed, there was a commotion
          among the Jews, and scribes, and Pharisees, who said: "A little more,
          and we shall have all the people looking for Jesus as the Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          They came, therefore, in a body to James, and said: "We entreat thee,
          restrain the people: for they are gone astray in their opinions about
          Jesus, as if he were the Christ. We entreat thee to persuade all who
          have come hither for the day of the passover, concerning Jesus. For we
          all listen to thy persuasion; since we, as well as all the people,
          bear thee testimony that thou art just, and showest partiality to
          none. Do thou, therefore, persuade the people not to entertain
          erroneous opinions concerning Jesus: for all the people, and we also,
          listen to thy persuasion. Take thy stand, then, upon the summit of the
          temple, that from that elevated spot thou mayest be clearly seen, and
          thy words may be plainly audible to all the people. For, in order to
          attend the passover, all the tribes have congregated hither, and some
          of the Gentiles also."
        </p>
        <p>
          The aforesaid scribes and Pharisees accordingly set James on the
          summit of the temple, and cried aloud to him, and said: "O just one,
          whom we are all bound to obey, forasmuch as the people is in error,
          and follows Jesus the crucified, do thou tell us what is the door of
          Jesus, the crucified." And he answered with a loud voice: "Why ask ye
          me concerning Jesus the Son of man? He Himself sitteth in heaven, at
          the right hand of the Great Power, and shall come on the clouds of
          heaven."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, when many were fully convinced by these words, and offered praise
          for the testimony of James, and said, "Hosanna to the son of David,"
          then again the said Pharisees and scribes said to one another, "We
          have not done well in procuring this testimony to Jesus. But let us go
          up and throw him down, that they may be afraid, and not believe him."
          And they cried aloud, and said: "Oh! oh! the just man himself is in
          error." Thus they fulfilled the Scripture written in Isaiah: "Let us
          away with the just man, because he is troublesome to us: therefore
          shall they eat the fruit of their doings." So they went up and threw
          down the just man, and said to one another: "Let us stone James the
          Just." And they began to stone him: for he was not killed by the fall;
          but he turned, and kneeled down, and said: "I beseech Thee, Lord God
          our Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, while they were thus stoning him to death, one of the priests,
          the sons of Rechab, the son of Rechabim, to whom testimony is borne by
          Jeremiah the prophet, began to cry aloud, saying: "Cease, what do ye?
          The just man is praying for us." But one among them, one of the
          fullers, took the staff with which he was accustomed to wring out the
          garments he dyed, and hurled it at the head of the just man.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so he suffered martyrdom; and they buried him on the spot, and the
          pillar erected to his memory still remains, close by the temple. This
          man was a true witness to both Jews and Greeks that Jesus is the
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>And shortly after Vespasian besieged Jud√¶a, taking them captive.</p>
