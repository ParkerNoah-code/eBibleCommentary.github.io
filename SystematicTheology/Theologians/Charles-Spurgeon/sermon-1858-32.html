        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.196)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 30, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>"Beloved, now are we the sons of God." -- 1 John 3:2.</p>
        <p>
          I SHALL not pretend to preach from the whole of my text this morning,
          short though it be. The word "now" is to me the most prominent word in
          the text, and I shall make it so this morning. "Beloved, now are we
          the sons of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is astonishing how distance blunts the keen edge of anything that
          is disagreeable. War is at all times a most fearful scourge. The
          thought of slain bodies and of murdered men must always harrow up the
          soul; but because we hear of these things in the distance, there are
          few Englishmen who can truly enter into their horrors. If we should
          hear the booming of cannon on the deep which girdles this island; if
          we should see at our doors the marks of carnage and bloodshed; then
          should we more thoroughly appreciate what war means. But distance
          takes away the horror, and we therefore speak of war with too much
          levity, and even read of it with an interest not sufficiently linked
          with pain. As it is with war, so it is with death. Death is a
          frightful thing; he who is the bravest must still fear before it, for
          at best it is a solemn thing to die. Man, therefore, adopts the
          expedient of putting off all thoughts of death: it may be very near to
          him, but he conceives it to be at a distance, and then the same effect
          is produced as when war is at a distance; its horror is forgotten, and
          we speak of it with less solemnity. So likewise with true religion;
          men are constrained to believe that there is truth in religion. Though
          there are some fool-hardy enough to deny it, the most of us in this
          enlightened land are obliged to acknowledge that there is a power in
          Godliness. What, then, does the worldling do? He practices the same
          expedient. He puts religion far away; he knows that its
          disagreeableness will be diminished by his believing it to be distant.
          Hence there has sprung up in the minds of the unregenerate world a
          notion that religion is a thing to be accomplished just at the close
          of life, and the usual prayer of an ungodly man, when in the slightest
          degree pricked in his conscience, is, "Oh, that I may be saved at
          last!" He does not feel anxious to be saved now; religion is a thing
          for which he has no appetite, and therefore believing it essential to
          insure his eternal welfare, he adopts the alternative of saying, "I
          hope to have it at last."
        </p>
        <p>
          The religion, then, of the present, is not the worldling's religion.
          He tolerates that which speaks of eternity; that which deals with
          dying beds; that which leads him to look back with a specious
          repentance upon a life spent in sin, but not that which will enable
          him to look forward to a life spent in holiness. Very differently,
          however, do we act with affairs of the present life, for things that
          are sweet to us, become the more sweet by their nearness. Was there
          ever a child who longed for his father's house who did not feel that
          the holidays grew more sweet in his estimation the shorter the time
          was that he had to tarry?
        </p>
        <p>
          What man is there who having once set his heart on riches, did not
          find his delight in the thought of being rich increase with the
          nearness of his approach to the desired object? And are we not all of
          us accustomed, when we think a good thing is at a distance, to try if
          we can shorten the time between us and it. We try anything and
          everything to push on the lagging hours; we chide them, wish that Time
          had double wings, that he might swiftly fly and bring the expected
          season. When the Christian talks of heaven, you will always hear him
          try to shorten the distance between himself and the happy land; he
          says, --
        </p>
        <p>"A few more rolling suns at most</p>
        <p>Will land me on fair Canaan's coast."</p>
        <p>
          There may be many years between him and paradise, but still he is
          prone to say,
        </p>
        <p>"The way may be rough, but it cannot be long."</p>
        <p>
          Thus do we all delight to shorten the distance between us and the
          things for which we hope. Now let us just apply this rule to religion.
          They who love religion love a present thing. The Christian who really
          seeks salvation, will never be happy unless he can say, "Now am I a
          child of God." Because the worldling dislikes it, he puts it from him,
          because the Christian loves it, therefore its very fairest feature is
          its present existence, its present enjoyment in his heart. That word
          "now" which is the sinners warning, and his terror, is to the
          Christian, his greatest delight and joy. "There is therefore" -- and
          then the sweetest bell of all rings -- "there is therefore now no
          condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus;" to the sinner that
          same idea is the blackest of all, "He that believeth not is condemned
          already, because he hath not believed on the Son of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning, in God's name, I shall endeavor to plead with men, and
          show them the importance of having a present religion. I am quite
          certain that this is a habit which is too much kept in the
          back-ground. I am sure from mixing with mankind, that the current
          belief is, that religion is a future thing, perhaps the wish is father
          to the thought. I am certain the ground of it is, men love not
          religion, and therefore they desire to thrust it far from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall commence by endeavoring to show that religion must be a thing
          of the present, because the present has such intimate connection with
          the future, and to proceed -- We are told in Scripture that this life
          is a seed time, and the future is the harvest, "He that soweth to the
          flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; he that soweth to the
          spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting." The Scripture
          often speaks to us in words like these, "They that sow in tears, shall
          reap in joy." It is always supposed in Scripture, that this life is
          the time of generating, if I may use such an expression, the life that
          is to come, as the seed generates the plant, even so doth this present
          life generate the eternal future. We know, indeed, that heaven and
          hell are, after all, but the developments of our present character,
          for what is hell but this, "He that is filthy, let him be filthy
          still, and he that is unholy, let him be unholy still?" Do we not know
          that in the bowels of every sin, damnation slumbers? Is it not a
          fearful truth that the germ of everlasting torment sleeps in every
          vile wish, every unholy thought, every unclean act, so that hell is
          but a great breaking out of slumbering lava, which had been so quiet,
          that while the mountain was covered with fair verdure, even to its
          summit, death comes and bide that lava rise; and down the steeps of
          manhood's eternal existence, the fiery flame, and the hot scalding
          lava of eternal misery doth pour itself. Yet it was there before, for
          sin is hell, and to rebel against God is but the prelude of misery. So
          is it with heaven; I know that heaven is a reward, not of debt, but of
          grace; but still the Christian has that within him, which forestall
          for him a heaven. What did Christ say? "I give unto my sheep eternal
          life." He did not say, I will give, but, I give unto them. "As soon as
          they believe in me, I give them eternal life," and "he that believeth,
          hath eternal life, and shall never come unto damnation." The Christian
          hath within him the seed-beds of a paradise, in due time the light
          that is sown for the righteous, and the gladness that is buried
          beneath the black earth for the upright in heart, shall spring up, and
          they shall reap the harvest. Is it not plain then that religion is a
          thing which we must have here? Is it not prominently revealed that
          religion is important for the present? for if this life be the seed
          time of the future, how can I expect to reap in another world other
          crops than I have been sowing here? how can I trust that I shall be
          saved, unless I am saved? how can I have hope that heaven shall be my
          eternal inheritance, unless the earnest be begun in my own soul on
          earth?
        </p>
        <p>
          But again, this life is always said in Scripture to be a preparation
          for the life to come, "Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel." "They that
          were ready went in with him to the supper, and the door was shut."
          There is in this world a getting ready for another world; to use a
          Biblical figure, we must here put on the wedding dress, which we are
          to wear for ever. This life is as the vestibule of the king's court,
          we must put our shoes from off our feet; we must wash our garments and
          make ourselves ready to enter into the marriage supper of the Lamb.
          Somehow, in Scripture, the thought comes out as plain as if written
          with a sunbeam, this world is the beginning of the end, -- it is the
          preparing-place for the future. Supposing you have no religion now,
          how will you stand when now is turned into eternity? When days and
          years are gone, how will it fare with you, if all your days have been
          spent without God and without Christ? Do you hope to hurry on the
          white garment after death? Alas! you shall be girt with your shroud,
          but not be able to put on the wedding raiment. Do you trust that you
          shall wash you and make you clean in the river Jordan? Alas! ye shall
          breed corruption in your tomb, but ye shall not find holiness there.
          Do ye trust to be pardoned after you have departed?
        </p>
        <p>"There are no acts of pardon pass'd</p>
        <p>In the cold grave to which we haste;</p>
        <p>But darkness, death, and fell despair,</p>
        <p>Reign in eternal silence there."</p>
        <p>
          Or, do ye think that when ye near the borders of the grave, then will
          be the time to prepare? Be not deceived. We read in Scripture one
          instance of a man saved at the eleventh hour. Remember, there is but
          one; and we have no reason to believe that there ever was, or ever
          will be another. There may have been persons saved on their dying
          beds, but we are not sure there ever were. Such things may have
          happened, but none of us can tell. Alas! facts are sadly against it;
          for we have been assured by those who have had the best means of
          judging -- those who have long walked the hospital of humanity -- that
          such as thought they were dying and made vows of repentance, have
          almost invariably turned back, like "the dog to his own vomit and the
          sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire." Oh no; "To-day if
          ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;" for to-day is the
          preparing time for the dread to-morrow -- to-day is the making ready
          for the eternal future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me urge one other reflection here. How are we saved? All through
          Scripture we are told we are saved by faith, except in one passage,
          wherein it is said, we are saved by hope. Now note, how certain it is
          that religion must be a present thing if we are saved by faith,
          because faith and hope cannot live in another world. "What a man
          seeth, why doth he yet hope for?" Hope cannot exist in that world of
          realities where shadows are unknown. How can faith be exercised when
          we see a thing? for what a man perceiveth by faith that he realises
          not by sense; and although we say "seeing is believing," it is quite
          certain that seeing and believing are at opposite poles. Believing is
          an assurance of that which we see not, and in confidence of faith
          waiting until we do see it; but seeing is sensuous, and the very
          reverse of faith. Now if I am to be saved by faith, it is quite
          certain I must be saved in a state where faith can be exercised that
          is in this world; and if I am to be saved by hope, I cannot be saved
          by hope in that world where hope cannot exist; I must be saved here,
          for here is the only place where hope can breathe an air that lets it
          live. The air of heaven is too bright and pure, too heavenly, too
          warm. too sweet with angels' songs, for faith and hope to inhabit.
          They leave us on this side of the Jordan; if then we are saved by
          these I think it follows -- and every one of you must perceive the
          inference -- we must be saved now, because faith and hope are not
          things of the future. Oh how pleasant, if after these remarks we can
          say, "Yes, it is so; it is even so, and we rejoice therein, for now
          are we the sons of God.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second place, as I have briefly shown the connection between
          the present and the future, let me use another illustration to show
          the importance of a present salvation. Salvation is a thing which
          brings present blessings. When you read Scripture, and alas there are
          few who care to read it as they ought in these times, they read
          anything rather than their Bibles -- when you read Scripture, you will
          be struck with the fact that every blessing is spoken of in the
          present tense. You remember how the apostle in one of his epistles
          says, "Unto them which are saved, Christ power of God and the wisdom
          of God." He does not say to them who shall be saved, but to them which
          are saved. We know too that justification is a present blessing --
          "there is therefore now no condemnation." Adoption is a present
          blessing, for it says, "Now are we the sons of God," and we know also
          that sanctification is a present blessing, for the apostle addresses
          himself to "the saints who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and
          called." All the blessings of the new covenant are spoken of in the
          present tense, because with the exception of eternal glory in heaven,
          they are all to be enjoyed here. I know this, that I shall be one day,
          if I am a believer in Christ, more sanctified than I am to-day -- if
          not in the sense of consecration, yet still in the sense of
          purification -- but at the same time I know this of a surety, that
          when I stand at God's right hand, midst the lamps of eternal
          brightness, and when these fingers move with vigor across the golden
          strings, and when this voice is filled with the immortal songs, I
          shall not be one whit more a child of God than I am now. And when the
          white robe is upon me, and the crown upon my head, I shall not be more
          justified than I am at the present moment, for it is the doctrine of
          Holy Scripture, that
        </p>
        <p>"The moment a sinner believes,</p>
        <p>And trusts in his crucified God,</p>
        <p>His pardon at once he receives</p>
        <p>Salvation in full through his blood."</p>
        <p>
          But the assurance of our possession in these things is a present
          blessing also. I will illustrate what I mean by a circumstance which
          happened to myself. A lady called upon me in some distress of mind,
          and this was her difficulty: -- She had, she trusted, been converted
          to God, enjoyed great peace of mind, and for a little season was very
          full of joy; because she believed that she had been forgiven, and was
          accepted in the beloved. Naturally enough, seeking her religious
          instructor, she went to the clergyman of the parish, who,
          unfortunately for her was a blind guide, for when she began to tell
          him concerning her joy, he checked her, by saying, "My good woman,
          this is all presumption." "Nay, sir," said she "I trust not; my hope
          is fixed on nothing else than Jesus; I repose alone in him." "That is
          right enough," said he, "but you have no authority to say you know you
          are saved; you have no authority to believe that you are already
          pardoned." And he told her that he did not believe it possible for any
          Christian to be assured of this except a very few eminent saints, they
          might hope, that was all; they might trust but they could never be
          sure. Ah! methinks he had gone but a very little way on the road to
          the kingdom of heaven. He must have been but a very small infant in
          Christ, if in Christ at all, to have told her so. For those of us who
          have for a few years put on the Lord Jesus, know of a surety that
          there is such a thing as infallible assurance, we know that although
          there is such a thing as presumption, there is a distinction which
          every Christian can easily mark between the one and the other.
          Presumption says, "I am a child of God, and I may live as like. I know
          I am saved, I need not therefore seek to have present communion with
          Christ." But Assurance says, "I know whom I have believed; I am
          persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
          against that day." And then she meekly bows her head, and says, "Hold
          thou me up and I shall be safe, keep me and I shall be kept; draw me
          and I will run after thee." Oh! my dear hearers, never believe that
          falsehood of the day -- that a man cannot know himself to be a child
          of God. For if you tell us that, we can refute you with a thousand
          testimonies. We have seen the poor, the humble, and the illiterate,
          confident of their interest in Christ. It is true, we have seen them
          doubt; we have heard their wailings when they could not see Christ
          with their heart. Yea we have known the time when the greatest of
          God's people have had to tremble, and say --
        </p>
        <p>"Tis a point I long to know,</p>
        <p>Oft it causes anxious thought --</p>
        <p>'Do I love the Lord, or no?</p>
        <p>Am I his, or am I not?'"</p>
        <p>
          But still, God's people may be assured; they may know, by the witness
          of the Spirit within, that they are born of God; for doth not an
          apostle say, "We know we have passed from death unto life, because we
          love the brethren?" "The Spirit beareth witness with our spirits that
          we are born of God." I would that we had more Christians who lived in
          the enjoyment of full assurance. How precious it is when the milk of
          faith settles down, and the thick cream of full assurance can be
          skimmed from the surface as marrow and fatness to the children of God.
          Religion, then, is a thing of present assurance. A man may know in
          this life, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that he is accepted in Christ
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet I am inclined to think, that the worldly man most of all objects
          to present religion, because he does not like its duties. Most men
          would be very religious if religion did not entail obligations. Many a
          free liver would be a very pious man, if he were not curtailed of a
          few of his bottles of wine. Many a loose character would have no
          objection to go up to the temple and pray, and subscribe his name to
          the God of Jacob, if the gospel did not forbid all uncleanness, and
          everything that is lascivious. Many a tradesman would put on the Lord
          Jesus Christ, if there were no necessity to put off the old man, if he
          could keep his sins and have Christ too -- oh, how willing would he
          be. Indeed, there are a great many who are so fond of it, that they
          have tried it. We know people who are like the Roman Emperor, who
          believed that Jesus Christ was God, but thought that all the other
          strange gods were likewise to be worshipped; so these people think
          religion a very good thing, but think sin a very good thing too, so
          they set up the two together, and their whole life is like Janus,
          two-faced. They look most comely Christians in the synagogue, but they
          look most unmistakable hypocrites if you see them in the market. Men
          will not direct a single eye to religion because it curtails license
          and entails duties. And this, I think, proves that religion is a
          present thing, because the duties of religion cannot be practiced in
          another world, they must be practiced here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what are the duties of religion? In the first place, here are its
          active duties, which a man should do between man and man, to walk
          soberly and righteously, and uprightly in the midst of an evil
          generation. Lightly as some people speak about morality, or against
          morality, there is no true religion where there is no morality. Do not
          tell me about your orthodoxy, do not come and tell me about your
          private prayers and secret piety, if your life be bad, you are bad
          altogether. A good tree cannot bring forth anything but good fruit,
          and a corrupt tree will bring forth corrupt fruit. There is no
          questioning that; what your life is, that you are -- for as out of the
          abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, so out of the abundance of
          the heart the man lives. It is an in vain for you to deprecate so
          strong a sentiment as this, and to say, "The best of saints are
          fallible." I know they are; I know that even the best of men will sin,
          but they will not sin willingly; if they sin publicly, it will be but
          an exception, their lives, under the power of Divine grace, will be
          holy, and pure, and upright. I believe the devil likes Antinomianism,
          and he says to the Romanist, "Preach on, you Priest; I do not mind
          what you preach, for you will enter my dominions. You tell people that
          they may live in sin, and then procure absolution for a shilling! Fine
          doctrine that!" And he pats the priest on the back, and gives him all
          the Assistance he can. Then comes there an Antinomian minister into
          the pulpit. The devil says, "Ah, though he rails against the Pope of
          Rome, I like them both, the one as much as the other." Then how he
          preaches! he begins preaching justification by faith alone, and he
          carries his argument a step too far, for he begins railing at good
          works, calls them legalists, who think it their duty to lead a holy
          life, and hints with a smirk and a smile, that the excellent conduct
          of a man is of little importance, so long as he believes the truth and
          goes to his chapel. "Ah," says the devil, "preach away; I love the two
          things, Antinomianism and Popery, for they are two of the finest
          quacks for canting souls." Again, I say, "Be not deceived, God is not
          mocked; for whatsover a man soweth that shall he also reap." By our
          works we are not to be justified, but still by our works we shall be
          judged, and by our works we shall be condemned. So saith the
          Scriptures, and this we must receive. Religion, therefore, must be a
          present thing; we need not talk of walking righteously, and soberly,
          in the world to come --
        </p>
        <p>"There all is pure, and all is clear,</p>
        <p>There all is joy and love."</p>
        <p>
          There will be no duty to discharge between the tradesman and the
          customer, between the debtor and the creditor, between the father and
          the child, between the husband and the wife, in heaven, for all
          relationships shall have passed away. Religion must be intended for
          this life; the duties of it cannot be practiced, unless they are
          practiced here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But besides these, there are other duties devolving upon the
          Christian. Though it is every man's duty to be honest and sober, the
          Christian has another code of law. It is the Christian's duty to love
          his enemies, to be at peace with all men, to forgive as he hopes to be
          forgiven; and it is his duty not to resist evil, when smitten on the
          one cheek to turn the other also; it is his duty to give to him that
          asketh of him and from him that would borrow of him not to turn away
          -- he is to be a liberal soul devising liberal things. It is the
          Christian's duty to visit his Master's children when they are sick, so
          that it may be said to him at last, "I was sick, and naked, and in
          prison, and ye visited me, and ministered to my necessities." Now, if
          religion be not a thing for this world, I ask you how is it possible
          to perform its duties at all? There are no poor in heaven whom we can
          comfort and visit, there are no enemies in heaven whom we can
          graciously forgive; and there are no injuries inflicted, or wrongs
          endured, which we can bear with patience. Religion must have been
          intended in the very first place for this world, it must have been
          meant that now we should be the sons of God. For again I repeat it,
          that the major part of the duties of religion cannot be practiced in
          heaven, and therefore religion must be a present thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, coming near to our conclusion, I believe there are many more
          persons who do not like religion for to-day, but who want to have it
          at the last, for this reason: they think religion is not a happy
          thing; they believe it makes men miserable. They have met with persons
          with long faces, they have seen some who were born in stormy weather,
          and who seem to have lived all their lives long with a hurricane
          inside their hearts, never having one flash of sunlight, nor one
          pleasant rainbow across their brow. Many young people imbibe this
          idea. They think that surely religion must be a thing that will make
          men go moping and melancholy all through this world. In fact, they
          enter the chapel sometimes, and they hear the saints singing -- and
          what a sweet hymn it is -- a sorry sweetness in truth! --
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, what a wretched land is this;"</p>
        <p>
          and they go out and say, "No doubt it is, we will have nothing to do
          with it." Looking upon religion as medicine which is extremely
          nauseous, -- if they must drink it, they will put it off to the last;
          they will gulp it down with a "Lord, have mercy on me!" and ere its
          bitterness is fairly in their mouth, they expect to begin to enjoy its
          sweetness in heaven. What a mistake! Religion has its present
          enjoyments. I do solemnly affirm to-day, in the face of this
          congregation, and before Almighty God, if I were certain that I were
          to die like a dog and when I was buried there would be an end of me,
          had I my choice of the happiest life a man could lead, I would say,
          "Let me be a Christian," for if, as some say, it be a delusion, it is
          one of the most magnificent delusions that ever we. devised. If any
          man could prove the religion of Christ to be a delusion, the next
          thing he should do would be to hang himself, because there is nothing
          worth living for. He might well sit down and weep to think he had made
          a ruin of so goodly a structure, and dissolved such a pleasant dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! beloved, there are present enjoyments in religion. Speak, ye that
          know them, for ye can tell; yet ye cannot recount them all. Oh! would
          ye give up your religion for all the joys that earth calls good or
          great? Say, if your immortal life could be extinguished, would you
          give it up, even for all the kingdoms of this world? Oh: ye sons of
          poverty, has not this been a candle to you in the darkness? Has not
          this lightened you through the dark shades of your tribulation? Oh! ye
          horny handed sons of toil, has not this been your rest, your sweet
          reposer; Have not the testimonies of God been your song in the house
          of your pilgrimage? Oh! ye daughters of sorrow, ye who spend the most
          of your time upon your beds -- and your couch to you is a rack of pain
          -- has not religion been to you a sweet quietus? When your bones were
          sore vexed, could ye not even then praise him on your beds? Speak from
          your couches to-day, ye consumptives, blanched though your cheeks;
          speak this day from your beds of agony, ye that are troubled with
          inumerable diseases, and are drawing near your last home? Is not
          religion worth having in the sick chamber, on the bed of pain and
          anguish? "Ah!" they heartily say," we can praise him on our beds; we
          can sing his high praises in the fires." And ye men of business, speak
          for yourselves! You have hard struggles to pass through life.
          Sometimes you have been driven to a great extremity, and whether you
          would succeed or not seemed to hang upon a thread. Has not your
          religion been a joy to you in your difficulties? Has it not calmed
          your minds? When you have been fretted and troubled about worldly
          things, have you not found it a pleasant thing to enter your closet,
          and shut-to the door, and tell your Father in secret all your cares?
          And O ye that are rich, cannot you bear the same testimony, if you
          have loved the Master? What had all your riches been to you without a
          Saviour? Can you not say, that your religion did gild your gold, and
          make your silver shine more brightly? for all things that you have are
          sweetened by this thought, that you have all these and Christ too! Was
          there ever a child of God who could deny this? We have heard of many
          infidels who grieved over their infidelity when they came to die. Did
          you ever hear of a Christian acting the counterpart? Did you ever hear
          of any one on his death-bed looking back on a life of holiness with
          sorrow? We have seen the rake, with a wasted constitution shrivel into
          a corpse through his iniquities, and we have heard him bemoan the day
          in which he went astray. We have seen the poor debauched child of sin
          rotting with disease, and listened to her shriek, and heard her
          miserably curse herself that she ever turned aside, to what was called
          the path of gaiety, but what was really the path to hell. We have seen
          the miser too, who has gripped his bags of gold, and on his dying bed
          we have found him curse himself, that when he came to die, his gold,
          though laid upon his heart, could not still its achings and give him
          joy. Never, never did we know a Christian who repented of his
          Christianity. We have seen Christians so sick, that we wondered that
          they lived -- so poor, that we pondered at their misery; we have seen
          them so full of doubts, that we pitied their unbelief; but we never
          heard them say, even then, "I regret that I gave myself to Christ."
          No; with the dying clasp, when heart and flesh were failing, we have
          seen them hug this treasure to their breast and press it to their
          heart, still feeling that this was their life, their joy, their all.
          Oh! if ye would be happy, if ye would be saved, if ye would strew your
          path with sunshine, and dig out the nettles and blunt the thorns,
          "seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these
          things shall be added unto you." Seek not happiness first; seek Christ
          first, and happiness shall come after. Seek ye first the Lord, and
          then he will provide for you everything that is profitable for you in
          this life and he will crown it with everything that is glorious in the
          life to come. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before closing this discourse, I fear that there are a great many of
          you who will say, "Well, I care nothing at all about religion. it is
          of no avail to me;" No, my friends, and it is very probable that you
          will not care about it, until it shall be too late to care. Mayhap you
          will go on putting off these thoughts, until the day shall come, when
          they will come so thick upon you, that you will not be able to
          procrastinate any longer, and then will you in right earnest set about
          seeking Christ; but at that hour he will say to you, "Inasmuch as Moab
          hath wearied himself upon the high places, and he betaketh himself to
          my sanctuary, I will not hear him, saith the Lord." "Strive to enter
          in at the strait gate" now, "for many shall seek to enter in, but
          shall not be able." Let us fear, lest, having the gospel preached in
          our ears, we should neglect and put it off until the last hour has
          struck, and we find ourselves without hope, when there is no time to
          seek a Saviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know where this morning's sermon will be found profitable. It will
          be in the case of those who are seeking Christ. Old Flockhart, who
          used to preach till within the last few months in the streets of
          Edinburgh, a much despised, but a very godly man, used to say, "When I
          begin my sermon, I begin by preaching the law, and then I bring the
          gospel afterwards; for," he said, "it is like a woman who is sewing --
          she cannot sew with thread alone; she first sticks a sharp needle
          through, and then draws the thread afterwards. so," he says, "does the
          Lord with us; he sends the sharp needle of conviction, the needle of
          the law, into our hearts. and pricks us in the heart, and he draws
          through the long silken thread of consolation afterwards." Oh! I would
          that some of you were pricked in the heart to-day. Remember, there are
          thunders in this book; though they are sleeping now, they will wake
          by-and-bye. There are in this Bible curses too horrible for heart to
          know their full extent of meaning; they are slumbering now, but they
          shall waken and when they leap from between the folded leaves, and the
          seven seals are broken, where will you flee, and where shall you hide
          yourselves, in that last great day of anger? If, then, ye are pricked
          to the heart, I preach to you the gospel now. "Today, if ye will hear
          his voice. harden not your hearts, as in the provocation." This day
          look to him that hung upon the cross. This day believe and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now to illustrate the manner in which rebellious sinners are
          reconciled to God, I will relate to you an interesting anecdote from
          the life of a soldier. It may picture to your minds the majesty of God
          in strewing grace, and the humbling experience of the sinner in
          receiving it, and help us to answer that solemn question -- "What must
          I do to be saved?" My author says, that himself and his comrades of a
          certain regiment serving in India, had been without pay for about six
          months, and there has strong suspicion throughout the ranks that their
          commanding officer had embezzled the money: he was a great gambler,
          and they thought it most likely that he had gambled away their pay.
          They were determined to seek redress; so all the private soldiers
          (with the exception of non-commissioned officers,) agreed that on a
          particular morning, when on parade, they should not obey the word of
          command. The day arrived, and they carried their design into
          execution. The regiment was assembled; the men in companies, headed by
          their respective officers, proceeded to the parade ground, and formed
          into open column. The commanding officer took his station in front and
          gave the word of command. Not one, however, of the privates obeyed.
          This being the conduct of the regiment, the commanding officer, with
          great self-possession, ordered every tenth man to be confined in the
          guard-house. It was done without a show of resistance. After which,
          all the privates fixed bayonets, shouldered arms, and marched off --
          the band playing and the drums beating alternately -- all the way to
          the residence of the general, about a mile distant. There they halted,
          and formed in line fronting the house, in a most orderly manner. One
          man from each of the ten companies then stepped forward, and they
          proceeded to lodge a written complaint against the colonel. Having
          thus fulfilled their purpose, they marched back, and dismissed; but
          the next thing was to release the prisoners, and this they did without
          any violence being offered by the guard. Whatever extenuations we may
          conceive for such conduct, according to military law it was a heinous
          crime. The soldier's duty is to obey; he must not think for himself,
          but he must be as a tool in the hands of his superior officers, to do
          as he is told, and not to complain. Shortly after this, to the
          surprise of these soldiers, the general was seen approaching with a
          large army of Sepoys, infantry and cavalry, with field pieces in
          front. The regiment went out and respectfully saluted him, forming in
          line. But this was not what the general came for. They saw the storm
          brewing and prepared to fight. After the two lines had been formed,
          facing each other, the General moved out on horseback. and said,
          "Twenty-second, take the command from me." They obeyed. He then said,
          "Order arms." Next -- "Handle arms;" -- and last, which was most
          disgraceful to them -- "Ground army" Having thus disarmed, he ordered
          his black cavalry to charge upon them, and drive them from their arms.
          One more order he gave to those disaffected men, that they should
          strip off their accoutrements and lay them on the ground, and be off
          to their cantonments. When he had thus disarmed and dishonored the
          men, he forgave them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now will not this incident fitly represent the manner of God with
          sinners, when according to the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, he
          brings terms of peace and reconciliation to us who are in revolt
          against him? He says, "Ground arms, give up your sins, take off your
          self-righteousness." He disarms us, dishonors us, and strips on all
          our comely array, and then says, "Now I will forgive you." If there be
          any one here who has thrown down his weapons of rebellion, and whose
          fine ornaments of beauty are stained with shame, let him believe that
          God will now forgive him; he forgives those who cannot forgive
          themselves. The great Captain of our salvation will pardon those whom
          he has humbled. He will have you submit to his will, and though that
          will may at first seem imperious to drive you from your quarters, and
          visit you with punishment, you shall presently find that his sovereign
          will is gracious, and he delighteth in mercy. "Believe on the Lord
          Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved," for thus saith the Word, "He
          that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth
          not shall be damned."<br />
