<p align="justify"><br/>
    TITLE. Maschil of Asaph. This is rightly entitled an instructive Psalm. It 
    is not a mere recapitulation of important events in Israelitish history, but 
    is intended to be viewed as a parable setting forth the conduct and 
    experience of believers in all ages. It is a singular proof of the 
    obtuseness of mind of many professors that they will object to sermons and 
    expositions upon the historical parts of Scripture, as if they contained no 
    instruction in spiritual matters: were such persons truly enlightened by the 
    Spirit of God, they would perceive that all Scripture is profitable, and 
    would blush at their own folly in undervaluing any portion of the inspired 
    volume.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. Give ear, O my people, to my law. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The inspired bard calls on his countrymen to give heed to 
    his patriotic teaching. We naturally expect God's chosen nation to be first 
    in hearkening to his voice. When God gives his truth a tongue, and sends 
    forth his messengers trained to declare his word with power, it is the least 
    we can do to give them our ears and the earnest obedience of our hearts. <i>
    Shall God speak, and his children refuse to hear? His teaching has the force 
    of law, let us yield both ear and heart to it. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Give earnest attention, bow your stiff necks, lean 
    forward to catch every syllable. We are at this day, <i>as readers of the 
    sacred records, bound to study them deeply, exploring their meaning, and 
    laboring to practice their teaching.</i> As the officer of an army commences 
    his drill by calling for "Attention," even so every trained soldier of 
    Christ is called upon to give ear to his words. Men lend their ears to 
    music, how much more then should they listen to the harmonies of the gospel; 
    they sit enthralled in the presence of an orator, how much rather should 
    they yield to the eloquence of Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. I will open my mouth in a parable.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Analogies are not only to be imagined—but are intended by 
    God to be traced between <i>the story of Israel and the lives of believers</i>. 
    Israel was ordained to be a type; the tribes and their marchings are living 
    allegories traced by the hand of an all wise providence. Unspiritual persons 
    may sneer about fancies and mysticisms—but Paul spoke well when he said 
    "which things are an allegory," and Asaph in the present case spoke to the 
    point when he called his narrative "a parable." That such was his meaning is 
    clear from the quotation, "All these things spoke Jesus unto the multitude 
    in parables; and without a parable spoke he not unto them: that it might be 
    fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in 
    parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the 
    foundation of the world." Matthew 13:34-35. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will utter dark sayings of old</p></b>.
<p align="justify">Enigmas of antiquity, riddles of yore. The mind of the 
    poet prophet was so full of ancient lore that he poured it forth in a 
    copious stream of song, while <i>beneath the gushing flood lay pearls and 
    gems of spiritual truth, capable of enriching those who could dive into the 
    depths and bring them up. </i>The <i>letter </i>of this song is precious—but 
    the <i>inner sense </i>is beyond all price. Whereas the first verse called 
    for attention, the second justifies the demand by hinting that <i>the outer 
    sense conceals an inner and hidden meaning, which only the thoughtful will 
    be able to perceive.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Which we have heard and known, and our fathers 
    have told us.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Tradition was of the utmost service to the people of God 
    in the olden time, before the more sure word of prophecy had become complete 
    and generally accessible. The receipt of truth from the lips of others laid 
    the instructed believer under solemn obligation to pass on the truth to the 
    next generation. <i>Truth, endeared to us by its fond associations with 
    godly parents and venerable friends, deserves of us our best exertions to 
    preserve and propagate it. </i>Our fathers told us, we hear them, and we 
    know personally what they taught; it remains for us in our turn to hand it 
    on. Blessed be God we have now the less mutable testimony of written 
    revelation—but this by no means lessens our obligation to instruct our 
    children in divine truth by word of mouth; rather, with such a gracious 
    help, we ought to teach them far more fully the things of God. Dr. Doddridge 
    owed much to his mother's explanations of the Bible narratives.<i> The more 
    of parental teaching the better; ministers and Sabbath school teachers were 
    never meant to be substitutes for mother's tears and father's prayers.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. We will not hide them from their children. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Our negligent silence shall not deprive our own and our 
    father's offspring of the precious truth of God, it would be shameful indeed 
    if we did so. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Showing to the generation to come the praises of the 
    Lord. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">We will look forward to future generations, and endeavor 
    to provide for their godly education. It is the duty of the church of God to 
    maintain, in fullest vigor, every agency intended for the religious 
    education of the young; to them we must look for the church of the future, 
    and as we sow towards them so shall we reap. </p>
<p align="justify">Children are to be taught to magnify the Lord; they ought 
    to be well informed as to his wonderful doings in ages past, and should be 
    made to know his strength and his wonderful works that he has done.<i> The 
    best education is education in the best things. The first lesson for a child 
    should be concerning his mother's God. Teach him what you will, if he learn 
    not the fear of the Lord, he will perish for lack of knowledge. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Grammar is poor food for the soul if it be not flavored 
    with grace. Every satchel should have a Bible in it. The world may teach 
    secular knowledge alone, it is all she has a heart to know—but the church 
    must not deal so with her offspring; she should look well to every Timothy, 
    and see to it that from a child he knows the Holy Scriptures. Around the 
    fireside fathers should repeat not only the Bible records—but the deeds of 
    the martyrs and reformers, and moreover the dealings of the Lord with 
    themselves both in providence and grace. </p>
<p align="justify">We dare not follow the vain and wicked traditions of the 
    apostate church of Rome, neither would we compare the fallible record of the 
    best human memories with the infallible written word—yet would we gladly see 
    oral tradition practiced by every Christian in his family, and children 
    taught cheerfully by word of mouth by their own mothers and fathers, as well 
    as by the printed pages of what they too often regard as dull, dry task 
    books. What happy hours and pleasant evenings have children had at their 
    parents knees as they have listened to some "sweet story of old." Reader, if 
    you have children, mind you do not fail in this duty.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. For he established a testimony in Jacob.</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">The favored nation existed for the very purpose of 
    maintaining God's truth in the midst of surrounding idolatry</p></i>. Theirs 
    were the oracles, they were the conservators and guardians of the truth. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our 
    fathers, that they should make them known to their children.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The testimony for the true God was to be transmitted from 
    generation to generation by the careful instruction of following families. 
    We have the command for this oral transmission very frequently given in the 
    Pentateuch, and it may suffice to quote one instance from Deuteronomy 6:7, 
    "And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, and shall talk of 
    them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you 
    lie down, and when you rise up." Reader, if you are a parent, have you 
    conscientiously discharged this duty?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. That the generation to come might know them, 
    even the children which should be born. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As far on as our brief life allows us to arrange, we must 
    industriously provide for the godly nurture of youth. The narratives, 
    commands, and doctrines of the word of God are not worn out; they are 
    calculated to exert an influence as long as our race shall exist. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Who should arise and declare them to their children. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The one object aimed at is transmission; the testimony is 
    only given that it may be passed on to following generations.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. That they might set their hope in God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Faith comes by hearing. Those who know the name of the 
    Lord will set their hope in him, and that they may be led to do so is the 
    main end of all spiritual teaching. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And not forget the works of God</p></b>. 
<p align="justify">Grace cures bad memories; those who soon forget the 
    merciful works of the Lord have need of teaching; they require to learn the 
    divine are of holy memory. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But keep his commandments. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Those who forget God's works are sure to fail in their 
    own. He who does not keep God's love in memory is not likely to remember his 
    law. <i>The design of teaching is practical; holiness towards God is the end 
    we aim at, and not the filling of the head with speculative notions.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn 
    and rebellious generation. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There was room for improvement. Fathers stubborn in their 
    own way, and rebellious against God's way, are sorry examples for their 
    children; and it is earnestly desired that better instruction may bring 
    forth a better race. It is common in some regions for men to count their 
    family custom as the very best rule; but disobedience is not to be excused 
    because it is hereditary. The leprosy was none the less loathsome because it 
    had been long in the family. If our fathers were rebellious we must be 
    better than they were, or else we shall perish as they did. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">A generation that set not their heart aright.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They had no decision for righteousness and truth. In them 
    there was no preparedness, or willingness of heart, to entertain the Savior;
    <i>neither judgments, nor mercies could bind their affections to their God;
    </i>they were fickle as the winds, and changeful as the waves. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And whose spirit was not steadfast with God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The tribes in the wilderness were constant only in their 
    inconstancy; there was no depending upon them. It was, indeed, needful that 
    their descendants should be warned, so that they might not blindly imitate 
    them. How blessed it would be if each age improved upon its predecessor; 
    but, alas! it is to be feared that decline is more general than progress, 
    and too often the heirs of true saints are far more rebellious than even 
    their fathers were in their unregeneracy. May the reading of this patriotic 
    and divine song move many to labor after the elevation of themselves and 
    their posterity.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. The children of Ephraim, being armed, and 
    carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Well equipped and furnished with the best weapons of the 
    times, the leading tribe failed in faith and courage and retreated before 
    the foe. There were several particular instances of this—but probably the 
    psalmist refers to the general failure of Ephraim to lead the tribes to the 
    conquest of Canaan. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">How often have we also, although supplied with every 
    gracious weapon, failed to wage successful war against our sins</p></i>, we have 
    marched onward gallantly enough until the testing hour has come, and then 
    "in the day of battle "we have proved false to good resolutions and holy 
    obligations. <i>How altogether vain is unregenerate man! </i>Array him in 
    the best that nature and grace can supply, he still remains a helpless 
    coward in the holy war, so long as he lacks a loyal faith in his God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. They kept not the covenant of God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Vows and promises were broken, idols were set up, and the 
    living God was forsaken. They were brought out of Egypt in order to be a 
    people separated unto the Lord—but they fell into the sins of other nations, 
    and did not maintain a pure testimony for the one only true God. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And refused to walk in his law. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They gave way to fornication, and idolatry, and other 
    violations of the decalogue, and were often in a state of rebellion against 
    the benign theocracy under which they lived. They had pledged themselves at 
    Sinai to keep the law, and then they willfully disobeyed it, and so became 
    covenant breakers.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. And forgot his works, and his wonders that he 
    had showed them. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Had they remembered them they would have been filled with 
    gratitude and inspired with holy awe: but <i>the memory of God's mercies to 
    them was as soon effaced as if written upon water</i>. Scarcely could one 
    generation retain the sense of the divine presence in miraculous power, the 
    following race needed a renewal of the extraordinary manifestations, and 
    even then was not satisfied without many displays thereof. <i>Before we 
    condemn them, let us repent of our own wicked forgetfulness, and confess the 
    many occasions upon which we also have been unmindful of past favors.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. He did miracles in the sight of their fathers 
    in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Egypt, here called the region of Zoan, was the scene of 
    marvelous things which were done in open day in the sight of Israel. These 
    were extraordinary, upon a vast scale, astounding, indisputable, and such as 
    ought to have rendered it impossible for an Israelite to be disloyal to 
    Jehovah, Israel's God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. He divided the sea, and caused them to pass 
    through. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A double wonder, for when the waters were divided the 
    bottom of the sea would naturally be in a very unfit state for the passage 
    of so vast a host as that of Israel; it would in fact have been impassable, 
    had not the Lord made the road for his people. <i>Who else has ever led a 
    nation through a sea? Yet the Lord has done this full often for his saints 
    in providential deliverances, making a highway for them where nothing short 
    of an almighty arm could have done so. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He forbade a drop to fall upon his chosen, they felt no 
    spray from the crystal walls on either hand. Fire will descend and water 
    stand upright at the bidding of the Lord of all. The nature of creatures is 
    not their own intrinsically—but is retained or altered at the will of him 
    who first created them. The Lord can cause those evils which threaten to 
    overwhelm us to suspend their ordinary actions, and become innocuous to us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud.</p></b>

<p align="justify">HE did it all. He alone. He brought them into the 
    wilderness, and he led them through it; it is not the Lord's manner to begin 
    a work, and then cease from it while it is incomplete. The cloud both led 
    and shadowed the tribes. It was by day a vast sun screen, rendering the 
    fierce heat of the sun and the glare of the desert sand bearable. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And all the night with a light of fire. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">So constant was the care of the Great Shepherd that all 
    night and every night the token of his presence was with his people. That 
    cloud which was a shade by day was as a sun by night. Even thus the grace 
    which cools and calms our joys, soothes and solaces our sorrows. What a 
    mercy to have a light of fire with us amid the lonely horrors of the 
    wilderness of affliction. Our God has been all this to us, and shall we 
    prove unfaithful to him? We have felt him to be both shade and light, 
    according as our changing circumstances have required.</p>
<p align="justify">"He has been our joy in woe,<br/>
    Cheered our heart when it was low,<br/>
    And, with warnings softly sad,<br/>
    Calmed our heart when it was glad."</p>
<p align="justify">May this frequently renewed experience knit our hearts to 
    him in firmest bonds.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. He cleave the rocks in the wilderness.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Moses was the instrument—but the Lord did it all. Twice 
    he made the flint a gushing rill. What can he <i>not </i>do? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And gave them drink as out of the great depths</p></b>—as 
    though it gushed from earth's innermost reservoirs. The streams were so 
    fresh, so copious, so constant, that they seemed to well up from the earth's 
    primeval fountains, and to leap at once from "the deep which couches 
    beneath." Here was a divine supply for Israel's urgent need, and such an one 
    as ought to have held them forever in unwavering fidelity to their wonder 
    working God.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. He brought streams also out of the rock, and 
    caused waters to run down like rivers.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The supply of water was as plenteous in quantity as it 
    was miraculous in origin. Torrents, not driblets came from the rocks. <i>
    Streams followed the camp</i>; the supply was not for an hour or a day. This 
    was a marvel of goodness. <i>If we contemplate the abounding of divine grace 
    we shall be lost in admiration. Mighty rivers of love have flowed for us in 
    the wilderness. </i>Alas, great God! our return has not been commensurate 
    therewith—but far otherwise.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. And they sinned yet more against him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Outdoing their former sins, going into greater deeps of 
    evil: the more they had the more loudly they clamored for more, and <i>
    murmured because they had not every luxury that pampered appetites could 
    desire</i>. It was bad enough to mistrust their God for <i>necessities</i>—but 
    to revolt against him in a greedy rage for superfluities was far worse. Ever 
    is it the nature of the disease of sin to proceed from bad to worse; <i>men 
    never weary of sinning—but rather increase their speed in the race of 
    iniquity</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">In the case before us the goodness of God was abused into 
    a reason for greater sin. Had not the Lord been so good they would not have 
    been so bad. If he had wrought fewer miracles before, they would not have 
    been so inexcusable in their unbelief, so wanton in their idolatry. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">By provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Although they were in a position of obvious dependence 
    upon God for everything, being in a desert where the soil could yield them 
    no support—yet they were graceless enough to provoke their benefactor. At 
    one time they provoked his jealousy by their hankering after false gods; 
    anon they excited his wrath by their challenges of his power, their slanders 
    against his love, their rebellions against his will. He was all bounty of 
    love, and they all superfluity of naughtiness. They were favored above all 
    nations, and yet none were more ill favored.<i> For them the heavens dropped 
    manna, and they returned murmurs; the rocks gave them rivers, and they 
    replied with floods of wickedness</i>. Herein, as in a mirror, we see 
    ourselves. <i>Israel in the wilderness acted out, as in a drama, all the 
    story of man's conduct towards his God.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. And they tempted God in their heart. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was not tempted, for he cannot be tempted by any—but 
    they acted in a manner calculated to tempt him, and it always just to charge 
    that upon men which is the obvious tendency of their conduct. </p>
<p align="justify">Christ cannot die again, and yet many crucify him afresh, 
    because such would be the legitimate result of their behavior if its effects 
    were not prevented by other forces. The sinners in the wilderness would have 
    had the Lord change his wise proceedings to humor their whims, hence they 
    are said to tempt him. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">By asking food for their lust.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Would they have God become purveyor for their greediness? 
    Was there nothing for it but that he must give them whatever their diseased 
    appetites might crave? <i>The sin began in their hearts—but it soon reached 
    their tongues. </i>What they at first silently wished for, they soon loudly 
    demanded with menaces, insinuations, and upbraidings.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 19. Yes, they spoke against God: They said, "Can 
    God prepare a table in the wilderness?"</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">From this verse we learn that unbelief of God is a 
    slander against him. Yes, they spoke against God. But how? The answer is, 
    They said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? To question the 
    ability of one who is manifestly Almighty, is to speak against him. These 
    people were base enough to say that although their God had given them bread 
    and water—yet he could not properly order or furnish a table. He could give 
    them coarse food—but could not prepare a feast properly arranged, so they 
    were ungrateful enough to declare. As if the manna was a mere makeshift, and 
    the flowing rock stream a temporary expedient, they ask to have a regularly 
    furnished table, such as they had been accustomed to in Egypt. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Alas, how have we also quarreled with our mercies, and 
    querulously pined for some imaginary good, counting our actual enjoyments to 
    be nothing because they did not happen to be exactly conformed to our 
    foolish fancies. They who will not be content, will speak against providence 
    even when it daily loads them with benefits.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 20. Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters 
    gushed out, and the streams overflowed. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They admit what he had done, and yet, with superabundant 
    folly and insolence, demand further proofs of his omnipotence. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his 
    people? </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As if the manna were nothing, as if animal food alone was 
    true nourishment for men. If they had argued, "can he not give flesh?" the 
    argument would have been reasonable—but they ran into insanity; when, having 
    seen many marvels of omnipotence, they dared to insinuate that other things 
    were beyond the divine power. </p>
<p align="justify">Yet, in this also, we have imitated their senseless 
    conduct. <i>Each new difficulty has excited fresh incredulity. We are still 
    fools and slow of heart to believe our God, and this is a fault to be 
    bemoaned with deepest penitence. </i>For this cause the Lord is often angry 
    with us and chastens us sorely; for unbelief has in it a degree of 
    provocation of the highest kind.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 21. Therefore the Lord heard this, and was angry.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was not <i>indifferent </i>to what they said. He dwelt 
    among them in the holy place, and, therefore, they insulted him to his face. 
    He did not hear a report of it—but the language itself came into his ears.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">So a fire was kindled against Jacob.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The fire of his anger which was also attended with 
    literal burnings.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And anger also came up against Israel. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Whether he viewed them in the lower or higher light, as 
    Jacob or as Israel, he was angry with them: even as mere men they ought to 
    have believed him; and as chosen tribes, their wicked unbelief was without 
    excuse<i>. The Lord does well to be angry at so ungrateful, gratuitous and 
    dastardly an insult as the questioning of his power.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 22. Because they believed not in God, and trusted 
    not in his salvation.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is the master sin, the crying sin. Like Jeroboam, 
    the son of Nebat, it sins and makes Israel to sin; it is in itself evil and 
    the parent of evils. It was this sin which shut Israel out of Canaan, and it 
    shuts myriads out of Heaven. God is ready to save, combining power with 
    willingness—but rebellious man will not trust his Savior, and therefore is 
    condemned already. In the text it appears as if all Israel's other sins were 
    as nothing compared with this; this is the peculiar spot which the Lord 
    points at, the special provocation which angered him. From this let every 
    unbeliever learn to tremble more at his unbelief than at anything else. If 
    he be no fornicator, or thief, or liar, let him reflect that it is quite 
    enough to condemn him that he trusts not in God's salvation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 23. Though he had commanded the clouds from above.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Such a marvel ought to have rendered unbelief impossible: 
    when clouds become granaries, seeing should be believing, and doubts should 
    dissolve. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And opened the doors of Heaven.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The great storehouse doors were set wide open, and the 
    grain of Heaven poured out in heaps. Those who would not believe in such a 
    case were hardened indeed; and yet our own position is very similar, for the 
    Lord has wrought for us great deliverances, quite as memorable and 
    undeniable, and yet suspicions and forebodings haunt us. He might have shut 
    the gates of Hell upon us, instead of which he has opened the doors of 
    Heaven; shall we not both believe in him and magnify him for this?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 24. And had rained down manna upon them to eat. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There was so much of it, the skies poured with food, the 
    clouds burst with provender. It was fit food, proper not for looking at but 
    for eating; they could eat it as they gathered it. Mysterious though it was, 
    so that they called it manna, or "what is it?" yet it was eminently adapted 
    for human nourishment; and it was both <i>abundant </i>and <i>adapted</i>, 
    so also was it <i>available!</i> They had not far to fetch it, it was near 
    them, and they had only to gather it up. </p>
<p align="justify">O Lord Jesus, you blessed manna of Heaven, how all this 
    agrees with You! We will even now feed on You as our spiritual meat, and 
    will pray You to chase away all wicked unbelief from us. Our fathers ate 
    manna and doubted; we feed upon You and are filled with assurance. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And had given them of the grain of Heaven.</p></b> It was all 
    a gift without money and without price. Food which dropped from above, and 
    was of the best quality, so as to be called heavenly grain, was freely 
    granted them. The manna was round, like a coriander seed, and hence was 
    rightly called grain; it did not rise from the earth—but descended from the 
    clouds, and hence the words of the verse are literally accurate. The point 
    to be noted is that this wonder of wonders left the beholders, and the 
    feasters, as prone as ever to mistrust their Lord.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 25. Man ate angel's food.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The delicacies of kings were outdone, for the dainties of 
    angels were supplied. Bread of the mighty ones fell on feeble man. Those who 
    are lower than the angels fared as well. It was not for the priests, or the 
    princes, that the manna fell; but for all the nation, for every man, woman, 
    and child in the camp: and there was sufficient for them all, for he sent 
    them food to the full. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">God's banquets are never stinted; he gives the best diet, 
    and plenty of it.</p></i> Gospel provisions deserve every praise that we can 
    heap upon them; they are free, full, and preeminent; they are of God's 
    preparing, sending, and bestowing. He is well fed, whom God feeds; Heaven's 
    food is nourishing and plentiful. If we have ever fed upon Jesus we have 
    tasted better than angel's food; for
<p align="justify">"Never did angels taste above<br/>
 Redeeming grace and dying love!"</p>
<p align="justify">It will be our wisdom to eat to the full of it, for God 
    has so sent it that we are not straitened in him—but in our own affections. 
    Happy pilgrims who in the desert have their food sent from the Lord's own 
    palace above; <i>let them eat abundantly of the celestial banquet, and 
    magnify the all sufficient grace which supplies all their needs, according 
    to His riches in glory, by Christ Jesus.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 26. He caused an east wind to blow in the Heaven.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He is Lord Paramount, above the prince of the power of 
    the air:<i> storms arise and tempests blow at his command. </i>Winds sleep 
    until God arouses them, and then, like Samuel, each one answers, "Here am I, 
    for you called me." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And by his power he brought in the south wind. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Either these winds followed each other, and so blew the 
    birds in the desired direction, or else they combined to form a south east 
    wind; in either case they fulfilled the design of the Lord, and illustrated 
    his supreme and universal power. If one wind will not serve, another shall; 
    and if need be, they shall both blow at once. <i>We speak of fickle 
    winds—but their obedience to their Lord is such that they deserve a better 
    word. If we ourselves were half as obedient as the winds, we would be far 
    superior to what we are now.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 27. He rained flesh also upon them as dust.</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">First he rained bread and then flesh, when he might have 
    rained fire and brimstone.</p></i> The words indicate the speed, and the 
    abundance of the descending quail. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And feathered birds like as the sand of the sea.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There was no counting them. By a remarkable providence, 
    if not by miracle, enormous numbers of migratory birds were caused to alight 
    around the tents of the tribes. It was, however, a doubtful blessing, as 
    easily acquired and super abounding riches generally are. <i>The Lord save 
    us from food which is seasoned with divine wrath.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They had no journey to make; they had clamored for flesh, 
    and it almost flew into their mouths.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Round about their habitations. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This made them glad for the moment—but they knew not that 
    mercies can be sent in anger, else they had trembled at sight of the good 
    things which they had lusted after.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 29. So they ate, and were well filled.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They greedily devoured the birds, even to repletion. The 
    Lord showed them that he could "provide flesh for his people," even enough 
    and to spare. He also showed them that <i>when lust wins its desire it is 
    disappointed, and by the way of satiety arrive at distaste</i>. First the 
    food satiates, then it nauseates.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For he gave them their own desire.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">They were filled with their own ways. The food was 
    unhealthy for them—but <i>as they cried for it they had it, and a curse with 
    it.</i> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">O my God, deny me my most urgent prayers sooner than 
    answer them in displeasure. Better hunger and thirst after righteousness 
    than to be well filled with sin's dainties.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verses 30-31. They were not estranged from their lust.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Lust grows upon that which it feeds on. If sick of too 
    much flesh—yet men grow not weary of lust, they change the object, and go on 
    lusting still. When one sin is proved to be a bitterness, men do not 
    desist—but pursue another iniquity. If, like Jehu, they turn from Baal, they 
    fall to worshiping the calves of Bethel.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But while their food was yet in their mouths.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Before they could digest their coveted meat, it turned to 
    their destruction. The wrath of God came upon them before they could swallow 
    their first meal of flesh.<i> Short was the pleasure, sudden was the doom. 
    The festival ended in a funeral. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen 
    men of Israel.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Perhaps these were the ringleaders in the lusting; they 
    are first in the punishment. God's justice has no respect of persons, the 
    strong and the valiant fall as well as the weak and the mean. <i>What they 
    ate on earth they digested in Hell, as many have done since. </i>How soon 
    they died, though they felt not the edge of the sword! How terrible was the 
    havoc, though not amid the din of battle! </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">My soul, see here the danger of gratified passions—they 
    are the conductors to Hell. </p></i>When the Lord's people hunger, God loves 
    them; Lazarus is his beloved, though he pines upon crumbs. But when God 
    fattens the wicked, he abhors them. The rich man is hated by God when he 
    fares sumptuously every day. We must never dare to judge men's happiness by 
    their tables, the heart is the place to look at. The poorest starveling 
    believer is more to be envied than the most full fleshed of the favorites of 
    the world. <i>Better to be God's dog, than the devil's darling!
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 32. For all this they still sinned.</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Judgments moved them no more than mercies. They defied 
    the wrath of God. Though death was in the cup of their iniquity—yet they 
    would not put it away—but continued to quaff it as if it were a healthful 
    potion.</p></i> 
<p align="justify">How truly might these words be applied to ungodly men who 
    have been often afflicted, laid upon a sick bed, broken in spirit, and 
    impoverished in estate—and yet have persevered in their evil ways, unmoved 
    by terrors, unswayed by threatenings. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And believed not for his wondrous works. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Their unbelief was chronic and incurable. Miracles both 
    of mercy and judgment were unavailing.</p></i> They might be made to wonder—but 
    they could not be taught to believe. Continuance in sin and in unbelief go 
    together. Had they believed they would not have sinned, had they not have 
    been blinded by sin they would have believed. There is a reflex action 
    between faith and character. How can the lover of sin believe? How, on the 
    other hand, can the unbeliever cease from sin? 
<i>
<p align="justify">God's ways with us in providence are in themselves both 
    convincing and converting—but unrenewed nature refuses to be either 
    convicted or converted by them.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 33. Therefore their days did he consume in vanity.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Apart from faith in God, life is vanity. To wander up and 
    down in the wilderness was a vain thing indeed, when unbelief had shut them 
    out of the promised land. It was fit that those who would not live to answer 
    the divine purpose by believing and obeying their God should be made to live 
    to no purpose, and to die before their time, unsatisfied, unblessed. Those 
    who wasted their days in sin had little cause to wonder when the Lord cut 
    short their lives, and swore that they should never enter the rest which 
    they had despised. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their years in trouble. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Weary marches were their trouble, and to come to no 
    resting place was their vanity. Innumerable graves were left all along the 
    track of Israel, and if any ask, "Who slew all these?" the answer must be, 
    "They could not enter in because of unbelief." </p>
<p align="justify">Doubtless much of the vexation and failure of many lives 
    results from their being sapped by unbelief, and honeycombed by evil 
    passions. None live so fruitlessly and so wretchedly as those who allow 
    sense and sight to override faith, and their reason and appetite to domineer 
    over their fear of God. </p>
<p align="justify">Our days go fast enough according to the ordinary lapse 
    of time—but the Lord can make them rust away at a bitterer rate, until we 
    feel as if sorrow actually ate out the heart of our life, and like a canker 
    devoured our existence. Such was the punishment of rebellious Israel—may the 
    Lord grant it may not be ours.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 34. When he slew them, then they sought him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Like whipped curs, they licked their Master's feet. They 
    obeyed only so long as they felt the whip about their loins. Hard are the 
    hearts which only death can move. While thousands died around them, the 
    people of Israel became suddenly religious, and repaired to the tabernacle 
    door, <i>like sheep who run in a mass while the black dog drives them—but 
    scatter and wander when the shepherd whistles him off. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they returned and inquired early after God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They could not be too zealous, they were in hot haste to 
    prove their loyalty to their divine King. Who would not be pious while the 
    plague is abroad? Doors, which were never so sanctified before, put on the 
    white cross then. <i>Even reprobates send for the minister when they lie a 
    dying. </i>Thus sinners pay involuntary homage to the power of right and the 
    supremacy of God—but <i>their hypocritical homage is of small value in the 
    sight of the Great Judge.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 35. And they remember that God was their rock. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Sharp strokes awoke their sleepy memories. Reflection 
    followed infliction. They were led to see that all their dependence must be 
    placed upon their God; for he alone had been their shelter, their 
    foundation, their fountain of supply, and their unchangeable friend. What 
    could have made them forget this? Was it that their stomachs were so full of 
    flesh that your had no space for ruminating upon spiritual things? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the high God their redeemer.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They had forgotten this also. The high hand and 
    outstretched arm which redeemed them out of bondage had both faded from 
    their mental vision. Alas, poor man, how readily do you forget your God!<i> 
    Shame on you, ungrateful worm, to have no sense of favors a few days after 
    they have been received. </i>Will nothing make you keep in memory the mercy 
    of your God except the utter withdrawal of it?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 36. Nevertheless they flattered him with their 
    mouth.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Bad were they at their best. False on their knees, liars 
    in their prayers.<i> Mouth worship must be very detestable to God when 
    dissociated from the heart.</i> <i>Other kings love flattery—but the King of 
    kings abhors it. </i></p>

<p align="justify">Since the sharpest afflictions only extort from carnal 
    men a feigned submission to God, there is proof positive that the heart is 
    desperately set on mischief, and that sin is ingrained in our very nature. 
    If you beat a tiger with many stripes, you cannot turn him into a sheep. The 
    devil cannot be whipped out of human nature, though another devil, namely,
    <i>hypocrisy </i>may be whipped into it. </p>
<p align="justify">Piety produced by the damps of sorrow and the heats of 
    terror, is of mushroom growth; it is rapid in its springing up, "they 
    inquired early after God"—but it is a mere unsubstantial fungus of unabiding 
    excitement. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And they lied unto him with their tongues. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Their godly speech was mere cant, their praise mere wind, 
    their prayer a fraud. <i>Their skin deep repentance was a film too thin to 
    conceal the deadly wound of sin. </i>This teaches us to place small reliance 
    upon professions of repentance made by dying men, or upon such even when the 
    basis is evidently slavish fear, and nothing more<i>. Any thief will whine 
    out repentance if he thinks the judge will thereby be moved to let him go 
    scot free.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 37. For their heart was not right with him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">There was no depth in their repentance, it was not heart 
    work. They were fickle as a weather-vane—every wind turned them; their mind 
    was not settled upon God. Neither were they steadfast in his covenant. Their 
    promises were no sooner made than broken, as if only made in mockery. Good 
    resolutions called at their hearts as men do at inns; they tarried awhile, 
    and then took their leave. They were hot today for holiness—but cold towards 
    it tomorrow. Variable as the hues of the chameleon, they changed from 
    reverence to rebellion, from thankfulness to murmuring. One day they gave 
    their gold to build a tabernacle for Jehovah, and the next they plucked off 
    their earrings to make a golden calf. Surely the heart is a chameleon. <i>
    Proteus had not so many changes.</i> As in the malaria, we both burn and 
    freeze, so do inconstant natures in their religion.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 38. But he, being full of compassion, forgave their 
    iniquity, and destroyed them not. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Though they were full of flattery, he was full of mercy</p></i>, 
    and for this cause he had pity on them. Not because of their pitiful and 
    hypocritical pretensions to penitence—but because of his own real compassion 
    for them he overlooked their provocations. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Yes, many a time turned he his anger away. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">When he had grown angry with them, he withdrew his 
    displeasure. Even unto seventy times seven did he forgive their offences. He 
    was slow, very slow, to anger. The sword was uplifted and flashed in 
    midair—but it was sheathed again, and the nation yet lived.</p>
<p align="justify">Though not mentioned in the text, we know from the 
    history that a mediator interposed, the man Moses stood in the gap; even so 
    at this hour the Lord Jesus pleads for sinners, and averts the divine wrath. 
    Many a barren tree is left standing because the dresser of the vineyard 
    cries, "let it alone this year also." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And did not stir up all his wrath. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Had he done so they must have perished in a moment. When 
    his wrath is kindled but a little men are burned up as chaff; but were he to 
    let loose his indignation, the solid earth itself would melt, and Hell would 
    engulf every rebel. Who knows the power of your anger, O Lord? <i>We see the 
    fullness of God's compassion—but we never see all his wrath</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 39. For he remembered that they were but flesh. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">They were forgetful of God—but he was mindful of them. He 
    knew that they were made of earthy, frail, corruptible material, and 
    therefore he dealt leniently with them. </p></i>Though in this he saw no excuse 
    for their sin—yet he constrained it into a reason for mercy; the Lord is 
    ever ready to discover some plea or other upon which he may have compassion.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">A wind that passes away, and comes not again. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Man is but a breath, gone never to return. Spirit and 
    wind are in this alike, so far as our humanity is concerned; they pass and 
    cannot be recalled. <i>What a nothing is our life.</i> <i>How gracious on 
    the Lord's part to make man's insignificance an argument for staying his 
    wrath.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 40. How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Times enough did they rebel: they were as constant in 
    provocation as he was in his patience. </p>
<p align="justify">In our own case, who can count his errors? In what book 
    could all our perverse rebellions be recorded? </p>
<p align="justify">The wilderness was a place of manifest dependence, where 
    the tribes were helpless without divine supplies—yet <i>they wounded the 
    hand which fed them while it was in the act of feeding them</i>. Is there no 
    likeness between us and them? Does it bring no tears into our eyes, while as 
    in a looking-glass, we see our own selves?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And grieve him in the desert. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Their provocations had an effect; God was not insensible 
    to them, he is said to have been grieved. His <i>holiness </i>could not find 
    pleasure in their sin, his <i>justice </i>in their unjust treatment, or his
    <i>truth </i>in their falsehood. <i>What must it be to grieve the Lord of 
    love!</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Yet we also have vexed the Holy Spirit, and he would long 
    ago have withdrawn himself from us, were it not that he is God and not man. 
    We are in the desert where we need our God, let us not make it a wilderness 
    of sin by grieving him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verses 41. Yes, they turned back.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Their hearts sighed for Egypt and its fleshpots. They 
    turned to their old ways again and again, after they had been scourged out 
    of them. Full of twists and turns, they never kept the straight path. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And tempted God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As far as in them lay they tempted him. His ways were 
    good, and they in desiring to have them altered, tempted God. Before they 
    would believe in him they demanded signs, defying the Lord to do this and 
    that, and acting <i>as if he could be cajoled into being the minion of their 
    lusts. </i>What blasphemy was this! Yet let us not tempt Christ lest we also 
    be destroyed by the destroyer. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And limited the Holy One of Israel. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They doubted his power and so limited him; they dictated 
    to his wisdom and so did the same. <i>To chalk out a path for God is 
    arrogant impiety. </i>The Holy One must do right, the covenant God of Israel 
    must be true, it is profanity itself to say unto him you shall do this or 
    that, or otherwise I will not worship you.<i> Not thus is the Eternal God to 
    be led by a string by his impotent creature. He is the Lord and he will do 
    as seems good to him.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 42. They remembered not his hand.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Yet it must have been difficult to forget it. Such 
    displays of divine power as those which smote Egypt with astonishment—it 
    must have needed some more than usual effort to blot it from the tablets of 
    memory. It is probably meant that they practically, rather than actually, 
    forgot. He who forgets the natural returns of gratitude, may justly be 
    charged with not remembering the obligation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Nor the days when he delivered them from the enemy.</p></b>

<p align="justify">The day itself was erased from their calendar, so far as 
    any due result from it or return for it. Strange is the faculty of memory in 
    its oblivions, as well as its records. <i>Sin perverts man's powers, makes 
    them forceful only in wrong directions, and practically dead for righteous 
    ends.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 43. How he had wrought his signs in Egypt. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The plagues were ensigns of Jehovah's presence and proofs 
    of his hatred of idols; these instructive acts of power were wrought in the 
    open view of all, as signals are set up to be observed by those far and 
    near. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his wonders in the field of Zoan.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In the whole land were miracles wrought, not in cities 
    alone—but in the broad territory, in the most select and ancient regions of 
    the proud nation. This the Israelites ought not to have forgotten, for they 
    were the favored people for whom these memorable deeds were wrought.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 44. And had turned their rivers into blood. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The waters had been made the means of the destruction of 
    Israel's newborn infants, and now they do as it were betray the crime—they 
    blush for it, they avenge it on the murderers. The Nile was the vitality of 
    Egypt, its true life-blood—but at God's command it became a flowing curse; 
    every drop of it was a horror, poison to drink, and terror to gaze on. How 
    soon might the Almighty One do this with the Thames or the Seine. Sometimes 
    he has allowed men, who were his rod, to make rivers crimson with gore, and 
    this is a severe judgment; but the event now before us was more mysterious, 
    more general, more complete, and must, therefore, have been a plague of the 
    first magnitude. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Lesser streams partook in the curse, reservoirs and 
    canals felt the evil; God does nothing by halves. All Egypt boasted of the 
    sweet waters of their river—but they were made to loathe it more than they 
    had ever loved it. <i>Our mercies may soon become our miseries if the Lord 
    shall deal with us in wrath.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 45. He sent diverse sorts of flies among them, 
    which devoured them.</p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Small creatures become great tormentors.</p></i> When they 
    swarm they can sting a man until they threaten to eat him up. In this case, 
    various orders of insects fought under the same banner; lice and beetles, 
    gnats and hornets, wasps and gadflies dashed forward in fierce battalions, 
    and worried the sinners of Egypt without mercy.<i> The tiniest plagues are 
    the greatest. What sword or spear could fight with these innumerable bands?
    </i>Vain were the monarch's armor and robes of majesty, the little cannibals 
    were no more lenient towards royal flesh than any other; it had the same 
    blood in it, and the same sin upon it. <i>How great is that God who thus by 
    the minute can crush the magnificent. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">And frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">These creatures swarmed everywhere when they were alive, 
    until the people felt ready to die at the sight; and when the reptiles died, 
    the heaps of their bodies made the land to stink so foully, that a 
    pestilence was imminent. Thus not only did earth and air send forth armies 
    of horrible life—but the water also added its legions of loathsomeness. It 
    seemed as if the Nile was first made nauseous and then caused to leave its 
    bed altogether, crawling and leaping in the form of frogs. <i>Those who 
    contend with the Almighty, little know what arrows are in his quiver; 
    surprising sin shall be visited with surprising punishment.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 46. He gave also their increase unto the 
    caterpillar, and their labor unto the locust. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Different sorts of devourers ate up every green herb and 
    tree. What one would not eat, another did. What they expected from the 
    natural fertility of the soil, and what they looked for from their own toil, 
    they saw devoured before their eyes by an insatiable multitude against whose 
    depredation no defense could be found. Observe in the text that the Lord did 
    it all, "he sent," "he gave," "he destroyed," "he gave up," etc.; <i>
    whatever the secondary agent may be, the direct hand of the Lord is in every 
    national calamity.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 47. He destroyed their vines with hail.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No more shall your butler press the clusters into your 
    cup, O Pharaoh! The young fruit bearing shoots were broken off, the vintage 
    failed. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their sycamore trees with frost. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Frost was not usual—but Jehovah regards no laws of nature 
    when men regard not his moral laws. The sycamore fig was perhaps more the 
    fruit of the many than was the vine, therefore this judgment was meant to 
    smite the poor, while the former fell most heavily upon the rich. <i>Mark 
    how the heavens obey their Lord and yield their stores of hail, and note how 
    the fickle weather is equally subservient to the divine will.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 48. He gave up their cattle also to the hail.</p></b>

<p align="justify">What hail it must have been to have force enough to 
    batter down bullocks and other great beasts. God usually protects animals 
    from such destruction—but here he withdraws his safeguards and gave them up: 
    may the Lord never give us up. </p>
<p align="justify">Some read, "shut up," and the idea of being abandoned to 
    destructive influences is then before us in another shape. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Fire was mingled with the hail, the fire ran along upon 
    the ground, it smote the smaller cattle. What a storm must that have been: 
    its effects were terrible enough upon plants—but to see the poor dumb 
    creatures stricken must have been heart-breaking. <i>Adamantine was that 
    heart which quailed not under such plagues as these. Harder than adamant 
    those hearts which in after years forgot all that the Lord had done, and 
    broke off from their allegiance to him.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 49. He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, 
    wrath, and indignation, and trouble. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">His last arrow was the sharpest! He reserved the strong 
    wine of his indignation to the last. Note how the psalmist piles up the 
    words, and well he might; for blow followed blow, each one more staggering 
    than its predecessor, and then the crushing stroke was reserved for the end.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">By sending destroying angels among them. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Messengers of destruction entered their houses at 
    midnight, and smote the dearest objects of their love. The angels were 
    destructive to them, though good enough in themselves. Those who to the 
    heirs of salvation are ministers of grace—are to the heirs of wrath 
    executioners of judgment. When God sends angels, they are sure to come; and 
    if he bids them slay, they will not spare. <i>See how sin sets all the 
    powers of Heaven in array against man; he has no friend left in the universe 
    when God is his enemy.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 50. He made a way to his anger.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Coming to the point with them by slow degrees; assailing 
    their outworks first by destroying their property, and then coming in upon 
    their persons as through an open breach in the walls. He broke down all the 
    comforts of their life, and then advanced against their life itself. Nothing 
    could stand in his way; he cleared a space in which to do execution upon his 
    adversaries. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He spared not their soul from death—but gave their life 
    over to the pestilence.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">In their soul was the origin of the sin, and he followed 
    it to its source and smote it there. A fierce disease filled the land with 
    countless funerals; Jehovah dealt out myriads of blows, and multitudes of 
    spirits failed before him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 51. And smote all the firstborn in Egypt. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No exceptions were made, the monarch bewailed his heir as 
    did the menial at the mill. They smote the Lord's firstborn, even Israel—and 
    he smites theirs.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham.</p></b>

<p align="justify">Swinging his scythe over the field, death topped off the 
    highest flowers. The tents of Ham knew each one its own peculiar sorrow, and 
    were made to sympathize with the sorrows which had been ruthlessly inflicted 
    upon the habitations of Israel.<i> Thus curses come home to roost. 
    Oppressors are repaid in their own coin, without the discount of a penny.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 52. But made his own people to go forth like sheep.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The contrast is striking, and ought never to have been 
    forgotten by the people.<i> The wolves were slain in heaps, the sheep were 
    carefully gathered, and triumphantly delivered. </i>The tables were turned, 
    and the poor serfs became the honored people, while their oppressors were 
    humbled before them. Israel went out in a compact body like a flock; they 
    were defenseless in themselves as sheep—but they were safe under their Great 
    Shepherd; they left Egypt as easily as a flock leaves one pasture for 
    another. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Knowing nothing of <i>the way </i>by their own 
    understanding or experience, they were, nevertheless, rightly directed, for 
    the All wise God knew every spot of the wilderness. To the sea, through the 
    sea, and from the sea, the Lord led his chosen; while their former 
    taskmasters were too cowed in spirit, and broken in power, to dare to molest 
    them.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 53. And he led them on safely, so that they feared 
    not.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">After the first little alarm, natural enough when they 
    found themselves pursued by their old taskmasters, they plucked up courage 
    and ventured forth boldly into the sea, and afterwards into the desert where 
    no man dwelt. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They were gone, gone forever, never to disturb the 
    fugitives again. That tremendous blow effectually defended the tribes for 
    forty years from any further attempt to drive them back. Egypt found the 
    stone too heavy and was glad to let it alone. Let the Lord be praised who 
    thus effectually freed his elect nation. </p>
<p align="justify">What a grand narrative have we been considering. Well 
    might the mightiest master of sacred song select "Israel in Egypt" as a 
    choice theme for his genius; and well may every believing mind linger over 
    every item of the amazing transaction.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The marvel is that the favored nation should live as if 
    unmindful of it all, and yet such is human nature. </p></i>Alas, poor man! 
    Rather, alas, base heart! 
<p align="justify">We now, after a pause, follow again the chain of events, 
    the narration of which had been interrupted by a retrospect, and we find 
    Israel entering into the promised land, there to repeat her follies and 
    enlarge her crimes.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 54. And he brought them to the border of his 
    sanctuary.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">He conducted them to the frontier of the Holy Land, where 
    he intended the tabernacle to become the permanent symbol of his abode among 
    his people. He did not leave them halfway upon their journey to their 
    heritage; his power and wisdom preserved the nation until the palm trees of 
    Jericho were within sight on the other side of the river. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Even to this mountain, which his right hand had 
    purchased.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Nor did he leave them then—but still conducted them until 
    they were in the region round about Zion, which was to be the central seat 
    of his worship. This the Lord had purchased in type of old by the sacrifice 
    of Isaac, fit symbol of the greater sacrifice which was in due season to be 
    presented there: that mountain was also redeemed by power, when the Lord's 
    right hand enabled his valiant men to smite the Jebusites, and take the 
    sacred hill from the insulting Canaanite. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Thus shall the elect of God enjoy the sure protection of 
    the Lord Almighty, even to the border land of death, and through the river, 
    up to the hill of the Lord in glory. The purchased people shall safely reach 
    the purchased inheritance.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 55. He cast out the heathen also before them</p></b>, 
    or "he drove out the nations." 
<p align="justify">Not only were armies routed—but whole peoples displaced. 
    The iniquity of the Canaanites was full; their vices made them rot above 
    ground; therefore, the land ate up its inhabitants, the hornets vexed them, 
    the pestilence destroyed them, and the sword of the tribes completed the 
    execution to which the justice of long provoked Heaven had at length 
    appointed them. </p>
<p align="justify">The Lord was the true conqueror of Canaan; he cast out 
    the nations as men cast out filth from their habitations, he uprooted them 
    as noxious weeds are extirpated by the gardener. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And divided them an inheritance by line. </p></b>He divided 
    the land of the nations among the tribes by lot and measure, assigning 
    Hivite, Perizzite, and Jebusite territory to Simeon, Judah, or Ephraim, as 
    the case might be. <i>Among those condemned nations were not only giants in 
    stature—but also giants in crime: those monsters of iniquity had too long 
    defiled the earth; it was time that they should no more indulge the 
    unnatural crimes for which they were infamous</i>; they were, therefore, 
    doomed to forfeit life and lands by the hands of the tribes of Israel. 
<p align="justify">The distribution of the forfeited country was made by 
    divine appointment; it was no scramble—but a judicial appointment of lands 
    which had fallen to the crown by the attainder of the former holders. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The favored people entered upon a furnished house: they 
    found the larder supplied, for they fed upon the old grain of the land, and 
    the dwellings were already built in which they could dwell. Thus does 
    another race often enter into the lot of a former people, and it is sad 
    indeed when the change which judgment decrees does not turn out to be much 
    for the better, because <i>the incomers inherit the evils as well as the 
    goods of the ejected. </i>Such a case of judicial visitation ought to have 
    had a beneficial influence upon the tribes; but, alas, they were 
    incorrigible, and would not learn even from examples so near at home and so 
    terribly suggestive.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 56. Yet they tempted and provoked the most high 
    God. </p>
</b><i>
<p align="justify">Change of condition had not altered their manners. They 
    left their nomadic habits—but not their tendencies to wander from their God.</p></i> 
    Though every divine promise had been fulfilled to the letter, and the land 
    flowing with milk and honey was actually their own—yet they tried the Lord 
    again with unbelief, and provoked him with other sins. 
<p align="justify">He is not only high and glorious—but <i>most </i>High, 
    yes, <i>the </i>most High, the only being who deserves to be so highly had 
    in honor; yet, instead of honoring him, Israel grieved him with rebellion.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And kept not his testimonies. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They were true to nothing but hereditary treachery; 
    steadfast in nothing but in falsehood. <i>They knew his truth and forgot it, 
    his will and disobeyed it, his grace and perverted it to an occasion for 
    greater transgression. </i>Reader, do you need a looking-glass? See here is 
    one which suits the present expositor well; does it not also reflect your 
    image?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 57. But turned back. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Turned over the old leaf, repeated the same offences, 
    started aside like an ill made bow, were false and faithless to their best 
    promises. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And dealt unfaithfully like their fathers.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Proving themselves unfaithfully by manifesting the 
    treachery of their sires. They were a new generation, but not a new 
    nation—another race, yet not another. Evil propensities are transmitted; the 
    birth follows the progenitor; the wild donkey breeds wild donkeys; the 
    children of the raven fly to the carrion.<i> Human nature does not improve. 
    The new editions contain all the errata of the first, and sometimes fresh 
    errors are imported. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Which not only fails to send the arrow towards the mark 
    in a direct line—but springs back to the archer's hurt, and perhaps sends 
    the shaft among his friends to their serious jeopardy. Israel boasted of the 
    bow as the national weapon, they sang the song of the bow, and hence a 
    deceitful bow is made to be the type and symbol of their own unsteadfastness; 
    God can make men's glory the very ensign of their shame, he draws a sinister 
    bar across the escutcheon of traitors.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 58. For they provoked him to anger with their high 
    places. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This was their first error: will worship—or the worship 
    of God otherwise than according to his command. Many think lightly of 
    this—but it was no mean sin; and its tendencies to further offence are very 
    powerful. The Lord would have his holy place remain as the only spot for 
    sacrifice; and Israel, in willful rebellion, (no doubt glossed over by the 
    plea of great devotion,) determined to have many altars upon many hills. If 
    they might have but one God, they insisted upon it that they would not be 
    restricted to one sacred place of sacrifice. </p>
<p align="justify">How much of the worship of the present day is neither 
    more nor less than sheer will worship! Nobody can plead a divine appointment 
    for the many rituals, festivals, ceremonies, and observances of certain 
    churches. Doubtless God, so far from being honored by worship which he has 
    not commanded, is greatly angered at it! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This was but one more step; they manufactured symbols of 
    the invisible God, for they lusted after something tangible and visible to 
    which they could show reverence. </p>
<p align="justify">This also is the crying sin of modern times. Do we not 
    hear and see superstition abounding? Images, pictures, crucifixes, and a 
    host of visible things are had in religious honor. Surely the Lord is very 
    patient, or he would visit the earth for this worst and basest of idolatry. 
    He is a jealous God, and abhors to see himself dishonored by any form of 
    representation which can come from man's hands.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 59. When God heard this, he was angry. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The mere report of it filled him with indignation; he 
    could not bear it, he was incensed to the uttermost, and most justly so. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And greatly abhorred Israel.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">He cast his idolatrous people from his favor, and left 
    them to themselves, and their own devices. How could he have fellowship with 
    idols? What concord has Christ with Belial?<i> Sin is in itself so offensive 
    that it makes the sinner offensive too. </i>Idols of any sort are highly 
    abhorrent to God, and we must see to it that we keep ourselves from them 
    through divine grace, for rest assured <i>idolatry is not consistent with 
    true grace in the heart. </i>If Dagon sit aloft in any soul, the ark of God 
    is not there. Where the Lord dwells no <i>image of jealousy </i>will be 
    tolerated. </p>
<p align="justify">A visible church will soon become a visible curse if 
    idols be set up in it, and then the pruning knife will remove it as a dead 
    branch from the vine. </p>
<p align="justify">Note that God did not utterly cast away his people Israel 
    even when he greatly abhorred them, for he returned in mercy to them, so the 
    subsequent verses tell us: so now the seed of Abraham, though for awhile 
    under a heavy cloud, will be gathered yet again, for the covenant of salt 
    shall not be broken. As for the <i>spiritual </i>seed, the Lord has not 
    despised nor abhorred them; they are his peculiar treasure and lie forever 
    near his heart.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 60. So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, 
    the tent which he placed among men.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">His glory would no more reveal itself there, he left 
    Shiloh to become a complete ruin. At the door of that tent shameless sin had 
    been perpetrated, and all around it idols had been adored, and therefore the 
    glory departed and Ichabod was sounded as a word of dread concerning Shiloh 
    and the tribe of Ephraim. Thus may the candlestick be removed though the 
    candle is not quenched. </p>
<p align="justify">Erring churches become apostate—but a true church still 
    remains; if Shiloh be profaned, Zion is consecrated. Yet is it ever a solemn 
    caution to all the assemblies of the saints, admonishing them to walk humbly 
    with their God, when we read such words as those of the prophet Jeremiah in 
    is seventh chapter, "Trust not in lying words, saying, The temple of the 
    Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these. Go you now 
    unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see 
    what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel." Let us take heed, 
    lest as the ark never returned to Shiloh after its capture by the 
    Philistines, so the gospel may be taken from us in judgment, never to be 
    restored to the same church again.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 61. And delivered his strength into captivity. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The ark was captured by the Philistines in battle, only 
    because the Lord for the punishment of Israel chose to deliver it into their 
    hands, otherwise they could have had no power at all against it. The token 
    of the divine presence is here poetically called "his strength;" and, 
    indeed, the presence of the Lord is his strength among his people. It was a 
    black day when the mercy-seat was removed, when the cherubim took flight, 
    and Israel's palladium was carried away. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And his glory into the enemy's hand. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The ark was the place for the revealed glory of God, and 
    his enemies exulted greatly when they bore it away into their own cities. 
    Nothing could more clearly have shown the divine displeasure. It seemed to 
    say that Jehovah would sooner dwell among his avowed adversaries, than among 
    so false a people as Israel; he would sooner bear the insults of Philistia, 
    than the treacheries of Ephraim. This was a fearful downfall for the favored 
    nation, and it was followed by dire judgments of most appalling nature. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">When God is gone, all is gone. No calamity can equal the 
    withdrawal of the divine presence from a people. </p></i>O Israel, how are you 
    brought low! Who shall help you now that your God has left you!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 62. He gave his people over also unto the sword.</p></b>

<p align="justify">They fell in battle because they were no longer aided by 
    the divine strength. Sharp was the sword—but sharper still the cause of its 
    being unsheathed. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And was angry with his inheritance.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">They were his still, and twice in this verse they are 
    called so; yet his regard for them did not prevent his chastening them, even 
    with a rod of steel. Where the love is most fervent, the jealousy is most 
    cruel.<i> Sin cannot be tolerated in those who are a people near unto God.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 63. The fire consumed their young men. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">As fire slew Nadab and Abihu literally, so the fire of 
    divine wrath fell on the sons of Eli, who defiled the sanctuary of the Lord, 
    and the like fire, in the form of war, consumed the flower of the people.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their maidens were not given to marriage. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">No nuptial hymn were sung, the bride lacked her 
    bridegroom, the edge of the sword had cut the bands of their espousals, and 
    left unmarried those who else had been extolled in hymns and 
    congratulations. Thus Israel was brought very low, she could not find 
    husbands for her maids, and therefore her state was not replenished; no 
    young children clustered around parental knees. The nation had failed in its 
    solemn task of instructing the young in the fear of Jehovah, and it was a 
    fitting judgment that the very production of a posterity should be 
    endangered.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 64. Their priests fell by the sword. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Hophni and Phineas were slain; they were among the chief 
    in sin, and, therefore, they perished with the rest.<i> Priesthood is no 
    shelter for transgressors; the jeweled breastplate cannot turn aside the 
    arrows of judgment. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And their widows made no lamentation.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Their private griefs were swallowed up in the greater 
    national agony, because the ark of God was taken. As the maidens had no 
    heart for the marriage song, so the widows had no spirit, even to utter the 
    funeral wail. The dead were buried too often and too hurriedly to allow of 
    the usual rites of lamentation. This was the lowest depth; from this point 
    things will take a gracious turn.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 65. The Lord awaked as one out of sleep. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Justly inactive, he had suffered the enemy to triumph, 
    his ark to be captured, and his people to be slain; but now he arouses 
    himself, his heart is full of pity for his chosen, and anger against the 
    insulting foe. Woe to you, O Philistia, now you shall feel the weight of his 
    right hand! </p>
<p align="justify">Waking and putting forth strength like a man who has 
    taken a refreshing draught, the Lord is said to be, <b>like a mighty man 
    that shouts by reason of wine.</b></p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1">
<p align="justify"></p>
</font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">Strong and full of energy the Lord dashed upon his foes, 
    and made them stagger beneath his blows. His ark from city to city went as 
    an avenger rather than as a trophy, and in every place the false gods fell 
    helplessly before it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 66. He smote his enemies in the hinder parts. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They fled but were overtaken and wounded in the back to 
    their eternal disgrace. He put them to a perpetual reproach. Their frequent 
    defeats by Israel until at last they were crushed under, never to exist 
    again as a distinct nation.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 67. Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">God had honored Ephraim, for to that tribe belonged 
    Joshua the great conqueror, and Gideon the great judge, and within its 
    borders was Shiloh the place of the ark and the sanctuary; but now the Lord 
    would change all this and set up other rulers. He would no longer leave 
    matters to the leadership of Ephraim, since that tribe had been tried and 
    found wanting. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And chose not the tribe of Ephraim. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Sin had been found in them, folly and instability, and 
    therefore they were set aside as unfit to lead.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 68. But chose the tribe of Judah. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">To give the nation another trial this tribe was elected 
    to supremacy. This was according to Jacob's dying prophecy.<i> Our Lord 
    sprang out of Judah, and he it is whom his brethren shall praise. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Mount Zion which he loved. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The tabernacle and ark were removed to Zion during the 
    reign of David; no honor was left to the wayward Ephraimites. Nearby this 
    mountain the Father of the Faithful had offered up his only son, and there 
    in future days the great gatherings of his chosen seed would be, and 
    therefore Zion is said to be lovely unto God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 69. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The tabernacle was placed on high, literally and 
    spiritually it was a mountain of beauty. True religion was exalted in the 
    land. For sanctity it was a temple, for majesty it was a palace.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Like the earth which he has established forever. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Stability was well as stateliness were seen in the 
    temple, and so also in the church of God. The prophets saw both in vision.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 70. He chose David also his servant.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">It was an election of a sovereignly gracious kind, and it 
    operated practically by making the chosen man a willing servant of the Lord. 
    He was not chosen because he was a servant—but in order that he might be so. 
    David always esteemed it to be a high honor that he was both <i>elect </i>of 
    God, and a <i>servant </i>of God. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And took him from the sheepfolds. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">A shepherd of sheep he had been, and this was a fit 
    school for a shepherd of men. Lowliness of occupation will debar no man from 
    such honors as the Lord's election confers, the Lord sees not as man sees. 
    He delights to bless those who are of low estate.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 71. From following the ewes great with young he 
    brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Exercising the care and are of those who watch for the 
    young lambs, David followed the ewes in their wanderings; the tenderness and 
    patience thus acquired would tend to the development of characteristics most 
    becoming in a king. To the man thus prepared, the office and dignity which 
    God had appointed for him, came in due season, and he was enabled worthily 
    to wear them. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">It is wonderful how often divine wisdom so arranges the 
    early and obscure portion of a choice life, so as to make it a preparatory 
    school for a more active and noble future.</p>
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 72. So he fed them according to the integrity of 
    his heart. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">David was upright before God, and never swerved in heart 
    from the obedient worship of Jehovah. Whatever faults he had, he was sincere 
    in his allegiance to Israel's superior king; he shepherded for God with 
    honest heart. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He was a sagacious ruler, and the psalmist magnifies the 
    Lord for having appointed him. Under David, the Jewish kingdom rose to an 
    honorable position among the nations, and exercised an influence over its 
    neighbors. </p>
<p align="justify">In closing the Psalm which has described the varying 
    conditions of the chosen nation, we are glad to end so peacefully; with all 
    noise of tumult or of sinful rites hushed into silence. After a long voyage 
    over a stormy sea, the ark of the Jewish state rested on its Ararat, beneath 
    a wise and gentle reign, to be wafted no more hither and thither by floods 
    and gales. </p>
<p align="justify">The psalmist had all along intended to make this his last 
    stanza, and we too may be content to finish all our songs of love with the 
    reign of the Lord's anointed. Only we may eagerly inquire, when will it 
    come? <i>When shall we end these desert roamings, these rebellions, and 
    chastenings, and enter into the rest of a settled kingdom, with the Lord 
    Jesus reigning as "the Prince of the house of David?" </i></p>

<p align="justify">Thus have we ended this lengthy parable, may we in our 
    life parable have less of sin, and as much of grace as are displayed in 
    Israel's history, and may we close it under the safe guidance of "that great 
    Shepherd of the sheep." AMEN.</p>
