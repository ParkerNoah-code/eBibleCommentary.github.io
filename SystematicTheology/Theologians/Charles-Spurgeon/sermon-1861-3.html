        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.350)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 16th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall, Strand.</p>
        <p>
          "If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am
          perfect, it shall also prove me perverse." -- Job 9:20.
        </p>
        <p>
          EVER since man became a sinner he has been self-righteous. When he had
          a righteousness of his own he never gloried of it, but ever since he
          has lost it, he has pretended to be the possessor of it. Those proud
          words which our father Adam uttered, when he sought to screen himself
          from the guilt of his treason against his Maker, laying the blame
          apparently on Eve, but really upon God who gave him the woman, were
          virtually a clame to blamelessness. It was but a fig leaf he could
          find to cover his nakedness, but how proud was he of that fig-leaf
          excuse, and how tenaciously did he hold to it. As it was with our
          first parents so is it with us: self-righteousness is born with us,
          and there is perhaps no sin which has so much vitality in it as the
          sin of righteous self. We can overcome lust itself, and anger, and the
          fierce passions of the will better than we can ever master the proud
          boastfulness which rises in our hearts and tempts us to think
          ourselves rich and increased in goods, while God knoweth we are naked,
          and poor, and miserable. Tens of thousands of sermons have been
          preached against self-righteousness, and yet it is as necessary to
          turn the great guns of the law against its walls to-day as ever it
          was. Martin Luther said he scarcely ever preached a sermon without
          inveighing against the righteousness of man, and yet, he said, "I find
          that still I cannot preach it down. Still men will boast in what they
          can do, and mistake the path to heaven to be a road paved by their own
          merits, and not a way besprinkled by the blood of the atonement of
          Jesus Christ." My dear hearers, I cannot compliment you by imagining
          that all of you have been delivered from the great delusion of
          trusting in yourselves. The godly, those who are righteous through
          faith in Christ, still have to mourn that this infirmity clings to
          them; while as to the unconverted themselves, their besetting sin is
          to deny their guiltiness, to plead that they are as good as others,
          and to indulge still the vain and foolish hope that they shall enter
          into heaven from some doings, sufferings, or weepings of their own. I
          do not suppose there are any who are self-righteous in as bold a sense
          as the poor countryman I have heard of. His minister had tried to
          explain to him the way of salvation, but either his head was very
          dull, or else his soul was very hostile to the truth the minister
          would impart; for he so little understood what he had heard, that when
          the question was put, "Now then, what is the way by which you hope you
          can be saved before God?" the poor honest simpleton said, "Do you not
          think sir, if I were to sleep one cold frosty night under a hawthorn
          bush, that would go a great way towards it?" conceiving that his
          suffering might, in some degree at least, assist him in getting into
          heaven. You would not state your opinion in so bold a manner; you
          would refine it, you would gild it, you would disguise it, but it
          would come to the same thing after all; you would still believe that
          some sufferings, or believings of your own might possibly merit
          salvation. The Romish Church indeed, often tells this so very plainly,
          that we cannot think it less than profanity. I have been informed that
          there is in one of the Romish chapels in Cork, a monument bearing
          these words upon it, "I. H. S. Sacred to the memory of the benevolent
          Edward Molloy; a friend of humanity, the father of the poor; he
          employed the wealth of this world only to procure the riches of the
          next; and leaving a balance of merit in the book of life, he made
          heaven debtor to mercy. He died October 17th, 1818, aged 90." I do not
          suppose that any of you will have such an epitaph on your tombstones,
          or ever dream of putting it as a matter of account with God, and
          striking a balance with him, your sins being on one side and your
          righteousness on the other, and hoping that a balance might remain.
          And yet the very same idea, only not so honestly expressed -- a little
          more guarded, and a little more refined -- the same idea, only taught
          to speak after a gospel dialect -- is inherent in us all, and only
          divine grace can thoroughly cast it out of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sermon of this morning is intended to be another blow against our
          self-righteousness. If it will not die, at least let us spare no
          arrows against it; let us draw the bow, and if the shaft cannot
          penetrate its heart, it may at least stick in its flesh and help to
          worry it to its grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Endeavouring to keep close to my text, I shall start with this
          first point -- that THE PLEA OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS CONTRADICTS ITSELF.
          "If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, friend, thou who dost justify thyself by thine own works, let me
          hear thee speak. "I say that I have no need of a salvation by the
          blood and righteousness of another, for I believe that I have kept the
          commands of God from my youth up, and I do not think that I am guilty
          in his sight, but I hope that I may be able in my own right to claim a
          seat in paradise." Now, sir, your plea and this declaration of yours
          is in itself a condemnation of you, because upon its very surface it
          is apparent that you are committing sin while you are pleading that
          you have no sin. For the very plea itself is a piece of high and
          arrogant presumption. God hath said it, let Jew and Gentile stop his
          mouth, and let all the world stand guilty before God. We have it on
          inspired authority, that "there is none righteous, no, not one."
          "There is none good, save one, that is God." We are told by the mouth
          of a prophet sent from God, that "all we like wandering sheep have
          gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way." And thou, in
          saying that thou art righteous, dost commit the sin of calling God a
          liar. Thou hast dared to impugn his veracity, thou hast slandered his
          justice. This boast of thine is in itself a sin, so great, so heinous,
          that if thou hadst only that one sin to account for, it would be
          sufficient to sink thee to the lowest hell. The boast, I say, is in
          itself a sin; the moment that a man saith, "I have no sin," he commits
          a sin in the saying of it, -- the sin of contradicting his Maker, and
          making God a false accuser of his creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, dost thou not see, thou vain and foolish creature, that thou
          hast been guilty of pride in the very language thou hast used? Who but
          a proud man would stand up and commend himself? Who, but one who was
          proud as Lucifer, would in the face of God's declaration declare
          himself to be just and holy? Did the best of men ever speak thus? Did
          they not all of them acknowledge that they were guilty? Did Job, of
          whom God said that he was a perfect and an upright man, claim
          perfection? Did he not say, "If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall
          condemn me?" Oh! proud wretch, how art thou puffed up! How hath Satan
          bewitched thee; how hath he made thee lift up thine horn on high and
          speak with a stiff neck. Take heed to thyself, for if thou hadst never
          been guilty before, this pride of thine were quite sufficient to draw
          Jehovah's thunderbolts out of the quiver, and make him smite thee once
          for all to thine eternal destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, the plea of self-righteousness is self-contradictory upon
          another ground; for all that a self-righteous man pleads for, is
          comparative righteousness. "Why," saith he, "I am no worse than my
          neighbours, in fact a great deal better; I do not drink, or swear; I
          do not commit fornication or adultery; I am no Sabbath breaker; I am
          no thief; the laws of my country do not accuse, much less condemn me;
          I am better than the most of men, and if I be not saved, God help
          those who are worse than I am; if I cannot enter the kingdom of
          heaven, then who can?" Just so, but then all that you claim is that
          you are righteous as compared with others. Do you not see that this is
          a very vain and fatal plea, because you do in fact admit that you are
          not perfectly righteous; -- that there is some sin in you, only you
          claim there is not so much in you as in another. You admit that you
          are diseased, but then the plague-spot is not so apparent in you as in
          your fellow-man. You admit that you have robbed God and broken his
          laws, only you have not done it with so desperate an intent, nor with
          so many aggravations as others. Now this is virtually a plea of
          guilty, disguise it as you may. You admit that you have been guilty,
          and against you the sentence comes forth -- "The soul that sinneth it
          shall die." Take heed to thyself that thou find no shelter in this
          refuge of lies, for it shall certainly fail thee when God shall come
          to judge the world with righteousness and the people with equity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose now for a moment that a command is issued to the beasts of the
          forest that they should become sheep. It is quite in vain for the bear
          to come forward and plead that he was not so venomous a creature as
          the serpent; equally absurd would it be for the wolf to say that
          though stealthy and cunning, and gaunt, and grim, yet he was not so
          great a grumbler not so ugly a creature as the bear; and the lion
          might plead that he had not the craftiness of the fox. "It is true,"
          saith he, "I wet my tongue in blood, but then I have some virtues
          which may commend me, and which, in fact, have made me king of
          beasts." What would this argument avail? The indictment is that these
          animals are not sheep, their plea against the indictment is that they
          are no less like sheep than other creatures, and that some of them
          have more gentleness and more docility than others of their kind. The
          plea would never stand. Or use another picture. If in the courts of
          justice, a thief, when called up, should argue, "Well, I am not so
          great a thief as some; there are to be found some living in
          Whitechapel or St. Giles's who have been thieves longer than I have,
          and if there be one conviction in the book against me, there are some
          that have a dozen convictions against them." No magistrate would
          acquit a man on such an excuse as that, because it would be tantamount
          to his admission of a degree of guilt, though he might try to excuse
          himself because he had not reached a higher degree. It is so with you,
          sinner. You have sinned. Another man's sins cannot excuse you; you
          must stand upon your own feet. At the day of judgment you must
          yourself make a personal appearance, and it will not be what another
          man has done that will condemn, or acquit you, but your own personal
          guilt. Take heed, then, take heed, sinner; for it will not avail thee
          that there are others blacker than thyself. If there be but a spot
          upon thee thou art lost; if there be but one sin unwashed by Jesus'
          blood, thy portion must be with the tormentors. A holy God cannot look
          even upon the least degree of iniquity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, the plea of the self-conceited man is, that he has done
          his best, and can claim a partial righteousness. It is true, if you
          touch him in a tender place he acknowledges that his boyhood and his
          youth were stained with sin. He tells you that in his early days he
          was a "fast lad;" that he did many things which he is sorry for now.
          "But then," says he, "these are only like spots in the sun; these are
          only like a small headland of waste ground in acres of fruitful soil;
          I am still good; I am still righteous, because my virtues exceed my
          vices, and my good deeds quite cover up all the mistakes that I have
          committed." Well, sir, do you not see that the only righteousness you
          claim is a partial righteousness? and in that very claim you do in
          fact make an admission that you are not perfect; that you have
          committed some sins. Now I am not responsible for what I am about to
          state, nor am I to be blamed for harshness in it, because I state
          neither more nor less than the very truth of God. It is of no saving
          avail to you that you have not have committed ten thousand sins, for
          if you have committed one, you are a lost soul. The law is to be kept
          intact and entire, and the least crack, or flaw, or breakage, spoils
          it. The robe of righteousness in which you must stand at last must be
          without spot or blemish, and if there be but one microscopic stain
          upon it, which is supposing what is never true, yet, even then the
          gates of heaven never can admit you. A perfect righteousness you must
          have, or else you shall never be admitted to that wedding feast. You
          may say, "I have kept such a commandment and have never broken it,"
          but if you have broken another you are guilty of the whole, because
          the whole law is like one rich and costly vase -- it is one in design
          and fashion. Though you break not the foor, and stain not the margin,
          yet if there be any flaw or damage, the whole vessel is marred. And so
          if you have sinned in any point, at any time, and in any degree, you
          have broken the whole law; you stand guilty of it before God, nor can
          you be saved by the works of the law, do what you may.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is a hard sentence," says one, "and who can bear it!" Indeed, who
          can bear it? Who can bear to stand at the foot of Sinai and hear its
          thunders roar? "If so much as a beast touch the mountain it must be
          stoned or thrust through with a dart." Who can stand when the
          lightnings flash and God descends upon Mount Paran and the hills melt
          like wax beneath his feet? "By the deeds of the law there shall no
          flesh living be justified." "Cursed is every one that continueth not
          in all things that are written in the law to do them." Cursed is the
          man who sins but once, yea, hopelessly cursed so far as the law is
          concerned. Oh! sinner, I cannot help turning aside from the subject
          for a moment to remind you that there is a way of salvation, and a way
          by which the law's demands can be fully satisfied. Christ bore all the
          punishment of all believers, so that they cannot be punished. Christ
          kept the law of God for believers, and he is willing to cast about any
          and every penitent sinner that perfect robe of righteousness which he
          himself has wrought out. But you cannot keep the law, and if you bring
          up your self-rigtheousness the law condemns both it and you; Out of
          your own mouth it condemns you, inasmuch as you have not done all
          things and have not kept all the law. A great rock lies in your path
          to heaven; a mountain insurmountable; a gulf impassable; and by that
          road no man shall ever enter into eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plea of self-righteousness, then, is in itself self-contradicting,
          and has only to be fairly stated to an honest man for him to see that
          it will not hold water for a single moment. What need of laboured
          argument to disprove a self-evident lie? Why should we tarry longer?
          Who but a very fool would maintain a notion which flies in its own
          face and witnesses against itself?
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now I pass to the second point, THE MAN WHO USES THIS PLEA
          CONDEMNS THE PLEA HIMSELF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does the plea cut its own throat, but the man himself is
          aware when he uses it that it is an evil, and false, and vain refuge.
          Now this is a matter of conscience, and therefore I must deal plainly
          with you; and if I speak not what you have felt, then you can say I am
          mistaken; but if I speak what you must confess to be true, let it be
          as the very voice of God to you. Men know that they are guilty. The
          conscience of the proudest man, when it is allowed to speak, tells him
          that he deserves the wrath of God. He may brag in public, but the very
          loudness of his bragging proves that he has an uneasy conscience, and
          therefore he makes a mighty din in order to drown its voice. Whenever
          I hear an infidel saying hard things of Christ, it reminds me of the
          men of Moloch, who beat the drums that they might not hear the screams
          of their own children. These loud blasphemies, these braggart
          boastings, are only a noisy way of drowing the shrieks of conscience.
          Do not believe that these men are honest. I think all controversy with
          them is time thrown away. I would never controvert with a thief about
          the principles of honesty, or with a known adulterer concerning the
          duty of chastity. Devils are not to be reasoned with, but to be cast
          out. Parleying with hell serves no one's turn except the devil's. Did
          Paul argue with Elymas? or Peter with Simon Magus? I would not cross
          swords with a man who says there is no God; he knows there is a God.
          When a man laughs at Holy Scripture, you need not argue with him; he
          is either a fool or a knave -- perhaps both. However villainous he may
          be, his conscience has some light; he knows that what he speaks is
          untrue. I cannot believe that conscience is so dead in any man as to
          let him believe that he is speaking the truth when he denies the
          Godhead; and much more I am certain that conscience never did give
          assent to the utterance of the braggart, who says he deserves eternal
          life, or has no sin of which to repent, or which by repentance may be
          washed away without the blood of Christ; he knows within himself that
          he speaks that which is false. When Professor Webster was shut up in
          prison for murder, he complained to the prison authorities that he had
          been insulted by his fellow-prisoners, for he said that through the
          walls of the prison he could hear them always crying out to him, "Thou
          bloody man! thou bloody man!" As it was not consistent with law that
          one prisoner should insult another, the strictest enquiry was made,
          and it was found that no prisoner had ever said such a word, or that
          if he had said it, Webster could not have heard it. It was his own
          conscience; it was not a word coming through the walls of the prison,
          but an echo reverberating from the wall of his bad heart, as
          conscience shouted, "Thou bloody man! thou bloody man!" There is in
          all your hearts a witness who will not cease his testimony; it cries,
          "Thou sinful man! thou sinful man!" You have only to listen to it, and
          you will soon find that every pretence of being saved by your good
          works must crumble to the ground. Oh! hear it now, and listen to it
          for a moment. I am sure my conscience says, "Thou sinful man! thou
          sinful man!" and I think yours must say the same, unless you are given
          up of God, and left to a seared conscience to perish in your sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          When men get alone, if in their loneliness the thought of death forces
          itself upon them, they boast no more of goodness. It is not easy for a
          man to lie on his bed seeing the naked face of death, not at a
          distance, but feeling that his breath is breathing upon the skeleton,
          and that he must soon pass through the iron gates of death -- it is
          not easy for a man to plead his self-righteousness then. The bony
          fingers thrust themselves like daggers into his proud flesh. "Ah!"
          saith Death, in tones which cannot be heard by mortal ear, but which
          are listened to by the mortal heart -- "Where now are all thy
          glories?" He looks upon the man, and the wreath of laurel that was
          upon his brow fades and falls to the earth like blasted flowers. He
          touches his breast, and the star of honour which he wore moulders and
          is quenched into darkness. He looks at him yet again -- that
          breast-plate of self-righteousness which glittered upon him like
          golden mail, suddenly dissolves unto dust, like the apples of Sodom
          before the touch of the gatherer, and the man finds himself to his own
          surprise naked, and poor, and miserable, when most he needed to be
          rich, when most he required to be happy and to be blessed. Ay, sinner,
          even while this sermon is being uttered, you may seek to refute it to
          yourself, and say, "Well, I believe I am as good as others, and that
          this fuss about a new birth, imputed righteousness, and being washed
          in blood, is all unnecessary," but in the loneliness of your silent
          chamber, especially when death shall be your dread and grim companion,
          you shall not need me to state this, you shall see it clearly enough
          yourselves; see it with eyes of horror; and feel it with a heart of
          dismay, and despair, and perish because thou hast despised the
          righteousness of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          How abundantly true, however, will this be at the day of judgment. I
          think I see that day of fire, that day of wrath. You are gathered as a
          great multitude before the eternal throne. Those who are robed in
          Christ's fine linen, which is the righteousness of the saints, are
          caught up to the right hand. And now the trumpet sounds; if there be
          any that have kept the law of God, if there be faultless ones, if
          there be any that have never sinned, let them stand forth and claim
          the promised reward; but, if not, let the pit engulph the sinner, let
          the fiery thunder-bolt be launched upon the impenitent offenders. Now,
          stand forth, sir, and clear thyself! Come forth, my friend, and claim
          the reward, because of the church you endowed, or the row of
          alms-houses that you erected. What! what! does your tongue lie dumb in
          your mouth? Come forward, come forward -- you who said you had been a
          good citizen, had fed the hungry, and clothed the naked -- come
          forward now, and claim the reward. What! what! is your face turned to
          whiteness? Is there an ashy paleness on your cheek? Come forward, ye
          multitudes of those who rejected Christ, and despised his blood. Come
          now, and say, "All the commandments have I kept from my youth up."
          What! are you seized with horror? Has the better light of judgment
          driven out the darkness of your self-righteousness? Oh! I see you, I
          see you, ye are not boasting now; but you, the best of you, are
          crying, "Ye rocks, hide me; ye mountains, open your stony bowels; and
          let me hide myself from the face of him that sits upon the throne."
          Why, why such a coward? Come, face it out before your Maker. Come up,
          infidel, now, tell God there is no God. Come, while hell is flaming in
          your nostrils; come, and say there is no hell; or tell the Almighty
          that you never could bear to hear a hell-fire sermon preached. Come
          now, and accuse the minister of cruelty, or say that we love to talk
          on these terrible themes. Let me not mock you in your misery; but let
          me picture to you how devils shall mock you. "Aha!" say they "where is
          your courage now? Are your ribs of iron and your bones of brass? Will
          you dare the Almighty now, and dash yourselves upon the bosses of his
          buckler, or run upon his glittering spear?" See them, see them as they
          sink! The gulf has swallowed them up; the earth has closed again, and
          they are gone; a solemn silence falls upon the ear. But hark below, if
          you could descend with them, you would hear their doleful groans, and
          hollow moans, as they now feel that the God omnipotent was right and
          just, and wise, and tender, when he bade them forsake their
          righteousness, and flee to Christ, and lay hold on him that can save
          to the uttermost them that come unto God by him.
        </p>
        <p>III. THE PLEA IS ITSELF EVIDENCE AGAINST THE PLEADER.</p>
        <p>
          There is an unregenerated man here, who says, "Am I blind also?" I
          answer in the words of Jesus, "But now ye say we see, therefore your
          sin remaineth." You have proved by your plea, in the first place, that
          you have never been enlightened of the Holy Spirit, but that you
          remain in a state of ignorance. A deaf man may declare that there is
          no such thing as music. A man who has never seen the stars, is very
          likely to say that there are no stars. But what does he prove? Does he
          prove that there are no stars? He only proves his own folly and his
          own ignorance. That man who can say half a word about his own
          righteousness has never been enlightened of God the Holy Spirit; for
          one of the first signs of a renewed heart is, that it abhors itself in
          dust and ashes. If thou dost to-day feel thyself to be guilty, and
          lost, and ruined, there is the richest hope for thee in the gospel;
          but if thou sayest, "I am good, I have merits," the law condemns thee,
          and the gospel cannot comfort thee; thou art in the gall of bitterness
          and in the bonds of iniquity, and thou art ignorant that all the while
          thou art talking thus, the wrath of God abideth on thee. A man may be
          a true Christian, and may fall into sin, but a man cannot be a true
          Christian and boast in his self-righteousness. A man may be saved,
          though infirmity may bespatter him with much mire; but he cannot be
          saved who does not know that he has been in the filth, and is not
          willing to confess that he is guilty before God. There are, in one
          sense, no conditions of salvation on our part, for whatever may be
          conditions God gives; but thus I know, there never was a man yet who
          was in a state of grace who did not know himself, in himself, to be in
          a state of ruin, a state of depravity and condemnation. If you do not
          know this, then I say your plea of self-righteousness condemns you for
          ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then again, inasmuch as you say that you are not guilty, this
          proves that you are impenitent. Now the impenitent can never come
          where God is. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
          forgive us our sins;" "but if we say that we have no sins, we make God
          a liar, and the truth is not in us." God will pardon all men who
          confess their iniquity. If we weep and lament, and take with us words,
          and say, "We have grievously sinned, forgive us -- we have greatly
          erred, have mercy upon us, through Jesus Christ," God will not refuse
          the cry; but if we, out of our impenitent and hard hearts, put
          ourselves upon God's justice, God will give us justice, but not mercy,
          and that justice shall be the meting out to us of the full vials of
          his indignation, and of his wrath for ever and ever. He that is
          self-righteous is impenitent, and therefore he is not, and cannot be
          saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further than this, the self-righteous man, the moment that he says he
          has done anything which can recommend him to God, proves that he is
          not a believer. Now, salvation is for believers, and for believers
          only. "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that
          believeth not shall be damned." Sir, you will be damned with all your
          self-righteousness, and your self-righteousness shall be like
          Dejanira's tunic, which she gave to Hercules, and which he put upon
          him, and, as the old fable hath it, it became a robe of fire to him;
          he tried to drag it away, but he pulled away pieces of his living,
          quivering flesh each moment, and perished miserably. Such shall your
          self-righteousness be to you. It seems a pleasant draught, and
          intoxicates for the moment; it is deadly and damnable as the venom of
          asps, and as the wine of Gomorrah. O soul! would that thou wouldst
          flee, above all things, from self-righteousness; for a self-righteous
          man does not and cannot trust Christ, and therefore he cannot see the
          face of God. None but the naked man will ever go to Christ for
          clothing; none but the hungry men will ever take Christ to be his
          food; none but thirsty souls will ever come to this well of Bethlehem
          to drink. The thirsty are welcome; but those who think they are good,
          are welcome neither to Sinai nor to Calvary. They have no hope of
          heaven, no peace in this world, nor in that which is to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah! soul, I know not who thou art; but if thou hast any righteousness
          of thine own, thou art a graceless soul. If you have given all your
          goods to feed the poor; if you have built many and many a sanctuary;
          if you have gone about with self-denial among the houses of poverty to
          visit the sons and daughters of affliction; if you have fasted thrice
          in the week; if your prayers have been so long that your throat has
          become hoarse through your crying; if your tears have been so many
          that your eyes have become blinded through your weeping; if your
          readings of Scripture have been so long that the midnight oil has been
          consumed in abundance; -- if, I say, your heart has been so tender
          towards the poor and the sick and the needy that you would have been
          willing to suffer with them, to bear all their loathsome diseases,
          nay, if adding all this you could give your body to be burned, yet if
          you trusted in any one of these things your damnation would be as sure
          as though you were thief or drunkard. Understand me, I mean what I
          say. I want you not to think I speak unguardedly now. Christ said of
          the Pharisees of old the very thing that I have said of you. They were
          good and excellent in their way; but, said he, the publicans and
          harlots enter the kingdom of God before you, because they would go the
          wrong way, while the poor publicans and harlots were led to go the
          right way. The Pharisee who went about to make a righteousness of his
          own, did not submit to the righteousness of Christ; the publican and
          the harlot, knowing that they had nothing whereof to glory, came to
          Christ and took him as he was, and gave their souls up to be saved by
          his grace. Oh! that we may do the same; for until we get rid of
          self-righteousness we are in a state of condemnation, and dying, the
          sentence must be executed upon us for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I close now upon the last point, namely, that this plea, if we
          retain it, not only accuses the pleader now, but IT WILL RUIN THE
          PLEADER FOR EVER.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me show you two suicides. There is a man who has sharpened a
          dagger, and seeking out his opportunity he stabs himself to the heart.
          There he falls. Who shall blame any man for his death? He slew
          himself; his blood be on his own head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is another: he is very sick and ill; he can scarcely crawl about
          the streets. A physician waits upon him; he tells him, "Sir, your
          disease is deadly; you must die; but I know a remedy which will
          certainly heal you. There it is; I freely give it to you. All I ask of
          you is, that you will freely take it." "Sir," says the man, "you
          insult me; I am as well as ever I was in my life; I am not sick."
          "But," says the other, "there are certain signs which I mark in your
          countenance which prove to me that you will have a deadly disease
          about you, and I warn you." The man thinks a moment; remembers that
          there have been certain signs in him of this very sickness; a monitor
          within tells him that it is so. He obstinately replies to the
          physician a second time -- "Sir, if I want your physic I will send for
          it, and if I need it I will pay for it." He knows all the while there
          is not a farthing in his pocket, and that he cannot get credit
          anywhere; and there stands the life-giving cup before him which the
          physician at great expense has obtained, but which he freely gives to
          him and bids him freely take. "No," says the man, "I will not take it;
          I may be somewhat sick, but I am not worse than my neighbours; I am
          not more ill than other people, and I shall not take it." One day you
          go to his bed and you find he has slept his last sleep, and there he
          lies stone dead. Who slew this man? Who killed him? His blood be on
          his own head; he is as base a suicide as the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I will show you two more suicides. There is a man here who says --
          "Well, let what will happen in the next world, I will have my fill in
          this. Tell me where there are pleasures to be had and I will have
          them. Leave the things of God to old fools, and such like; I shall
          have the things of the present, and the joys and delights of time." He
          drains the cup of drunkenness, frequents the haunt of folly, and if he
          knows where there is any vice pursued he rushes after it. Like Byron;
          he is a very thunderbold, launched from the hand of an arch-fiend; he
          flashes through the whole firmament of sin, and blazes himself out,
          until decayed in body and soul, he dies. He is a suicide. He defied
          God; he went against the laws of nature and of grace, despised
          warnings, declared he would be damned, and he has got what he richly
          deserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is another. He says, "I despise these vices; I am the most
          upright, honest, and commendable of men. I feel that I do not need
          salvation, and if I did need it I could get it myself. I can do
          anything you tell me to do, I feel I have mental force and manly
          dignity enough remaining in me to accomplish it. I tell you, sir, you
          insult me when you bid me trust in Christ." "Well," he says, "I
          consider there is such dignity in manhood, and so much virtue in me,
          that I need not a new heart, nor will I succumb and bend my spirit to
          the gospel of Christ on free-grace terms." Very well sir, when in hell
          you lift up your eyes, and you will do so as surely as the most
          profligate and profane, your blood will be upon your own head; and you
          will be as truly a suicide as he who wantonly and wickedly dashed
          himself against the laws of God and man, and brought himself to a
          sudden and hasty end by his iniquity and crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," says one, "this is a sermon well adapted to self-righteous
          persons, but I am not one." Then what are you, sir? Are you a believer
          in Christ? "I cannot say I am, sir." Why are you not, then? "Well, I
          would be, but I am afraid I may not believe in Christ." You are
          self-righteous, sir. God commands you to believe in Christ, and you
          say you are not fit. Now what does this mean but that you are wanting
          to make yourself fit, and this after all is the spirit of
          self-righteousness; you are so proud that you will not take Christ
          unless you think you can bring something to him -- that is it "Ah!
          no," says one poor broken-hearted soul, "I do not think that is fair
          with me, for I do feel as if I would give anything, if I might hope to
          be saved; but oh, I am such a wretch! I am such a wretch! I cannot
          believe." Now, that after all is self-righteousness. Christ bids you
          trust him. You say, "No, I will not trust thee, Christ, because I am
          such-an-one and such-an-one." So, then, you are wanting to make
          yourself somebody, and then Jesus Christ is to do the rest. It is the
          same spirit of self-righteousness only in another garb. "Ah!" saith
          one, "but if I did but feel my need enough, as you just now said, sir,
          then I think I would trust Christ." Self-righteousness again, you want
          your sense of need to save you. "Oh! but, sir, I cannot believe in
          Christ as I would." Self-righteousness again. Let me just utter a
          solemn sentence which you may masticate at your leisure. If you trust
          to your faith and to your repentance, you will be as much lost as if
          you trusted to your good works or trusted to your sins. The ground of
          your salvation is not faith, but Christ; it is not repentance, but
          Christ. If I trust my trust of Christ, I am lost. My business is to
          trust Christ; to rest on him; to depend, not on what the Spirit has
          done in me, but what Christ did for me, when he did hang upon the
          tree. Now be it known unto you, that when Christ died, he took the
          sins of all his people upon his head, and there and then they all
          ceased to be. At the moment when Christ died, the sins of all his
          redeemed were blotted out. He did then suffer all they ought to have
          suffered; he paid all their debts; and their sins were actually and
          positively lifted that day from their shoulders to his shoulders, for
          "the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." And now, if you
          believe in Jesus, there is not a sin remaining upon you, for your sin
          was laid on Christ; Christ was punished for your sins before they were
          committed, and as Kent says:
        </p>
        <p>"Here's pardon for transgressions past,</p>
        <p>It matters not how black their caste;</p>
        <p>And oh! my soul with wonder view,</p>
        <p>For sins to come here's pardon too."</p>
        <p>
          Blessed privilege of the believer! But if you live and die
          unbelievers, know this, that all your sins lie on your own shoulders.
          Christ did never make any atonement for you; you were never bought
          with blood; you never had an interest in his sacrifice. You live and
          die in yourselves, lost; in yourselves, ruined; in yourselves, utterly
          destroyed. But believing -- the moment you believe, you may know that
          you were chosen of God from before the foundation of the world.
          Believing, you may know that the righteousness of Christ is all yours;
          that all he did, he did for you; that all he suffered, he suffered for
          you. You do in fact, in the moment you believe, stand where Christ
          stood as God's accepted Son; and Christ stands where you stood as the
          sinner, and suffers as if he had been the sinner, and dies as if he
          had been guilty -- dies in your room, place, and stead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! Spirit of God, give faith this morning. Win us all from self; knit
          us all to Christ; may we be saved now by his free grace, and be saved
          in eternity.<br />
