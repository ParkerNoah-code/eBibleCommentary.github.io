        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1020)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, November 12th, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, which is as a
          bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to
          run a race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his
          circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
          thereof." -- Psalm 19:4-6.
        </p>
        <p>"The Sun of righteousness." -- Malachi 4:2.</p>
        <p>
          WE SHOULD FEEL QUITE JUSTIFIED in applying the language of the 19th
          Psalm to our Lord Jesus Christ from the simple fact that he is so
          frequently compared to the sun; and especially in the passage which we
          have given you as our second text, wherein he is called "the Sun of
          Righteousness." But we have a higher justification for such a reading
          of the passage, for it will be in your memories that, in the 10th
          chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, the Apostle Paul, slightly
          altering the words of this psalm, applies them to the gospel and the
          preachers thereof. "Have they not heard?" said he, "Yea, verily, their
          sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the
          world." So that what was here spoken of the sun by David, is referred
          by Paul to the gospel, which is the light streaming from Jesus Christ,
          "the Sun of Righteousness." We can never err if we allow the New
          Testament to interpret the Old: comparing spiritual things with
          spiritual is a good mental and spiritual exercise for us; and I feel,
          therefore, that we shall not be guilty of straining the text at all
          when we take the language of David in relation to the sun, and use it
          in reference to our Lord Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not your hearts often say, "What shall we do, or what shall we say
          to render honor unto our Redeemer?" Have you not often felt confounded
          as to what offering you shall bring to him? If you had been Possessor
          of all the worlds, you would have laid them at his feet; if the
          universe had been your heritage, you would cheerfully have resigned it
          to him, and felt happy in stripping yourself of everything, that he
          might be rendered the more glorious by your sacrifice. Since you have
          not all this wealth, have you not again and again asked of your soul,
        </p>
        <p>"Oh what shall I do,</p>
        <p>My Savior to praise?"</p>
        <p>
          I would write the best of poems if so I could extol him, but the
          faculty is not in me; I would sing the sweetest of songs, and compose
          the most melting music, if I could, and count art, and wit, and music
          exalted by being handmaidens to him; but, wherewithal shall I adore
          him, before whom the best music on earth must be but discord; and how
          shall I set him forth, the very skirts of whose garments are bright
          with insufferable light? At such times you have looked the whole world
          through to find metaphors to heap upon him; you have culled all the
          fair flowers of nature, and made them into garlands to cast at his
          feet, and you have gathered all earth's gems and precious things
          wherewith to crown his head, but you have been disappointed with the
          result, and have cried out with our poet: --
        </p>
        <p>"The whole creation can afford</p>
        <p>But some faint shadows of my Lord;</p>
        <p>Nature, to make his beauties known,</p>
        <p>Must mingle colors not her own."</p>
        <p>
          At such times, while ransacking land, and sea, and sky for metaphors,
          you have probably looked upon the sun, and have said: "This great orb,
          the lord of light and lamp of day, is like my Savior; it is the faint
          image of his excellent glory whose countenance thineth as the sun in
          its strength." You have done well to seize on such a figure. What
          Milton calls the golden-tressed sun is the most glorious object in
          creation, and in Jesus the fullness of glory dwells; the sun is at the
          same time the most influential of existences, acting upon the whole
          world, and truly our Lord is, in the deepest sense, "of this great
          world both eye and soul; he "with benignant ray sheds beauty, life,
          and joyance from above. The sun is, moreover, the most abiding of
          creatures; and therein it is also a type of him who remaineth from
          generation to generation, and is the same yesterday, to-day, and for
          ever. The king of day is so vast and so bright that the human eye
          cannot bear to gaze upon him; we delight in his beams, but we should
          be blinded should we continue to peer into his face; even yet more
          brilliant is our Lord by nature, for as God he is a consuming fire,
          but he deigns to smile upon us with milder beams as our brother and
          Redeemer. Jesus, like the sun, is the center and soul of all things,
          the fullness of all good, the lamp that lights us, the fire that warms
          us, the magnet that guides and controls us; he is the source and
          fountain of all life, beauty, fruitfulness, and strength; he is the
          fosterer of tender herbs of penitence, the quickener of the vital sap
          of grace, the ripener of fruits of holiness, and the life of
          everything that grows within the garden of the Lord. Whereas to adore
          the sun would be idolatry; it were treason not to worship ardently the
          divine Sun of Righteousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus Christ is the great, the glorious, the infinitely blessed; even
          the sun fails to set hire forth; but, as it is one of the best figures
          we can find, be it ours to use it this day. We will think of Jesus as
          the Sun this morning; first as in the text; secondly, as he is to us;
          and then, thirdly, for a few minutes, we will bask in his beams.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, then, we will contemplate Jesus AS THE SUN IN THE TEXT.</p>
        <p>
          Note how the passage begins: "In them hath he set a tabernacle for the
          sun." Kings were accustomed in their pompous progresses through their
          dominions to have canopies of splendor borne aloft over them, so that
          marching in the midst of their glittering soldiery they were
          themselves the main attraction of the gorgeous pageant. Our Lord Jesus
          Christ in his church is, as it were, traversing the heavens in a
          majestic tabernacle, and, like the sun, scattering his beams among
          men. The Redeemer is canopied by the adoration of his saints, for he
          "inhabiteth the praises of Israel." He is from day to day advancing in
          his glorious matchings through the universe, conquering and to
          conquer, and he will journey onward till the dispensation shall
          terminate, and the gospel age shall be closed by his second advent.
          When the text saith that there is a tabernacle set for the sun in the
          firmament, we are reminded of Christ as dwelling in the highest
          heavens. He is not alone the Christ of ancient history, but he is the
          Christ of to-day. Think not always of him as the lowly man despised
          and rejected, as nailed to the cross, or buried in the tomb; he is not
          here, for he is risen, but he still exists, not as a dream or phantom,
          but as the real Christ. Doubt it not, for up yonder, in the seventh
          heaven, the Lord has set a tabernacle for the Sun of Righteousness.
          There Jesus abides in splendor inconceivable, the joy and glory of all
          those blessed spirits who, having believed in him on the earth, have
          come to behold him in the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>"Bright, like a sun, the Savior sits,</p>
        <p>And spreads eternal noon;</p>
        <p>No evenings there, nor gloomy nights,</p>
        <p>To want the feeble moon."</p>
        <p>
          That Jesus lives is a deep well of consolation to the saints, and did
          we always remember it our hearts would not be troubled. If we always
          remembered that Jesus both lives and reigns; our joys would never
          wither. We worship him, it is true, as one who was slain and hath
          redeemed us unto God by his blood; but we also extol him as one who is
          "alive for evermore, and hath the keys of death and of hell."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let your faith to-day behold Jesus sitting at the right hand of God,
          even the Father. He sits there because his atoning work is done, and
          he is receiving the infinite reward which his Father promised him. He
          is exalted as a king upon his throne, expecting until his enemies are
          made his footstool. He dwells within his tabernacle of praise, adored
          and admired by angels and glorified spirits. He sits there, not as a
          weary one, feeble and exhausted, but with the keys of universal
          monarchy at his girdle, for "the government is upon his shoulder, and
          his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God." I want you
          fully to grasp the thought of the living Savior, -- of the Sun in his
          tabernacle in the highest heavens, for this must be the fulcrum upon
          which we shall work this morning. We shall get our leverage here: the
          living Savior, the mighty Savior, the reigning Savior; he is the
          church's joy and hope in the present and for all years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text proceeds to speak of Jesus as the sun, and describes him
          first as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber. A beautiful
          description indeed of the sun when he rises in the early morning. He
          comes forth from the vast obscure, as from within a secret chamber. He
          withdraws the veil of night, and floods the earth with fluid gold.
          From curtains of purple and vermillion, he looks forth, and scatters
          orient pearl around him. Clad with a blaze of glory, he begins the
          race of day. Thus our Lord Jesus Christ when he rose from the dead,
          was as the sun unveiling itself. He came forth from the sepulcher as a
          bridegroom from his chamber. Observe that dear name of bridegroom. The
          Lord of heaven and earth, between whom and us there was an infinite
          distance, has deigned to take our humanity into union with himself of
          the most intimate kind. Among men, there is no surer mode of making
          peace between two contending parties, than for a marriage to be
          established between them. It has often so been done, and thus wars
          have been ended, and alliances have been established. The Prince of
          Peace on heaven's side condescends to be married to our nature, that
          henceforth heaven and earth may be as one. Our Lord came as the
          bridegroom of his church out of his chamber, when he was born of the
          virgin and was revealed to the shepherds and the wise men of the east;
          yet, in a certain sense, he still continued in his chamber as a
          bridegroom all his life, for he was hidden and veiled, the Jewish
          world knew not their king; though he spake openly in their streets and
          sought not mystery, yet he was unknown, they did not discern him; and
          in some respects he did not then desire to be discerned, for he often
          bade his disciples to tell no man what was done. That was the time
          when the bridegroom was in his chamber, being made perfect through
          suffering and perfectly conformed unto his church, hearing her
          sicknesses and her sorrows, suffering her wants, enduring her shame,
          and thus completing the marriage union between the two. To this end,
          he actually descended by dark steps of anguish into the silent inner
          room of the grace, and there he slept in his chamber, perfectly wedded
          to his church. Come and look at him, you who admire the lover of your
          souls; he stooped to death and the sepulcher, because manhood had
          fallen under their yoke; his church was subject to death, and he must
          die. She deserved to stiffer the penally due to God's insulted law,
          and, therefore, Jesus bowed his head to the stroke.
        </p>
        <p>"Yea, said the Son, with her I'll go</p>
        <p>Through all the depths of sin and woe;</p>
        <p>And on the cross will even dare</p>
        <p>The bitter pains of death to bear."</p>
        <p>
          And he did bear them, and in the darksome chamber of the tomb, he
          proved how true a bridegroom he was to his church. Before his great
          race began, of which we are soon to speak, it behaved our mighty
          champion to descend into the lowest parts of the earth, and sleep
          among the dead. Before every day there is a night wherein darkness
          seems to triumph. It behaved Christ to suffer, and then to rise again.
          His descent was necessary to his ascent; his sojourn in the chamber to
          his race and victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have introduced to you the prelude of the race, the bridegroom
          in his chamber. Now observe the coming out of it. The sun comes forth,
          at the appointed hour, from the gates of day, and begins to gladden
          the earth; even so on the third day, early in the morning, Jesus, our
          Lord, arose from his sleep, and there was a great earthquake, for the
          angel of the Lord descended from heaven and rolled back the stone from
          the door of the sepulcher. Then did the Sun of Righteousness arise.
          Then did the great Bridegroom come forth from his chamber, and begin
          his joyful race. It must have been a ravishing sight to have beheld
          the risen Savior; well might the disciples hold him by the feet and
          worship him. Methinks, if ever angels sung more sweetly at one time
          than another, it must have been on that first Easter morning, when
          they saw the divine champion break his bonds of death asunder, and
          rise into the glorious resurrection life. Then was he revealed to the
          sons of men; and, no longer hidden: he began to tell his disciples the
          meaning of those enigmas which had been dark to them; things which
          they had not understood, which seemed inexplicable, were all opened up
          by him, for now was his time to come out of his chamber. His words,
          though plain enough, had aforetime hidden him even from those who
          loved him; but now he speaketh no more in proverbs, but showeth them
          openly concerning himself and the Father. He hath laid aside the
          incognito in which he traversed the earth as a stranger, and he is now
          divinely familiar with his friends, bidding them even touch his hands
          and his side. In his death the veil was rent, and in his resurrection
          the High Priest came forth in his robes of glory and beauty. A little
          while he was gone away, but he returned from the secret chambers of
          the ivory palaces, and showed himself unto his disciples. Blessed were
          the eyes that saw him in that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though during the forty days in which our Lord lingered among his
          followers upon earth we may truly say that he had come out of his
          chamber, we perceive that he more fully did so when, after the forty
          days had been accomplished, he took his disciples to the top of
          Olivet, and there ascended into heaven, out of their sight. Then had
          the sun indeed ascended above the horizon to make his glories stream
          along the heavens. See ye not the angelic bands poising themselves
          upon the wing in mid-air, waiting until he shall return all gloving
          with the victory non in long and deadly fight. Mark ye well that
          matchless spectacle as he is "seen of angels."
        </p>
        <p>"The helmed cherubim</p>
        <p>And sworded seraphim</p>
        <p>Are seen in glittering ranks, with wings displayed."</p>
        <p>
          They have hastened to meet the Prince of Glory, and attend him to his
          ancient patrimony. Right glad are an the heavenly band to welcome back
          the Captain of the Lord's host, and, therefore, they harp in loud and
          solemn quire to Heaven's triumphant Heir. As for the glorified of
          mortal race, redeemed of old by his blood which in the fullness of
          time was shed, they hail him with gladdest hymn, and lift up their
          sweetest symphonies to extol him who finished transgression, made an
          end of sin, and brought in everlasting righteousness. Then the
          bridegroom came out of his chamber with fit marriage music: his
          beauties hidden awhile in the chamber, where he vies regarded as
          without form or comeliness, blazed forth with renewed splendor, such
          as confounded both sun and moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another respect, Christ came out of his chamber at his ascension,
          because, when he ascended on high, leading captivity captive, he
          received and gave gifts for men. The gifts were intended for the
          manifestation of himself. His church, which is his body, was by his
          own command sitting still in the chamber, tarrying till power was
          given. But, on a sudden, the bridegroom's power was felt, for there
          was heard the sound as of a rushing mighty wind, which filled all the
          place, and then descending upon each favored head came the cloven
          tongue, and, straightway, you could see that the bridegroom had come
          out of his chamber, for the multitude in the street began to hear his
          voice. It was Peter that spake, we say, but far rather was it Christ,
          the bridegroom, who spake by Peter. It was the sun, from the chambers
          of the east, bursting through the clouds, and beginning to shine on
          Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia,
          and Rome, and Egypt, and making the multitudes in far off lands to see
          the day which prophets and kings had waited for, but which had never
          visited their eyes. Do you hear the joyful motion among the people,
          the joy mingled with the sorrows of repentance? This is the singing of
          birds, and these the dewdrops which hail the rising sun. The people
          cry, "What must we do to be saved?" -- the shadows are fleeing. They
          believe in Jesus, and are baptized into his name, -- the true light is
          shining. Three thousand souls are added in one day to the church, for
          truly the bridegroom is awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
          man that shouteth by reason of wine (Psalm 78:65). Then was the gospel
          race commenced with a glorious burst of strength, such as only our
          champion could have displayed. Meditate at your leisure upon this
          first general manifestation of our Lord to the general multitude. He
          had not gone out of Israel before. "I am not sent," said he, "save to
          the lost sheep of the House of Israel." Palestine was his chamber: he
          went to the windows of it, and looked forth on Tyre and Sidon
          wistfully; but he had not come forth of his chamber till that day,
          when the gospel began to be preached to the Gentiles also, and in
          fulfillment of the gift of Pentecost, when the Spirit was poured out
          upon all flesh, the apostles vent everywhere preaching the word. When
          even we, the dwellers in the far off northern isles, received the
          gospel, then, indeed, had the bridegroom come forth out of his
          chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          But enough of this, or time will fail me. After the coming forth, we
          have to consider in the text his course. The course of Jesus has been
          as that of the sun, or like that of a mighty champion girded for
          running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice, under this head, his continuance. Our Lord's gospel has been
          no meteor that flashed for a while and then passed away, but it has
          remained as the sun in the heavens. What systems of philosophy have
          come and none since on Calvary the Christ of God was lifted up! What
          speculations, what lo-heres and lo-theres have shone forth, have
          dazzled fools, and have been quenched in night, since he left the
          chamber of his marriage! Yet he continues still the same; nor,
          brethren, are there any marks of decrepitude either in him or in his
          gospel. They tell us that the idolatry of Hindostan is evidently
          crumbling: it falls not yet, but it is worm-eaten through and through.
          Equally sure is it that the false prophet holds but a feeble swats
          among his followers, and we can all see that though popery makes
          desperate efforts, and its extremities are vigorous, yet it is
          paralyzed at its heart, and the Vatican is made to feel than its time
          of power is short.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the gospel, it wears the dew of its youth after eighteen
          centuries of struggles; and it predominates most in those young
          nations which have evidently a history before them. The old systems
          are now most favored by those nations which are left behind in the
          race of civilisation, but the peoples whom God has made quick by
          nature are those to whom he has given to be receptive of his grace.
          There are grand days coming for the church of God. Voltaire said that
          he lived in the twilight of Christianity; and so he did, but it was
          the twilight of the morning, not the twilight of the evening. Glory be
          unto God, the little cloud the size of a man's hand is spreading; it
          begins to cover the heavens, and the day is not far distant when the
          sound of abundance of rain shall be heard. Christ was not a strong
          man, who bounded forth at a leap, and then put forth no more strength,
          but he rejoiced to continue his work, and to run his race. He was not
          a shooting star that sparkles for a moment, but a sun that shall thine
          throughout the livelong day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note next in this metaphor the unity of our Lord's course, for it is
          clear in the text: "Rejoicing as a strong man to run the race." A race
          is one thing; there is the one goal, and the man gathers up his
          strength to reach it. He has nothing else to think of. They may throw
          the golden apples in his road, but he does not observe them; they may
          sound harp and sackbut to the right, and breathe the lute or sweeter
          instruments of music to the left, but he is deaf to all; he has a race
          to run, and he throws his whole strength into it. This is a fit image
          of our Lord; he has never turned aside, he has never been compelled to
          retrace his steps, to revise his doctrine, to amend his system, or
          change his tactics. On, on, on has the course of Jesus been, shining
          more and more unto the perfect day.
        </p>
        <p>
          A certain people now-a-days who yet dare to call themselves
          Christians, are always hankering after something new, pining for
          novelties, and boasting of their fresh discoveries, though, forsooth,
          their fresh things are only fragments of broken images of heresies,
          which our fathers dashed to shivers centuries ago. The great thinkers
          of the present day are nothing more than mere translators -- you know
          the London meaning of that word -- buyers of old shoes who patch then
          up, and send them forth again as if they were something new. Old shoes
          and clouted are common enough among those Gibeonites who would deceive
          Israel, and whose boast is that they have come from far, and bring us
          treasures of wisdom from remote regions. Sirs, we want not your new
          things, for our Lord's race is the same as of old, and as he continues
          in one course so also will we. To spread righteousness and, in so
          doing, to save sinners and to glorify God, this is the one purpose of
          Christ; from it he will never cease, and nothing shall ever tempt him
          from the pursuit of it. Look, I pray you, with pleasure and see how
          our Lord, from his first coming out of his chamber until now, has
          continued still in the gospel to thine forth with rays of glory,
          without variableness or shadow of a turning. Though we believe not, he
          abideth faithful, he cannot deny himself; he changes not in work or
          way. For Zion's sake he worketh hitherto, and the pleasure of the Lord
          prospers in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, observe next, the notable idea of strength which the text
          conveys to us. "Rejoicing as a strong man to run his race." It is no
          drudgery the ascended Lord to carry on his cause;
        </p>
        <p>"The baffled prince of hell</p>
        <p>In lain new efforts tries,</p>
        <p>Truth's empire to repel</p>
        <p>By cruelty and lies;</p>
        <p>Th' infernal gates shall rage in vain</p>
        <p>Conquest awaits the Lamb once slain."</p>
        <p>
          There is a race to be run but Jesus is strong enough for it; he does
          not come panting up to the starting place, and thence go creeping on,
          but like a strong man he surveys the course. He knows that he is equal
          to it, and, therefore, he delights in it. When he began his race he
          was opposed, but the opposition only made him triumph the more
          readily, for "they that were scattered abroad went everywhere
          preaching the word." When our Lord arose like the sun, the clouds were
          thick and heavy, but he painted their fleecy skirts with gold;
          persecution hung over the eastern horizon, but he turned it into the
          imperial purple of his sovereignty. As he pursued his course the ice
          of centuries melted, the dense gloom of ages disappeared. No chains
          could bind him, and no bonds could hold him. He dashed on with
          undiminished energy, and the gates of hell could not prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          As no cloud has ever stayed the sun as he has "whirled his car along
          the ethereal plain," so no difficulties impeded the onward course of
          the gospel in the days of its dawning. To the first days of the church
          Thomson's lines to the sun are fully applicable --
        </p>
        <p>"Now, flaming up the heavens, the potent sun</p>
        <p>Melts into limpid air the high-raised clouds,</p>
        <p>And morning fogs, that hover'd round the hills,</p>
        <p>In party-coloured bands; till wide, unveiled,</p>
        <p>The face of nature shines, from where earth seems</p>
        <p>Far stretch'd around, to meet the bending sphere."</p>
        <p>
          The gospel soon shed its light in every land, and all nations felt its
          benign power. Men ceased to persecute, and bowed before the cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anon fresh clouds arose, and the church passed through them. Errors
          and heresies multiplied, filthy dreamers led away a huge apostacy,
          Rome became the mother of harlots and abominations, but the true
          church, and the true Christ within her, went right on. The church was
          not less triumphant in her second trial than in her first. Rome Papal
          was overcome as, surely as Rome Pagan. Popes were no more her
          conquerors than bloody emperors had been of yore. To the thoughtful
          eye the sun of Christ is not less bright over the valleys of Piedmont
          than over the waves of the sea which bore Paul and his fellow
          apostles. The champion's race was as eager and as triumphant as
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, dense banks of spiritual deadness and false teaching have
          barred the visible heavens, and have appeared to mortal sight an ebon
          wall impenetrable as steel, but the Lord reigneth. He that sitteth in
          the heavens doth laugh, the Lord doth have them in derision. Strong is
          his right hand, and his enemies shall be broken. On goes the Sun of
          Righteousness, nothing impedes him, his tabernacle is above them all,
          he rideth on the heavens, yea, he rideth on the wings of the wind.
          Trust ye in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah there is
          everlasting strength. Christ has failed in nothing, the decrees have
          been executed, the eternal purposes have been fulfilled, the elect
          have been saved, his kingdom is established, and shall continue as
          long as the sun. Who shall stay his hand? Who shall resist his will?
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, therefore, how the force is coupled with joy. Weakness brings
          sorrow, but strength begets joy. Christ is always glad, and he would
          have his people rejoice, for his cause goeth right on and he shall not
          fail nor be discouraged. He rejoices as he divides the spoil with the
          strong. When a man has a task to do which is easy to him, and which he
          can readily perform, he sings at his work; and so this day doth Christ
          rejoice over his church with joy, and triumph over her with singing.
          His cause goes on in spite of foes, and his strength is so great, that
          even the battle fills him with delight. I remember to have heard a
          Welsh preacher make use of the following simile. He was speaking of
          the joy of Christ in heaven, and he said, "You tell me that the church
          is sorrowful on earth and I tell you that Christ is joyous in heaven;
          and then you ask me how this can be? You see yonder mother with her
          babe, and she is washing the child; its face is foul and she desires
          to see it shine with brightness, she would see it white as the marble
          mingled with the redness of the rose. Therefore she washes it; but the
          child cries, it is fretful and knows not what is good for it, so it
          whines and struggles; the mother does not cry, or share its sorrow,
          she keeps on singing because she knows that all is right, and that her
          darling will smile like a cherub when all is over; she sees the good
          results coming, while the babe only feels the present discomfort, so
          she sings her song and never stops, let the child cry as it may." And
          so the Lord Jesus has pleasure in his work; he is purifying his
          church, and making her fit to be presented to himself, and though she
          winces and laments, it is the flesh that makes her so to do. The Lord
          sings still joyously, because he sees the end from the beginning!
          Earth may be swathed in mist, but the sun is never so, he shines
          gloriously evermore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text mentions one other fact connected with Jesus as the sun, --
          "There is nothing hid from the heat thereof;" by which is meant,
          nothing is able to escape the powerful influence of Christ Jesus. His
          own chosen people must, in due season, feel his power to save. They
          may wander as they do, and sin as they may, but when the time
          appointed comes, they shall be redeemed out of the land of the enemy.
          The sun's power is felt in the darkest and deepest mines; that there
          is a sun still shining might be discoverable even in the bowels of the
          earth! and so, in the darkest haunts of sin, God's elect shall be made
          to feel the sovereign power and omnipotent grace of our Lord Jesus
          Christ. When you and I shall die, and when we shall be buried in the
          grave, we shall not there be hid from the heat of this Sun of
          Righteousness, by-and-by he shall kindle life within our bones again;
          he shall create a soul within the ribs of death, and we shall spring
          upward as the grass, and as the willows by the watercourses, when the
          sun renewers the year. Our dry bones shall live, and in our flesh
          shall we see God. Meanwhile, while the gracious operations of Christ
          thus fall on all his elect, and there is nothing hid from the heat
          thereof, other operations are at work on all the sons of men. He rules
          in providence over all people, whether they believe in him or not, and
          if men do not accept the gospel, yet they are affected by it, in some
          way or other. Even the darkest parts of the world feel something of
          the presence of the Christ of God. Responsibility is heaped on those
          that hear of him and reject him; he becomes a savor of death unto
          death where he is not a savor of life unto life. There is nothing hid
          from the heat thereof. Oh, how this ought to encourage you Christian
          people to work! The Lord has gone before you; there is nothing hid
          from the heat of his presence. Jesus is King of the darkest
          settlements of the heathen, and he reigns in the lowest haunts of
          London's vice. Go there, for you are not intruders; you have a right
          to go any there in your Master's dominions; and the earth is the
          Lord's, and the fullness thereof. Be not afraid to face the vilest
          blasphemer, or the most foul-mouthed infidel, for Christ is Master,
          and if you bring the gospel before his enemy, he will be made to feel
          its power, either so as to yield to it a willing submission, or else
          to be condemned by it, In either case, you shall have done your part,
          and uttered your testimony, and freed your head of his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these thoughts combined, we see Christ Jesus, the risen Savior,
          pursuing his ever glorious course till he shall descend again the
          second time to take his people to himself to reign with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Very briefly indeed in the second place. Let us think for a moment
          of JESUS AS A SUN TO US. Worship and bless our Savior, it is ever meet
          and right to do so. Let him be extolled and be very high. Some would
          give him a secondary place, let it never be so with us. As the sun is
          the center, so is Christ; as the sun is the great motor, the first
          source of motive power, so is Christ to his people; as the sun is the
          fountain from which light, life, and heat perpetually flow, so is the
          Savior; as the sun is the fructifier by which fruits multiply and
          ripen, so is Christ: and as the sun is the regulator and rules the
          day, and marks the seasons, even so is Jesus owned as Lord to the
          glory of God the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think these thoughts over in the following respects. When you take the
          Bible remember that Christ is the center of the Scriptures. Do not put
          election in the center; some do, and they make a one-sided system. Do
          not put man in the center, -- some do, and they fall into grievous
          errors. Christ is the center of the entire system of the gospel, and
          all will be seen to move with regularity when you perceive that he is
          the chief fixed point; you cannot be right in the rest unless you
          think rightly of him. He is the center and King of all truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the center of the Church too. Not the pastor, not the church
          itself, not any rule or government, no bishop, no priest, and no Pope
          can be our center, Christ alone is our central sun. We follow as
          planets where he leads the way: around him we revolve, but we own no
          other Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let it be so in the world that even there Christ governs and is the
          center of all history. You will understand history better when you
          know this, for this is the key of the world's story, the reason for
          the rise and fall of empires. You shall understand all things when you
          know Immanuel, God with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And let him have this place in your hearts. There enthrone him!
          Establish him as the central sun, and let him rule your entire being,
          enlightening your understanding, warming your hearts, filling all your
          powers, passions, and faculties with the fullness of his presence. To
          have Christ in us, the hope of glory -- oh, what blessedness! But let
          us take care that it is so, for we know not Christ aright unless we
          give him such a place in our hearts as the sun occupies in God's
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But time fails me, and we must now pass on to the last point, and
          let us for a minute or two BASK IN HIS BEAMS. How shall we do it?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we must realize that he is. Sinner, saint, Christ lives: he who
          trod the wave of Galilee lives on. He who was marked with the nails
          rules on. Oh, sinner, does not that comfort you? The Savior lives, the
          redeemer lives; he who forgives sins still lives. Saint, does not this
          comfort you? The man of the tender heart still lives, with a bosom
          still to be leaned upon, and with lips still ready to speak endearing
          words. There is a tabernacle for the sun; he is not extinct; he
          thineth still, he blesses still. Bask in his beams, then, by realising
          that he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then come and lay your souls beneath his divine influence. O my soul,
          if thou art guilty come and rest in his atonement, if thou art
          unrighteous come and take his righteousness. If thou art feeble lay
          hold upon his strength. If thou canst not pray accept him as thine
          intercessor. If thou art in thyself nothing, take him to be thy all in
          all. Some creatures delight to warm themselves in the sun, but oh,
          what a pleasure it is to sun ones self in the presence of Christ.
          Never mind how little I am, how nothing I am, how vile I am, how foul
          I am; all I am he has taken to himself, and all he has belongs to me.
          I sin, but he has taken all my sin: he is righteous and all his
          righteousuess is mine. I am feeble, he is mighty; his mightiness is
          mine, I wrap myself in his omnipotence. Christ is all and Christ is
          mine. Why, I utterly fail when trying to talk about such things as
          these; talking is but stuttering on such a theme. Faith must enjoy
          rather than express her delight. Come, plunge ye all into this sea of
          sweetness, dive deep into this abyss of happiness -- Christ Jesus is
          yours for ever and for ever. The sun is very great but it is all for
          me, and Christ is very bright and glorious, but he is all my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then next, if you would sun yourself in his beams, imbibe the joy of
          his strength. He is like a bridegroom rejoicing to run his race. Now,
          brethren and sisters, I am often afraid lest in serving God, we should
          grow dispirited and downcast, and think that things are not going on
          as they should, the joy of the Lord is your strength. If you begin to
          say, "Our cause is very feeble, the gospel will not prevail among us,
          you will slacken your efforts." Do not so, but remember that Jesus
          Christ does not fret or sadden himself about his kingdom. He runs on
          full of strength and rejoices as he runs; and I bid you in the power
          of the Holy-Spirit, do the same. Cast away your doubts and fears, the
          kingdom is the Lord's, and he will deliver his adversaries, into your
          hands. I fret and worry myself sometimes about these inventors of new
          doctrines, and those ritualists who bring up the old rates and stale
          tallow of the past ages. Let us fret no more, but think that these are
          only like the clouds to the great sun; the gospel will still proceed
          in its career. Let us laugh the enemies of God to scorn and defy them
          to their faces. They defy the Lord God of Israel as did the Philistine
          of old, but God himself is mightier than they, and the victory is sure
          to the true church and to the gospel of his Son. Be ye very
          courageous! Be not alarmed with sudden fear! Trust in Jehovah, for the
          Lord will surely give unto his own servants the victory in the day of
          battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And brethren, if you would sun yourselves in Christ's beams, let me
          bid you reflect his light whenever you receive it. He is the sun, and
          you are the planet, but every planet shines, shines with borrowed
          light. It conceals no light, but sends back to other worlds what the
          sun has given to it. Cast back on men the light which Jesus gives you.
          Triumph in Christ's circuit, that it is so broad as to comprehend the
          world, and compass all time. Enlarge your oven hearts, and let your
          light thine far and wide, believing that the power of God which gives
          you light will go with the light which you reflect. Comfort your
          hearts! "Be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of
          the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the
          Lord." Who shall stop the Christ of God in his race? Let him first go
          pluck the sun from his sphere. Who shall stay the champion of God who
          has girt himself for his race? Whosoever cometh in his way woe unto
          him, for if Samson smote a thousand men hip and thigh, what shall our
          immortal Samson do? Let all the armies of pope and devil come against
          him, he will utterly defy them, and drive them like chaff before the
          wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sing ye unto his name, for he hath triumphed gloriously! Begin the
          everlasting song, for he is the Lord and God, and to the uttermost
          ages shall he reign; yea, for ever and ever is he priest and King.
        </p>
        <p>God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.</p>
