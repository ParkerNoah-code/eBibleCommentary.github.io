          |Abgar, son of Archam, prince of the land, to Jesus, Saviour and
          Benefactor of men, who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem,
          greeting: --
        </p>
        <p>
          |I have heard of Thee, and of the cures wrought by Thy hands, without
          remedies, without herbs: for, as it is said, Thou makest the blind to
          see, the lame to walk, the lepers to be healed; Thou drivest out

          The messengers, the bearers of this letter, met Jesus at Jerusalem, a
          fact confirmed by these words of the Gospel: |Some from amongst the
          heathen came to find Jesus, but those who heard them, not daring to
          tell Jesus what they had heard, told it to Philip and Andrew, who
          repeated it all to their Master.|
        </p>
        <p>
          The Saviour did not then accept the invitation given to Him, but He
          thought fit to honour Abgar with an answer in these words: --
