        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.695)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, June 17th, 1866, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
          worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such
          to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must
          worship him in spirit and in truth." -- John 4:23-24.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE WOMAN'S CONSCIENCE had been aroused by Christ's declaration of her
          sin. He was touching upon matters of the most vital importance, and
          her depraved heart naturally shrunk from the lancet, From the truth
          which was becoming inconveniently personal she flew to that natural
          resort of the carnal mind, namely, to religions discourse upon points
          of outward observance. Instead of confessing her sin, and asking how
          it may be forgiven, she must needs say, "Our fathers worshipped in
          this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men
          ought to worship." The carnal heart dreads the contact of spiritual
          truth, and finds a most convenient way of avoiding it by running to
          questions of holy places, holy times, and holy customs. Jesus, to her
          astonishment, informs her that the question which she had asked was of
          only temporary importance. There had been a time when it was well to
          know that salvation was of the Jews, and that the rival temple of the
          Samaritans was an imposture; but he says in effect to her, "Woman,
          believe me that question is of no importance now, for the hour cometh,
          yea and now is, when the external is to be abolished and the
          ritualistic is to be put away, and a purer, simpler, and more
          spiritual worship, is to take its place."
        </p>
        <p>
          The worship which our Lord Jesus Christ established involved a change.
          That is implied in the expressions here used. He announced to her that
          the hour was just then come when all questions about this or that
          place must cease, and be superseded by spiritual worship. Our Lord
          gave a very brief, but I think a very instructive description of what
          this worship was to be. If you observe carefully the words, you will
          see that it was a distinguishing kind of worship, for he mentions true
          worshippers. There had been but little distinction before; so long as
          they all passed through the same outward form they all seemed to be
          worshippers; but a distinction was now to be made clear and manifest.
          Merely outward worshippers were now false worshippers, and only those
          who pressed into spiritual worship were to be regarded as true. The
          gospel of Christ is a great discerner and an accurate judge. Christ
          has the winnowing fan in his hand; he sits as a refiner; he is
          compared by the prophet to the "refiner's fire" and to "fuller's
          soap;" and hence you see he discerns at once between worshippers and
          worshippers. There they stand both alike with bended heads, perhaps
          both repeating the same words, but the Savior distinguishes: "there
          is," saith he, "a false worshipper, and there is a true worshipper,
          and he alone who is spiritual is true." He announces further that
          under the gospel God is to be worshipped in the character of a Father;
          true worshippers shall worship the Father. This had not been the case
          before. The Lord had been adored as the Adonai, and reverenced as
          Jehovah; but to say "Our Father which art in heaven" remains the
          prerogative of the enlightened Christian who, having believed in
          Christ, has received power to become a son of God. True Christian
          worship addresses God, not merely as Creator and Preserver, or as the
          great Lord of the Universe, but as one who is very near of kin to us,
          our Father, beloved of our souls. Jesus likewise states that gospel
          worship is to be of a kind which does not result from the man himself
          merely, but comes from God, and is a work of grace. This is implied in
          the sentence, "The Father seeketh such to worship him," as if no true
          worship would come from any man unless God sought it. True devotion
          under the Christian dispensation is not merely human but also divine.
          It is the work of the Spirit in the soul returning to its author; or
          as our hymn puts it --
        </p>
        <p>"Prayer is the breath of God in man,</p>
        <p>Returning whence it came."</p>
        <p>
          These are very grave points, and draw a broad line of distinction
          between the living worship of the chosen of God and the dead formal
          worship of the world which lieth in the wicked one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the Savior goes on to say that they who worship God are
          to worship him "in spirit." No longer with the visible sacrifice of a
          lamb, but inwardly trusting in him who is the Lamb of God's passover;
          no more with sprinkled blood of goats, but heartily relying upon the
          blood once shed for many; no longer worshipping God with ephod,
          breastplate, and mitre, but with prostrate soul, with uplifted faith,
          and with the faculties not of the body but of the inward spirit. We
          who worship God under the Christian dispensation are no longer to
          fancy that bodily exercise in worship profiteth anything, that
          genuflexions and contortions are of any value, but that acceptable
          worship is wholly mental, inward, and spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he adds, lest there should seem an omission in the description,
          "must worship him in spirit and in truth;" for though we should
          profess to worship God only with the spirit and so despise forms, yet
          unless the soul shall truly love, and really adore, and sincerely bow,
          our worship will be as unacceptable as though it were formal and
          outward. See then, brethren, putting the whole three together, the
          worship under the Christian dispensation which God ordains, and which
          he accepts through Christ Jesus, is a worship distinguished by an
          inward vitality from the outward worship of the carnal mind. It is the
          worship of a child towards a father, feeling within himself a kinship
          with the divine; it is a worship wrought in us by God the Holy Ghost,
          because the Father has sought us out and taught us how to worship him.
          It is a worship which is not outward, but of the inner man, and
          occupies not hand, eye, and foot, but heart and soul and spirit: and
          it is a worship which is not professional and formal, but real,
          hearty, earnest, and so acceptable before God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me give a sketch of this worship as it actually exhibits itself. A
          man may have been to a place of worship from his youth up, and he may
          have fallen into a habit of repeating a sacred form every morning and
          every evening, he may even have been a tolerably diligent reader of
          the Word of God, and yet though this may have been continued for sixty
          years and more, he may never once have worshipped God after the
          fashion prescribed in the text. But see him! the Father seeks him,
          truth comes home to his soul, and in the light of that truth he feels
          himself a sinner, and feeling himself so, he cries, "Father, I have
          sinned." That is his first true worship. See, brethren, his spirit
          feels it, he means what he says. All that he said before was as
          nothing, but that first cry "I have sinned" has in it the vitality of
          worship. He hears the story of the cross, the full atonement made by
          God's appointed sacrifice, and he prays, "Lord, I believe in Jesus,
          and I trust him;" here is another specimen of true worship; here is
          the spirit resting upon God's appointed sacrifice, and reverencing
          God's way of salvation by accepting it. Being saved by the precious
          blood of Jesus, he cries, "Father, I bless thee that I am saved, I
          thank thee that my sins are washed away." This is true worship.
          Whether a man sings in the assembly, or sings alone; whether he prays
          aloud, or prays in silence, if he feels gratitude to God for pardon
          received, he offers the true worship. The whole of the Christian's
          life, consisting as it must do of dealings with the invisible God
          through Jesus Christ by his heart, is a life of worship, and when at
          last he comes to die, you perceive that his worship will not cease
          with death, because it has always been spiritual, and did not depend
          upon the body. So that while the outward man faileth him, the inward
          spiritual man grows more strong in devotion than ever it was before;
          and when at last the spirit leaves its earthly tenement, and is
          disembodied, it has still a song for God, and throughout eternity its
          spiritual worship can continue; which worship must have been suspended
          if it had been connected with the body, and not with the immortal part
          of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I understand the Savior's words, and I hope I do, not only
          theoretically but practically, he means that those of us who are his
          true worshippers must worship him with our better and our nobler part,
          and our soul, with all the power she has, must pay reverence to the
          unseen God, Brethren, this is the kind of worship that men will not
          render to God; they will render him anything else but this; and until
          divinely effectual grace shall work such worship in man's heart it is
          obnoxious to him; he will worship God with robes, and incense, and
          flowers, and banners, but he will not consent to worship him in spirit
          and in truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. I shall proceed to my work by giving A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY
          OF WORSHIP, in connection with the doctrine that we are now to worship
          more manifestly than ever God in spirit and in truth. It appears from
          Scripture that worship before the flood was of the very simplest form.
          The outward ordinances were very few; the chief of them being the
          offering of sacrifice. This was probably instituted by God himself
          when he clothed Adam and his wife with skins of beasts; it has been
          thought that he then indicated to them the slaughter of beasts for
          sacrifice. Certain it is that the first worship of fallen man was by
          sacrifice. There was connected with this no doubt the meeting of
          gracious hearts for prayer, and also the ministration of truth, for
          Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied concerning the coming of
          the Lord; so that they appear to have had what was tantamount to a
          ministry, and the sons of God had appointed times for meeting. But
          this simple form of worship seems to have been too high, too spiritual
          for fallen man at the first; at any rate the seed of the serpent could
          not endure it, for Cain at the very first commenced a schism; instead
          of bringing a sacrifice by blood he must needs bring a sacrifice of
          the fruits of the ground. Perhaps he was a man of taste, and desired
          to bring something that should look more decorous than a poor bleeding
          victim; he would lay those rich grapes, those ruddy fruits upon the
          altar; and those fair flowers that gemmed the bosom of earth, surely
          he might consecrate those. At any rate he was the first man who set up
          taste and self as the guide in religious worship, and God had no
          respect unto his sacrifice. The two stood by their altars; Abel by
          faith, exercising spiritual worship, offered a more acceptable
          sacrifice than Cain; Cain's offering was possibly even more fair to
          look upon but it was of his own invention; Abel was accepted, but Cain
          discarded. The ultimate result of man's sinfulness in connection with
          this early type of worship was general neglect of all religion. The
          sons of God seem to have maintained their simplicity for a time, but
          at last by unholy alliances with the ungodly race there arose a
          widespread neglect of all thought of God, so that they were married
          and given in marriage, they ate and they drank till the day when the
          flood came and swept them all away. Depraved nature thus refused to
          render spiritual worship. After the flood we find worship restored in
          very much the same form: let us distinguish it as the patriarchal
          method of worship. The head of a family was accustomed to offer
          sacrifice, and no doubt if Job be taken as a type thereof family
          prayer and household religion were maintained, But you see very early
          the indication that man, although he could not forget God, for the
          deluge had struck to the very heart of manhood an awful dread of the
          Most High, began to interpose symbols and visible objects between God
          and himself. The use of teraphim became very common; so that in the
          house even of Abraham's ancestors teraphs were found; and when we come
          down to the time of Jacob, we find one of his wives stealing her
          father's images, thus proving that Laban, one of a once God-fearing
          family, had become a worshipper of God through the medium of images.
          Thus was it among those who still had some knowledge of God; but the
          nations being dispersed, soon lost the pure idea of the invisible One,
          and worshipped gods of their own devising. From the plagues of Egypt,
          which were no doubt intended to be a blow against all Egypt's gods, we
          find out that, in addition to the worship of the calf or bull, the
          Egyptians paid religious reverence to flies, the river Nile, the
          elements, beetles, and all kinds of creatures; and throughout the
          world, as a general rule, through the introduction of visible symbols
          of the unseen Being, the Lord himself had become forgotten, and
          spiritual worship had almost ceased, except in one elect household;
          and even there, alas! how fallen had spirituality become!
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping to the line of grace, we shall now introduce you to the
          ceremonial form of worship which God instituted after the more
          spiritual method had entirely broken down. He saw that the children of
          Israel whom he loved were but a mob of slaves; their spirits had been
          broken by bitter bondage; like the poor African race of the present
          day, they seemed as a whole incapable of rising at once to mental
          dignity, and needed to pass through a generation or two before they
          could as a nation achieve manly self-government. So when he brought
          his people out of Egypt the Lord did not try them with an altogether
          spiritual form of worship; because of the hardness of their hearts
          among other reasons, though he was still to be worshipped as a spirit,
          yet he gave them certain outward signs by which they might be enabled
          to understand his character. A great deal has been made of the
          symbolical worship of the Jew, as if it were an excuse for the manmade
          symbolism of the Roman and Anglican Antichrist. We would remark that
          nothing ought to be made of it at all now, since it has been
          positively declared many times in Scripture that the age of the shadow
          has gone, and that the age of the substance now reigns. Whatever may
          or may not have been the excellence of the old Jewish economy -- and
          being divinely ordained, God forbid we should say a word against it --
          yet the apostle Paul always talks of it as being but a yoke of bondage
          to which we are no more to submit ourselves, being but the shadow and
          not the very image of the good things which were to come; and he
          speaks of it as a thing so passed away, that to go back to it is to go
          back to the rudiments, and not to go onward in the full-grown
          manliness of Christianity. If there were no other passage my text
          might show that the ceremonialism of the Jew is no excuse whatever for
          ceremonialism now, but that we ought to stand in direct contrast to
          that, hearing the Savior declare, that whatever may have been before
          his time, the hour had come when the true worshipper must worship the
          Father in spirit and in truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that symbolical worship was suitable merely to the infancy of
          God's church, and that now having received the Spirit of God to dwell
          in us it would be as unsuitable as would the swaddling bands of
          babyhood to full-grown men. Besides, even while it existed it was
          spoken of as soon to be superseded by a new and better covenant. It
          was frequently broken through by divine authority. Elijah though not
          at all of the house of Levi offered sacrifice, and prophet after
          prophet as he arose manifested and declared by his actions that God
          did not intend to give the Levitical form of worship undivided sway,
          but that when he poured his Spirit upon special men they were to break
          through all ritual regulations in order to show that they were not
          meant to be fixed and permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not sufficiently remembered that the most of God's people in the
          Jewish nation had very little to do with this symbolical worship. When
          they were all in the wilderness, and gathered round the one tent
          called the tabernacle, they might all see the fiery cloudy pillar; but
          when they came into the land which God had given them, what had they
          most of them to see? Why the temple itself the most of them would only
          see once or twice in a year. Scarcely any one ever saw the ark, the
          cherubim, or the golden candlestick; they were always within the veil,
          and only once in the year did the high priest enter that sacred place.
          Even the place where the sacrifices were carried on continually, no
          one entered but the priests; so that to at least eleven tribes out of
          twelve the ceremonials were mainly invisible. Little was done outside
          the court of the priests, but the most of the sacrifices, and of the
          typology of Judaism, was as much a hidden thing as the spiritual
          things of God are to us at the present day; and thus there was a great
          exercise of the spiritual faculties, and comparatively little of
          outward display. Moreover, it is to be remembered that there was
          nothing whatever visible for the Jew to worship. It is not so in the
          symbology of that false Church which is trying to raise up and revive
          the beggarly elements; there men bow before a cross; a piece of bread
          inside a box is reverenced and treated with worship; cast-off clouts
          and rotten rags, called relics, are the objects of adoration; but
          there was nothing like this with the Jews, they did worship toward the
          temple, but they did not adore the temple, or mercy-seat, the altar,
          or any other emblem. Is it not said expressly, "Ye saw no similitude"?
          When God descended upon Sinai, and all the people worshipped there,
          they saw nothing which they dared to worship; God was to them still
          invisible, and they had to exercise their mental faculties in the
          worship of the invisible God. When at one time it was thought that the
          miraculous powers of the brazen serpent entitled it to worship,
          Hezekiah called it Nehushtan, that is, a piece of brass, and broke it
          to pieces. So that with all its splendor of imagery, embroidered vest,
          and glittering breastplate, to a great extent there was a powerful
          element of spirituality even about Aaronic worship; I mean, of course,
          only to spiritual men. David himself utterly outstripped the outward,
          when he declared, "Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire;" and
          when he said again, "Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it
          thee." The prophet declares that God is weary of their sacrifices, and
          in another place the Lord himself says that if we could come before
          him with rivers of oil, or ten thousand of the fat of fed beasts, he
          would not accept us with these. To obey is better than sacrifice, is
          told us even under the law. So that even there, though not so
          distinctly as now, the spirituality of worship was taught and
          declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, dear friends, what became of this accommodation of worship to the
          childhood of the church? You know that very soon after Israel came out
          of Egypt they said, "Let us make gods that they may go before us."
          They could not do without a visible God. Do not think that when they
          set up the calf they meant to worship the calf instead of Jehovah,
          that would be a slander upon them; they worshipped Jehovah through the
          calf -- that was their plea, for they said, "Tomorrow is a feast unto
          Jehovah." They thought to represent Jehovah by a bull, "they changed
          their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass." Though
          severely rebuked, it was the constant sin of Israel to desire to
          worship God under the favourite Egyptian emblem of the bull. At last
          they had so far gone into idolatry that they were driven far away; and
          in captivity they were so chastened, and moreover brought into such
          contact with the abominations of idolatry that they were heartily sick
          of it, and no Jew has been an idolater ever since. Still, spiritual
          worship they would not offer, and therefore fell into rigid ritualism,
          reverencing the mere letter of the law, and fighting over trifling
          refinements of regulation and observance; so that in Christ's day they
          made broad their phylacteries and the borders of their garments, but
          they forgot the Great Spirit who is to be worshipped in spirit and in
          truth.

          Since that day the Lord has been treated by carnal men in one of three
          ways; either God is adored by outward symbols as among Brahminists,
          Romanists, Puseyites, and other idolaters; or else he is worshipped
          through ritualism, as among too many who claim to be orthodox, who
          contend for pre-arranged, and unbending forms; written or unwritten as
          the case may be: or else men show an utter indifference to God
          altogether, and then rush into superstitious reverence for something
          or other which is evil, and therefore to be dreaded and spoken of with
          awe. This is the history of religious worship, that let spiritual
          worship assume what form it may, man always will if he can, get away
          from it and forget his God and set up something seen, instead of
          bowing down before the unseen; hence the necessity of the second
          commandment in the Decalogue, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any
          graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or
          that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
          thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the
          Lord thy God am a jealous God, and so on." This is not a command
          against worshipping another God, that is the first commandment, but a
          command against worshipping God under any shape, or through any medium
          or under any symbol; for he is a spirit, and must be worshipped in
          spirit and in truth and not by symbols. Against this command the human
          mind is always dashing itself, and in one shape or another idolatry is
          the ruling religion of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ comes to tell us that now his worship is to be wholly
          spiritual, even the altar which belongs to antediluvian times is gone,
          for we have an altar of another kind; even the sacrifice which
          belonged to the early period has departed like a shadow, because we
          have the sacrifice of Christ in which to trust. As for the
          institutions which suited the infancy of the church, they also have
          disappeared, for now Jesus would have the worship of men enlightened
          by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost; he would have us understand that
          a perfect revelation demands of us, that in the perfection of our
          spiritual powers we should adore the invisible God without the
          interference of visible signs. Now he would have us cast away all
          outward types and signs, except the two which he has himself ordained,
          and even these are types of the Savior's manhood and not of his
          Godhead at all, to be only valued because of the spiritual communion
          which they enable our hearts to hold with Jesus; baptism being
          intended for spiritual men, that they may enter into the Savior's
          death and burial, and the Lord's supper that the same persons may
          remember his body broken and his blood shed for them; the water, the
          bread, the wine, being mere emblems, not to be treated with reverence,
          but put to their proper emblematic use.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. I shall now, in the second place, try to ACCOUNT FOR THE EXTREME
          RARITY OF SPIRITUAL WORSHIP. The reason is, my brethren, because man
          has fallen. If man were what he once was, pure and holy, I cannot
          conceive of his wanting holy places and crosses, copes, and dalmatics,
          crosiers, and chasubles. I cannot conceive of the temptation to bow
          down before a bull, or a Virgin Mary, or a wafer. There the noble
          creature walks in paradise, and if he reclines beneath a shady tree,
          he lifts up his eyes and says, "My Father, thou hast made this
          grateful shade, here I will adore thee;" or if he walks in the full
          heat of the sun, he says, "My God, it is thy light that shineth on me,
          -- I adore thee." Up yonder on the mountain's brow, or down by the
          gleaming river, or the silvery lake, he needs build no altar, his
          altar is within himself; be needs make no temple, his temple is
          everywhere. The morning is holy, and the evening is holy; he hath no
          prescribed hour of prayer, it is devotion all day long; his morning
          bath is his baptism; each meal is his Eucharist. Depend upon it, the
          nearer we get back to the nakedness of worship, the nearer we get to
          its truth and purity; and it is because man has fallen, that as his
          body wants clothing, so he is always dressing up his religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it is far more difficult to worship God in spirit than in
          form. To patter through a dozen Ave Marias or Paternosters is so easy,
          that I can nearly go to sleep over them: to repeat a form of prayer in
          the morning and evening is a very small matter, and one can be
          thinking of the shop all the while; to go to church or chapel so many
          times a week is a cheap duty, and withal one may still be a thief or a
          hypocrite; but it is hard, very hard, to bring the heart down to
          humble penitence, and the soul to holy meditation. The last thing that
          most people will do is to think. The noblest part of our nature is
          still the least exercised. Humbly to tremble before God, to confess
          sin before him, to believe him, to love him -- this is spiritual
          worship! Because this is so hard, men say, " No, no, let me crawl on
          my knees around a shrine! Let me kneel down before a pyx, let me help
          to make a cope, or to manufacture some pretty piece of millinery for
          the priest to wear. Let me go every morning to the steeple house and
          come out in half an hour, and feel I have done my religion." That is
          quite easy, but the hard part of religion is the part of spiritual
          worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet again, to worship God spiritually men would have to part with
          their sins. There is no effect produced upon a man's conscience by his
          being sprinkled, or by his taking the sacraments, he can do all that
          and be as much a pleasure-lover, or a worshipper of Mammon, as he was
          before; but, to worship God spiritually, a man must give up his sins,
          must overcome his pride and lust, and his evil concupiscence must be
          cast out of him. Many persons might honestly declare, "I do not mind
          worshipping God if it consists in doing penance, or going without meat
          on Fridays; but if I am to give up my sins, love God, seek Christ,
          trust to him, I cannot attend to that." Furthermore, man, for the most
          part, somehow cannot get the idea of this spiritual worship into his
          brain, Oh the many times I have tried to preach spiritual worship
          here, and yet I am conscious that when I try at it I do not interest
          many of you, and some of you think, "if he would only give us more
          metaphors, more anecdotes, and so on;" I say I will do that, for I
          believe we should speak by parable, but sometimes I do not know how to
          clothe these spiritual things without making you look at the clothing
          rather than the spirit. It is not your worshipping God by words in
          hymns and prayers, or sitting in a certain place, or covering your
          faces at certain times that is acceptable to him; true worship lies in
          your heart paying reverence to him, your soul obeying him, and your
          inner nature coming into conformity to his own nature, by the work of
          his Spirit in your soul; and because men can scarcely get the idea of
          this till the Holy Spirit gives it to them, this is a reason why it is
          so rare, so exceedingly rare. There is one other reason, dear friends,
          why spiritual worship is unusual, and that is because man cannot
          traffic in spiritual religion. The priest is up at arms directly. "
          Oh," saith he, "spiritual! spiritual! why they will do without me one
          of these days. Spiritual -- why, if you tell these people that every
          place is holy, and that there are no holy places; and that one
          believer is as much a priest as another, and that prayer is as
          acceptable at home, as it is in a particular spot, why," says he,
          "there is an end of me." Yes, sir, there is an end of you, and the
          sooner the better for the world; for of all the curses that have ever
          fallen upon the human race the priesthood is the worst. Its claims are
          imposture, and its actions are full of deceit, In the age of witches
          and ghosts priesthood might be tolerated, but he who now sets himself
          up as a priest is as much a common nuisance as a fortune-teller.
          Nothing has been such a nightmare upon the intellect of man; nothing
          has sat like old Sindbad the Sailor upon the back of humanity, like
          the pretensions of priesthood. God forbid that Christianity should
          even for a moment endorse the lie! Christ has put it all down. Christ
          says, "All ye are brethren," and he says of the whole body of his
          elect, "Ye are a royal priesthood." Concerning all the saints,
          Scripture declares, "Ye are God's clergy," for that is the Greek word
          in the passage -- "Ye are God's heritage." We know no clergy and no
          laity; we know nothing whatever now of priesthood and of the common
          people, for ye are made priests and kings unto God to offer spiritual
          sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Turning from that point, a third subject is this, WHY IS SUCH
          WORSHIP TO BE RENDERED? Why did not God ordain worship by windmills as
          in Thibet? Why has he not chosen to be worshipped by particular men in
          purple and fine linen, acting gracefully as in Roman and Anglican
          churches? Why not? He gives two reasons which ought to suffice. The
          first is, he himself seeks spiritual worship. It is his own wish that
          the worship should be spiritual, And in the second place, he is
          himself a spirit, and is to be spiritually worshipped. Whatever kind
          of worship the great Ruler desires he ought to receive, and it is
          impertinence on my part if I say to him, "No, not that, but this." It
          is true I may say, "I am very sincere in all this, very earnest in it.
          It suits my taste. There is a beauty about it; it excites certain
          emotions which I think to be devotional." What is all that but saying,
          "Great God, thou hast chosen such-and-such a way of being worshipped,
          but I will not render it to thee?" Is not that in effect saying, "I
          will not worship thee at all;" for must not worship, to be worship, be
          such as the person worshipped himself will accept? To invent our own
          forms of worship is to insult God; and every mass that is ever offered
          upon the Romish altar is an insult to heaven, and a blasphemy to God
          who is a Spirit. Every time any form of worship by procession,
          celebration, or ceremonial of man's invention is offered to God, it is
          offered in defiance of this word of Christ, and cannot and will not be
          received; however earnest people may be they have violated the
          imperative canon of God's Word; and in fighting for rubrics they have
          gone against the eternal rubric that God as a Spirit must be
          worshipped in spirit and in truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second reason given is, that God is a Spirit. If God were
          material, it might be right to worship him with material substances;
          if God were like to ourselves, it might be well for us to give a
          sacrifice congenial to humanity; but being as he is, pure spirit, he
          must be worshipped in spirit. I like the remark made by Trapp in his
          commentary on this passage, when he says that perhaps the Savior is
          even here bringing down God to our comprehension; "for," saith he,
          "God is above all notion, all name." Certainly, this we know, that
          anything which associates him with the grossness of materialism is
          infinitely removed from the truth. Said Augustine, "When I am not
          asked what God is, I think I know, but when I try to answer that
          question, I find I know nothing." If the Eternal were such an one as
          thou art, O man, he might be pleased with thy painted windows. But
          what a child's toy must coloured glass be to God! I can sit and gaze
          upon a cathedral with all its magnificence of architecture, and think
          what a wonderful exhibition of human skill; but what must that be to
          God, who piles the heavens, who digs the foundation of the deep, who
          leads Arcturus with his sons? Why, it must be to him the veriest
          trifle, a mere heap of stones. I delight to hear the swell of organs,
          the harmony of sweet voices, the Gregorian chant, but what is this
          artistic sound to him more than sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal?
          As a sight, I admire the choristers and priests, and the whole show of
          a grand ceremonial; but do you believe that God is imposed upon by
          those frocks and gowns of white, and blue, and scarlet, and fine
          linen? It seems to me as if such a notion brings down God to the level
          of a silly woman who is fond of finery. The infinite God, who spreads
          out the heavens and scatters stars with both his hands, whom heaven
          and earth cannot contain, to whom space is but a speck, and time is as
          nothing, do you think that he dwelleth in temples made with hands,
          that is to say, of man's building? And is he to be worshipped with
          your organs, and your roodscreens, and your gaudy millinery? He
          laugheth at them, he treadeth on them as being less than nothing and
          vanity. Spiritual worship is what he regardeth, because he is a
          Spirit. My brethren, if you could get together a procession of worlds,
          if you could make the stars walk along the streets of some great new
          Jerusalem, dressed in their brightest array; if instead of the songs
          of a few boys or men you could catch the sonnets of eternal ages; if
          instead of a few men to officiate as priests you could enlist time,
          eternity, heaven and earth to be the priesthood, yet all this would be
          to him but as a company of grasshoppers, and he would take up the
          whole as a very little thing. But let me tell you that even God
          himself, great as he is, does not despise the tear that drops from a
          repentant eye, nor does he neglect the sigh that comes from a sinner's
          soul. He thinks more of your repentance than of your incense, and more
          of your prayers than of your priesthoods. He views with pleasure your
          love and your faith, for these are spiritual things in which he can
          take delight; but your architecture, your music and your fine arts,
          though they lavish their treasures at his feet, are less than nothing
          and vanity. Ye know not what spirit ye are of. If ye think to worship
          my God with all these inventions of man, ye dream like fools. I feel
          glowing within me the old iconoclastic spirit. Would God we had men
          now like Knox or Luther, who with holy indignation would pull in
          pieces those wicked mockeries of the Most High, against which our soul
          feels a hallowed indignation as we think of his loftiness, and of that
          poor paltry stuff with which men degrade his name.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. WHAT THEN? What is the practical drift of this? Why two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is, my dear brothers and sisters, I mean you who have
          learned to worship God in spirit and in truth, who have got above the
          beggarly elements of the outward, and can worship him in spirit and in
          truth, what then? Why, in the first place, let us be particularly
          jealous of anything which looks at all like going back to
          ceremonialism. As a matter of taste I have a great liking for noble
          architecture. Many an hour have I lingered in the ruins of some
          splendid abbey or our own majestic buildings still used for sacred
          worship. I have a great delight in a well-painted window. I cannot say
          that I like most Dissenting painted windows, because they look to me
          as if they were a sort of would be if you could. I cannot say I have
          any kind of liking for most of our Dissenting Gothic, for it seems to
          me such a paltry thing to build a front just like St. Paul's or
          Westminster Abbey, and then as if to cheat the Lord to make the back
          part shabby. I cannot say I care for that kind of thing. But a really
          splendid place of worship I admire, as a matter of taste. I like an
          organ very well, as a matter of musical taste. But, my brethren, I
          feel that these are times when we must stand out even against
          allowable things, lest going one step we should go another. I do pray
          you therefore if you have any influence anywhere always use it in
          favor of simplicity, and if you see at any time in the churches of
          which you are the members a tendency to creep on to something a little
          nearer, a little towards the way of Rome, cry "Halt!" Let us rather go
          back to the barns in which our fathers worshipped, or better still to
          the hill side, and to the green sward than go forward to anything like
          symbolism, which will tempt the soul away from spiritual worship. We
          ought ourselves to guard against falling into formalism by means of
          simplicity, for we may do it the one way as well as the other, by
          laying it down as a rule that a service must begin with prayer or
          begin with singing, that the preacher must preach at such a time in
          the service, that the service must commence, continue, and conclude in
          some fixed fashion; that seems to me to have a tendency to breed
          another form of ritualism inconsistent with worshipping God in spirit
          and in truth. I am afraid I have hardly grace enough to worship God by
          two or three hours together in silence as our Quaker friends do. I do
          enjoy a quarter of an hour's silence every now and then; to sit quite
          still seems to me to be an admirable way of getting into contact with
          God. Our service is so much words, words, words, that I am almost
          afraid you get to think as much of words as other people do of
          banners, and flags, and so on. Now, to sit still, to get might away
          from words, if so your heart keeps to God, is better even than
          preaching and singing. Juan De Yaldes, a Catholic, but a good
          Protestant for all that, remarks that the vulgar in seeking to
          remember Christ by the crucifix do not exercise their mind but stop at
          the crucifix, and therefore that which was intended to be a help
          becomes a hindrance; so the learned get their bibles which should help
          them to think upon divine things, but being content with having read
          the letter of Scripture they often fail to reach the spiritual truth
          which it containeth, and so after all do not worship God. Remember
          that while we should be jealous of anything which would make it easy
          to be formal of worship which might be adopted, yet we may still after
          all have missed the main thing, the worshipping of God in spirit and
          in truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us make it a matter of heart-searching as to whether we ourselves
          have been in the habit of worshipping the Father in spirit and in
          truth. Dear friends, I am jealous of some of you that you do not do
          this. If the preacher happens to be away you do not feel in so good a
          frame; somebody else takes my place, and there are certain feeble folk
          among you who feel as if the sabbath had lost its enjoyment. But God
          is here, and you might worship God as much surely without me as with
          me; and though the instruction received from one man may not seem so
          edifying as that which may come from another, and possibly may not be
          so, yet still if your object be the worship of God, which should be
          the main object of our gathering, surely you should do that as well
          under the ministry of Mr. A. as Mr. B. I am afraid too that many of
          you are content with singing through the hymn; now all that singing
          which is not thought-singing is of no use; you may have very sweet
          voices but God does not regard your voice, he hears your heart, and if
          your heart does not sing you have not sung at all. When we stand up to
          pray it may be that the preacher's words may happen to be suitable to
          your case, but it is not prayer so far as you are concerned, though it
          may be as far as he is, unless you join in it. Recollect that if you
          do not put your hearts into the worship of God, you might for that
          matter as well be at home as here; you are better here than at home
          for other reasons, because you are in the way where good may come to
          you; but for worship's sake you might as well have been in bed as
          here. You who have no spiritual worship may even clog the devotions of
          those who have; an invisible savor of death unto death may be stealing
          from you, helping to pollute or to render dead the worship of those
          who truly adore God. At any rate, my dear hearers, if you have not
          with your whole hearts loved and worshipped God, repent over it, and
          pray the Holy Ghost to make you spiritual. Go to Christ's cross, and
          trust in him; then, and not till then, will you be capable of adoring
          the most High God in a style in which he can accept your worship. God
          grant that this may be impressed upon the hearts of all of us, that we
          may worship God in spirit and in truth.
