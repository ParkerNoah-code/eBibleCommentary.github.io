</b></font>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">TITLE. A Song of Degrees. A joyful song indeed: let all 
    pilgrims to the New Jerusalem sing it often. The degrees or ascents are very 
    visible; the theme ascends step by step from "afflictions" to a "crown", 
    from "remember David", to, "I will make the horn of David to bud." The 
    latter half is like the over-arching sky bending above "the fields of the 
    woods" which are found in the resolves and prayers of the former portion.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">DIVISION. Our translators have rightly divided this 
    Psalm. It contains:<br/>
    a statement of David's anxious care to build a house for 
    the Lord (verses 1-7); <br/>
    a prayer at the removal of the Ark (verses 8-10); <br/>
    and a pleading of the divine covenant and its promises (verses 11-18).<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">EXPOSITION</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 1. LORD, remember David and all his afflictions.
    </b>With David the <i>covenant</i> was made, and therefore his name is pleaded on 
    behalf of his descendants, and the people who would be blessed by his 
    dynasty. Jehovah, who changes not, will never forget one of his servants, or 
    fail to keep his covenant; yet for this thing he is to be entreated. That 
    which we are assured the Lord will do must, nevertheless, be made a matter 
    of prayer. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The request is that the Lord would <i>remember</i>, and this is a word 
    full of meaning. We know that the Lord remembered <i>Noah</i>, and assuaged the 
    flood; he remembered <i>Abraham</i>, and sent Lot out of Sodom; he remembered 
    <i>Rachel</i>, and <i>Hannah</i>, and gave them children; he remembered his mercy to the 
    house of <i>Israel</i>, and delivered his people. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">That is a choice song wherein we 
    sing, "He remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endures for ever"; 
    and this is a notable prayer, "Lord remember <i>me</i>." </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The plea is urged with God 
    that he would bless the family of David for the sake of their progenitor; 
    how much stronger is our master argument in prayer that God would deal well 
    with us for <i>Jesus' </i>sake! <i>David</i> had no personal merit; the plea is based upon 
    the covenant graciously made with him: but <i>Jesus</i> has deserts which are his 
    own, and of boundless merits these we may urge without hesitation. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">When the 
    Lord was angry with the reigning prince, the people cried, "Lord remember 
    David"; and when they needed any special blessing, again they sang, "Lord, 
    remember David." This was good pleading, but it was not so good as ours, 
    which runs on this wise, "Lord, remember <i>Jesus</i>, and all his afflictions."</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The afflictions of David here meant were those which came 
    upon him as a godly man. His endeavors to maintain the worship of Jehovah, 
    and to provide for its decent and suitable celebration. There was always an 
    ungodly party in the nation, and these people were never slow to slander, 
    hinder, and molest the servant of the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Whatever were David's faults, he 
    kept true to the one, only, living, and true God; and for this he was <i>a 
    speckled bird</i> among monarchs. Since he zealously delighted in the worship of 
    Jehovah, his God, he was despised and ridiculed by those who could not 
    understand his enthusiasm. <i>God will never forget what his people suffer for 
    his sake.</i> </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">No doubt innumerable blessings descend upon families and nations 
    through the godly lives and patient sufferings of the saints. We cannot be 
    saved by the merits of others, but beyond all question <i>we are benefitted by 
    their virtues</i>. Paul says, "God is not unrighteous to forget your work and 
    labor of love, which you have showed toward his name." Under the New 
    Testament dispensation, as well as under the Old, there is a full reward for 
    the righteous. That reward frequently comes upon their <i>descendants</i> rather 
    than upon themselves: they sow, and their successors reap. We may at this 
    day pray—Lord, remember the martyrs and confessors of our race, who suffered 
    for your name's sake, and bless our people and nation with gospel grace for 
    our fathers' sakes.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 2. How he swore unto the Lord, and vowed unto 
    the mighty God of Jacob.</b> Moved by intense devotion, David expressed his 
    resolve in the form of a solemn vow, which was sealed with an oath. The 
    fewer of such vows the better, under a dispensation whose great 
    Representative has said, "swear not at all." Perhaps even in this case it 
    had been wiser to have left the pious resolve in the hands of God in the 
    form of a prayer; for the vow was not actually fulfilled as intended, since 
    the Lord forbade David to build him a temple. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">We had better not swear to do 
    anything before we know the Lord's mind about it, and then we shall not need 
    to swear. The instance of David's vows shows that vows are <i>allowable</i>, but it 
    does not prove that they are <i>desirable</i>. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Probably David went too far in his 
    words, and it is well that the Lord did not hold him to the letter of his 
    bond, but accepted the will for the deed, and the meaning of his promise 
    instead of the literal sense of it. David imitated Jacob, that great maker 
    of vows at Bethel, and upon him rested the blessing pronounced on Jacob by 
    Isaac, "God Almighty bless you" (Genesis 28:3), which was remembered by the 
    patriarch on his death bed, when he spoke of "the mighty God of Jacob." </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">God 
    is mighty to <i>hear</i> us, and to <i>help</i> us in performing our vow. We should be 
    full of awe at the idea of making any promise to the Mighty God: to dare to 
    trifle with him would be grievous indeed. It is observable that affliction 
    led both David and Jacob into covenant dealings with the Lord: many vows are 
    made in anguish of soul. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">We may also remark that, if the votive obligations 
    of David are to be remembered of the Lord, much more are the suretyship 
    engagements of the Lord Jesus before the mind of the great Lord, to whom our 
    soul turns in the hour of our distress. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Note, upon this verse, that Jehovah 
    was the <i>God of Jacob</i>, the same God evermore; that he had this for his 
    attribute, that he is mighty—mighty to support his <i>Jacobs</i> who put their 
    trust in him, though their afflictions be many. He is, moreover, specially 
    <i>the Mighty One of his people</i>; he is the God of Jacob in a sense in which he 
    is not the God of unbelievers. So here we have three points concerning our 
    God:<br/>
<i>name</i>, Jehovah; <br/>
<i>attribute</i>, mighty; <br/>
<i>special</i> <i>relationship</i>, "mighty God of 
    Jacob." <br/>
    He it is who is asked to remember David and his trials, and there is 
    a plea for that blessing in each one of the three points.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of 
    my house, nor go up into my bed. </b>Our translators give the meaning, 
    though not the literal form, of David's vow, which ran thus, "If I go", "If 
    I go up", etc. This was an elliptical form of <i>imprecation</i>, implying more 
    than it expressed, and having therefore about it a mystery which made it all 
    the more solemn. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">David would not take his ease in his house, nor his rest in 
    his bed, until he had determined upon a place for the worship of Jehovah. 
    The <i>ark</i> had been neglected, the <i>Tabernacle</i> had fallen into disrespect. 
    He 
    would find the ark, and build for it a suitable house; he felt that he could 
    not take pleasure in his own palace until this was done. David meant well, 
    but he spoke more than he could carry out. His language was hyperbolic, 
    and the Lord knew what he meant: zeal does not always measure its terms, for 
    it is not thoughtful of the criticisms of men, but is carried away with love 
    to the Lord, who reads the <i>hearts</i> of his people. David would not think 
    himself housed until he had built a house for the Lord, nor would he reckon 
    himself rested until he had said, "Arise, O Lord, into your rest!" </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Alas, we 
    have many around us who will never carry their care for the Lord's worship 
    too far! No fear of their being indiscreet. They are housed and bedded, and 
    as for the Lord, his people may meet in a barn, or never meet at all; it 
    will be all the same to them. Observe that <i>Jacob</i> in his vow spoke of the 
    stone being God's house, and <i>David's</i> vow also deals with a house for God.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 4. I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber 
    to my eyelids. </b>He could not enjoy sleep until he had done his best to 
    provide a place for the ark. It is a strong expression, and it is not to be 
    coolly discussed by us. Remember that the man was all on fire, and he was 
    writing poetry also, and therefore his language is not that which we should 
    employ in cold blood. Everybody can see what he means, and how intensely he 
    means it. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Oh, how many are seized with sleeplessness because the 
    house of the Lord lies waste. They can slumber fast enough, and not even 
    disturb themselves with a dream, though the cause of God should be brought 
    to the lowest ebb by their covetousness. What is to become of those who have 
    no care about divine things, and never give a thought to the claims of their 
    God?</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 5. Until I find out a place for the Lord, a 
    habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</b> He resolved to find a place 
    where Jehovah would allow his worship to be celebrated, a house where God 
    would fix the symbol of his presence, and commune with his people. At that 
    time, in all David's land, there was no proper place for that ark whereon 
    the Lord had placed the mercy seat, where prayer could be offered, and where 
    the manifested glory shone forth. All things had fallen into decay, and the 
    outward forms of public worship were too much disregarded; hence the King 
    resolves to be first and foremost in establishing a better order of things. 
    </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Yet one cannot help remembering that the holy resolve of David gave to a 
    <i>place</i> and a <i>house</i> much more importance than the Lord himself 
    ever attached to such matters. This is indicated in Nathan's message from 
    the Lord to the king, "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the
    <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">LORD</span> says: Are you the one to 
    build me a house to dwell in? I have not dwelt in a house from the day I 
    brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from 
    place to place with a tent as my dwelling. Wherever I have moved with all 
    the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to 
    shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"' </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Stephen in his inspired 
    speech puts the matter plainly: "Solomon built him an house. Howbeit the 
    Most High dwells not in temples made with hands." It is a striking fact that 
    true religion never flourished more in Israel than <i>before</i> the temple was 
    built; and that from the day of the erection of that magnificent house the 
    spirit of godliness declined. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Godly men may have on their hearts matters 
    which seem to them of chief importance, and it may be acceptable with God 
    that they should seek to carry them out; and yet in his infinite wisdom he 
    may judge it best to prevent their executing their designs. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">God does not 
    measure his people's actions by their wisdom, or lack of wisdom, but by the 
    sincere desire for his glory which has led up to them. David's resolution, 
    though he was not allowed to fulfill it, brought a blessing upon him: the 
    Lord promised to build the house of David, because he had desired to build 
    the house of the Lord. Moreover, the King was allowed to prepare the 
    <i>treasure</i> for the erection of the glorious edifice which was built by his son 
    and successor. The Lord shows the acceptance of what we desire to do, by 
    permitting us to do something else which his infinite mind judges to be 
    fitter for us, and more honorable to himself.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 6. Meanwhile, where was the habitation of God 
    among men? </b>God was accustomed to shine forth from between the cherubim, 
    but where was the ark? It was like a hidden thing, a stranger in its own 
    land. Rumors came that it was somewhere in 
    the land of Ephraim, in a temporary lodging; rather an object of dread than 
    of delight. Is it not astonishing that so renowned a symbol of the presence of 
    the Lord should be lingering in neglect—a neglect so great that it was 
    remarkable that we should have heard of its whereabouts at all? </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">When a man 
    begins to think upon God and his service it is comforting that the gospel is 
    heard of. Considering the opposition which it has encountered, it is 
    marvelous that it should be heard of, and heard of in a place remote from 
    the central city; but yet we are sorrowful that it is only in connection 
    with some poor despised place that we do hear of it. What is Ephratah? Who at 
    this time knows where it was? How could the ark have remained there so long?</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">David instituted a search for the ark. It had to be 
    hunted for high and low; and at last at Kirjath-jearim, the forest city, he 
    came upon it. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>How often do souls find Christ and his salvation in out of the 
    way places!</i> What matters where we meet with him, so long as we do behold him, 
    and find life in him? That is a blessed <i>Eureka</i> which is embedded in our 
    text, <i>"We found it!"</i> The matter began with hearing, led on to a search, and 
    concluded in a joyful find. "We found it in the fields of the wood." </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Alas 
    that there should be no room for the Lord in the palaces of kings, so that 
    he must needs take to the woods. If Christ be in forest he will yet be found 
    of those who seek for him. He is as near in the rustic home, embowered among 
    the trees, as in the open streets of the city. Yes, he will answer prayer 
    offered from the heart of the black forest where the lone traveler seems out 
    of all hope of hearing.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The text presents us with an instance of one 
    whose heart was set upon finding the place where God would meet with him; 
    this made him quick of hearing, and so the cheering news soon reached him. 
    The tidings renewed his ardor, and led him to stick at no difficulties in 
    his search; and so it came to pass that, where he could hardly have expected 
    it, he lighted upon the treasure which he so much prized!</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 7. We will go into his tabernacles. </b>Having 
    found the place where he dwells, we will hasten thereto. He has many 
    dwellings in one in the various courts of his house, and each of these shall 
    receive the reverence due: in each the priest shall offer for us the 
    appointed service; and our <i>hearts</i> shall go where our <i>bodies</i> may not enter. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">David is not alone, he is represented as having sought for the ark with 
    others, for so the word "we" implies; and now they are glad to attend him in 
    his pilgrimage to the chosen shrine, saying, "We found it, we will go!" 
    Because these are the Lord's courts we will resort to them. We will worship 
    at his footstool. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The best ordered earthly house can be no more than the 
    footstool of so great a King. His ark can only reveal the glories of his 
    feet, according to his promise that he will make the place of his feet 
    glorious: yet thither will we hasten with joy, in glad companionship, and 
    there will we adorn him. Where Jehovah is, there shall he be worshiped. It 
    is well not only to go to the Lord's house, but to <i>worship</i> there. We do but 
    profane his tabernacles if we enter them for any other purpose. Before 
    leaving this verse let us note the <i>ascent</i> of this Psalm of degrees, "We 
    <i>heard</i>...we <i>found</i>...we will <i>go</i>...we will <i>worship</i>."</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 11.</b> Here we come to a grand covenant 
    pleading of the kind which is always prevalent with the Lord. <b>The LORD 
    has sworn in truth unto David. </b>We cannot urge anything with God which 
    is equal to his own word and oath. Jehovah swears that our faith may have 
    strong confidence in it: he cannot forswear himself. He swears in truth, for 
    he means every word that he utters; men may be perjured, but none will be so 
    profane as to imagine this of the God of truth. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">By Nathan this covenant of 
    Jehovah was conveyed to David, and there was no delusion in it. He will not 
    turn from it. Jehovah is not a changeable being. He never turns from his 
    purpose, much less from his promise solemnly ratified by oath. He turns 
    never. He is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should 
    repent. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>What a rock they stand upon who have an immutable oath of God for 
    their foundation!</i> We know that this covenant was really made with Christ, 
    the spiritual seed of David, for Peter quotes it at Pentecost, saying, "Men 
    and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he 
    is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day. 
    Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to 
    him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise 
    up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before, spoke of the 
    resurrection of Christ." </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Christ therefore sits on a sure throne forever and 
    ever, seeing that he has kept the covenant, and through him the blessing 
    comes upon Zion, whose poor are blessed in him. <i>Of the fruit of your body 
    will I set upon your throne.</i> Jesus sprang from the race of David, as the 
    evangelists are careful to record; he was "of the house and lineage of 
    David": at this day he is the King of the Jews, and the Lord has also given 
    him the heathen for his inheritance. <i>He must reign, and of his kingdom there 
    shall be no end.</i> God himself has set him on the throne, and no rebellion of 
    men or devils can shake his dominion. The honor of Jehovah is concerned in 
    his reign, and therefore it is never in danger; for the Lord will not allow 
    his oath to be dishonored.</p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>Verse 12. If your children will keep my covenant and 
    my testimony that I shall teach them.</b> There is a <i>condition</i> to the 
    covenant so far as it concerned kings of David's line before the coming of 
    the true Seed; but he has fulfilled that condition, and made the covenant 
    indefeasible henceforth and forever as to himself and the spiritual seed in 
    him. Considered as it related to <i>temporal</i> things, it was no small blessing 
    for David's dynasty to be secured the throne upon good behavior. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">These monarchs held their crowns from God upon the terms 
    of loyalty to their superior Sovereign, the Lord who had elevated them to 
    their high position. They were to be faithful to the covenant by <i>
    obedience to the divine law, </i>and<i> by belief of divine truth</i>, they were to accept 
    Jehovah as their Lord and their Teacher, regarding him in both relations as 
    in covenant with them. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">What a condescension on God's part to be their teacher! 
    How gladly ought they to render intelligent obedience! What a proper, 
    righteous, and needful stipulation for God to make that they should be true 
    to him when the reward was the promise: Their children shall also sit upon 
    your throne for evermore. <i>If they will sit at his feet, God will make them 
    sit on a throne; if they will keep the covenant, they shall keep the crown 
    from generation to generation.</i></p>

<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The kingdom of Judah might have stood to this day had its 
    kings been faithful to the Lord. No internal revolt or external attack could 
    have overthrown the royal house of David: it fell by its own sin, and by 
    nothing else. The Lord was continually provoked, but he was amazingly long-suffering, for long after seceding 
    <i>Israel</i> had gone into captivity, <i>Judah</i> 
    still remained. Miracles of mercy were shown to her. Divine patience 
    exceeded all limits, for the Lord's regard for David was exceeding great.
    </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The princes of David's house seemed set on ruining 
    themselves, and nothing could save them; justice waited long, but it was 
    bound at last to unsheathe the sword and strike! Still, if in the <i>letter</i> 
    man's breach of promise caused the covenant to fail—yet in <i>spirit</i> and 
    essence the Lord has been true to it, for Jesus reigns, and holds the throne 
    forever! David's seed is still royal, for he was the progenitor according to 
    the flesh of him who is King of kings and Lord of lords. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">This verse shows us <i>the need of family piety</i>. Parents 
    must see to it that their children know the fear of the Lord, and they must 
    beg the Lord himself to teach them his truth. We have no hereditary right to 
    the divine favor. The Lord keeps up his friendship to families from 
    generation to generation, for he is hesitant to leave the descendants of his 
    servants, and never does so except under grievous and long continued 
    provocation. </p>
<p align="justify" dir="ltr">As believers, we are all in a measure under some such 
    covenant as that of David. Certain of us can look backward for four 
    generations of saintly ancestors, and we are now glad to look forward and to 
    see our children, and our children's children, walking in the truth. Yet we 
    know that <i>grace does not run in the blood</i>, and we are filled with holy fear 
    lest in any of our seed there should be an evil heart of unbelief in 
    departing from the living God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. For the LORD has chosen Zion.</p></b> It was no 
    more than any other Canaanite town until God chose it, David captured it, 
    Solomon built it, and the Lord dwelt in it.
<p align="justify">Just so was the <i>church</i> a mere Jebusite stronghold until 
    <i>grace</i> chose it, conquered it, rebuilt it, and dwelt in it! Jehovah has 
    chosen his people, and hence they are his people. He has chosen the church, 
    and hence it is what it is. Thus in the covenant David and Zion, Christ and 
    his people go together. </p>
<p align="justify">David is for Zion, and Zion for David: the interests of 
    Christ and his people are mutual.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">He has desired it for his habitation.</p></b> David's 
    question is answered. The Lord has spoken, the site of the temple is fixed, 
    the place of the divine manifestation is determined. Indwelling follows upon 
    election, and arises out of it. Zion is chosen, chosen for a habitation of 
    God. 
<p align="justify">The desire of God to dwell among the people whom he has 
    chosen for himself is very gracious and yet very natural: his love will not 
    rest apart from those upon whom he has placed it. <i>God desires to abide 
    with those whom he has loved with an everlasting love</i>; and we do not 
    wonder that it should be so, for we also desire the company of our beloved 
    ones. It is a double marvel, that the Lord should choose and desire such 
    poor creatures as we are. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers is 
    a wonder of grace parallel to the incarnation of the Son of God. <i>God in 
    the church is the wonder of Heaven, the miracle of eternity, the glory of 
    infinite love!</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. This is my rest forever.</p></b> Oh, glorious 
    words! It is God himself who here speaks. Think of rest for God! A Sabbath 
    for the Eternal, and a place of abiding for the Infinite. 
<p align="justify">He calls Zion <i>my rest</i>. Here his love remains and displays 
    itself with delight. "He shall rest in his love"—and this forever. He will 
    not seek another place of repose, nor grow weary of his saints. In Christ 
    the heart of Deity is filled with contentment, and for his sake he is 
    satisfied with his people, and will be so world without end. </p>
<p align="justify">These august words declare a <i>distinctive</i> choice—this and 
    no other; a <i>certain</i> choice—this which is well known to me; a <i>present</i> 
    choice—this which is here at this moment. </p>
<p align="justify">God has made his <i>election</i> of old, he has not changed it, 
    and he never will repent of it—his church was his rest and is his rest 
    still. As he will not turn from his <i>oath</i>, so he will never turn from his 
    <i>choice</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, that we may enter into his rest, may be part and 
    parcel of his church, and yield by our loving faith a delight to the mind of 
    him who takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his 
    mercy. Here will I dwell, for I have desired it. </p>
<p align="justify">Again are we filled with wonder that he who fills all 
    things should dwell in Zion—should dwell in his church. God does not 
    unwillingly visit his chosen people; he desires to dwell with them; he desires 
    them. He is already in Zion, for he says here, as one upon the spot. Not 
    only will he occasionally come to his church, but he will <i>dwell</i> in it as 
    his fixed abode. He cared not for the magnificence of Solomon's temple, but 
    he determined that at the mercy-seat he would be found by suppliants, and 
    that thence he would shine forth in brightness of grace among the favored 
    nation. </p>
<p align="justify">All this, however, was but a type of the spiritual house 
    of which Jesus is foundation and cornerstone, upon which all the<i> living 
    stones</i> are built together for a habitation of God through the Spirit. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Oh, the sweetness of the thought that God desires to 
    dwell in his people and rest among them! </p></i>Surely if it be his desire he 
    will cause it to be so. If the desire of the <i>righteous</i> shall be granted, 
    much more shall the desire of the righteous <i>God</i> be accomplished. This is the 
    joy of our souls, for surely we shall <i>rest</i> in God, and certainly our desire 
    is to <i>dwell</i> in him. This also is the end of our fears for the church of God; 
    for if the Lord dwells in her, she shall not be moved; if the Lord desires 
    her, the devil cannot destroy her.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. I will abundantly bless her provision. </p></b>It 
    must be so. How can we be without a blessing when the Lord is among us? We 
    live upon his word, we are clothed by his charity, we are armed by his 
    power—all sorts of provision are in him, and how can they be otherwise than 
    blessed? The provision is to be abundantly blessed; then it will be abundant 
    and blessed. Daily provision, royal provision, satisfying provision, 
    overflowingly joyful provision—the church shall receive. The divine blessing 
    shall cause us . . .<br/>
    to receive it with faith, <br/>
    to feed upon it by experience,<br/>
    to grow upon it by sanctification,<br/>
    to be strengthened by it to labor,<br/>
    to be cheered by it to patience, and<br/>
    to be built up by it to perfection. 
<b>
<p align="justify">I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p></b> The citizens of 
    Zion are poor in themselves, poor in spirit, and often poor in pocket, but 
    their hearts and souls shall dwell in such abundance that they shall neither 
    need more nor desire more. 
<p align="justify">Satisfaction is the crown of experience. Where God rests, 
    his people shall be satisfied. They are to be satisfied with what the Lord 
    himself calls "bread", and we may be sure that he knows what is really bread 
    for souls. He will not give us a stone. The Lord's poor shall "have food 
    convenient for them"—that which will suit their palate, remove their hunger, 
    fill their desire, build up their frame, and perfect their growth. </p>
<p align="justify">The breadth of earth is "the bread that perishes", but 
    the <i>bread of God </i>endures to life eternal. In the church where God 
    rests his people shall not starve; the Lord would never rest if they did. He 
    did not take rest for six days until he had prepared the world for the first 
    man to live in; he would not stay his hand until all things were ready; 
    therefore, we may be sure if the Lord rests it is because "it is finished", 
    and the Lord has prepared of his goodness for the poor. Where God finds his 
    desire, his people shall find theirs; if he is satisfied, they shall be. </p>
<p align="justify">Taking the two clauses together, we see that nothing but 
    an abundant blessing in the church will satisfy the Lord's poor people: they 
    are naked and miserable until that comes. All the provision that Solomon 
    himself could make would not have satisfied the saints of his day—they 
    looked higher, and longed for the Lord's own boundless blessing, and 
    hungered for the bread which came down from Heaven. Blessed be the Lord, 
    they had in this verse two of the "I wills" of God to rest upon, and nothing 
    could be a better support to their faith.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. </p></b>More is promised than was prayed for. See 
    how the ninth verse asks for the priests to be clad in righteousness, and 
    the answer is:<b> I will also clothe her priests with salvation. </b>God is 
    accustomed to do exceeding abundantly, above all that we ask or even think.
<p align="justify">Righteousness is but one feature of blessing, salvation 
    is the whole of it. What cloth of gold is this! What more than regal array! 
    Garments of salvation! We know who has woven them, who has dyed them, and 
    who has given them to his people. These are the best robes for priests and 
    preachers, for princes and people; there is none like them; give them to me.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Not every priest shall be thus clothed, but only her 
    priests, those who truly belong to Zion by faith which is in Christ Jesus 
    who has made them priests unto God. These, are clothed by the Lord himself, 
    and none can clothe as he does. It even the grass of the field is so clothed 
    by the Creator as to out do Solomon in all his glory, then how must his own 
    children be clad? Truly he shall be admired in his saints; the liveries of 
    his servants shall be the wonder of Heaven.<b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">And her saints shall shout aloud for joy. Again we 
    have a golden answer to a silver prayer. The Psalmist would have the "saints 
    shout for joy." "That they shall do", says the Lord, "and aloud too"; they 
    shall be exceedingly full of delight; their songs and shouts shall be so 
    hearty that they shall sound as the noise of many waters, and as great 
    thunders. These joyful ones are not, however, the mimic saints of 
    superstition, but her saints, saints of the Most High, "sanctified in Christ 
    Jesus." </p>
<p align="justify">These shall be so abundantly blessed and so satisfied, 
    and so appareled that they can do no otherwise than shout to show their 
    astonishment, their triumph, their gratitude, their exultation, their 
    enthusiasm, their joy in the Lord. </p>
<p align="justify">Zion has no dumb saints. The sight of God at rest among 
    his chosen ones, is enough to make the most silent shout. If the morning 
    stars sang together when the earth and heavens were made, much more will all 
    the sons of God shout for joy when the new heavens and the new earth are 
    finished, and the New Jerusalem comes down out of Heaven from God, prepared 
    as a bride for her husband. Meanwhile, even now the dwelling of the Lord 
    among us is a perennial fountain of sparkling delight to all holy minds. </p>
<p align="justify">This shouting for joy is guaranteed to Zion's holy ones: 
    God says they <i>shall </i>shout aloud, and depend upon it they will—who 
    shall stop them of this glorying? The Lord has said by his Spirit, "let them 
    shout aloud"—who is he who shall make them hold their peace? The Bridegroom 
    is with them, and shall the children of the bride chamber fast? Nay, truly, 
    we rejoice, yes and will rejoice.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 17. There will I make the horn of David to bud.</p></b> 
    In Zion David's dynasty shall develop power and glory. As the stag is made 
    noble and strong by the development of his horns, so the house of David 
    shall advance from strength to strength. This was to be by the work of the 
    Lord, "there will <i>I</i> make", and therefore it would be sure and solid 
    growth. When God makes us to bud none can cause us to fade. 
<p align="justify">When David's descendants left the Lord and the worship of 
    his house, they declined in all respects, for it was only through the Lord, 
    and in connection with his worship that their horn would bud. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</p></b> David's name 
    was to be illustrious, and brilliant as a lamp; it was to continue shining 
    like a lamp in the sanctuary; it was thus to be a comfort to the people, and 
    an enlightenment to the nations. God would not allow the light of David to 
    go out by the extinction of his race—his holy ordinances had decreed that 
    the house of his servant should remain in the midst of Israel. 
<p align="justify">What a lamp is our Lord Jesus! A light to enlighten the 
    Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel. As the anointed—the true 
    Christ, he shall be the light of Heaven itself. Oh for grace to receive our 
    illumination and our consolation from Jesus Christ alone.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 18. His enemies will I clothe with shame.</p></b> They 
    shall be utterly defeated, they shall loathe their evil design, they shall 
    be despised for having hated the Ever Blessed One. Their shame they will be 
    unable to hide, it shall cover them. God will array them in it forever, and 
    it shall be their convict dress to all eternity. 
<b>
<p align="justify">But upon himself shall his crown flourish. </p></b>Green 
    shall be his laurels of victory. He shall win and wear the crown of honor, 
    and his inherited diadem shall increase in splendor. Is it not so to this 
    hour with Jesus? His kingdom cannot fail, his imperial glories cannot fade. 
    It is himself that we delight to honor; it is to himself that the honor 
    comes, and upon himself that it flourishes. If others snatch at his crown 
    their traitorous aims are defeated; but he in his own person reigns with 
    ever growing splendor.
