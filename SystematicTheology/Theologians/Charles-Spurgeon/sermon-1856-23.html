        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.77)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, May 4, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? -- Matthew
          20:15.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE householder says, "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
          mine own?" and even so does the God of heaven and earth ask this
          question of you this morning. "Is it not lawful for me to do what I
          will with mine own?" There is no attribute of God more comforting to
          his children than the doctrine of Divine Sovereignty. Under the most
          adverse circumstances, in the most severe troubles, they believe that
          Sovereignty hath ordained their afflictions, that Sovereignty
          overrules them, and that Sovereignty will sanctify them all. There is
          nothing for which the children of God ought more earnestly to contend
          than the dominion of their Master over all creation -- the kingship of
          God over all the works of his own hands -- the throne of God, and his
          right to sit upon that throne. On the other hand, there is no doctrine
          more hated by worldlings, no truth of which they have made such a
          foot-ball, as the great, stupendous, but yet most certain doctrine of
          the Sovereignty of the infinite Jehovah. Men will allow God to be
          everywhere except on his throne. They will allow him to be in his
          workshop to fashion worlds and to make stars. They will allow him to
          be in his almonry to dispense his alms and bestow his bounties. They
          will allow him to sustain the earth and bear up the pillars thereof,
          or light the lamps of heaven, or rule the waves of the ever-moving
          ocean; but when God ascends his throne, his creatures then gnash their
          teeth; and when we proclaim an enthroned God, and his right to do as
          he wills with his own, to dispose of his creatures as he thinks well,
          without consulting them in the matter, then it is that we are hissed
          and execrated, and then it is that men turn a deaf ear to us, for God
          on his throne is not the God they love. They love him anywhere better
          than they do when he sits with his sceptre in his hand and his crown
          upon his head. But it is God upon the throne that we love to preach.
          It is God upon his throne whom we trust. It is God upon his throne of
          whom we have been singing this morning; and it is God upon his throne
          of whom we shall speak in this discourse. I shall dwell only, however,
          upon one portion of God's Sovereignty, and that is God's Sovereignty
          in the distribution of his gifts. In this respect I believe he has a
          right to do as he wills with his own, and that he exercises that
          right.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must assume, before we commence our discourse, one thing certain,
          namely, that all blessings are gifts and that we have no claim to them
          by our own merit. This I think every considerate mind will grant. And
          this being admitted, we shall endeavour to show that he has a right,
          seeing they are his own to do what he wills with them -- to withhold
          them wholly is he pleaseth -- to distribute them all if he chooseth --
          to give to some and not to others -- to give to none or to give to
          all, just as seemeth good in his sight. "Is it not lawful for me to do
          what I will with mine own?"
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall divide God's gifts into five classes. First, we shall have
          gifts temporal; second, gifts saving; third gifts honourable; fourth,
          gifts useful; and fifth, gifts comfortable. Of all these we shall say,
          "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place then, we notice GIFTS TEMPORAL. It is an
          indisputable fact that God hath not, in temporal matters, given to
          every man alike; that he hath not distributed to all his creatures the
          same amount of happiness or the same standing in creation. There is a
          difference. Mark what a difference there is in men personally (for we
          shall consider men chiefly); one is born like Saul, a head and
          shoulders taller than the rest -- another shall live all his life a
          Zaccheus -- a man short of stature. One has a muscular frame and a
          share of beauty -- another is weak, and far from having anything
          styled, comeliness. How many do we find whose eyes have never rejoiced
          in the sunlight, whose ears have never listened to the charms of
          music, and whose lips have never been moved to sounds intelligible or
          harmonious. Walk through the earth and you will find men superior to
          yourself in vigour, health, and fashion, and others who are your
          inferiors in the very same respects. Some here are preferred far above
          their fellows in their outward appearance, and some sink low in the
          scale and have nothing about them that can make them glory in the
          flesh. Why hath God given to one man beauty and to another none? to
          one all his senses, and to another but a portion? why, in some, hath
          he quickened the sense of apprehension, while others are obliged to
          bear about them a dull and stubborn body? We reply, let men say what
          they will, but no answer can be given except this, "Even so, Father,
          for so it seemed good in thy sight." The old Pharisees asked, "Did
          this man sin or his parents, that he was born blind?" We know that
          there was neither sin in parents nor child, that he was born blind, or
          that others have suffered similar distresses, but that God has done as
          it has pleased him in the distribution of his earthly benefits, and
          thus hath said to the world, "Is it not lawful for me to do what I
          will with mine own?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Mark also, in the distribution of mental gifts, what a difference
          exists. All men are not like Socrates; there are but few Platos; we
          can discover but here and there a Bacon; we shall but every now and
          then converse with a Sir Isaac Newton. Some have stupendous intellects
          wherewith they can unravel secrets -- fathom the depths of oceans --
          measure mountains -- dissect the sunbeams, and weigh the stars. Other
          have but shallow minds. You may educate and educate, but can never
          make them great. You cannot improve what is not there. They have not
          genius, and you cannot impart it. Anybody may see that there is an
          inherent difference in men from their very birth. Some, with a little
          education do surpass those who have been elaborately trained. There
          are two boys, educated it may be in the same school, by the same
          master, and they shall apply themselves to their studies with the same
          diligence, but yet one shall far outstrip his fellow. Why is this?
          Because God hath asserted his sovereignty over the intellect as well
          as the body. God hath not made us all alike, but diversified his
          gifts. One man is as eloquent as Whitfield; another stammers if he but
          speaks three words of his mother tongue. What makes these various
          differences between man and man? We answer, we must refer it all to
          the Sovereignty of God, who does as he wills with his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, again, what are the differences of men's conditions in this
          world. Mighty minds are from time to time discovered in men whose
          limbs are wearing the chains of slavery, and whose backs are laid bare
          to the whip -- they have black skins, but are in mind vastly superior
          to their brutal masters. So, too, in England; we find wise men often
          poor, and rich men not seldom ignorant and vain. One comes into the
          world to be arrayed at once in the imperial purple -- another shall
          never wear aught but the humble garb of a peasant. One has a palace to
          dwell in and a bed of down for his repose, while another finds but a
          hard resting-place, and shall never have a more sumptuous covering
          than the thatch of his own cottage. If we ask the reason for this, the
          reply still is, "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
          So, in other ways you will observe in passing through life how
          sovereignty displays itself. To one man God giveth a long life and
          uniform health, so that he scarcely knows what it is to have day's
          sickness, while another totters through the world and finds a grave at
          almost every step, feeling a thousand deaths in fearing one. One man,
          even in extreme old age, like Moses, has his eye undimmed; and though
          his hair is grey, he stands as firmly on his feet as when a young man
          in his father's house. Whence, again, we ask is the difference? And
          the only adequate answer is, it is the effect of Jehovah's
          Sovereignty. You find, too, that some men are cut off in the prime of
          their life -- the very midst of their days -- while others live beyond
          their threescore years and ten. One departs before he has reached the
          first stage of existence, and another has his life lengthened out
          until it becomes quite a burden; we must, I conceive, necessarily
          trace the cause of all these differences in life to the fact of God's
          Sovereignty. He is Rule and King, and shall he not do as he wills with
          his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pass from this point -- but before we do so we must stop to improve
          it just a moment. O thou who art gifted with a noble frame, a comely
          body, boast not thyself therein, for thy gifts come from God. O glory
          not, for if thou gloriest thou becomest uncomely in a moment. The
          flowers boast not of their beauty; be exalted ye sons of comeliness;
          and O ye men of might and intellect, remember, that all you have is
          bestowed by a Sovereign Lord; he did create; he can destroy. There are
          not many steps between the mightiest intellect and the helpless idiot
          -- deep though verges on insanity. Thy brain may at any moment, be
          smitten, and thou be doomed henceforth to live a madman. Boast not
          thyself of all that thou knowest, for even the little knowledge thou
          hast has been given thee. Therefore, I say, exalt not thyself above
          measure, but use for God what God has given thee, for it is a royal
          gift, and thou shouldst not lay it aside. But if the Sovereign Lord
          has given thee one talent, and no more, lay it not up in a napkin, but
          use it well, and then it may be that he will give thee more. Bless God
          that thou hast more than others, and thank him also that he has given
          thee less than others, for thou hast less to carry on thy shoulders;
          and the lighter thy burden the less cause wilt thou have to groan as
          thou travellest on towards the better land. Bless God then if thou
          possessest less than thy fellows, and see his goodness in withholding
          as well as in giving.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. So far most men probably have gone with us; but when we come to
          the second point, GIFTS SAVING, there will a large number who will go
          from us because they cannot receive our doctrine. When we apply this
          truth regarding the Divine Sovereignty to man's salvation, then we
          find men standing up to defend their poor fellow creatures whom they
          conceive to be injured by God's predestination. But I never heard of
          men standing up for the devil; and yet I think if any of God's
          creature have a right to complain of his dealings it is the fallen
          angels. For their sin they were hurled from heaven at once, and we
          read not that any message of mercy was ever sent to them. Once cast
          out, their doom was sealed; while men were respited, redemption sent
          into their world, and a large number of them chosen to eternal life.
          Why not quarrel with Sovereignty in the one case as well as the other.
          We say that God has elected a people out of the human race, and his
          right to do this is denied. But I ask, why not equally dispute the
          fact that God has chosen men and not fallen angels, or his justice in
          such a choice. If salvation be a matter of right, surely the angels
          had as much claim to mercy as men. Were they not seated in more than
          equal dignity? Did they sin more? We think not. Adam's sin was so
          wilful and complete, that we cannot suppose a greater sin than that
          which he committed. Would not the angels who were thrust out of heaven
          have been of greater service to their Maker if restored, than we can
          ever be? Had we been the judges in this matter we might have given
          deliverance to angels but not to men. Admire then, Divine Sovereignty
          and love, that whereas the angels were broken into shivers, God hath
          raised an elect number of the race of men to set them among princes,
          through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note again, the Divine Sovereignty, in what God chose the Israelitish
          race and left the Gentiles for years in darkness. Why was Israel
          instructed and saved, while Syria was left to perish in idolatry? Was
          the once race purer in its origin and better in its character than the
          other? Did not the Israelites take unto themselves false gods a
          thousand times, and provoke the true God to anger and loathing? Why
          then, should they be favoured above their fellows? Why did the sun of
          heaven shine upon them while all around the nations were left in
          darkness, and were sinking into hell by myriads? Why? The only answer
          that can be given is this, that God is a Sovereign, and "will have
          mercy upon whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, now, also, why is it that God hath sent his word to us while a
          multitude of people are still without his word? Why do we each come up
          to God's tabernacle, Sabbath after Sabbath, privileged to listen to
          the voice of the minister of Jesus, while other nations have not been
          visited thereby? Could not God have caused the light to shine in the
          darkness there as well as here? Could not he, if he had pleased, have
          sent forth messengers swift as the light to proclaim his gospel over
          the whole earth? He could have done it if he would. Since we know that
          he has not done it, we bow in meekness, confessing his right to do as
          he wills with his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me drive the doctrine home once more. Behold how God displays
          his Sovereignty in this fact, that out of the same congregation, those
          who hear the same minister, and listen to the same truth, the one is
          taken and the other left. Why is it that one of my hearers shall sit
          in yonder pew, and her sister by her side, and yet that the effect of
          the preaching shall be different upon each? They have been nursed on
          the same knee, rocked in the same cradle, educated under the same
          auspices, they hear the same minister, with the same attention -- why
          is it that the one shall be saved and the other left? Far be it from
          us to weave any excuse for the man who is damned: we know of none: but
          also, far be it from us to take glory from God. We assert that God
          makes the difference -- that the saved sister will not have to thank
          herself but her God. There shall even be two men given to drunkenness.
          Some word spoken shall pierce one of them through, but the other shall
          sit unmoved, although they shall, in all respects, be equally the same
          both in constitution and education. What is the reason? You will
          reply, perhaps, because the one accepts and the other rejects the
          message of the gospel. But must you not come back to the questions,
          who made the one accept it, and who made the other reject it? I dare
          you to say that the man made himself to differ. You must admit in your
          conscience that it is God alone to whom this power belongs. But those
          who dislike this doctrine are nevertheless up in arms against us; and
          they say, how can God justly make such a difference between the
          members of his family? Suppose a father should have a certain number
          of children, and he should give to one all his favors, and consign the
          others to misery -- should we not say that he was a very unkind and
          cruel father? I answer, yes. But the cases are not the same. You have
          not a father to death with, but a judge. You say all men are God's
          children; I demand of you to prove that. I never read it in my Bible.
          I dare not say, "Our father which art in heaven," till I am
          regenerated. I cannot rejoice in the fatherhood of God towards me till
          I know that I am one with him, and a joint heir with Christ. I dare
          not claim the fatherhood of God as an unregenerated man. It is not
          father and child -- for the child has a claim upon its father -- but
          it is King and subject; and not even so high a relation as that, for
          there is a claim between subject and King. A creature -- a sinful
          creature, can have no claim upon God; for that would be to make
          salvation of works and not of grace. If men can merit salvation, then
          to save them is only the payment of a debt, and he gives them nothing
          more than he ought to give them. But we assert that grace must be
          distinguishing if it be grace at all. O, but some say is it not
          written that "He giveth to every man a measure of grace to profit
          withal?" If you like to repeat that wonderful quotation so often
          hurled at my head, you are very welcome, for it is no quotation from
          Scripture, unless it be an Arminian edition. The only passage at all
          like it refers to the spiritual gifts of the saints and the saints
          only. But I say, granted your supposition, that a measure of grace is
          given to every man to profit withal, yet he hath given to some a
          measure of particular grace to make that profit. For what do you mean
          by grace, which I put out, to profit? I can understand a man's
          improvement in the use of grace, but grace improved and made use of by
          the power of man I cannot comprehend. Grace is not a thing which I
          use; grace is something which uses me. But people talk of grace
          sometimes as if it was something they could use, and not as influence
          having power over them. Grace is something not which I improve, but
          which improves, employs me, works on me; and let people talk as they
          will about universal grace, it is all nonsense, there is no such
          thing, nor can there be. They may talk correctly of universal
          blessings, because we see that the natural gifts of God are scattered
          everywhere, more or less, and men may receive or reject them. It is
          not so, however, with grace. Men cannot take the grace of God and
          employ it in turning themselves from darkness to light. The light does
          not come to the darkness and say, use me; but the light comes and
          drives the darkness away. Life does not come to the dead man and say,
          use me, and be restored to life; but it comes with a power of its own
          and restores to life. The spiritual influence does not come to the dry
          bones and say, use this power and clothe yourselves with flesh; but it
          comes and clothes them with flesh, and the work is done. Grace is a
          thing which comes and exercises an influence on us.
        </p>
        <p>"The sovereign will of God alone</p>
        <p>Creates us heirs of grace;</p>
        <p>Born in the image of his Son,</p>
        <p>A new-created race."</p>
        <p>
          And we say to all of you who gnash your teeth at this doctrine,
          whether you know it or not, you have a vast deal of enmity towards God
          in your hearts; for until you can be brought to know this doctrine,
          there is something which you have not yet discovered, which makes you
          opposed to the idea of God absolute, God unbounded, God unfettered,
          God unchanging, and God having a free will, which you are so fond of
          proving that the creature possesses. I am persuaded that the
          Sovereignty of God must be held by us if we would be in a healthy
          state of mind. "Salvation is of the Lord alone." Then give all the
          glory to his holy name, to whom all glory belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We now come, in the third place, to notice the differences which
          God often makes in his Church in HONOURABLE GIFTS. There is a
          difference made between God's own children -- when they are his
          children. Note what I mean: One hath the honourable gift of knowledge,
          another knows but little. I meet, every now and then, with a dear
          Christian brother with whom I could talk for a month, and learn
          something from him every day. He has had deep experience -- he has
          seen into the deep things of God -- his whole life has been a
          perpetual study wherever he has been. He seems to have gathered
          thoughts, not from books merely, but from men, from God, from his own
          heart. He knows all the intricacies and windings of Christian
          experience: he understands the heights, the depths, the lengths, and
          the breadths of the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. He has
          gained a grand idea, an intimate knowledge of the system of grace, and
          can vindicate the dealings of the Lord with his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you must meet with another who has passed through many troubles,
          but he has no deep acquaintance with Christian experience. He never
          learned a single secret by all his troubles. He just floundered out of
          one trouble into another, but never stopped to pick up any of the
          jewels that lay in the mire -- never tried to discover the precious
          jewels that lay in his afflictions. He knows very little more of the
          heights and depths of the Saviour's love than when he first came into
          the world. You may converse with such a man as long as you like, but
          you will get nothing from him. If you ask why is it, I answer, there
          is a Sovereignty of God in giving knowledge to some and not to others.
          I was walking the other day with an aged Christian, who told me how he
          had profited by my ministry. There is nothing humbles me like that
          thought of yon old man deriving experience in the things of God,
          receiving instruction in the ways of the Lord from a mere babe in
          grace. But I expect that when I am an old man, if I should live to be
          such, that some babe in grace will instruct me. God sometimes shutteth
          the mouth of the old man and openeth the mouth of the child. Why
          should we be a teacher to hundreds who are, in some respects, far more
          able to teach us? The only answer we can find is in the Divine
          Sovereignty, and we must bow before it, for has he not a right to do
          as he wills with his own? Instead of being envious of those who have
          the gift of knowledge, we should seek to gain the same, if possible.
          Instead of sitting down and murmuring that we have not more knowledge,
          we should remember that the foot cannot say to the head, nor the head
          to the foot, I have no need of thee, for God hath given us talents as
          it hath pleased him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note, again, when speaking of honourable gifts. Not only knowledge,
          but office is an honourable gift. There is nothing more honourable to
          a man than the office of a deacon or a minister. We magnify our
          office, though we would not magnify ourselves. We hold there is
          nothing can dignify a man more than being appointed to an office in a
          Christian church. I would rather be a deacon of a church than Lord
          Mayor of London. To be a minister of Christ is in my estimation an
          infinitely higher honour than the world can bestow. My pulpit is to me
          more desirable than a throne, and my congregation is an empire more
          than large enough; an empire before which the empires of the earth
          dwindle into nothing in everlasting importance. Why does God give to
          one man a special call by the Holy Ghost, to be a minister, and pass
          by another? There is another man more gifted, perhaps, but we dare not
          put him in a pulpit, because he has not had a special call. So with
          the deaconship; the man whom some would perhaps think most suitable
          for the office is passed by, and another chosen. There is a
          manifestation of God's Sovereignty in the appointment to office -- in
          putting David on a throne, in making Moses the leader of the children
          of Israel through the wilderness, in choosing Daniel to stand among
          princes, in electing Paul to be the minister to the Gentiles, and
          Peter to be the Apostle of the Circumcision. And you who have not the
          gift of honourable office, must learn the great truth contained in the
          question of the Master, "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will
          with mine own?"
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another honourable gift, the gift of utterance. Eloquence
          hath more power over men than all else besides. If a man would have
          power over the multitude, he must seek to touch their hearts, and
          chain their ears. There are some men who are like vessels full of
          knowledge to the brim, but having no means of giving it forth to the
          world. They are rich in all gems of learning but know not how to set
          them in the golden ring of eloquence. They can collect the choicest of
          flowers, but know not how to tie them up in a sweet garland to present
          them to the admirer's eye. How is this? We say again, the Sovereignty
          of God is here displayed in the distribution of gifts honourable.
          Learn here, O Christian man, if you have gifts, to cast the honour of
          them at the Saviour's feet, and if you possess them not, learn not to
          murmur; remember that God is equally as kind when he keepeth back as
          when he distributeth his favours. If any among you be exalted, let him
          not be puffed up; if any be lowly, let him not be despised; for God
          giveth to every vessel his measure of grace. Serve him after your
          measure, and adore the King of Heaven who doth as he pleaseth.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We notice in the fourth place, the gift of USEFULNESS. I have
          often done wrong in finding fault with brother ministers for not being
          useful, I have said you might have been as useful as I have been had
          you been in earnest. But surely there are others even more earnest,
          and more efficient: others labouring as constantly, but with far less
          effect. And, therefore, let me retract my accusation, and in lieu
          thereof assert that the gift of usefulness is the result of God's
          Sovereignty. It is not in man to be useful, but in God to make him
          useful. We may labour ourselves with all our might, but God alone can
          make us useful. We can put every stitch of canvass on when the wind
          blows, but we cannot make the wind blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sovereignty of God is seen also in the diversity of ministerial
          gifts. You go to one minister and are fed with plenty of good food:
          another has not enough to feed a mouse; he has plenty of reproof, but
          no food for the child of God. Another can comfort the child of God,
          but he cannot reprove a backslider. He has not strength of mind enough
          to give those earnest home strokes which are sometimes needed. And
          what is the reason! God's Sovereignty. One can wield the sledge hammer
          but could not heal a broken heart. If he were to attempt it, you would
          be reminded of an elephant trying to thread a needle. Such a man can
          reprove, but he cannot apply oil and wine to a bruised conscience.
          Why? Because God hath not given to him the gift. There is another one
          who always preaches experimental divinity; and very rarely touches
          upon doctrine. Another is all doctrine, and cannot preach much about
          Jesus Christ and him crucified. Why? God hath not given him the gift
          of doctrine. Another always preaches Jesus -- blessed Jesus; men of
          the Hawker school -- and many say, oh! they do not give us experience
          enough; they do not go into the deep experiences of the corruption
          which vexes the children of God. But we do not blame them for this.
          You will notice that out of the same man will at one time flow streams
          of living water, while at another time he will be as dry as possible.
          On one Sabbath you go away refreshed by the preaching, and the next
          you get no good. There is Divine Sovereignty in all this, and we must
          learn to recognize and admire it. I was preaching on one occasion last
          week to a large crowd of people, and in one part of the sermon the
          people were very much affected; I felt that the power of God was
          there; one poor creature absolutely shrieked out because of the wrath
          of God against sin; but at another time the same words might have been
          uttered and there might have been the same desire in the minister's
          heart, and yet no effect produced. We must trace, I say, Divine
          Sovereignty in all such cases. We ought to recognize God's hand in
          everything. But the present is the most godless generation that ever
          trod this earth, I verily believe. In our fathers' days there was
          hardly a shower but they declared that God caused it to fall; and they
          had prayers for rain, prayers for sunshine, and prayers for harvest;
          as well when a haystack was on fire, as when a famine desolated the
          land; our forefathers said, the Lord hath done it. But now our
          philosophers try to explain everything, and trace all phenomena to
          second causes. But brethren, let it be ours to ascribe the origin and
          direction of all things to the Lord, and the Lord alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. Lastly, GIFTS COMFORTABLE are of God. O, what comfortable gifts do
          some of us enjoy in the ordinances of God's house, and in a ministry
          that is profitable. But how many churches have not a ministry of that
          kind; and why then have we? Because God hath made a difference. Some
          here have strong faith, and can laugh at impossibilities; we can sing
          a song in all ill weathers -- in the tempest as well as in the calm.
          But there is another with little faith who is in danger of tumbling
          down over every straw. We trace eminent faith entirely to God. One is
          born with a melancholy temperament, and he sees a tempest brewing even
          in the calm; while another is cheerful, and sees a silver lining to
          every cloud, however black, and he is a happy man. But why is that?
          Comfortable gifts come of God. And then observe that we ourselves,
          differ at times. For a season we may have blessed intercourse with
          heaven, and be permitted to look within the veil? but anon, these
          delightful enjoyments are gone. But do we murmur on that account? May
          he not do as he will with his own? May he not take back what he has
          given? The comforts we possess were his before they were ours.
        </p>
        <p>"And shouldst thou take them all away,</p>
        <p>Yet would I not repine,</p>
        <p>Before they were possessed by me</p>
        <p>They were entirely thine."</p>
        <p>
          There is no joy of the Spirit -- there is no exceeding blessed hope --
          no strong faith -- no burning desire -- no close fellowship with
          Christ, which is not the gift of God, and which we must not trace to
          him. When I am in darkness and suffer disappointment, I will look up
          and say, he giveth songs in the night; and when I am made to rejoice,
          I will say, my mountain shall stand fast for ever. The Lord is a
          Sovereign Jehovah; and, therefore, prostrate at his feet I lie, and if
          I perish, I will perish there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me say, brethren, that so far from this doctrine of Divine
          Sovereignty making you to sit down in sloth, I hope in God it will
          have a tendency to humble you, and so to lead you to say, "I am
          unworthy of the least of all thy mercies. I feel that thou hast a
          right to do with me as thou wilt. If thou dost crush, a helpless worm,
          thou wilt not be dishonoured; and I have no right to ask thee to have
          compassion upon me, save this, that I want thy mercy. Lord, if thou
          wilt, thou art able to pardon, and thou never gavest grace to one that
          wanted it more. Because I am empty, fill me with the bread of heaven;
          because I am naked, clothe me with thy robe; because I am dead, give
          me life." If you press that plea with all your soul and all your mind,
          though Jehovah is a Sovereign, he will stretch out his sceptre and
          save, and thou shalt live to worship him in the beauty of holiness,
          loving and adoring his gracious Sovereignty. "He that believeth" is
          the declaration of Scripture "and is baptized, shall be saved; but he
          that believeth not shall be damned." He that believeth in Christ
          alone, and is baptized with water in the name of the Father, the Son,
          and the Holy Ghost, shall be saved, but he who rejecteth Christ and
          believeth not in him, shall be damned. That is the Sovereign decree
          and proclamation of heaven -- bow to it, acknowledge it, obey it, and
          God bless you.
