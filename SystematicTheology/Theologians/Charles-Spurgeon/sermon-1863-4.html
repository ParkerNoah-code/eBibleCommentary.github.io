        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.496)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Evening, December 28th, 1862, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things:
          his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory." --
          Psalm 98:1.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE MUST BE NEW SONGS on new occasions of triumph. It would have
          been absurd for Miriam with her timbrel to conduct the music of the
          daughters of Israel to some old sonnet that they had learned in Egypt.
          Nay, an old song could not have spoken out the feelings of that
          generation, much less could it have served to utter a voice, the
          jubilant notes of which distant posterity should echo. They must have
          a new song while they cry the one unto the other, "Sing unto the Lord,
          for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
          thrown into the sea." The like had never been known before, but
          henceforth father to son must show forth its fame. In after times,
          when Deborah and Barak had routed the hosts of Sisera, they did not
          borrow Miriam's song; but they had a new psalm for the new event. They
          said, "Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
          Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam." In after
          years, at the building of the temple, or on the solemn feast days, it
          was ever the wont of the inspired poets of the age to cry, "O come,
          let us sing unto the Lord a new song." Thus the grateful notes of
          praise have gathered volume and augmented their compass as the ages
          have rolled onwards; and these as it were only the rehearsals for a
          grand oratorio. What then, shall be the marvellous novelty and the
          matchless glory of that song which shall be sung at the last upon
          Mount Zion, when ten thousand times ten thousand of the warriors of
          God shall surround Jesus the conqueror, when we shall hear a voice
          from heaven as the voice of many waters, and like great thunders, when
          shall be heard the voice of harpers, harping with their harps; what
          shall be, I say, the strange novelty of that new song which they shall
          sing before the throne, when the four and twenty elders and the four
          living creatures shall fall before God upon their faces, and worship
          him for ever and ever? Would that our ears could anticipate that
          tremendous burst of "Hallelujah! hallelujah! hallelujah! the Lord God
          Omnipotent reigneth."
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to carry your minds, if I can, to-night, for a little season to
          that last and grandest, because the decisive victory, which shall tell
          out the name and fame of Jehovah in all his mighty attributes, and in
          all his majestic deeds, when the battle shall be over for ever, and
          the banner shall be furled and the sword shall be sheathed, because
          the last foe shall be destroyed, and placed beneath the feet of the
          Almighty victor; "His right hand, and his holy arm, hath him the
          victory." My text seems, however suitable it may be to other
          occasions, to be most fitting to that last and most splendid triumph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three things there are in it: victory transcendent; Deity conspicuous;
          holiness glorified.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First in our text we perceive very clearly VICTORY TRANSCENDENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          What shall we say of that victory? The shouts thereof already greet
          our ears, and the anthem that celebrates it is already prepared, when
          all the principalities and powers of this world shall be laid low, the
          pride of earth shall burst like a bubble, the great globe itself shall
          dissolve, and the things that are seen shall be folded up like a
          vesture, worn out, and crumbled with decay, that victory will be
          transcendent; there shall be none comparable to it; it shall stand
          matchless and unrivalled in all the wars of God, of angels, or men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, we must say of that victory, there shall be none to dispute the
          claim of God the Most High. The most splendid victories of one army
          have frequently been claimed by the opposite partisans. If you stand
          beneath the triumphal arch in Paris, you will see the names of some
          battles which you simple-minded Englishmen always thought had been won
          by British soldiers; but you discover that our history was all a
          mistake, and that the Frenchmen really retired victorious from the
          plain. I suppose in America it is always difficult to ascertain who
          has been the conqueror; and where there are no generals, and the whole
          affair seems to be which shall kill the most and wade through the most
          blood, there naturally must be difficulty in ascertaining who has won
          the day. But in this case there shall be no dispute whatever. The
          dragon's head shall be so completely broken, that he can do nothing
          but bite his iron bonds and growl out his confession that God is
          stronger than he. The hosts of hell shall have been so utterly routed,
          that the deep groans of dismay and shrieks of terror shall be the
          confession that Omnipotence rules their terrible doom. As for Death,
          when he shall see his captives all loosed before his eyes; as for the
          grave, when the key shall be rent from her grip, and all her treasures
          plucked from her grasp -- death and the grave shall both acknowledge
          that their victory is gone for ever; Christ has been the conqueror,
          the Son of God who in our nature has already taken away the sting.
          There may be to-day some who write their names down as Atheists; there
          may be others who openly avow that they are the adversaries of God;
          and throughout the universe there are never wanting those who are
          hopeful that the issue will turn out as they wish -- they are hopeful
          that wrong will master right; that evil shall drive out good, and
          darkness extinguish light. But there shall not be one such being left
          on that great day of victory; it shall be acknowledged even by the lip
          of despair that the Lord God, "with his own right hand, and his holy
          arm, hath gotten him the victory." Blazoned across the sky in
          lightnings such as the eye of terror has never beheld before;
          thundered out with trumpet louder than even that which startled the
          sleeping dead, every tongue in earth and hell shall confess, because
          every ear hath heard, that the Lord reigneth, and is king for ever and
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But further, as this victory will be certainly beyond all dispute, let
          me remind you it will be transcendent, because there shall be nothing
          that can occur to mar it. When the last shock of the dread artillery
          shall have been endured by the hosts of God's elect; when the last
          charge shall have driven the foes before them as thin clouds fly
          before a Biscay gale; then, as the heroes sit down to read the story
          of the war, they shall discover that there is nothing to mar the
          splendor of that glory, for it has been a victory throughout. Of all
          other victories we read, at one time the balance trembled -- sometimes
          the host on this side wavered; perhaps for the first half day it
          seemed not only doubtful which would win, but it appeared as though
          the adversary at length defeated would certainly be the conqueror.
          But, beloved, when we shall read history in the light of heaven, we
          shall discover that God was never conquered -- that never did the
          ranks reel; we shall see that even the most disastrous strokes of
          Providence, even the most dire calamities that ever occurred to the
          Church, were only the on-march, the tramp of victories yet to come. I
          am certain that those things we most deplore to-day will even become
          the subjects of the most marvellous gratitude to-morrow. We look
          to-day upon the black side of the question, and say, "Ah! here,
          indeed, goodness was foiled;" but when we look at the whole matter
          through, we shall see that every dark and bending line meets in the
          center of the divine plan, and that which seemed the most incongruous
          and out of place with its fellow, was the most fitting and the most
          necessary of the whole programme. Satan at the last shall not be able
          to put his finger upon any spot of the battle-field and say, "Here my
          hosts routed the troops of Emmanuel." Everywhere it shall be seen
          that, from the dawning day, when first he struck the blow at Eve and
          made her sin, to the very last, when Christ shall drag him up the
          everlasting hills, led captive at his chariot wheels, from the first
          to the last, the Lord's "right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him
          the victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, too, that this is a victory all along the line. The
          general's cautious eye marks that there the left wing has driven the
          adversary back, but for that right wing bring up the reserves, let not
          the ranks be broken. Stern liners, let your chivalry be seen yonder
          for that wing reels. Generally in the battle some part must fail,
          while in this portion or the other there shall be success. Ah! but at
          the last when Christ shall stand, and bare his brow in heaven's
          sunlight, and all his angels shall be with him, it shall be seen that
          they were everywhere triumphant. The blood on Madagascar's rocks shall
          not defeat the on-march of God's armies. Saints may be burned, may be
          sawn in sunder, may wander about in sheep skins and goat skins, but
          they shall be victorious everywhere. Spain may shut her gates against
          the gospel, and the inquisition may make that place its stronghold,
          but as sure as there is a God in heaven, Christ shall be conqueror
          there. Tyrants may pass edicts to exterminate Christians, conclaves
          may make decrees to drive out the religion of Jesus, but in every
          place, in every land, where ever foot of man has trodden this green
          earth, shall there be victory; from the north to the south, from the
          east to the west, everywhere shall be triumph -- China and Japan,
          Brazil and Chili, the islands of the south, the frozen regions of the
          north, even Africa with her sable sons, the dwellers in the wilderness
          shall bow before him and lick the dust at his feet. There shall be
          victory all along the line. Not from one place merely, but from all,
          shall be heard the tune -- "His own right hand, and his holy arm, hath
          gotten him the victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          And it shall be a victory Sustained by the news of the morrow. Not so
          among the embattled hosts of men. How hard to brook the morrow! Then
          the general's brow is dark, and his eye is heavy, for the list of the
          dead and wounded is brought in for inspection. "Another victory like
          this," says one, "and I am defeated for ever. It is dearly purchased,"
          saith he, "with the blood of these mothers' sons. My comrades and
          companions in arms must bite the ground to let the country live." But
          in that last great battle of God the muster-roll shall be found
          without one missing in it; as they call their names they shall all
          answer, there shall not be one left dead upon the field. "How so? How
          so?" saith unbelief, "are they not dead and buried now? Have not their
          bodies lain to bleach upon the side of the Alps? Have they not been
          burned in the fire and scattered as ashes to the four winds? Do not
          the saints sleep to-day in our cemeteries, and in our grave-yards, and
          doth not the deep engulf full many a body that was a temple of the
          Holy Ghost?" I answer, yes, but they shall come again. Refrain thine
          eyes from weeping, O daughter of Jerusalem; refrain thine heart from
          sorrow, for they shall come again from the land of their captivity. We
          that are alive and remain shall not have the preference beyond them
          that sleep, "For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
          incorruptible, and we shall be changed; so when this corruptible shall
          have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
          immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
          Death is swallowed up in victory." "His right hand, and his holy arm,
          hath gotten him the victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          And sometimes, on the morrow, the general feels the glory of the
          victory is marred, for there are many prisoners; they are not dead,
          their corpses lie not on the field, but they have been taken off by
          the opposite parties, and they are a prey; and who knoweth what may
          become of them; what dungeons may contain them; to what tortures they
          may be put. But in this last victory of God, there shall be no
          prisoners, no prisoners left in the hand of his enemy. I know there
          are some who say that we may be children of God, and yet fall from
          grace and perish. My brethren, it is a foul slander upon the
          faithfulness and power of the Redeemer. I know that all he undertakes
          to save he will save, and he will bring the troops off from the battle
          field, every brow crowned with laurel, not one slain, not one a
          prisoner; the gates of hell shall never enclose the ransomed of the
          Lord; amongst the groans of the lost there shall never be heard a sigh
          from one that was once a saint before God. There are no prisoners.
          March out your prisoners, Prince of Hell, bring forth, if you can, one
          soul that Jesus bought with blood, one soul that the Spirit quickened,
          one soul that the Eternal Father gave to the hands of the Great Surety
          to keep for ever -- bring him forth. Ah! ye have none. "Shall the prey
          be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?" Thus saith
          the Lord, the God of hosts, "My ransomed shall return, and come to
          Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads;" then shall it
          be said, "His right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
          victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, beloved, after the battle is over, the conqueror wipes his brow
          and says, "Ah, but the scattered hosts may rally, and they who were
          driven to-day like chaff before the wind, may rise again, and long may
          be the campaign, and fierce the struggle, before we have stamped out
          the sparks of war. "Sleep on your arms," saith he, "you may be
          attacked to-morrow, be ready for the cry of boot and saddle,' for
          there may be a charge again ere many hours are spent." But not so in
          this case: the victory is crushing, total, final; it is once for ever
          with evil, with darkness, with hell; they shall never again be able to
          tempt the righteous, or to cast them down, or to pale their cheeks
          with fear; they shall never be able again to win the world to their
          dominion, they are routed, routed, routed for ever. Hosts of evil, it
          is not your heel that is bruised -- your head is broken; the Lord hath
          used his people as his battle-axe and his weapons of war, and he hath
          cleft ye and left ye without might or strength for ever and for ever.
          So, dear friends, this is our joy and comfort, that once the battle
          over, the whole campaign is ended; there shall be no further
          onslaughts; we rest eternally; we triumph everlastingly; no more
          fights to risk, no more conflicts in which to tug and strive. This
          shall be the note that shall ring throughout the arches of eternity --
          "The Lord's right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory
          for ever and for ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think these are two good reasons why I should say this victory is
          transcendent -- there is none to dispute it, and there is nothing to
          mar it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yet further we will venture to enlarge upon this victory by
          shewing its particulars. The ultimate triumph and victory of God in
          all his purposes will lie in several things. How glorious the fact
          that all whom he ordained to save are saved! Calling was the first
          work which he wrought in them; they were called every one of them, but
          like the rest of mankind they would not come; their wills were so
          desperate that they resisted long; the minister preached at them;
          their mother wept over them; their father entreated them; providence
          came and hewed them; afflictions broke them in pieces, and they were
          unsaved still; but not in one case where God ordains to call has the
          calling failed. In every case where his electing love hath set its
          purpose, the will is turned round, the affections yield, the judgment
          gives way, the man is subdued -- he is called, he is quickened. There
          may be some such here to-night, who think, "Well, I never would be
          saved upon such terms as acknowledging the sovereign grace of God,
          even if he wills to do it." Thy will must give way before the crushing
          force of the will of God. He hath mysterious ways of finding an
          entrance into the most reluctant heart, and taking up his throne there
          for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          How clearly is this victory seen in the subjugation of the lusts and
          passions of the called sinner! He may have been a drunkard, he thought
          he could not give it up, but the rod of iron "dashes in pieces the
          potter's vessel." He may have loved the pleasures of the flesh, they
          were dear to him as his right eye, but grace overcame the most darling
          lust, and threw to the earth the most pampered sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not less conspicuously will it appear in the perseverance of every
          saint. Not a stone will have been left unturned by the adversary to
          prevent the saints holding on; the caverns of hell will be emptied
          against God's redeemed; Satan and his myrmidons will do their utmost
          to cast them down to destruction, but they shall hold on their way,
          they shall wax stronger and stronger, and when at last the gates of
          heaven shall be fast closed, because there are no more to enter, it
          shall be proclaimed, while devils bite their iron bands in shame, that
          not a soul who was written in the Book of Life was lost, not one whom
          Jesus bought with blood has been unredeemed, not one quickened by
          grace suffered to die, not one who truly began the heavenly race
          turned aside from it, not one concerning whom it was said, "These are
          mine, and in the day when I make up my jewels they shall be mine;" not
          one of these is lost, but all saved, saved eternally. Oh! that will be
          a splendid victory! What can be greater? You that know the conflict
          through which the child of God has to pass will bear me witness that
          if you get to heaven, you will sing with all your might the
          conqueror's hymn. And I think we all should do the same. I remember
          saying once that if ever I got to heaven I would sing the loudest
          there, for I owed the most to sovereign grace. But when I came down
          stairs, one said to me, "You made a mistake, I shall sing more loudly
          than you, for I owe more than you do." And I found that was the
          general opinion, that each brother and each sister thought that he
          owed most to divine grace. Now, if we are all to sing loudest what a
          shout of triumph there will be! And I suppose the verse in our hymn is
          quite true to the apprehension of each of us --
        </p>
        <p>"Then loudest of the crowd I'll sing,</p>
        <p>While heaven's resounding mansions ring</p>
        <p>With shouts of sovereign grace."</p>
        <p>What a transcendent triumph!</p>
        <p>
          Not a few shall there be to share the triumph, but a multitude that no
          man can number; for the glory shall be enhanced by the salvation of so
          many. Heaven is none of your narrow places for narrow-hearted bigots.
          No, brethren, our largest imagination never yet could grasp heaven,
          but it will hold multitudes of multitudes. Nor will the praise be any
          the less, when we consider that there were so many of such varied
          clans and climes, some of all kindreds on the face of the earth,
          swarthy or white. There shall be found in heaven the vilest sinner
          that lived, there shall be brought thither the proudest rebel, and the
          stoutest hearted, and the most obstinate of sinners; there shall be
          such in heaven as would have made a wonder in hell, some, I say, who
          would have been such great sinners, had they been suffered to go to
          hell, that their dreadful fall would even hell itself appal, but they
          are in heaven, saved by sovereign grace. And, O beloved! as there are
          such persons, this will help to make the victory grand, that they were
          saved by such means, such simple means, by the simple preaching of the
          gospel; not by wisdom, not by science, not by eloquence, but by the
          simple telling out of the story of the cross. How this will tend to
          make the triumph brighter than it could have been in any other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, O beloved, this victory will excel all others in the routing of
          such foes, such cruel, such crafty, such mighty, such numerous foes.
          Sin, sin, it is a name of horror -- sin o'erthrown. Death -- what
          glooms are concentrated in that word! -- death destroyed. Satan --
          what craft, what cruelties, what malice linger there -- Satan bound
          hand and foot, and led captive. Such a victory over such foes. I find
          no words in any tongue by which I can describe its magnitude. And oh!
          the results of that victory, how bright! Souls knit to Christ by such
          love, tongues tuned to such music, hearts burning with such fire,
          heaven filled with such devout, such holy inhabitants, the ears of
          Deity regaled with such grateful music, heaven filled with such
          myriads of happy spirits. The peaceful results, setting aside the
          overthrow, will be enough to make this victory grander than all the
          triumphs of men or angels put together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Say now, and gather up all your enthusiasm to say it -- What a victory
          shall that be, when there shall not be a single trophy in the hands of
          the adversary. The victory shall be unparalleled in this, that all the
          success which the enemy thought he had achieved shall only tend to
          make his defeat the more galling, and add lustre to the victorious
          King of kings. You see sometimes hanging up in old minsters tattered
          flags, that were taken from the adversary; sometimes when the report
          of battle comes in, we are told the battle was won, that so many
          cannon and so many flags were left with the enemy. But, O Lord God!
          thou hast not left a single trophy in the hands of thy foe. I said he
          had no prisoners, but he shall not even have a flag, not one truth
          rent in pieces, not one doctrine of revelation hung up to rot in the
          minsters of hell; not one single attribute of God that shall be
          trailed in the mire, not one single truth of Christianity to be
          laughed at, and despised by fiends, not a trophy; there shall not a
          hair of your head perish, not so much as that shall Satan gain, not a
          bone, not a fragment of the saint, either of his body or his spirit --
          no trophies left. And all this will make hell angry, to think that God
          gave him vantage-ground, let him contend with poor feeble men; but God
          was in man, and fought with Satan -- man, a poor feeble worm, fought
          with Satan, and, like David, he threw the stone of faith at the
          giant's head, and destroyed him with his own weapons. God hath
          destroyed death by the death of Christ, destroyed sin by the great
          sin-bearer, yea he has destroyed the dragon by the seed of a woman,
          who bruised his head with that very seed whose heel the serpent once
          did bite. Glory be unto thee, O Lord! This is thy victory. The more we
          muse upon it, the higher doth our rapture rise, and the more prepared
          do our hearts grow to peal forth the words of the Psalmist, "His right
          hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory."
        </p>
        <p>II. Secondly; observe that DEITY IS CONSPICUOUS HERE.</p>
        <p>
          Man is not made mention of. There is no name of Moses, or of the
          prophets, or of the apostles here; I read not the names of Chrysostom
          and Augustine, nor of those modern fathers of the Church, such as
          Calvin, and Zwingle -- the stars are lost in the blaze of the sun. O
          God! how glorious is thy right arm, and how do thy disciples, thy
          children, hide their heads and say, "Not unto us, but unto thy name be
          all the glory!" But mark, beloved, as they are not mentioned it is not
          because the mention need to be avoided, for the more we talk of
          instrumentalities, or rather think about them -- (I do not say the
          more we think of them, but the more we think about them) -- the more
          persuaded we shall be that it only adds to God's glory to use men, for
          men are such poor tools to work with. You have heard of the celebrated
          painter who gained renown by painting with poor brushes, when the good
          ones were stolen; and Quintin Matsys, who made a cover for the well
          without tools, when all the proper tools were taken away; he wrought
          the ironwork with such poor implements as he could get. So was the
          skill of the painter or artisan admired in that he could produce such
          effects under such disadvantageous conditions. Ah! then what an artist
          must he be! they exclaim concerning the one. And they look upon this
          piece of ironwork, and say of the other, "What! no graving tools, no
          casting, how could he do it?" So when we shall come to look at men,
          when we look at them in the light which eternity shall reveal, we
          shall say of the best of them, "How can the Lord have won such
          victories with such poor things as these!" So that you may mention the
          instruments every one of them, from righteous Abel down to the last
          preacher of the Word, and yet it shall be true, that the victory shall
          speak the sole praise of the General. No doubt, dear friends, this
          will be a part of the splendor of the triumph to think that he did win
          by man. It was in man that Satan conquered: Adam and Eve were led
          astray by the crafty wiles of Satan. It is by man that death came, and
          by man comes the resurrection of the dead. This will be gall and
          wormwood in the cup of the lost, when they shall see the Man Christ
          Jesus, the seed of the woman, sitting at the right hand of God. This
          is judgment's greatest terror, "Hide us from the Lamb;" and this shall
          be hell's greatest horror, "Hide us from the Lamb; let us not behold
          his face." But glory be unto thee, most gracious God, for thou hast
          lifted man up above all the works of thy hands, and given him dominion
          above all creatures, so that principalities and powers are put beneath
          his feet in the person of Christ. And all this only proves that "His
          own right-hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I might enlarge here and speak of the conspicuous glory of God
          in this respect, that all the persons of the Trinity will be
          glorified, the Father, the Son, the Spirit. All the attributes of God,
          his unsearchable greatness, and his unrivalled majesty, his grace, his
          power, his truth, his justice, his holiness, his immutability, these
          shall shine forth with resplendent lustre. His wondrous works and his
          terrible acts shall declare his praise; they shall be the theme of
          every tongue, and the topic of every conversation. "Men shall speak of
          the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power." All his decrees
          shall be seen in their final accomplishment, every one of them
          fulfilled, the counsel answering to the providence. Of all that the
          Father willed, of all that the Son performed, of all that the Spirit
          revealed, not one thing is frustrated. How shall I gather up these
          things? O for the voice of a mighty angel! O for a seraph's lip of
          fire, to speak now of the splendor of that last day, when not only the
          great but the little, not only the abundance of God's providence, and
          the great deeps of his counsel, but even the small deeds of his
          lovingkindness shall be made to sing forth his praise, when not only
          the leviathian deeds of God shall make the deep to praise the Lord,
          but even the little fish that move therein, shall leap up to join the
          chorus, and everywhere from everything, for everything, there shall be
          heard the tune -- "His right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him
          the victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We have in our text a third thought, which we can only hint at.
          In all this -- HOLINESS WILL BE GLORIFIED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the adjective, -- "His holy arm." When we contemplate any actions
          of God, you will notice that the name which cherubs utter, "Holy,
          holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth," is always brought out. Where Christ
          bears sin, and overcomes it, I hear the cry of "Holy, holy, holy,"
          from the cross. Where Jesus breaks the tomb, and conquers death, I
          seem to hear the note of "Holy, holy, holy," for it makes the day holy
          on which the deed was done. And when he ascends to glory, and the
          Father says, "Well done," we seem to hear still the note, "Holy, holy,
          holy." In everything, from the manger to the cross, and from the cross
          onward to the crown, holiness becometh God's house, and all God's acts
          for ever. Is it not, dear friends, after all the hinge of the
          struggle? Is not this the point, just as you know in great battles,
          there is some one mountain or hill, which is the object of struggle,
          not for the value of that particular hill, but because on that the
          battle will depend, so holiness is just the point, the rallying point
          between God and Satan. Here are the two war-cries. The hosts of evil
          cry, "Sin, sin, sin;" but the cry of the armies of the Lord of hosts
          is this, "Holiness, holiness, holiness." Every time we strike a blow
          it is "Holiness;" and every time they attack us it is "Sin." Sin is
          the real object of their aim. When Satan attacks, it is to stab at
          holiness, and when we resist, it is to guard holiness, or to drive
          back his sin. Mark you, this, I say, is the point of the battle, and
          by that ye shall be able to judge on which side you are. What is your
          war-cry? What is your war-cry? When Cromwell fought with the soldiers
          of the covenant at Dunbar, you will remember they were distinguished
          by their cries, on the one side, "The Covenant, the Covenant;" and on
          the other side, "The Lord of hosts, the Lord of hosts." And so
          to-night there is the cry on either side, "Sin and the pleasures
          thereof." Is that your war-cry, friend? You say "No," -- how is it
          then you were at the theater the other night? You say "No," -- how is
          it then you frequent the tavern? You say "No," -- how is it then you
          have got so many misgotten gains about you now? You say, "No," -- how
          is it you make appointments for deeds of sin, and perhaps to-night, or
          to-morrow night, intend to fulfill them? I tell you, sirs, there are
          many of you whose war-cry to-night is "Sin, and the pleasures
          thereof." On the other hand, I trust there are not a few in this vast
          throng, who can say, "Oh! sir, feebly though I speak it, yet my war"
          cry is Holiness, and the cross'" -- that goeth with it, "Holiness, and
          the cross." Ah! beloved you are just now on the side that is laughed
          at, the world points at you and says, "There are your saints." Yes,
          here they are, sir, what dare you say against them? Abide your time,
          man, and have your jeering out; ye shall change that laugh for
          everlasting howlings by-and-bye. "There are your Methodists; there are
          your hypocritical professors." What, sir, dare you say it? The
          servants of the living God will know how to answer you in that day,
          when their king shall be revealed in the clouds of heaven, and his
          glory shall be manifest, and they shall share his triumph, and all
          flesh shall see it, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. The
          world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. "It doth not yet appear
          what we shall be, but when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for
          we shall see him as he is." Come, we will pass that question again
          to-night, "What is your war-cry?" There has been a good deal of
          wickedness these last few days in London. I love to see holy mirth; I
          delight to see men well feasted. I like Christmas; I wish it came six
          times a-year. I like the generosity of those who give to the poor. Let
          it be extended. I would not stop a smile. God forbid me! But cannot
          men be happy without drunkenness? cannot they be mirthful without
          blasphemy? Is there no possibility of being happy without
          lasciviousness? Are there no other ways of finding true pleasure
          besides selling your soul to the devil? O sirs! I say there have been
          thousands in this huge city who have been going about the streets, and
          whose cry has been, "Sin, and the pleasures thereof! Where is the
          music-hall? Where is the Casino? Where is the Coal Hole? Where is the
          tavern? Where is the ball-room? Sin, and the pleasures thereof." O
          Satan! thou hast many soldiers, and right brave soldiers they are, and
          never are they afraid of thy cause, nor ashamed of thy name nor of thy
          unholy work. Ay, thou art well served, O prince of hell! and rich will
          be thy wages when thy drudges earn the fire for which they have
          labored. But I hope and trust there are some to-night who will change
          their watch-note. Ye have not nailed your colors to the mast, have
          you? Even if you have, by God's grace I would pull the nails out. Are
          ye determined to die? Will you serve the black prince for ever, and
          perish with him? Jesus Emmanuel, the captain of our salvation, bids me
          cry to you, "Enlist beneath my banner." Believe in him, trust in him,
          and live. Oh! trust the merit of the cross, the virtue of the blood,
          the tears, and the dying groans. This it is to be a Christian, and
          ever afterwards this shall be your war-note -- "Holiness, and the
          cross thereof!" O take this, all! Fear not. The cross with holiness
          will bring the mortifying of the flesh, the shame of the world, and
          the reproach of men. Take both, for now the battle is raging. But, O
          my brethren, another crush, and another, and another, and another, and
          we shall gain the top of the hill, and the shout of "Holiness and the
          cross!" shall be answered by the echoes all round the world, for
          everywhere holiness shall be victorious, and men shall know the Lord.
          Ay, and the echoes of heaven shall answer, too, and the spirits of the
          sanctified shall cry, "Holiness, and the crown thereof!" Then we will
          change one word of our watch-note; and as our enemies have broken
          before us and are utterly destroyed; as they melt away like the fat of
          rams; as unto smoke they consume away, we will sing for ever,
          "Holiness, and the crown thereof! holiness, and the crown thereof!"
          But that shall be only one note: this shall be the song -- "His own
          right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory."
        </p>
        <p>
          I would that some soul would believe in Jesus to-night, that it might
          share in the victory. I would that young man's heart would be given to
          Christ to-night, or yours yonder. He deserves it of you: if it were
          only his mercy in having spared you, he deserves it. And thou
          greyheaded sinner there, does he not deserve thy heart for sparing
          thee so long? Yield, I pray thee; his love meets thee. Yield; his
          terrors threaten thee. Yield; lay down thy weapons, and be for ever
          forgiven. May God help thee to do it. The Lord prove his sovereignty
          and his power to-night in the conversion of many of his chosen; and
          unto him shall be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br />
