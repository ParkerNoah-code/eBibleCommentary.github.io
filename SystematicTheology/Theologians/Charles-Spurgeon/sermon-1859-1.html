        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.225)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, November 28th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "The governor of the feast called the bridegroom, and saith unto him,
          every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have
          well drunk, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine
          until now." -- John 2:9-10.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE governor of the feast said more than he intended to say, or
          rather, there is more truth in what he said than he himself imagined.
          This is the established rule all the world over: "the good wine first,
          and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse." It is the
          rule with men; and have not hundreds of disappointed hearts bewailed
          it? Friendship first -- the oily tongue, the words softer than butter,
          and afterwards the drawn sword. Ahithophel first presents the lordly
          dish of love and kindness to David, then afterwards that which is
          worse, for he forsakes his master, and becomes the counsellor of his
          rebel son. Judas presents first of all the dish of fair speech and of
          kindness; the Saviour partook thereof, he walked to the house of God
          in company with him, and took sweet counsel with him; but afterwards
          there came the dregs of the wine -- "He that eateth bread with me hath
          lifted up his heel against me." Judas the thief betrayed his Master,
          bringing forth afterwards "that which is worse." Ye have found it so
          with many whom ye thought your friends. In the heyday of prosperity,
          when the sun was shining, and the birds were singing, and all was fair
          and gay and cheerful with you, they brought forth the good wine; but
          there came a chilling frost, and nipped your flowers, and the leaves
          fell from the trees, and your streams were frosted with the ice, and
          then they brought forth that which is worse, -- they forsook you and
          fled; they left you in your hour of peril, and taught you that great
          truth, that "Cursed is he that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his
          arm." And this is the way all the world over -- I say it once again --
          not merely with men, but with nature too.
        </p>
        <p>"Alas, for us, if thou wert all,</p>
        <p>And nought beyond O earth;"</p>
        <p>
          for doth not this world serve us just the same? In our youth it brings
          forth the best wine; then we have the sparkling eye, and the ear
          attuned to music; then the blood flows swiftly through the veins and
          the pulse beats joyously; but wait a little and there shall come forth
          afterwards that which is worse, for the keepers of the house shall
          tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves; the grinders shall
          fail because they are few, they that look out of the windows shall be
          darkened, all the daughters of music shall be brought low; then shall
          the strong man totter, the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire
          shall fail, the mourners shall go about the streets. First there is
          the flowing cup of youth, and afterwards the stagnant waters of old
          age, unless God shall cast into those dregs a fresh flood of his
          lovingkindness and tender mercy, so that once again, as it always
          happeneth to the Christian, the cup shall run over, and again sparkle
          with delight. O Christian, trust not thou in men; rely not thou upon
          the things of this present time, for this is evermore the rule with
          men and with the world -- "the good wine first, and when ye have well
          drunken, then that which is worse."
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning, however, I am about to introduce you to two houses of
          feasting. First, I shall bid you look within the doors of the devil's
          house, and you will find he is true to this rule; he brings forth
          first the good wine, and when men have well drunk, and their brains
          are muddled therewith, then he bringeth forth that which is worse.
          Having bidden you look there and tremble, and take heed to the
          warning, I shall then attempt to enter with you into the banquetting
          house of our beloved Lord and Master Jesus Christ, and of him we shall
          be able to say, as the governor of the feast said to the bridegroom,
          "Thou hast kept the good wine until now;" thy feasts grow better, and
          not worse: thy wines grow richer, thy viands are daintier far, and thy
          gifts more precious than before. "Thou hast kept the good wine until
          now."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we are to take a warning glance at the HOUSE OF FEASTING
          WHICH SATAN HATH BUILDED: for as wisdom hath builded her house, and
          hewn out her seven pillars, so hath folly its temple and its tavern of
          feasting, into which it continually tempts the unwary. Look within the
          banquetting house, and I will shew you four tables and the guests that
          sit thereat; and as you look at those tables you shall see the courses
          brought in. You shall see the wine cops brought, and you shall see
          them vanish one after another, and you shall mark that the rule holds
          good at all four tables -- first the good wine, and afterwards that
          which is worse -- yea, I shall go further -- afterwards, that which is
          worst of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. At the first table to which I shall invite your attention, though I
          beseech you never to sit down and drink thereat, sit the PROFLIGATE.
          The table of the profligate is a gay table; it is covered over with a
          gaudy crimson, and all the vessels upon it look exceedingly bright and
          glistening. Many there be that sit thereat, but they know not that
          they are the guests of hell, and that the end of all the feast shall
          be in the depths of perdition. See ye now the great governor of the
          feast, as he comes in? He has a bland smile upon his face; his
          garments are not black, but he is girded with a robe of many colours,
          he hath a honied word on his lip, and a tempting witchery in the
          sparkle of his eye. He brings in she cup, and says, "Hey, young man,
          drink hereat, it sparkleth in the cup, it moveth itself aright. Do you
          see it? It is the wine-cup of pleasure." This is the first cup at the
          banquetting house of Satan. The young man takes it, and sips the
          liquor. At first it is a cautious sip; it is but a little he will
          take, and then he will restrain himself. He does not intend to indulge
          much in lust, he means not to plunge headlong into perdition. There is
          a flower there on the edge of that cliff: he will reach forward a
          little and pluck it, but it is not his intention to dash himself from
          that beetling crag and destroy himself. Not he! He thinks it easy to
          put away the cup when he has tested its flavour! He has no design to
          abandon himself to its intoxication. He takes a shallow draught. But O
          how sweet it is! How it makes his blood tingle within him. What a fool
          I was, not to have tasted this before! he thinks. Was ever joy like
          this? Could it be thought that bodies could be capable of such ecstacy
          as this? He drinks again; this time he takes a deeper draught, and the
          wine is hot in his veins. Oh! how blest is he! What would he not say
          now in the praise of Bacchus, or Venus, or whatever shape Beelzebub
          chooses to assume? He becomes a very orator in praise of sin? It is
          fair, it is pleasant, the deep damnation of lust appeareth as joyous
          as the transports of heaven. He drinks, he drinks, he drinks again,
          till his brain begins to reel with the intoxication of his sinful
          delight. This is the first course. Drink, O ye drunkards of Ephraim,
          and bind the crown of pride about your head, and call us fools because
          we put your cup from us; drink with the harlot and sup with the
          lustful; ye may think yourselves wise for so doing, but we know that
          after these things there cometh something worse, for your vine is the
          vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah, your grapes are grapes
          of gall, the clusters are bitter; your wine is the poison of dragons
          and the cruel venom of asps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now with a leer upon his brow, the subtle govenor of the feast riseth
          from his seat. His victim has had enough of the best wine. He takes
          away that cup, and he brings in another, not quite so sparkling. Look
          into the liquor; it is not beaded over with the sparkling bubbles of
          rapture; it is all flat, and dull, and insipid; it is called the cup
          of satiety. The man has had enough of pleasure, and like a dog he
          vomits, though like a dog he will return to his vomit yet again. Who
          hath woe? Who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine.
          I am now speaking figuratively of wine, as well as literally. The wine
          of lust bringeth the same redness of the eyes; the profligate soon
          discovers that all the rounds of pleasure end in satiety. "What!" says
          he, "What more can I do? There! I have committed every wickedness that
          can be imagined, and I have drained every cup of pleasure. Give me
          something fresh! I have tried the theatres all round: there! I don't
          care so much as one single farthing for them all. I have gone to every
          kind of pleasure that I can conceive. It is all over. Gaiety itself
          grows flat and dull. What am I to do?" And this is the devil's second
          course -- the course of satiety -- a fitful drowsiness, the result of
          the previous excess. Thousands there are who are drinking of the
          tasteless cup of satiety every day, and some novel invention whereby
          they may kill time, some new discovery whereby they may give a fresh
          vent to their iniquity would be a wonderful thing to them; and if some
          man should rise up who could find out for them some new fashion of
          wickedness, some deeper depths in the deeps of the nethermost hell of
          lasciviousness, they would bless his name, for having given them
          something fresh to excite them. That is the devil's second course. And
          do you see them partaking of it? Three are some of you that are having
          a deep draught of it this morning. You are the jaded horses of the
          fiend of lust, the disappointed followers of the will-o'-the-wisp of
          pleasure. God knows, if you were to speak your heart out you would be
          obliged to say, "There! I have tried pleasure, and I do not find it
          pleasure ; I have gone the round, and I am just like the blind horse
          at the mill, I have to go round again. I am spell-bound to the sin,
          but I cannot take delight in it now as I once did, for all the glory
          on it is as a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Awhile the feaster remains in the putrid sea of his infatuation, but
          another scene is opening. The governor of the feast commandeth another
          liquor to be broached. This time the fiend bears a black goblet, and
          he presents it with eyes full of hell-fire, flashing with fierce
          damnation. "Drink of that, sir," says he, and the man sips it and
          starts back and shrieks, "O God! that ever I must come to this!" You
          must drink, sir! He that quaffs the first cup, must drink the second,
          and the third. Drink, though it be like fire down your throat! Drink
          it, though it be as the lava of Etna in your bowels! Drink! you must
          drink! He that sins must suffer; he that is a profligate in his youth
          must have rottenness in his bones, and disease within his loins. He
          who rebels against the laws of God, must reap the harvest in his own
          body here. Oh! there are some dreadful things that I might tell you of
          this third course. Satan's house has a front chamber full of
          everything that is enticing to the eye and bewitching to the sensual
          taste; but there is a back chamber, and no one knoweth, no one hath
          seen the whole of its horrors. There is a secret chamber, where he
          shovels out the creatures whom he hath himself destroyed -- a chamber,
          beneath whose floor is the blazing of hell, and above whose boards the
          heat of that horrible pit is felt. It may be a physician's place
          rather than mine, to tell of the horrors that some have to suffer as
          the result of their iniquity. I leave that; but let me tell the
          profligate spendthrift, that the poverty which he will endure is the
          result of his sin of extravagant spendthriftcy; let him know, also,
          that the remorse of conscience that will overtake him is not an
          accidental thing that drops by chance from heaven, -- it is the result
          of his own iniquity; for, depend upon it, men and brethren, sin
          carries an infant misery in its bowels, and sooner or later it must be
          delivered of its terrible child. If we sow the seed we must reap the
          harvest. Thus the law of hell's house stands -- "first, the good wine,
          then, afterwards, that which is worse."
        </p>
        <p>
          The last course remains to be presented. And now, ye strong men who
          mock at the warning, which I would fain deliver to you with a
          brother's voice and with an affectionate heart, though with rough
          language. Come ye here, and drink of this last cup. The sinner has at
          the end brought himself to the grave. His hopes and joys were like
          gold put into a bag full of holes, and they have all vanished --
          vanished for ever; and now he has come to the last; his sins haunt
          him, his transgressions perplex him; he is taken like a bull in a net,
          and how shall he escape. He dies, and descends from disease to
          damnation. Shall mortal language attempt to tell you the horrors of
          that last tremendous cup of which the profligate must drink, and drink
          for ever? Look at it: ye cannot see its depths, but cast an eye upon
          its seething surface, I hear the noise of rushing to and fro, and a
          sound as of gnashing of teeth and the wailing of despairing souls. I
          look into that cup, and I hear a voice coming up from its depths --
          "These shall go away into everlasting punishment;" for "Tophet is
          prepared of old, the pile thereof is wood and much smoke, the breath
          of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, shall kindle it." And what
          say ye to this last course of Satan? "Who among us shall dwell with
          the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting
          burnings?" Profligate! I beseech thee, in the name of God, start from
          this table! Oh, be not so careless at thy cups; be not so asleep,
          secure in the peace which thou now enjoyest! Man! death is at the
          door, and at his heels is swift destruction. As for you, who as yet
          have been restrained by a careful father and the watchfulness of an
          anxious mother, I beseech you shun the house of sin and folly. Let the
          wise man's words be written on thine heart, and be thou mindful of
          them in the hour of temptation -- "Remove thy way far from her, and
          come not nigh the door of her house: for the lips of a strange woman
          drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: but her end
          is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two edged sword. Her feet go down to
          death; her steps take hold on hell."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Do ye see that other table yonder in the middle of the palace? Ah!
          good easy souls! Many of you had thought that you never went to the
          feast of hell at all; but there is a table for you too; it is covered
          over with a fair white cloth, and all the vessels upon the table are
          most clean and comely. The wine looks not like the wine of Gomorrah,
          it moveth aright, like the wine from the grapes of Eshcol; it seems to
          have no intoxication in it; it is like the ancient wine which they
          pressed from the grape into the cup having in it no deadly poison. Do
          ye see the men who sit at this table? How self-contented they are! Ask
          the white fiends who wait at it, and they will tell you, "This is the
          table of the self-righteous: the Pharisee sits there. You may know
          him; he has his phylactery between his eyes; the hem of his garment is
          made exceeding broad; he is one of the best of the best professors."
          "Ah!" saith Satan, as he draws the curtain and shuts off the table
          where the profligates are carousing, "be quiet; don't make too much
          noise, lest these sanctimonious hypocrites should guess what company
          they are in. Those self-righteous people are my guests quite as much
          as you, and I have them quite as safely." So Satan, like an angel of
          light, brings forth a gilded goblet, looking like the chalice of the
          table of communion. And what wine is that? It seems to be the very
          wine of the sacred Eucharist; it is called the wine of
          self-satisfaction, and around the brim you may see the bubbles of
          pride. Look at the swelling froth upon the bowl -- "God, I thank thee,
          that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
          even as this publican." You know that cup, my self-deceiving hearers;
          Oh that ye knew the deadly hemlock which is mixed therein. "Sin as
          other men do? Not you; not at all. You are not going to submit
          yourself to the righteousness of Christ: what need you? You are as
          good as your neighbours; if you are not saved, you ought to be, you
          think. Don't you pay everybody twenty-shillings in the pound? Did you
          ever rob anybody in your life? You do your neighbours a good turn; you
          are as good as other people." Very good! That is the first cup the
          devil gives, and the good wine makes you swell with self-important
          dignity, as its fumes enter your heart and puff it up with an accursed
          pride. Yes! I see you sitting in the room so cleanly swept and so
          neatly garnished, and I see the crowds of your admirers standing
          around the table, even many of God's own children, who say, "Oh that I
          were half as good as he." While the very humility of the righteous
          provides you with provender for your pride. Wait awhile, thou unctious
          hypocrite, wait awhile, for there is a second course to come. Satan
          looks with quite as self-satisfied an air upon his guests this time as
          he did upon the troop of rioters. "Ah!" says he, "I cheated those gay
          fellows with the cup of pleasure -- I gave them, afterwards, the dull
          cup of satiety, and I have cheated you, too; you think yourselves all
          right, but I have deceived you twice, I have befooled you indeed." So
          he brings in a cup which, sometimes, he himself doth not like to
          serve. It is called the cup of discontent and unquietness of mind, and
          many there be that have to drink this after all their
          self-satisfaction. Do you not find, you that are very good in your own
          esteem, but have no interest in Christ, that when you sit alone and
          begin to turn over your accounts for eternity, that they do not square
          somehow -- that you cannot strike the balance exactly to your own side
          after all, as you thought you could? Have not you sometimes found,
          that when you thought you were standing on a rock, there was a
          quivering beneath your feet? You heard the Christian sing boldly, --
        </p>
        <p>"Bold shall I stand in that great day,</p>
        <p>For who aught to my charge shall lay?</p>
        <p>While, thro' thy blood, absolv'd I am</p>
        <p>From sin's tremendous curse and shame."</p>
        <p>
          And you have said, "Well, I cannot sing that, I have been as good a
          Churchman as ever lived, I never missed going to my church all these
          years, but I cannot say I have a solid confidence." You had once a
          hope of self-satisfaction; but now the second course has come in, and
          you are not quite so contented. "Well," says another, "I have been to
          my chapel, and I have been baptized, and made a profession of
          religion, though I was never brought to know the Lord in sincerity and
          in truth, and I once thought it was all well with me, but I want a
          something which I cannot find." Now comes a shaking in the heart. It
          is not quite so delightful as one supposed, to build on one's own
          righteousness. Ah! that is the second course. Wait awhile, and mayhap
          in this world, but certainly in the hour of death, the devil will
          bring in the third cup of dismay, at the discovery of your lost
          condition. How many a man who has been self-righteous all his life,
          has, at the last discovered that the thing whereon he placed his hope
          had failed him. I have heard of an army, who, being defeated in
          battle, endeavoured to make good a retreat. With all their might the
          soldiers fled to a certain river, where they expected to find a bridge
          across which they could retreat and be in safety. But when they came
          to the stream, there was heard a shriek of terror -- "The bridge is
          broken, the bridge is broken!" All in vain was that cry; for the
          multitude hurrying on behind, pressed upon those that were before and
          forced them into the river, until the stream was glutted with the
          bodies of drowned men. Such must be the fate of the self-righteous.
          You thought there was a bridge of ceremonies; that baptism,
          confirmation, and the Lord's Supper, made up the solid arches of a
          bridge of good works and duties. But when you come to die, there shall
          be heard the cry -- "The bridge is broken, the bridge is broken!" It
          will be in vain for you to turn round then. Death is close behind you;
          he forces you onward, and you discover what it is to perish, through
          having neglected the great salvation, and attempting to save yourself
          through your own good works. This is the last course but one: and your
          last course of all, the worst wine, your everlasting portion must be
          the same as that of the profligate. Good as you thought yourself to
          be, inasmuch as you proudly rejected Christ, you must drink the
          winecup of the wrath of God; that cup which is full of trembling. The
          wicked of the earth shall wring out the dregs of that cup, and drink
          them; and you also must drink of it as deep as they. Oh, beware in
          time! Put away your high looks, and humble yourselves under the mighty
          hand of God. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall be saved.

          3. Some of you have as yet escaped the lash, but there is a third
          table crowded with most honourable guests. I believe there have been
          more princes and kings, mayors and aldermen, and great merchants
          sitting at this table, than at any other. It is called the table of
          worldliness. "Humph," says a man, "Well, I dislike the profligate;
          there's my eldest son, I've been hard at work saving up money all my
          life, and there's that young fellow, he will not stick to business: he
          has become a real profligate, I am very glad the minister spoke so
          sharp about that. As for me -- there now; I don't care about your
          self-righteous people a single farthing; to me it is of no account at
          all; I don't care at all about religion in the slightest degree; I
          like to know whether the funds rise or fall, or whether there is an
          opportunity of making a good bargain; but that's about all I care
          for." Ah! worldling, I leave read of a friend of yours, who was
          clothed in scarlet, and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day.
          Do you know what became of him? You should remember it, for the same
          end awaits yourself. The end of his feast must be the end of yours. If
          your God is this world, depend upon it you shall find that your way is
          full of bitterness. Now, see that table of the worldly man, the mere
          worldling, who lives for gain. Satan brings him in a flowing cup,
          "There," says he, "Young man, you are starting in business; you need
          not care about the conventionalities of honesty, or about the ordinary
          old-fashioned fancies of religion; get rich as quick as ever you can.
          Get money -- get money -- honestly if you can, but, if not, get it
          anyhow," says the devil; and down he puts his tankard. "There," says
          he, "is a foaming draught for you." "Yes," says the young man, "I have
          abundance now. My hopes are indeed realised." Here, then, you see the
          first and best wine of the worldling's feast, and many of you are
          tempted to envy this man. "Oh, that I had such a prospect in
          business," says one, "I'm not half so sharp as he is, I could not deal
          as he deals; my religion would not let me. But how fast he gets rich!
          O that I could prosper as he does." Come, my brother, judge not before
          the time, there's a second course to come, the thick and nauseous
          draught of care. The man has got his money, but they that will be
          rich, fall into temptation and a snare. Wealth ill-gotten, or
          ill-used, or hoarded, brings a canker with it, that does not canker
          the gold and silver, but cankers the man's heart, and a cankered heart
          is one of the most awful things a man can have. Ah! see this
          money-lover, and mark the care which sits upon heart. There is a poor
          old woman, that lives near his lodge gate. She has but a pittance a
          week, but she says, "Bless the Lord, I have enough!" She never asks
          how she is to live, or how she is to die, or how she is to be buried,
          but sleeps sweetly on the pillow of contentment and faith; and here is
          this poor fool with untold gold, but he is miserable because he
          happened to drop a sixpence as he walked along the streets, or because
          he had an extra call upon his charity, to which the presence of some
          friend compelled him to yield; or perhaps he groans because his coat
          wears out too soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this comes avarice. Many have had to drink of that cup; may God
          save any of us from its fiery drops. A great American preacher has
          said, "Covetousness breeds misery. The sight of houses better than our
          own, of dress beyond our means, of jewels costlier than we may wear,
          of stately equipage, and rare curiosities beyond our reach, these
          hatch the viper brood of covetous thoughts; vexing the poor, who would
          be rich; tormenting the rich, who would be richer. The covetous man
          pines to see pleasure; is sad in the presence of cheerfulness; and the
          joy of the world is his sorrow, because all the happiness of others is
          not his. I do not wonder that God abhors him. He inspects his heart as
          he would a cave full of noisome birds, or a nest of rattling reptiles,
          and loathes the sight of its crawling tenants. To the covetous man
          life is a nightmare, and God lets him wrestle with it as best he may.
          Mammon might build its palace on such a heart, and Pleasure bring all
          its revelry there, Honour all its garlands -- it would be like
          pleasures in a sepulchre, and garlands on a tomb." When a man becomes
          avaricious, all he has is nothing to him; "More, more, more!" says he,
          like some poor creatures in a terrible fever, who cry, "Drink, drink,
          drink!" and you give them drink, but after they have it, their thirst
          increases. Like the horse-leech they cry, "Give, give, give!" Avarice
          is a raving madness which seeks to grasp the world in its arms, and
          yet despises the plenty it has already. This is a curse of which many
          have died; and some have died with the bag of gold in their hands, and
          with misery upon their brow, because they could not take it with them
          into their coffin, and could not carry it into another world. Well,
          then, there comes the next course. Baxter, and those terrible old
          preachers used to picture the miser, and the man who lived only to
          make gold, in the middle of hell; and they imagined Mammon pouring
          melted gold down his throat, "There," say the mocking devils, "that is
          what you wanted, you have got it now; drink, drink, drink!" and the
          molten gold is poured down. I shall not, however, indulge in any such
          terrible imaginations, but this much I know, he that liveth to himself
          here, must perish; he who sets his affections upon things on earth,
          hath not digged deep -- he has built his house upon the sands; and
          when the rain descends, and the floods come, down must come his house,
          and great must be the fall thereof. It is the best wine first,
          however; it is the respectable man, -- respectable and respected, --
          everybody honours him, -- and afterwards that which is worse, when
          meanness has beggared his wealth, and covetousness has maddened his
          brain. It is sure to come, as sure as ever you give yourself up to
          worldliness.

          4. The fourth table is set in a very secluded corner, in a very
          private part of Satan's palace. There is the table set for secret
          sinners, and here the old rule is observed. At that table, in a room
          well darkened, I see a young man sitting to-day, and Satan is the
          servitor, stepping in so noiselessly, that no one would hear him. He
          brings in the first cup -- and O how sweet it is! It is the cup of
          secret sin. "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
          pleasant." How sweet that morsel, eaten all alone! Was there ever one
          that rolled so delicately under the tongue? That is the first; after
          that, he brings in another, -- the wine of an unquiet conscience. The
          man's eyes are opened. He says, "What have I done? What have I been
          doing? Ah," cries this Achan, "the first cup you brought me, I saw
          sparkling in that a wedge of gold, and a goodly Babylonish garment;
          and I thought, Oh, I must have that;' but now my thought is, What
          shall I do to hide this, where shall I put it? I must dig. Ay, I must
          dig deep as hell before I shall hide it, for sure enough it will be
          discovered."
        </p>
        <p>
          The grim governor of the feast is bringing in a massive bowl, filled
          with a black mixture. The secret sinner drinks, and is confounded; he
          fears his sin will find him out. He has no peace, no happiness, he is
          full of uneasy fear; he is afraid that he shall be detected. He dreams
          at night that there is some one after him; there is a voice whispering
          in his ear, and telling him "I know all about it; I will tell it." He
          thinks, perhaps, that the sin which he has committed in secret will
          break out to his friends; the father will know it, the mother will
          know it. Ay, it may be even the physician will tell the tale, and blab
          out the wretched secret. For such a man there is no rest. He is always
          in dread of arrest. He is like the debtor I have read of; who, owing a
          great deal of money, was afraid the bailiffs were after him: and
          happening one day to catch his sleeve on the top of a palisade, said,
          "There, let me go; I'm in a hurry. I will pay you to-morrow,"
          imagining that some one was laying hold of him. Such is the position
          in which the man places himself by partaking of the hidden things of
          dishonesty and sin. Thus he finds no rest for the sole of his foot for
          fear of discovery. At last the discovery comes; it is the last cup.
          Often it comes on earth; for be sure your sin will find you out, and
          it will generally find you out here. What frightful exhibitions are to
          be seen at our police courts of men that are made to drink that last
          black draught of discovery. The man who presided at religious
          meetings, the man who was honoured as a saint, is at last unmasked.
          And what saith the judge -- and what saith the world of him? He is a
          jest, and a reproach, and a rebuke everywhere. But, suppose he should
          be so crafty, that he passes through life without discovery -- though
          I think it is almost impossible -- what a cup he must drink when he
          stands at last before the bar of God! "Bring him forth, jailor! Dread
          keeper of the dungeon of hell, lead forth the prisoner." He comes! The
          whole world is assembled, "Stand up, sir! Did you not make a
          profession of religion? did not every body think you a saint?" He is
          speechless. But many there are in that vast crowd who cry, "We thought
          him so." The book is open, his deeds are read: transgression after
          transgression all laid bare. Do you hear that hiss? The righteous,
          moved to indignation, are lifting up their voices against the man who
          deceived them, and dwelt among them as a wolf in sheep's clothing. Oh,
          how fearful it must be to bear the scorn of the universe! The good can
          bear the scorn of the wicked but for the wicked to bear the shame and
          everlasting contempt which righteous indignation will heap upon them,
          will be one of the most frightful things, next to the eternal
          endurance of the wrath of the Most High, which, I need not add, is the
          last cup of the devil's terrible feast, with which the secret sinner
          most be filled, for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pause now, but it is just to gather up my strength to beg that
          anything I may have said, that shall have the slightest personal
          bearing upon any of my hearers, may not be forgotten. I beseech you,
          men and brethren, if now you are eating the fat, and drinking the
          sweet of hell's banquet, pause and reflect what shall the end be? "He
          that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption. He that
          soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting." I
          cannot spare more time far that, most assuredly.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But you must pardon me while I occupy only a few minutes in taking
          you into the HOUSE OF THE SAVIOUR, where he feasts his beloved. Come
          and sit with us at Christ's table of outward providences. He does not
          feast his children after the fashion of the prince of darkness: for
          the first cup that Christ brings to them is very often a cup of
          bitterness. There are his own beloved children, his own redeemed; who
          have but sorry cheer. Jesus brings in the cup of poverty and
          affliction, and he makes his own children drink of it, till they say,
          "Thou hast made me drunken with wormwood, and thou hast filled me with
          bitterness." This is the way Christ begins. The worst wine first. When
          the serjeant begins with a young recruit, he gives him a shilling, and
          then, afterwards, come the march and the battle. But Christ never
          takes his recruits so. They must count the cost, lest they should
          begin to build, and not be able to finish. He seeks to have no
          disciples who are dazzled with first appearances. He begins roughly
          with them, and many have been his children who have found that the
          first course of the Redeemer's table has been affliction, sorrow,
          poverty, and want.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the olden time, when the best of God's people were at the table, he
          used to serve them worst, for they wandered about in sheep-skins and
          goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world
          was not worthy, and they kept on drinking of these bitter cups for
          many a day; but let me tell you afterwards he brought out sweeter cups
          for them, and you that have been troubled have found it so. After the
          cup of affliction, comes the cup of consolation, and, oh, how sweet is
          that! It has been the privilege of these lips to drink that cup after
          sickness and pain; and I can bear witness, that I said of my Master,
          "Thou hast kept the best wine until now." It was so luscious, that the
          taste thereof did take away every taste of the bitterness of sorrow;
          and I said, "Surely the bitterness of this sickness is all past, for
          the Lord has manifested himself to me, and given me his best wine."
          But, beloved, the best wine is to come last. God's people will find it
          so outwardly. The poor saint comes to die. The master has given him
          the cup of poverty, but now no more he drinks thereof, he is rich to
          all the intents of bliss. He has had the cup of sickness; he shall
          drink of that no more. He has had the cup of persecution, but now he
          is glorified, together with his Master, and made to sit upon his
          throne. The best things have come last to him in outward
          circumstances. There were two martyrs once burned at Stratford-le-Bow;
          one of them was lame, and the other blind, and when they were tied to
          the stake, the lame man took his crutch and threw it down, and said to
          the other, "Cheer up, brother, this is the sharp physic that shall
          heal us, I shall not be lame within an hour of this time nor shalt
          thou be blind." No, the best things were to come last. But I have
          often thought that the child of God is very much like the crusaders.
          The crusaders started of on their journey, and they had to tight their
          way through many miles of enemies and to march through leagues of
          danger. You remember, perhaps, in history, the story that when the
          armies of the Duke of Bouillon came in sight of Jerusalem, they sprang
          from their horses, clapped their hands, and cried, "Jerusalem,
          Jerusalem, Jerusalem." They forgot all their toils, all the weariness
          of the journey and all their wounds, for there was Jerusalem in their
          sight. And how will the saint at last cry, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem,"
          when all sorrow, and all poverty, and sickness are past, and he is
          blest with immortality. The bad wine -- bad did I say? nay the bitter
          wine is taken away, and the best wine is brought out, and the saint
          sees himself glorified for ever with Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, we will sit down at the table of inward experience. The first
          cup that Christ brings to his children, when they sit at that table,
          is one so bitter that, perhaps, no tongue can ever describe it, -- it
          is the cup of conviction. It is a black cup, full of the most intense
          bitterness. The apostle Paul once drank a little of it, but it was so
          strong that it made him blind for three days. The conviction of his
          sin overpowered him totally; he could only give his soul to fasting
          and to prayer, and it was only when he drank of the next cup that the
          scales fell from off his eyes. I have drank of it, children of God,
          and I thought that Jesus was unkind, but, in a little while, he
          brought me forth a sweeter cup, the cup of his forgiving love, filled
          with the rich crimson of his precious blood. Oh! the taste of that
          wine is in my mouth this very hour, for the taste thereof is as the
          wine of Lebanon, that abideth in the cask for many a day. Do you not
          remember, when, after you had drunk the cup of sorrow, Jesus came and
          showed you his hands and his side, and said, "Sinner, I have died for
          thee, and given myself for thee; believe on me?" Do you not remember
          how you believed, and sipped the cup, and bow you believed again and
          took a deeper draught, and said, "Blessed be the name of God from this
          time forth and for ever; and let the whole earth say, Amen,' for he
          hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder,
          and let the captives go free?" Since then the glorious Master has said
          to you, "Friend, come up higher!" and he has taken you to upper seats
          in the best rooms, and he has given you sweeter things. I will not
          tell you, to-day, of the wines you have drank. The spouse in Solomon's
          Song may supply the deficiency of my sermon this morning. She drank of
          the spiced wine of his pomegranate; and so have you, in those high and
          happy moments when you had fellowship with the Father, and with his
          Son, Jesus Christ. But tarry awhile, he has kept the best wine yet.
          You shall soon come near the banks of the Jordan, and then you shall
          begin to drink of the old wine of the kingdom, that has been barrelled
          up since the foundation of the world. The vintage of the Saviour's
          agony; the vintage of Gethsemane shall soon be broached for you, the
          old wine of the kingdom. You are come into the land "Beulah," and you
          begin to taste the full flavour of the wines on the lees well refined.
          You know how Bunyan describes the state which borders on the vale of
          death. It was a land flowing with milk and honey; a land where the
          angels often came to visit the saints, and to bring bundles of myrrh
          from the land of spices. And now the high step is taken, the Lord puts
          his finger upon your eyelids and kisses your soul out at your lips.
          Where are you now? In a sea of love, and life, and bliss, and
          immortality. "O Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, thou hast indeed kept the best
          wine until now! My Master! I have seen thee on the Sabbath, but this
          is an everlasting Sabbath. I have met thee in the congregation, but
          this is a congregation that shall ne'er break up. O my Master! I have
          seen the promises, but this is the fulfilment. I have blessed thee for
          gracious providences, but this is something more than all these: thou
          didst give me grace, but now thou hash given me glory; thou wast once
          my shield, but thou art now my sun. I am at thy right hand, where
          there is fullness of joy for ever. Thou hast kept thy best wine until
          now. All I ever had before was as nothing compared with this."

          And, lastly, for only time fails me, I could preach a week upon this
          subject. The table of communion is one at which God's children must
          sit. And the first thing they must drink of there, is the cup of
          communion with Christ in his sufferings. If thou wouldst come to the
          table of communion with Christ, thou must first of all drink of the
          wine of Calvary. Christian, thy head most he crowned with thorns. Thy
          hands must be pierced, I mean not with nails, but, spiritually thou
          must be crucified with Christ. We must suffer with him, or else we
          cannot reign with him; we must labour with him first, we must sup of
          the wine which his Father gave him to drink, or else we cannot expect
          to come to the better part of the feast. After drinking of the wine of
          his sufferings, and continuing to drink of it, we must drink of the
          cup of his labours, we must be baptized with his baptism, we must
          labour after souls, and sympathise with him in that ambition of his
          heart -- the salvation of sinners, and after that he will give us to
          drink of the cup of his anticipated honours. Here on earth we shall
          have good wine in communion with Christ in his resurrection, in his
          triumphs and his victories, but the best wine is to come at last. O
          chambers of communion, your gates have been opened to me; but I have
          only been able to glance within them; but the day is coming when on
          your diamond hinges ye shall turn, and stand wide open for ever and
          ever; and I shall enter into the king's palace and go no more out. O
          Christian! thou shalt soon see the King in his beauty; thy head shall
          soon be on his bosom; thou shalt soon sit at his feet with Mary; thou
          shalt soon do as the spouse did, thou shalt kiss him with the kisses
          of thy lips, and feel that his love is better than wine. I can
          conceive you, brethren, in the very last moment of your life, or
          rather, in the first moment of your life, saying, "He has kept the
          best wine until now." When you begin to see him face to face, when you
          enter into the closest fellowship, with nothing to disturb or to
          distract you, then shall you say "The best wine is kept until now."

          A saint was once dying, and another who sat by him said -- "Farewell,
          brother, I shall never see you again in the land of the living." "Oh,"
          said the dying man, "I shall see you again in the land of the living
          that is up yonder, where I am going; this is the land of the dying."
          Oh brethren and sisters, if we should never meet again in the land of
          the dying, have we a hope that we shall meet in the land of the
          living, and drink the last wine at last.<br />
