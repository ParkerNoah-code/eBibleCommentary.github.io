        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.140)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, July 12, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." --
          Romans 10:13.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT has been said by an eminent divine that many of us in preaching the
          word suppose too great knowledge in our hearers. "Very often," says
          this divine, "there are in the congregation persons who are totally
          unacquainted with the great science of divinity. They are entire
          strangers to the whole system of grace and salvation." It is proper,
          then, that the preacher should address himself to his hearers
          sometimes as if they were totally ignorant of his message, and tell it
          to them as a new thing, going over the whole of it as if he believed
          them to be ignorant of it; "For," says this good man, "it is better to
          suppose too little knowledge, and so to explain the thing clearly, to
          the meanest comprehension, than to suppose too much, and thus to let
          the ignorant escape without a word of instruction."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think, I shall not this morning err in his point of view, for I
          shall assume that some of my congregation, at least, are totally
          unacquainted with the great plan of salvation. And you that know it
          well, and have tried its preciousness, will bear with me, I am sure,
          whilst I try in the simplest words that human lips can put together to
          tell out the story of how men are lost, and how men are saved
          according to the words of my text by calling upon the name of the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well then, we must begin at the beginning. And we must first tell our
          hearers, that inasmuch as our text talks of men being saved, it
          implies that men need saving, and we tell them that if men had been as
          God created them, they would have needed no saving. Adam in the garden
          wanted no salvation, he was perfect, pure, clean, holy, and acceptable
          before God. He was our representative, he stood as the representative
          for all the race, and when he touched the forbidden fruit, and ate of
          the tree of which God had said, "Thou shalt not eat thereof, or thou
          shalt surely die." When he so transgressed against God, he needed a
          Saviour and we, his offspring through his sin, are born into this
          world, each of us needing a Saviour. We, who are now present, must not
          however throw blame on Adam; no man was ever yet damned for Adam's sin
          alone. Children dying in infancy are, without doubt, saved by
          sovereign grace through the atonement which is in Christ Jesus. No
          sooner do they close their eyes to earth than being innocent of any
          actual sin they at once open them on the bliss of heaven. But you and
          I are not children. We need not talk just now of Adam's sins. We have
          our own to a count for, and God knoweth they are enough. Holy
          Scripture tells us that we all have sinned, and come short of the
          glory of God, and conscience beareth witness to the same truth. We
          have all broken the great commands of God, and in consequence thereof
          the just God is bound in justice to punish us for the sins we have
          committed. Now, my brethren, it is because you and I have broken the
          divine law, and are subject to the divine wrath, that we stand in need
          of mercy. Every one of us therefore -- every one of us if we would be
          happy, if we would dwell in heaven with God for ever, must be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is great confusion in the minds of men as to what being
          saved is. Allow me, then, just to say, that salvation means two
          things. It means in the first place, our escaping from the punishment
          of sins committed; and it means in the next place, the escaping from
          the habit of sin, so that in future we shall not live as we have
          lived. The way in which God saves you is twofold: he finds man a
          sinner breaking his law, he says, "I forgive you, I will not punish
          you. I have punished Christ instead of you -- you shall be saved." But
          that is only half the work. He says in the next place -- "Man, I will
          not let you go on sinning as you have been wont to do; I will give you
          a new heart, which shall subdue your evil habits. So that whereas you
          have been the slave of sin, you shall be free to serve me. Come away,
          you are not going to serve that black master of yours any more, you
          must leave that demon, I will have you to be my child, my servant.
          Thou sayest, I cannot do so.' Come, I will give thee grace to do it; I
          give thee grace to break off drunkenness, grace to renounce thy
          swearing, grace to give up Sabbath-breaking; I give thee grace to run
          in the ways of my commandments, and to find them to be a delightful
          road." Salvation, then, I say, consists of two things -- deliverance
          on the one hand from the habit of living in enmity with God; and, on
          the other hand, from the punishment annexed to transgression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great subject of this morning, which I shall attempt to dwell upon
          in very plain language; attempting no flights of oratory whatever --
          is, how men may be saved. That is the one great question. Let them
          remember what to be saved is. It is to be made Christians, to have new
          thoughts, new minds new hearts, and then, it is to have a new home for
          ever at God's right hand in bliss. How may they be saved? "What must I
          do to be saved?" is a cry springing from many lips here this morning.
          The answer of my text is this -- "Whosoever shall call upon the name
          of the Lord shall be saved." I shall first try to explain the text a
          little -- explanation. Secondly, I shall try to clear the text from
          some errors about salvation, which are very popular -- that will be
          refutation. And then, thirdly, I shall press the usefulness of my text
          upon your minds: that will be exhortation. Explanation, refutation,
          exhortation, you will remember the points, and may God impress them
          upon your minds!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, EXPLANATION -- What is here meant by calling upon the
          name of the Lord? And I tremble at this very moment, when I try to
          explain my text, for I feel it is very easy to darken words without
          knowledge." Full many a time has a preacher rendered Scripture dark by
          his explanations, instead of making it brighter. Many a preacher has
          been like a painted window, shutting out the light, instead of
          admitting it. There is nothing whatever puzzles me more, and tries my
          mind more, than the answer to that simple question, What is faith?
          What is believing? What is calling upon the name of the Lord? In order
          to get the true sense of this, I turned to my concordance, and looked
          out the passages where the same word is employed; and, so far as I can
          judge, I may state from the authority of Scripture, that the word
          "call" signifies worship, so that I might translate it thus --
          "Whosoever worships God shall be saved." But you must let me explain
          that word "worship" according to the Scripture signification of it
          which must be received, in order to explain the word "call."
        </p>
        <p>
          To call upon the name of the Lord, in the first place, signifies to
          worship God. You will find in the book of Genesis that, "when men
          began to multiply upon the face of the earth, then began men to call
          upon the name of the Lord." That is they began to worship God, they
          builded altars in his name, they certified their belief in the
          sacrifice that was to come, by offering a typical sacrifice upon the
          altar they had reared, they bowed their knee in prayer; they lifted
          their voice in sacred song, and cried, "Great is Jehovah, Creator,
          Preserver, let him be praised, world without end." Now, whosoever --
          whoever he may be in the wide, wide world, who is enabled by grace to
          worship God, in God's way, shall be saved. If you worship him by a
          Mediator, having faith in the atonement of the cross, if you worship
          him by humble prayer and hearty praise, your worship is a proof that
          you shall be saved. You could not thus worship, unless you had grace
          within your heart, and your faith and grace are a proof that you shall
          have glory. Whosoever, then in lowly devotion, on the green sward,
          beneath the wide-spreading branches of a tree, beneath the vault of
          God's heaven, or in God's house, or out of it -- whosoever shall
          worship God with a pure heart fervently, looking for acceptance
          through the atonement of Christ, and meekly casting himself upon the
          mercy of God, shall be saved. So stands the promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          But lest any man should run away with a mistaken idea of what worship
          is, we must just explain a little further. The word "call," in holy
          Scripture meaning, signifies prayer. You remember the case of Elijah:
          when the prophets of Baal roughs to get rain from the false god, he
          said, "I will call upon God" -- that is to say, "I will pray to God
          that he may send the rain." Now, prayer is a sure sign of divine life
          within. Whosoever prayeth to God through Christ, with sincere prayer
          shall be saved. Oh, I can remember how this text cheered me once. I
          felt the weight of sin, and I did not know the Saviour. I thought God
          would blast me with his wrath, and smite me with his hot displeasure!
          From chapel to chapel I went to hear the word preached, but never a
          gospel sentence did I hear; but this one text just preserved me from
          what I believe I should have been driven to -- the commission of
          suicide through grief and sorrow. It was this sweet word -- "Whosoever
          shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Well, I thought,
          I cannot believe on Christ as I could wish. I cannot find pardon, but
          I know I call upon his name, I know I pray, ay, and pray with groans
          and tears and sighs day and night; and if I am ever lost, I will plead
          that promise -- "Oh God thou saidst, he that calleth upon thy name
          shall be saved; I did call; wilt thou cast me away? I did plead thy
          promise; I did lift up my heart in prayer; canst thou be just, and yet
          damn the man who did really pray?" But mark that sweet thought: prayer
          is the certain forerunner of salvation. Sinner, thou canst not pray
          and perish; prayer and perishing are two things that never go
          together. I ask you not what your prayer is; it may be a groan, it may
          be a tear, a wordless prayer, or a prayer in broken English,
          ungrammatical and harsh to the ear: but if it be a prayer from the
          inmost heart, thou shalt be saved; or else this promise is a lie. As
          surely as thou prayest whoever thou mayest be whatever thy past life,
          whatever the transgressions in which thou hast indulged, though they
          be the foulest which pollute mankind, yet if from thine heart thou
          hast learned to pray --
        </p>
        <p>"Prayer is the breath of God in man</p>
        <p>Returning whence it came" --</p>
        <p>
          And thou canst not perish with God's breath in thee. "Whosoever shall
          call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved!"
        </p>
        <p>
          But the word "call" signifies a little more, it signifies trust. A man
          cannot call upon the name of the Lord, unless he trusts in that name.
          We must have reliance upon the name of Christ, or else we have not
          called aright. Hear me, then, poor tried sinner; thou hast come here
          this morning sensible of thy guilt, awakened to thy danger; here is
          thy remedy. Christ Jesus the Son of God, became a man; he was "born of
          the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead
          and buried." He did this to save sinners such as thou art. Wilt thou
          believe this? Wilt thou trust thy soul to it? Wilt thou say "Sink or
          swim, Christ Jesus is my hope; and if I perish I will perish with my
          arms around his cross, crying --
        </p>
        <p>'Nothing in my hands I bring</p>
        <p>Simply to the cross I cling?'"</p>
        <p>
          Poor soul, if thou canst do that, thou wilt be saved. Come, now, no
          good works of thine own are needed -- no sacraments, all that is asked
          of thee is this, and that he gives thee. Thou art nothing; wilt thou
          take Christ to be everything? Come, thou art black, wilt thou be
          washed? Wilt thou down on thy knees, and cry, "Lord, have mercy upon
          me, a sinner, not for anything I have done, or can do, but for his
          dear sake, whose blood streamed from his hands and feet, in whom alone
          I trust?" Why sinner the solid pillars of the universe shall totter
          rather than thou shouldst perish; ay heaven should weep a vacant
          throne, and an extinguished Godhead, rather than the promise should be
          violated in any case in the world. He that trusteth in Christ, calling
          on his name, shall be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once more, and then I think I shall have given you the whole
          scripture meaning of this. Calling on the name of the Lord signifies
          professing his name. You remember what Ananias said to Saul,
          afterwards called Paul, "arise and be baptized, and wash away thy
          sins, calling upon the name of the Lord." Now, sinner if thou wouldst
          be obedient to Christ's word, Christ's word says, "He that believeth,
          and is immersed, shall be saved." Mark, I have translated the word.
          King James would not have it translated. I dare not be unfaithful to
          my knowledge of God's word. If it means sprinkle, let our brethren
          translate it "sprinkle." But they dare not do that; they know they
          have nothing in all classical language that would ever justify them in
          doing that, and they have not the impudence to attempt it. But I dare
          translate it -- "He that believeth, and is immersed, shall be saved."
          And though immersion is nothing, yet God requires of men who believe
          that they should be immersed, in order to make a profession of their
          belief. Immersion is nothing, I repeat, in salvation, it is the
          profession of salvation; but God requires that every man that puts his
          trust in the Saviour should be immersed, as the Saviour was, in order
          to the fulfillment of righteousness. Jesus went meekly down from
          Jordan's shore, to be immersed beneath the wares; and so let every
          believer be baptized in his name. Now some of you draw back from the
          thought of making a profession. "No," you say, "we will believe and be
          secret Christians." Hear you this then -- "If any man be ashamed of
          me, and of my words in this generation; of him will I be ashamed, when
          I shall come in the glory of my Father, with all his holy angels." I
          will repeat a truism; not one of you in your lives ever knew a secret
          Christian, and I will prove it to demonstration. For if you knew a man
          to be a Christian, it could not be a secret; for if it had been a
          secret how came you to know it? Then, as you never knew a secret
          Christian, you are not justified in believing there ever is such a
          one. You must come out and make a profession. What would Her Majesty
          think of her soldiers, if they should swear they were loyal and true,
          and were to say -- "Your Majesty, we prefer not to wear these
          regimentals; let us wear the dress of civilians! We are right honest
          men and upright; but we do not care to stand in your ranks,
          acknowledged as your soldiers, we had rather slink into the enemy's
          camp, and into your camps too, and not wear anything that would mark
          us as being your soldiers!" Ah! some of you do the same with Christ.
          You are going to be secret Christians, are you, and slink into the
          devil's camp, and into Christ's camp, but acknowledged by none? Well,
          ye must take the chance of it, if ye will be so; but I should not like
          to risk it. It is a solemn threatening, "of him will I be ashamed when
          I come in the glory of my Father, and all his holy angels with me!" It
          is a solemn thing, I say, when Christ says, "Except a man take up his
          cross and follow me, he cannot be my disciple." Now, then, I claim of
          every sinner here whom God has awakened to feel his need of a Saviour,
          obedience to the command of Christ, in this point, as well as in every
          other. Hear the way of salvation: worship, prayer, faith, profession.
          And the profession, if men would be obedient, if they would follow the
          Bible, must be done in Christ's way, by a baptism in water, in the
          name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. God requireth
          this; and though men are saved without any baptism, and multitudes fly
          to heaven who are never washed in the stream, though baptism is not
          saving, yet if men would be saved, they must not be disobedient. And
          inasmuch as God gives a command, it is mine to enforce it. Jesus said,
          "Go and preach the gospel to every creature: he that believeth, and is
          immersed, shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, then, is the explanation of my text. No churchman here can
          object to my interpretation. The Church of England holdeth dipping. It
          only saith, if children be weak they are to be sprinkled; and it is
          marvellous what a many weakly children there have been born lately. I
          am astonished to find any of you alive, after finding that so much
          weakness has everywhere existed! The dear little ones are so tender,
          that a few drops suffice instead of the dipping which their own church
          enforces. I would that all churchmen were better churchmen; if they
          would be more consistent with their own articles of faith, they would
          be more consistent with Scripture, and if they were a little more
          consistent with some of the rubrics of their own church, they would be
          a little more consistent with themselves. If your children are weak,
          you can let them be sprinkled; but if you are good churchmen you will
          immerse them, if they can bear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now, the second point is REFUTATION. There are some popular
          errors with regard to salvation, which need to be cured by refutation.
          My text says, "whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
          saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, one idea which conflicts with my text is this, that a priest or a
          minister is absolutely necessary to assist men in salvation. That idea
          is current in other places besides the Romish Church; there are many,
          alas! too many who make a dissenting minister as much their priest as
          the Catholic makes his priest his helper. There are many who imagine
          that salvation cannot be accomplished except in some undefinable and
          mysterious way -- and the minister and the priest are mixed up with
          it. Hear ye then, if you had never seen a minister in your lives, if
          you had never heard the voice of the bishop of the church, or an elder
          thereof, yet if ye did call on the name of the Lord your salvation
          would be quite as sure without one as with one. Men cannot call upon a
          God they do not know. The necessity of a preacher lies in telling what
          the way of salvation is, for how can they hear without a preacher, and
          how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? But the
          preacher's office goes no further than just the telling of the
          message, and after we have told it, God, the Holy Spirit, must apply
          it; for further we cannot go. Oh, take care of priestcraft, take care
          of mancraft, of ministercraft, of clergycraft. All God's people are
          clergy, we are all God's cleros, all his clergy, if we have been
          anointed with the Holy Spirit, and are saved. There never ought to
          have been a distinction between clergy and laity. We are all clergy
          who love the Lord Jesus Christ, and you are as much fit to preach the
          gospel, if God has given you the ability, and called you to the work
          by his Spirit as any man alive. No priestly hand, no hand of
          presbyterian -- which means priest written large -- no ordination of
          men is necessary; we stand upon the rights of manhood to speak what we
          believe, and next to that we stand upon the call of God's Spirit in
          the heart bidding us testify his truth. But, brethren, neither Paul,
          nor an angel from heaven, nor Apollos, nor Cephas can help you in
          salvation. It is not of man, neither by men, and neither Pope, nor
          Archbishop, nor bishop, nor priest, nor minister, nor any one hath any
          grace to give to others. We must each of us go ourselves to the
          fountain-head, pleading this promise -- "Whosoever calleth on the name
          of the Lord Jesus, shall be saved." If I were shut up in the mines of
          Siberia, where I could never hear the gospel, if I did call upon the
          name of Christ the road is just as straight without the minister as
          with him, and the path to heaven is just as clear from the wilds of
          Africa, and from the dens of the prisonhouse and the dungeon, as it is
          from the sanctuary of God. Nevertheless for edification, all
          Christians love the ministry, though not for salvation; though neither
          in priest nor preacher do they trust, yet the word of God is sweet to
          them, and beautiful on the mountains are the feet of them that bring
          glad tidings of peace."

          Another very common error is, that a good dream is a most splendid
          thing in order to save people. Some of you do not know the extent to
          which this error prevails. I happen to know it. It is received among
          many persons, that if you dream that you see the Lord in the night you
          will be saved, and if you can see him on the cross, or if you think
          you see some angels, or if you dream that God says to you, "You are
          forgiven, all is well;" but if you do not have a very nice dream you
          cannot be saved. So some people think. Now, if it be so, the sooner we
          all begin to eat opium the better; because there is nothing that makes
          people dream so much as that, and the best advice I could give would
          be -- let every minister distribute opium very largely, and then his
          people would all dream themselves into heaven. But, out upon that
          rubbish; there is nothing in it. Dreams, the disordered fabrics of a
          wild imagination; the totterings often of the fair pillars of a grand
          conception; how can they be the means of salvation? You know Rowland
          Hill's good answer; I must quote it, in default of a better. When a
          woman pleaded that she was saved because she dreamed, he said, "Well,
          my good woman, it is very nice to have good dreams when you are
          asleep; but I want to see how you act when you are awake; for if your
          conduct is not consistent in religion when you are awake I will not
          give a snap of the finger for your dreams." Ah, I do marvel that ever
          any person should go to such a depth of ignorance as to tell me the
          stories that I have heard myself about dreams. Poor dear creatures,
          when they were sound asleep they saw the gates of heaven opened, and a
          white angel came and washed their sins away, and then they saw that
          they were pardoned; and since then they have never had a doubt or a
          fear. It is time that you should begin to doubt, then very good time
          that you should; for if that is all the hope you have, it is a poor
          one. Remember it is, "whosoever calls upon the name of God," not
          whosoever dreams about him. Dreams may do good. Sometimes people have
          been frightened out of their senses in them; and they were better out
          of their senses than they were in, for they did more mischief when
          they were in their senses than they did when they were out; and the
          dreams did good in that sense. Some people, too, have become alarmed
          by dreams; but to trust to them is to trust to a shadow, to build your
          hopes on bubbles, scarcely needing a puff of wind to burst them into
          nothingness. Oh! remember, you want no vision, no marvellous
          appearance. If you have had a vision or a dream, you need not despise
          it; it may have benefitted you: but do not trust to it. But if you
          have had none, remember that is the mere calling upon God's name to
          which the promise is appended.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, once again, there are others, very good sort of people too,
          that have been laughing while I was talking about dreams, and now it
          is our turn to laugh at them. There are some people who think they
          must have some very wonderful kind of feelings, or else they cannot be
          saved; some most extraordinary thoughts such as they never had before,
          or else certainly they cannot be saved. A woman once applied to me for
          admission to church-membership. So I asked her whether she had ever
          had a change of heart. She said, "Oh yes sir, such a change as you
          know," she said, "I felt it across the chest so singular, sir; and
          when I was a praying one day I felt as if I did not know what was the
          matter with me, I felt so different. And when I went to the chapel,
          sir, one night, I came away and felt so different from what I felt
          before, so light." "Yes," I said "light-headed, my dear soul, that is
          what you felt, but nothing more, I am afraid." The good woman was
          sincere enough; she thought it was all right with her, because
          something had affected her lungs, or in some way stirred her physical
          frame. "No," I hear some of you say, "people cannot be so stupid as
          this." I assure you that if you could read the hearts of this present
          congregation, you would find there are hundreds here that have no
          better hope of heaven than that, for I am dealing with a very popular
          objection just now. "I thought," said one addressing me one day, "I
          thought when I was in the garden, sure Christ could take my sins away,
          just as easily as he could move the clouds. Do you know, sir, in a
          moment or two the cloud was all gone, and the sun was shining. Thought
          I to myself, the Lord is blotting out my sin." Such a ridiculous
          thought as that, you say, cannot occur often. I tell you, it does,
          very frequently indeed. People get supposing that the veriest nonsense
          in all the earth is a manifestation of divine grace in their hearts,
          Now, the only feeling I ever want to have is just this, -- I want to
          feel that I am a sinner and that Christ is my Saviour. You may keep
          your visions, and ecstasies and raptures, and dancings to yourselves;
          the only feeling that I desire to have is deep repentance and humble
          faith; and if, poor sinner, you have got that, you are saved. Why,
          some of you believe that before you can be saved there must be a kind
          of electric-shock, some very wonderful thing that is to go all through
          you from head to foot. Now hear this, "The word is nigh thee, in thy
          mouth and in thy heart. If thou dost with thy heart believe on the
          Lord Jesus Christ and with thy mouth dost confess, thou shalt be
          saved." What do ye want with all this nonsense of dreams and
          supernatural thoughts? All that is wanted is, that as a guilty sinner
          I should come and cast myself on Christ. That done, the soul is safe,
          and all the visions in the universe could not make it safer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I have one more error to try to rectify. Among very poor
          people -- and I have visited some of them, and know what I say to be
          true, and there are some here, and I will speak to them, -- among the
          very poor and uneducated, there is a very current idea that somehow or
          other salvation is connected with learning to read and write. You
          smile, perhaps, but I know it. Often has a poor woman said, "Oh! sir,
          this is no good to poor ignorant creatures like us; there is no hope
          for me, sir; I cannot read. Do you know, sir, I don't know a letter? I
          think if I could read a bit I might be saved; but, ignorant as I am, I
          do not know how I call: for I have got no understanding, sir." I have
          found this in the country districts too, among people who might learn
          to read if they liked. And there are none but can, unless they are
          lazy. And yet they sit down in cold indifference about salvation,
          under the notion that the parson could be saved, for he reads a
          chapter so nicely; that the clerk could be saved, for he said "Amen"
          so well; that the squire could be saved, for he knew a great deal, and
          had a vast many books in his library, but that they could not be
          saved, for they did not know anything, and that therefore it was
          impossible. Now, have I one such poor creature here? I will speak
          plainly to you. My poor friend, you do not want to know much to go to
          heaven. I would advise you to know as much as ever you can; do not be
          backward in trying to learn. But in regard to going to heaven, the way
          is so plaint that "the wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err
          therein." Do you feel that you have been guilty, that you have broken
          God's commandments that you have not kept his Sabbath, that you have
          taken his name in vain that you have not loved your neighbor as
          yourself, nor your God with all your heart. Well, if you feel it,
          Christ died for such as you; he died upon the cross, and was punished
          in your stead, and he tells you to believe it. If you want to hear
          more about it, come to the house of God and listen, and we will try to
          lead you to something else. But remember, all you want to know to get
          to heaven is the two things that begin with S. -- Sin and Saviour. Do
          you feel your sin? Christ is your Saviour trust to him pray to him;
          and as sure as you are here now, and I am talking to you, you will one
          day be in heaven. I will tell you two prayers to pray. First, pray
          this prayer, -- "Lord, show me myself." That is an easy one for you.
          Lord, show me myself, show me my heart, show me my guilt; show me my
          danger, Lord, show me myself. And, when you have prayed that prayer,
          and God has answered it, (and remember, he hears prayer) when he has
          answered it, and shown you yourself, here is another prayer for you,
          -- "Lord, show me thyself: Show me thy work, thy love, thy mercy, thy
          cross, thy grace." Pray that, and those are about the only prayers you
          want to pray, to get to heaven with, -- "Lord, show me myself;" "Lord,
          show me thyself." You do not want to know much, then. You need not
          spell, to get to heaven; you need not be able to speak English, to get
          to heaven; the ignorant and rude are welcome to the cross of Christ
          and salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excuse my thus answering these popular errors; I answer them because
          they are popular, and popular among some who are present. O men and
          women, hear the word of God once more. "Whosoever shall call upon the
          name of the Lord shall be saved." Man of eighty, child of eight, young
          man and maiden, rich, poor, literate, illiterate, to you is this
          preached in all its fullness and freeness, yea, to every creature
          under heaven "whosoever "( and that shuts out none,) "whosoever shall
          call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I have nothing to do except to finish with EXHORTATION.
          My exhortation is, I intreat you by the name of God believe the
          message which this day I declare from God's word. Do not turn away
          from me because the message is simply delivered, do not reject it
          because I have chosen to preach it simply and plainly to the poor, but
          hearken again, "Whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord shall be
          saved." I beseech you believe this. Does it seem hard to believe?
          Nothing is too hard for the Most High. Do you say, "I have been so
          guilty, I cannot think God will save me?" Hear Jehovah speak: "My
          thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your ways. As high
          as the heavens are above the earth, so high are my thoughts above your
          thoughts, my ways above your ways." Do you say, "I am excluded.
          Surely, you cannot mean that he would cave me?" Hark you; it says,
          "Whosoever" -- "whosoever" is a great wide door, and lets in big
          sinners. Oh, surely, if it says, "whosoever," you are not excluded if
          you call -- there is the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now come, I must plead with you, and I will use a few reasons to
          induce you to believe this truth. They shall be Scripture reasons May
          God bless them to you, sinner. If thou callest on Christ's name thou
          wilt be saved. I will tell thee first, thou wilt be saved because thou
          art elect. No man ever called on Christ's name yet who was not
          elected. That doctrine of election which puzzles many and frightens
          more, never need do so. If you believe, you are elect, if you call on
          the name of Christ you are elect, if you feel yourself to be a sinner,
          and put your trust in Christ you are elect. Now, the elect must be
          saved, for them there is no perdition. God has predestinated them unto
          eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck
          them out of Christ's hands. God does not choose men, and then cast
          them away; he does not elect them, and then cast them into the pit.
          Now, you are elect, you could not have called if you had not been
          elected your election is the cause of your calling, and inasmuch as
          you have called, an do call upon the name of God, you are God's elect.
          And from his book not death nor hell can ever erase your name. Tis an
          omnipotent decree. Jehovah's will be done! His chosen must be saved,
          though earth and hell oppose, his strong hand shall break their ranks,
          and lead his people through. You are one of these people. You shall at
          last stand before his throne, and see his smiling face in glory ever
          lasting, because you are elect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, another reason. If thou callest upon the name of the Lord thou
          shalt be saved, because thou art redeemed. Christ has bought thee, and
          paid for thee, poured out the hottest of his heart's blood to buy thy
          ransom, split his heart, and riven it to splinters to buy thy soul
          from wrath. Thou art a bought one, thou knowest it not, but I see the
          blood-mark on thy brow. If thou callest on his name though thou hast
          as yet no comfort, yet Christ has called thee his own. E'er since that
          day when he said "It is finished," -- Christ has said, "My delight is
          in him, for I have bought him with my blood," and because thou art
          bought thou shalt never perish. Not one of Jesus' blood-bought ones
          was ever lost yet. Howl, howl, O hell, but howl thou canst not over
          the damnation of a redeemed soul. Out upon the horrid doctrine that
          men are bought with blood, and yet are damned, it is too diabolical
          for me to believe. I know that what the Saviour did he did, and if he
          did redeem he did redeem, and those redeemed by him are positively
          redeemed from death and hell and wrath. I can never bring my mind to
          the unrighteous idea that Christ was punished for a man, and that such
          a man will be punished again. I never could see how Christ could stand
          in a man's stead and be punished for him, and yet that man be punished
          again. No, inasmuch as thou callest on God's name there is proof that
          Christ is thy ransom. Come, rejoice! If he was punished, God's justice
          cannot demand a double vengeance, first, at the bleeding Surety's
          hands and then again at thine. Come, soul put thine hand upon the
          Saviour's head, and say "Blest Jesus, thou wast punished for me." Oh,
          God, I am not afraid of thy vengeance. When my hand is on the
          atonement, smite, but thou must smite me through thy Son. Smite, if
          thou wilt, but thou canst not for thou hast smitten him, and sure thou
          wilt not smite again for the same offense. What! Did Christ at one
          tremendous draught of love, drink my damnation dry? and shall I be
          damned after that? God forbid! What! shall God be unrighteous forget
          the Redeemer's work for us and let the Saviour's blood be shed in
          vain? Not hell itself has ever indulged the thought which has only
          been worthy of the men who are traitors to God's truth. Ay, brethren,
          if ye call on Christ, if ye pray, if ye believe, ye may be quite sure
          of salvation, for ye are redeemed, and the redeemed must not perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I tell you one more reason? Believe this truth: it must be true.
          For it ye call upon the name of God, "In my Father's house," says
          Christ, "there are many mansions," and there is one there for you.
          Christ has prepared a house and a crown, from before the foundation of
          the world, for all them that believe. Come! dost thou think Christ
          will prepare a house, and not carry the inhabitant there? Will he make
          crowns, and then lose the heads that are to wear them! God forbid!
          Turn thine eye towards heaven. There is a seat there that must be
          filled, and must be filled by thee; there is a crown there that must
          be worn, and must be worn by thee. Oh! be of good cheer: heavens
          preparation shall not be too abundant, he shall make room for those
          that believe, and because he hath made that room those that believe
          shall come there. Oh! I would to God I might know that some soul could
          lay hold on this promise! Where are you? Are you standing away among
          the crowd there, or sitting here in the body of the hall or in the
          topmost gallery? Are you feeling your sins? Do you shed tears in
          secret on account of them? Do you lament your iniquities? Oh! take his
          promise -- "Whosoever (sweet whosoever!) -- whosoever calleth upon the
          name of the Lord shall be saved." Say thus. The devil says it is of no
          use for you to call; you have been a drunkard. Tell him it says,
          "Whosoever," "Nay," says the evil spirit, "it is of no use for you,
          you have never been to hear a sermon, or been in the house of God
          these last ten years." Tell him it says, "Whosoever." "No," says
          Satan, "remember the sins of last night, and how you have come up to
          the MUSIC HALL stained with lust." Tell the devil it says.
          "Whosoever," and that it is a foul falsehood of his, that you can call
          on God and yet be lost. No; tell him that --
        </p>
        <p>"If all the sins that men have done</p>
        <p>In thought, or word, or deed,</p>
        <p>Since worlds were made or time begun,</p>
        <p>Could meet on one poor head,</p>
        <p>The blood of Jesus Christ alone</p>
        <p>For all this guilt could well atone."</p>
        <p>
          Oh lay this to thine heart. May God's Spirit do it! "Whosoever calleth
          upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."<br />
