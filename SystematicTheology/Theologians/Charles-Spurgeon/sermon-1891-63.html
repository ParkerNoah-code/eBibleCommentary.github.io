          1. Let us return, however, to the remaining points of their system.
          For when they declare that, at the consummation of all things, their
          mother shall re-enter the Pleroma, and receive the Saviour as her
          consort; that they themselves, as being spiritual, when they have got
          rid of their animal souls, and become intellectual spirits, will be
          the consorts of the spiritual angels; but that the Demiurge, since
          they call him animal, will pass into the place of the Mother; that the
          souls of the righteous shall psychically repose in the intermediate
          place; -- when they declare that like will be gathered to like,
          spiritual things to spiritual, while material things continue among
          those that are material, they do in fact contradict themselves,
          inasmuch as they no longer maintain that souls pass, on account of
          their nature, into the intermediate place to those substances which
          are similar to themselves, but [that they do so] on account of the
          deeds done [in the body], since they affirm that those of the
          righteous do pass [into that abode], but those of the impious continue
          in the fire. For if it is on account of their nature that all souls
          attain to the place of enjoyment, and all belong to the intermediate
          place simply because they are souls, as being thus of the same nature
          with it, then it follows that faith is altogether superfluous, as was
          also the descent of the Saviour [to this world]. If, on the other
          hand, it is on account of their righteousness [that they attain to
          such a place of rest], then it is no longer because they are souls but
          because they are righteous. But if souls would have perished unless
          they had been righteous, then righteousness must have power to save
          the bodies also [which these souls inhabited]; for why should it not
          save them, since they, too, participated in righteousness? For if
          nature and substance are the means of salvation, then all souls shall
          be saved; but if righteousness and faith, why should these not save
          those bodies which, equally with the souls, will enter into
          immortality? For righteousness will appear, in matters of this kind,
          either impotent or unjust, if indeed it saves some substances through
          participating in it, but not others.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For it is manifest that those acts which are deemed righteous are
          performed in bodies. Either, therefore, all souls will of necessity
          pass into the intermediate place, and there will never be a judgment;
          or bodies, too, which have participated in righteousness, will attain
          to the place of enjoyment, along with the souls which have in like
          manner participated, if indeed righteousness is powerful enough to
          bring thither those substances which have participated in it. And then
          the doctrine concerning the resurrection of bodies which we believe,
          will emerge true and certain [from their system]; since, [as we hold,]
          God, when He resuscitates our mortal bodies which preserved
          righteousness, will render them incorruptible and immortal. For God is
          superior to nature, and has in Himself the disposition [to show
          kindness], because He is good; and the ability to do so, because He is
          mighty; and the faculty of fully carrying out His purpose, because He
          is rich and perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But these men are in all points inconsistent with themselves, when
          they decide that all souls do not enter into the intermediate place,
          but those of the righteous only. For they maintain that, according to
          nature and substance, three sorts [of being] were produced by the
          Mother: the first, which proceeded from perplexity, and weariness, and
          fear -- that is material substance; the second from impetuosity --
          that is animal substance; but that which she brought forth after the
          vision of those angels who wait upon Christ, is spiritual substance.
          If, then, that substance which she brought forth will by all means
          enter into the Pleroma because it is spiritual, while that which is
          material will remain below because it is material, and shall be
          totally consumed by the fire which burns within it, why should not the
          whole animal substance go into the intermediate place, into which also
          they send the Demiurge? But what is it which shall enter within their
          Pleroma? For they maintain that souls shall continue in the
          intermediate place, while bodies, because they possess material
          substance, when they have been resolved into matter, shall be consumed
          by that fire which exists in it; but their body being thus destroyed,
          and their soul remaining in the intermediate place, no part of man
          will any longer be left to enter in within the Pleroma. For the
          intellect of man -- his mind, thought, mental intention, and such like
          -- is nothing else than his soul; but the emotions and operations of
          the soul itself have no substance apart from the soul. What part of
          them, then, will still remain to enter into the Pleroma? For they
          themselves, in as far as they are souls, remain in the intermediate
          place; while, in as far as they are body, they will be consumed with
          the rest of matter.
