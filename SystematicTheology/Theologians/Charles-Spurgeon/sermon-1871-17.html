          "Thou art beautiful, O my love as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
          terrible as an army with banners." -- Song of Solomon 6:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          THERE are various estimates of the Christian church. Some think
          everything of her; some think nothing of her; and probably neither
          opinion is worth the breath which utters it. Neither Ritualists, who
          idolise their church, nor sceptics, who vilify all churches, have any
          such knowledge of the true spiritual church of Jesus Christ as to be
          entitled to give an opinion. The king's daughter is all glorious
          within, with a beauty which they are quite unable to appreciate. What
          is usually the most correct character which is obtainable of a woman?
          Shall we be guided by the praises of those neighbors who are on good
          terms with her, or by the scandal of those who make her the subject of
          ill-natured gossip? No; the most accurate judgment we are likely to
          get is that of her husband. Solomon saith in the Proverbs concerning
          the virtuous woman, "Her husband also riseth up, and he praiseth her."
          Of that fairest among women, the church of Christ, the same
          observation may be made. It is to her of small consequence to be
          judged of man's judgment, but it is her honor and joy to stand well in
          the love and esteem of her royal spouse, the Prince Emmanuel. Though
          the words before us are allegorical, and the whole song is crowded
          with metaphor and parable, yet the teaching is plain enough in this
          instance; it is evident that the Divine Bridegroom gives his bride a
          high place in his heart, and to him, whatever she may be to others,
          she is fair, lovely, comely, beautiful, and in the eyes of his love
          without a spot. Moreover, even to him there is not only a beauty of a
          soft and gentle kind in her, but a majesty, a dignity in her holiness,
          in her earnestness, in her consecration, which makes even him say of
          her that she is "terrible as an army with banners," "awful as a
          bannered army." She is every inch a queen: her aspect in the sight of
          her beloved is majestic. Take, then, the words of our text as an
          encomium upon Christ's church, pronounced by him who knows her best,
          and is best able to judge concerning her, and you learn that to his
          discerning eye she is not weak, dishonorable, and despicable, but
          bears herself as one of highest rank, consciously, joyously strong in
          her Lord's strength.

          On this occasion let us note, first of all, WHY IT IS THAT THE CHURCH
          OF GOD IS SAID TO BE AN ARMY WITH BANNERS. That she is an army is true
          enough, for the church is one, but many; and consists of men who march
          in order under a common leader, with one design in view and that
          design a conflict and a victory. She is the church militant here
          below, and both in suffering and in service she is made to prove that
          she is in an enemy's country. She is contending for the truth against
          error, for the light against darkness: till the day break and the
          shadows flee away, she must maintain her sentinels and kindle her
          watch fires; for all around her there is cause to guard against the
          enemy, and to descend the royal treasure of gospel truth against its
          deadly foes. But why an army with banners? Is not this, first of all,
          for distinction? How shall we know to which king an army belongs
          unless we can see the royal standard? In times of war the nationality
          of troops is often declared by their distinguishing regimentals. The
          grey coats of the Russians were well known in the Crimea; the white
          livery of the Austrians was a constant eyesore in bygone days to the
          natives of Lombardy. No one mistook the Black Brunswickers for French
          Guards, or our own Hussars for Garibaldians. Quite as effectively
          armies have been distinguished by the banners which they carried. As
          the old knights of old were recognised by their plume and helmet, and
          escutcheon, so an army is known by its standard and the national
          colors. The tricolor of the French readily marked their troops as they
          fled before the terrible black and white of the German army. The
          church of Christ displays its banners for distinction's sake. It
          desires not to be associated with other armies, or to be mistaken for
          them, for it is not of this world, and its weapons and its warfare are
          far other than those of the nations. God forbid that followers of
          Jesus should be mistaken for political partisans or ambitious
          adventurers. The church unfurls her ensign to the breeze that all may
          know whose she is and whom she serves. This is of the utmost
          importance at this present, when crafty men are endeavoring to palm
          off their inventions. Every Christian church should know what it
          believes, and publicly avow what it maintains. It is our duty to make
          a clear and distinct declaration of our principles, that our members
          may know to what intent they have come together, and that the world
          also may know what we mean. Far be it from us to join with the Broad
          Church cry, and furl the banners upon which our distinctive colors are
          displaced. We hear on all sides great outcries against creeds. Are
          these clamours justifiable? It seems to me that when properly analysed
          most of the protests are not against creeds, but against truth, for
          every man who believes anything must have a creed, whether he write it
          down and print it or no; or if there be a man who believes nothing, or
          anything, or everything by turns, he is not a fit man to be set up as
          a model. Attacks are often made against creeds because they are a
          short, handy form by which the Christian mind gives expression to its
          belief, and those who hate creeds do so because they find them to be
          weapons as inconvenient, as bayonets in the hands of British soldiers
          have been to our enemies. They are weapons so destructive to theology
          that it protests against them. For this reason let us be slow to part
          with them. Let us day hold of God's truth with iron grip, and never
          let it go. After all, there is a Protestantism still worth contending
          for; there is a Calvinism still worth proclaiming, and a gospel worth
          dying for. There is a Christianity distinctive and distinguished from
          Ritualism, Rationalism, and Legalism, and let us make it known that we
          believe in it. Up with your banners, soldiers of the cross! This is
          not the time to be frightened by the cries against conscientious
          convictions, which are nowadays nicknamed sectarianism and bigotry.
          Believe in your hearts what you profess to believe; proclaim openly
          and zealously what you know to be the truth. Be not ashamed to say
          such-and-such things are true, and let men draw the inference that the
          opposite is false. Whatever the doctrines of the gospel may be to the
          rest of mankind, let them be your glory and boast. Display your
          banners, and let those banners be such as the church of old carried.
          Unfurl the old primitive standard, the all-victorious standard of the
          cross of Christ. In very deed and truth -- in hoc signo vinces -- the
          atonement is the conquering truth. Let others believe as they may, or
          deny as they will, for you the truth as it is in Jesus is the one
          thing that has won your heart and made you a soldier of the cross.
        </p>

          Banners were carried, not merely for distinctiveness, but also to
          serve the purposes of discipline. Hence an army with banners had one
          banner as a central standard, and then each regiment or battalion
          displayed its own particular flag. The hosts of God, which so
          gloriously marched through the wilderness, had their central standard.
          I suppose it was the very pole upon which Moses lifted up the brazen
          serpent (at any rate, our brazen serpent is the central ensign of the
          church); and then, besides that, each tribe of the twelve had its own
          particular banners, and with these uplifted in the front, the tribes
          marched in order, so that there was no confusion on the march, and in
          time of battle there was no difficulty in marshalling the armed men.
          It was believed by the later Jews that "the standard of the camp of
          Judah represented a lion; that of Reuben, a man; that of Joseph, an
          ox; and that of Dan, an eagle. The Targumists, however, believe that
          the banners were distinguished by their colors, the color for each
          tribe being analogous to that of the precious stone for that tribe, in
          the breastplate of the high priest; and that the great standard of
          each of the four camps combined the three colors of the tribes which
          composed it." So, brethren, in the church of God there must be
          discipline -- the discipline not only of admission and of dismission
          in receiving the converts and rejecting the hypocrites, but the
          discipline of marshalling the troops to the service of Christ in the
          holy war in which we are engaged. Every soldier should have his
          orders, every officer his troop, every troop its fixed place in the
          army, and the whole army a regularity such as is prescribed in the
          rule, "Let all things be done decently and in order." As in the ranks
          each man has his place, and each rank has its particular phase in the
          battalion, so in every rightly constituted church each may, each
          woman, will have, for himself or herself, his or her own particular
          form of service, and each form of service will link in with every
          other, and the whole combined will constitute a force which cannot be
          broken. A church is not a load of bricks, remember: it is a house
          builded together. A church is not a bundle of cuttings in the
          gardener's hand: it is a vine, of which we are the branches. The true
          church is an organised whole; and life, true spiritual life, wherever
          it is paramount in the church, without rules and rubrics, is quite
          sure to create order and arrangement. Order without life reminds us of
          the rows of graves in a cemetery, all numbered and entered in the
          register: order with life reminds us of the long lines of fruit trees
          in Italy, festooned with fruitful vines. Sunday-school teachers, bear
          ye the banner of the folded lamb; sick visitors, follow the ensign of
          the open hand; preachers, rally to the token of the uplifted brazen
          serpent; and all of you, according to your sacred calling, gather to
          the name of Jesus, armed for the war.
        </p>

          An army with banners may be also taken to represent activity. When an
          army holds up its colors the fight is over. Little is being done in
          military, circles when the banners are put away; the troops are on
          furlough, or are resting in barracks. An army with banners is
          exercising, or marching, or fighting; probably it is in the middle of
          a campaign, it is marshalled for offense and defense, and there will
          be rough work before long. It is to be feared that some churches have
          hung up their flags to rot in state, or have encased them in dull
          propriety. They do not fool; to do great things, or to see great
          things. They do not expect many conversions; if many did happen, they
          would be alarmed and suspicious. They do not expect their pastor's
          ministry to be with power; and if it were attended with manifest
          effect they would be greatly disturbed, and perhaps would complain
          that he created too much excitement. The worst of it is, that
          do-nothing churches are usually very jealous lest any should encroach
          on their domain. Our churches sometime ago appeared to imagine that a
          whole district of this teeming city belonged to them to cultivate or
          neglect, as their monopolising decree might be. If anybody attempted
          to raise a new interest, or even to build a preaching station, within
          half a mile of them, they resented it as a most pernicious poachings
          upon their manor. They did nothing themselves, and were very much
          afraid lest anybody should supplant them. Like the lawyers of old, who
          took away the key of knowledge, they entered not in themselves, and
          them that were entering in they hindered. That day, it is to be hoped,
          has gone once for all; yet too much of the old spirit lingers in
          certain quarters. It is high time that each church should feel that if
          it does not work, the sole reason for its existence is gone. The
          reason for a church being a church dies its mutual edification and in
          the conversion of sinners; and if these two ends are not really
          answered by a church, it is a mere name, a hindrance, an evil, a
          nuisance; like the salt which has lost its savor, it is neither fit
          for the land nor yet for the dunghill. May we all in our church
          fellowship be active in the energy of the Spirit of God. May none of
          us be dead members of the living body, mere impediments to the royal
          host, baggage to be dragged rather than warriors pushing on the war.
          May we, every one of us, be soldiers filled with vigor to the fullness
          of our manhood, by the eternal power of the Holy Spirit; and may we be
          resolved that any portion of the church which does not uplift its
          banner of service shall not long number us among its adherents. Be it
          ours to determine that whether others will or will not serve God and
          extend the kingdom of his dear Son, we will, in his name and strength,
          contend even to the death. Unsheath our swords, ye soldiers of the
          cross; arise from your slumbers, ye careless ones, gird on your swords
          and prepare for the war. The Lord has redeemed you by his blood, not
          that you might sleep, but that you might fight for the glory of his
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does not the description, "an army with banners," imply a degree of
          confidence? It is not an army retiring from the foe, and willing
          enough to hide its colors to complete its escape. An army that is
          afraid to venture out into the open, keeps its banners out of the
          gleam of the sun. Banners uplifted are the sign of a fearlessness
          which rather courts than declines the conflict. Ho! warriors of the
          cross, unfurl the gospel's ancient standard to the breeze; we will
          teach the foeman what strength there is in hands and hearts that rally
          to the Christ of God. Up with the standard, ye brave men at arms; let
          all eyes see it; and it the foemen glare like lions on it, we "will
          call upon the Lion of the tribe of Judah to lead the van, and we will
          follow with his word like a two-edged sword in our hands: --
        </p>
        <p>"Stand up! stand up for Jesus!</p>
        <p>Ye soldiers of the cross!</p>
        <p>Lift high hits royal banner;</p>
        <p>It must not suffer loss:</p>
        <p>From victory unto victory</p>
        <p>His army shall he lead</p>
        <p>Till every foe is vanquished</p>
        <p>And Christ is Lord indeed."</p>
        <p>
          We cannot place too much reliance in the gospel; our weakness is that
          we are so diffident and so apt to look somewhere else for strength. We
          do not believe in the gospel as to its power over the sons of men as
          we should believe in it. Too often we preach it with a coward's voice.
          Have I not heard sermons commencing with abject apologies for the
          preacher's daring to open his mouth; apologies for his youth, for his
          assertions, for his venturing to intrude upon men's consciences, and I
          know not what else? Can God own ambassadors of this cowardly cringing
          breed, who mistake fear of men for humility! Will our Captain honor
          such carpet-knights, who apologise for bearing arms? I have heard that
          of old the ambassadors of Holland, and some other states, when
          introduced to his celestial majesty, the brother of the son and cousin
          of the moon, the Emperor of China, were expected to come crawling on
          their hands and knees up to the throne; but when our ambassadors went
          to that flowery land, they declined to pay such humiliating homage to
          his impertinent majesty, and informed him that they would stand
          upright in his presence, as free men should do, or else they would
          decline all dealings with him, and in all probability his majesty
          would hear from a cannon's mouth far less gentle notes than he would
          care for. Even thus, though we may well humble ourselves as men, yet
          as ambassadors of God we cannot crouch to the sons of men, to ask them
          what message would suite them best. It must not, shall not, be that we
          shall smoothe our tongues and tone our doctrines to the taste of the
          age. The gospel that we preach, although the worldly wise man despises
          it, in God's gospel for all that. "Ah," says he, "there is nothing in
          it: science has overthrown it." "And," says another, "this gospel is
          but so much platitude; we have heard it over and over again." Ah, sir,
          and though it be platitude to you, and you decree it to be
          contemptible, you shall hear it or nothing else from us; "for it is
          the power of God, and the wisdom of God." In its simplicity lies its
          majesty and its power. "We are not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.
          "God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
          Christ." We will proclaim it again with confidence; We will bring
          forth once more the selfsame truth as of old; and as the barley loaf
          smote the tent of Midian, so that it lay along, so shall the gospel
          overturn its adversaries. The broken pitcher, and the flaming torches,
          and the old war cry, "The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon" shall yet
          fill the foeman with dismay. Let us but be bold for Jesus, and we
          shall see what his arm can do. The gospel is the voice of the eternal
          God, and has in it the same power as that which brought the world out
          of nothing, and which shall raise the dead from their graves at the
          coming of the Son of Man. The gospel, the word of God, can no more
          return to him void than can the snow go back to heaven, or the
          rain-drops climb again the path by which they descended from the
          clouds. Have faith in God's word, faith in the presence of the Holy
          Ghost, faith in the reigning Savior, faith in the fulfillment of the
          everlasting purposes, and you will be full of confidence, and like an
          army with banners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, an army with banners may signify the constancy and
          perseverance in holding the truth. We see before us not an army that
          has lost its banners, that has suffered its colors to be rent away
          from it, but an army which bears aloft its ancient standard and swears
          by it still. Let us be very earnest to maintain the faith once
          delivered to the saints. Let us not give up this doctrine or that, at
          the dictates of policy or fashion; but whatsoever Jesus saith unto us,
          let us receive it as the word of life. Great injury may be done to a
          church ere it knows it, if it shall tolerate error here and there; for
          false doctrine, like the little leaven, soon leavens the whole lump.
          If the church be taught of the Spirit to know the voice of the Good
          Shepherd, a stranger it will not follow; for it knows not the voice of
          strangers. This is part of the education which Christ gives to his
          people: "All thy people shall be taught of the Lord." They shall know
          the truth, and the truth shall make them free. May we, as a church,
          hold fast the things which we have learned and have been taught of
          God; and may we be preserved from the philosophies and refinings of
          these last days. If we give up the things which are verily believed
          among us we shall lose our pourer, and the enemy alone will be
          pleased; but if we maintain them, the maintenance of the old faith, by
          the Spirit of God, shall make us strong in the Lord and in the power
          of his might. Wrap the colors round you, ye standard bearers, in the
          day of danger, and die sooner than give them up. Life is little
          compared with God's lovingkindness, and that is the sure heritage of
          the brave defender of the faith. Thus resolute for truth, the church
          becomes an army with banners.
        </p>

          II. Secondly, the church is said to be TERRIBLE. To whom is she
          terrible? She should be amiable, and she is. May God grant that our
          church may never be terrible to young converts by moroseness and
          uncharitableness. Whenever I hear of candidates being alarmed at
          coming before our elders, or seeing the pastor, or making confession
          of faith before the church, I wish I could say to them: "Dismiss your
          fears, beloved ones; we shall be glad to see you, and you will find
          your intercourse with us a pleasure rather than a trial." So far from
          wishing to repel you, if you really do love the Savior, we shall be
          glad enough to welcome you. If we cannot see in you the evidence of a
          great change, we shall kindly point out to you our fears, and shall be
          thrice happy to point you to the Savior; but be sure of this, if you
          have really believed in Jesus, you shall not find the church terrible
          to you. Harsh judgments are contrary to the spirit of Christ and the
          nature of the gospel; where they are the rule, the church is
          despicable rather than terrible. Bigotry and uncharitableness are
          indications of weakness, not of strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          To what and to whom is the church terrible? I answer, first, in a
          certain sense she is terrible to all ungodly men. A true church in her
          holiness and testimony is very terrible to sinners. The ungodly care
          not a rush about a mock church, nor about sham Christians; but a
          really earnest Christian makes the ungodly abashed. We have known some
          who could not use the foul language which they were accustomed to when
          they were in the presence of godly men and women, though these persons
          had no authority or position or rank. Even in the most ribald company,
          when a Christian of known consistency of character has wisely spoken
          the word of reproof, a solemn abashment comes over the majority of
          those present; their consciences have borne witness against them, and
          they have felt how awful goodness is. Not that we are ever to try and
          impress others with any dread of us; such an attempt would be
          ridiculed, and end in deserved failure; but the influence which we
          would describe flows naturally out of a godly light. Majesty of
          character never lies in affectation of demeanor, but in solidity of
          virtue. If there be real goodness in us -- if we really, fervently,
          zealously love the right, and hate the evil -- the outflow of our life
          almost without a word will judge the ungodly -- and condemn them in
          their heart of hearts. Holy living is the weightiest condemnation of
          sin. We have heard of an ungodly son who could not bear to dive in the
          house where his departed father had in his lifetime so devoutly
          prayed; every room, and every piece of furniture reproved him for
          forsaking his father's God. We have read of others who were wont to
          dread the sight of certain godly men whose holy lives held them more
          in check than the laws of the land. The bad part of this is that the
          terror of the ungodly suggests to them an unhallowed retort upon their
          reprovers, and becomes the root out of which springs persecution.
          Those whom the ungodly fear because they condemn them by their
          character, they try to put out of the world if they can, or to
          bespatter them with slander if they cannot smite them with the hand of
          cruelty. The martyrdom of saints is the result of the darkness hating
          the light, because the light makes manifest its evil deeds. There will
          be always in proportion to the real holiness, earnestness, and Christ
          likeness of a church something terrible in it to the perverse
          generation in which it is placed; it will dread it as it does the
          all-revealing day of judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          So is there something terrible in a living church to all errorists.
          Just now two armies have encamped against the host of God, opposed to
          each other, but confederates against the church of God. Ritualism,
          with its superstition, its priestcraft, its sacramental efficacy, its
          hatred of the doctrines of grace; and on the other side Rationalism,
          with its sneering unbelief and absurd speculations. These, like Herod
          and Pilate, agree in nothing but in opposition to Christ; they have
          one common dread, although they may not confess it. They do not dread
          those platform speeches in which they are so furiously denounced at
          public meetings, nor those philosophical discussions in which they are
          overthrown by argument; but they hate, but they fear, and therefore
          abuse and pretend to despise, the prayerful, zealous, plain simple
          preaching of the truth as it is in Jesus. This is a weapon against
          which they cannot stand -- the weapon of the odd gospel. In the days
          of Luther it did marvels; it wrought wonders in the days of Whitfield
          and Wesley: it has often restored the ark of the Lord to our land, and
          it will again. It has lost none of its ancient power, and therefore is
          it the terror of the adversaries of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>"Thine aspect's awful majesty</p>
        <p>Doth strike thy foes with fear;</p>
        <p>As armies do when banners fly,</p>
        <p>And martial flags appear.</p>
        <p>How does thine armor, glitt'ring bright,</p>
        <p>Their frighted spirits quell!</p>
        <p>The weapons of thy warlike might</p>
        <p>Defy the gates of hell."</p>
        <p>
          Even to Satan himself the church of God is terrible. He might, he
          thinks, deal with individuals, but when these individuals strengthen
          each other by mutual converse and prayer, when they are bound to each
          other in holy love, and make a temple in which Christ dwells, then is
          Satan hard put to it. O brethren and sisters, it is not every church
          that is terrible thus, tent it is a church of God in which there is
          the life of God, and the love of God; a church in which there is the
          uplifted banner, the banner of the cross, high-held amid those various
          banners of truthful doctrine and spiritual grace, of which I have just
          now spoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We will take a third point; and that is, WHY IS THE CHURCH OF
          CHRIST TERRIBLE AS AN ARMY WITH BANNERS? Why is it terrible because of
          its banners? The whole passage seems to say that the church is
          terrible as an army, but that to the fullest degree she owes her
          terribleness to her banners. "Terrible as an army with banners." I
          believe the great banner of the Christian church to be the uplifted
          Savior. "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
          me." Around him then we gather. "Unto him shall the gathering of the
          people be." As the brazen serpent in the midst of the camp in the
          wilderness, so is the Savior lifted high, our banner. The atoning,
          sacrifice of Christ is the great central standard of all really
          regenerate men, and this is the main source of dismay to Israel's
          foes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we shall take the thoughts in order. The church herself is
          terrible, and then terrible because of her banners. Brethren, the army
          itself is terrible. Why? First, because it consists of elect people.
          Remember how Haman's wife enquired concerning Mordecai whether he
          belonged to the seed of the Jews; for if he did, then she foretold
          that her husband's scheme would prove a failure. "If Mordecai be of
          the Seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt
          not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him." Now, the
          church of God as made up of men and women is nothing more than any
          other organisation. Look at its exterior, and you see in it few
          persons of great education and a great many of no education; here and
          there a wealthy and powerful person, but hundreds who are poor and
          despised. It does not possess in itself, naturally, the elements of
          strength, according to ordinary reckoning. Indeed, its own confession
          is that in itself it is perfect weakness, a flock of sheep among
          wolves; but here lies its strength, that each of the true members of
          the church are of the seed royal; they are God's chosen ones, the seed
          of the woman ordained of old to break the head of Satan and all his
          serpent seed. They are the weakness of God, but they are stronger than
          men; he has determined with the things that are not to bring to nought
          the things that are. As the Canaanites feared the chosen race of
          Israel because the rumor of them had gone forth among the people, and
          the terror of Jehovah was upon them; so is it with the hosts of evil.
          They have dreamed their dreams, as the Midianite did, and valiant men
          like Gideon can hear them telling it; the barley cake shall fall upon
          the royal tent of Gideon and smite it till it lies along; the sword of
          the Lord, and of Gideon, shall rout the foe. The elect shall overcome
          through the blood of the Lamb, and none shall say them nay. Ye are a
          royal priesthood, a peculiar people, a chosen generation; and in you
          the living God will gloriously declare his sovereign grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church, again, consists of a praying people. Now prayer is that
          which links weakness with infinite strength. A people who can pray can
          never be overcome, because their reserve forces can never be
          exhausted. Go into battle, my brother; and if you be vanquished with
          the strength you have, prayer shall call up another legion. Yea,
          twenty legions of angels, and the foe shall marvel to see undefeated
          adversaries still holding the field. If ten thousand saints were
          burned to-morrow, their dying prayers would make the church rise like
          a phoenix from her ashes. Who, therefore, can stand against a people
          whose prayers enlist God in their quarrel? "The Lord of hosts is with
          us; the God of Jacob is our refuge." We cry unto the Lord, and he
          heareth us; he breaketh through the ranks of the foe; he giveth us
          triumph in the day of battle: therefore, terrible as an army with
          banners are those who wield the weapon of all-prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, a true church is based upon eternal truth. I need not quote to
          you the old Latin proverb which says that truth is mighty and must
          prevail. Truth is, and truth shall be. It alone is substance, and must
          outlast the lapse of ages. Falsehoods are soon swollen to their
          perfection of development, like the bubbles with rainbow hues which
          children blow, but they are dispersed as easily as they are fashioned;
          they are children of the hour, while truth is the offspring and heir
          of eternity. Falsehood dies, pierced through the heart by the arrows
          of time, but truth, in her impenetrable mail bids defiance to all
          foes. Men who love the truth are building gold and silver, and
          precious stones; and though their architecture may progress but
          slowly, it is built for eternity. Ramparts of truth may often be
          assailed, but they will never be carried by the foe. Establish a power
          among men of the most ostentatious and apparently stable kind, but
          rest assured that if untruth be at the root of it, it must perish,
          sooner or later; only truth is invincible, eternal, supreme. The fear
          of the true church and the dread thereof falls upon the enemy, because
          they have wit enough left to know that truth has an abiding and
          indestructible power. I was very much amused, the other day, to read a
          criticism by an eminent infidel, whose name would be well known if I
          were to mention it, in which he speaks very highly of the exceeding
          great skill and wisdom, and common sense, always exhibited in the
          arrangements of the Roman Catholic Church in opposition to Infidelity,
          and of the imbecility and childishness manifested by Christian
          ministers in assailing Rationalism with their dogmatism, etc. I was
          very glad to receive information so valuable, and I thought: "I see,
          my friend, what kind of warfare you like best. You admire the Roman
          Catholic kind of fighting, but you do not admire that which
          evangelical ministers have adopted. It is no aim of ours to please our
          enemies in our mode of warfare, but the reverse; and if we have
          discovered a weapon which galls you, we will use that same arm more
          freely than ever." There is a story of an officer who was rather
          awkward in his manners, and, upon some great occasion, almost fell
          over his sword in his haste. His majesty remarked, "Your sword seems
          to be very much in the way." "So your majesty's enemies have very
          often felt," was the reply. So, when the enemies of the truth are
          finding fault with our procedure, we accept their verdict when we have
          turned it the other way upwards. If they do not admire our mode of
          warfare, we think; it is in all probability about the best method we
          could adopt. We would still, God granting us help, continue preaching
          the "foolishness" of the gospel, and deliver again and again the old
          truth, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not
          imputing their trespasses unto them. Instead of lifting up a new
          banner (which would better please our adversaries) it shall be the old
          banner still -- "None but Christ." "By grace are ye saved through
          faith; and that out of yourselves: it is the gift of God." Salvation
          is by free favor, through the expiatory sacrifice of Jesus Christ our
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now to observe, that the chief glory and majesty of the church
          lies mainly in the banner which she carries. What cause for terror is
          there in the banner? We reply, the enemies of Christ dread the cross,
          because they know what the cross has done. Wherever the crucified
          Jesus has been preached, false systems have tottered to their fall.
          Dagou has always fallen before the ark of the Lord. Rage the most
          violent is excited by the doctrine of the atonement, a rage in which
          the first cause for wrath is fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terribleness of the church lies in her banners, because those
          banners put strength into her. Drawing near to the standard of the
          cross the weakest soldier becomes strong: he who might have played the
          coward becomes a hero when the precious blood of Jesus is felt with
          power in his soul. Martyrs are born and nurtured at the cross. It is
          the blood of Jesus which is the life-blood of self-denial; we can die
          because our Savior died. The presence of Alexander made the Greeks
          more than giants: the presence of our Redeemer makes believers swifter
          than eagles, and stronger than lions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the powers of evil tremble at the old standard, because they
          have a presentiment of its future complete triumph. It is decreed of
          God, and fixed by his predestinating purpose, that all flesh shall see
          the salvation of God. Jesus must reign; the crucified One must
          conquer. The hands nailed to the wood must sway the scepter of all
          kingdoms. Like potters' vessels dashed to pieces, must all the might
          and majesty of men be, that shall oppose the crown and scepter of
          Christ's kingdom. In Christ preached lies the battle-axe and weapons
          of war, with which the Lord will work out his everlasting decrees. The
          church with the name of Immanuel emblazoned on her banner, which it is
          her duty to keep well displayed, and lifted high, is sure to be
          terrible to all the powers of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will close with one or two reflections. Will each one here say to
          himself: "An army, a company of warriors, am I one of them? Am I a
          soldier? I have entered the church; I make a profession; but am I
          really a soldier? Do I fight? Do I endure hardness? Am I a mere
          carpet-knight, a mere lie-a-bed soldier, one of those who are pleased
          to put on regimentals in order to adorn myself with a profession
          without ever going to the war?"
        </p>
        <p>"Am I a soldier of the cross -- a follower of the Lamb?"</p>
        <p>
          Pass the question round, my dear brethren and sisters: Are you
          soldiers who engage in actual fighting for Jesus, under his banner? Do
          you rally round it? Do you know the standard? Do you love it? Could
          you die in defense of it? Is the person of Jesus dearest of all things
          to you? Do you value the doctrine of the atoning substitution? Do you
          feel your own energy and power awakened in the defense of that, and
          for the love of that? Let not one go away without making the searching
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then "terrible." Am I in any way terrible through being Christian?
          Is there any power in my life that would condemn a sinner? my holiness
          about me that would make a wicked man feel ill at ease in my company?
          Is there enough of Christ about my life to make me like a light in the
          midst of the darkness? or is it very likely that if I were to live in
          a house the inhabitants would never see any difference between me and
          the ungodly? Oh, how many Christians there are who need to wear a
          label round their necks: you would never know that they were
          Christians without it! They make long prayers and great pretences, but
          they are Christians in nothing but the name. May your life and mine
          never be thus despicable, but may we convince gainsayers that there is
          a power in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and make them confess, that
          they, not having it, are losing a great blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          One other thought. If I am not a soldier, if I am not a servant of
          Christ in very truth, and yet I come to the place of worship where
          Christians meet, and where Christ is preached, the day will be when
          the church of God will be very terrible to me. I will suppose that
          there is a person listening to this sermon who has been hearing the
          preaching of the word in this place now for many years. Imagine that
          the last day is come. You are brought before the great judgment-seat,
          and this is the question: -- "Did this sinner hear the gospel
          faithfully preached? He is ungodly, he has rejected Christ: does he
          deserve to be cast away? Did he really bear the gospel, and did he
          reject it?" If I am asked to give my witness, I must say, "To the best
          of my ability, I tried to tell him the gospel of Jesus Christ." "Was
          this sinner prayed for by the church?" There are many of the members
          of this church who would feel bound to declare "Yes, Lord, we did pray
          for him." Yes, and all of us should say, "If we did not pray for him
          by name, we included him in the general company of those who attended
          upon the means of grace, for whom we made a constant intercession." Is
          there any member of the church who would be able to make an apology
          for the rejector of Christ? He has willfully rejected the Savior, he
          knowingly continued in sin. Will anybody be an advocate for him? Not
          one tongue would be able to excuse you at the judgment, or to argue
          against the righteous sentence of God. When the great Judge condemns
          the sinner to be taken away to execution, the whole church with whom
          that sinner has worshipped, and in whose presence that sinner has
          rejected Christ, will become "terrible as an army with banners;" for
          all its voices will say, "Amen, Amen, Amen! Thou art righteous, O
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is no picture drawn from fancy. Know ye not that the saints shall
          judge the world? They shall sit as co-assessors with the Son of God at
          the last great assize, and shall say, "Amen!" to every verdict which
          proceedeth from his mouth. O that the thought of this might be blessed
          of God's Spirit, so as to lead many of you to be reconciled to God.
          Jesus is still the loving Mediator, and a full surrender of yourselves
          to him will assuredly save you. Whosoever believeth on him is not
          condemned; and this is to believe on him -- that ye trust in him, and
          know that God hath given unto us eternal life -- and this life is in
          his Son who suffered in the stead of sinners, that whosoever believeth
          in him might not perish, but have everlasting life. The Lord bless
          you, for the Lord Jesus' sake. Amen.
        </p>
        <p>
          MR. SPURGEON has been laid aside by sickness for two Sabbaths, but is
          now recovering and hopes to be again in the pulpit next Lord's-day. He
          earnestly beg the prayers of loving friends that his frequent
          infirmities may be sanctified to the glory of God and the profit of
          the church; and then, if it were the Lord's will, eventually removed.
