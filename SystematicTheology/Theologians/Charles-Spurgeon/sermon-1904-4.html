        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.2908)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, November 3rd, 1904,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>On Lord's-day Morning, November 5th, 1854.</p>
        <p>
          NOTE: This is taken from an early published edition of the original
          sermon. The version that appears in The Metropolitan Tabernacle
          Pulpit, vol.50, was slightly edited by the publishers. For edition we
          have restored in most places the text of the earlier published
          edition, while retaining a few of the editorial refinements of the Met
          Tab edition.

          "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue
          that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is
          the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is
          of me, saith the Lord." -- Isaiah 54:17.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS IS THE FIFTH of November, a day very notable in English history.
          The events which transpired on it ought never to be forgotten. On this
          memorable day, the Catholics, foiled in all their schemes for crushing
          our glorious Protestantism, devised a plot horrible and diabolical
          enough to render them for ever hateful among upright men. The vast
          Armada of Spain on which they had relied, had been by the breath of
          God scattered and given to destruction, and now the cowardly traitors
          attempted by the foulest means the end which they could not accomplish
          by open warfare. Under the Houses of Parliament the deadly powder was
          concealed which they hoped would be a death-blow to both Houses, and
          so annihilate the power of Protestantism; but God looked from heaven,
          he confounded their knavish tricks, he laid their secrets bare, and
          discovered their treachery. Hallelujah to the King immortal,
          invisible, who guarded us, and guards us still from the devices of
          Rome and hell. Praise to his name, we are free from the Pope of Rome,
          to whom --
        </p>
        <p>"Britons never will be slaves."</p>
        <p>"While for our princes they prepare,</p>
        <p>In caverns deep a burning snare,</p>
        <p>He shot from heaven a piercing ray,</p>
        <p>And the dark treachery brought to day."</p>
        <p>
          Nor is this the only event for which the fifth of November is notable,
          for in 1688, we as a nation experienced a deliverance equally as
          great. James II had attempted to revive the dying cause of Popery, and
          the hopes of Satan were great. But sturdy Protestants would not easily
          lose their dear-bought liberties, and, therefore, brought about the
          glorious revolution by which King William III ascended the throne, and
          from him the succession has been happily continued until the reign of
          our Queen, for whom our earnest prayers shall rise.
        </p>
        <p>"Such great deliverance God hath wrought,</p>
        <p>And down to us salvation brought,</p>
        <p>And still the care of guardian heaven,</p>
        <p>Secures the bliss itself has given."</p>
        <p>
          Blessed be God that on this fifth of November we can record such
          deliverances! Our Puritan forefathers never suffered this day to pass
          over without a commemoration service. So far from this day being
          forgotten, it ought to be remembered, not by the saturnalia of
          striplings, but by the songs of saints. I think I have in my
          possession now a record of sermons preached on the fifth of November
          by Matthew Henry. Many divines of his time regularly preached on this
          day. I think the true Protestant feeling of this country, which has
          lately so revived, and which has shown itself so strongly, will
          scarcely forgive me, if I do not this morning return most humble and
          hearty thanks to that God who has delivered us from the curse, and
          enabled us to stand as Protestant men free to preach the gospel of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I notice in my text two things this morning -- the first is, the
          saint's heritage; the second, the saint's watchword.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, the saint's heritage -- "No weapon that is formed against
          thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in
          judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of
          the Lord;" and then comes the saint's watchword -- "Their
          righteousness is of me, saith the Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, do not suppose that this morning I shall either have time, or
          opportunity, or talents, or power, to enter into an investigation of
          all the saint's heritages, especially when you remember that "all
          things are ours" -- the gift of God, the purchase of the Saviour's
          blood; so that time would fail us to talk of the possessions of the
          child of God. This world is his; earth is his lodge, and heaven his
          home. This life is his, with all its sorrows and its joys; death is
          his, with all its terrors and solemn realities; and eternity is his,
          with all its immortality and its grandeur. God is his, with all his
          attributes. The saint has a prospective right to every thing. God hath
          made him the heir of all things; for we are co-heirs with Christ, and
          joint-heirs with the Son of God. O, we have not time enough in the
          term of seventy years to read over once the fair inventory of the
          saint's possessions. If we could read it over once, there would be
          such a depth unfathomable, such a height immeasurable, such an
          intensity of value, such a depth of preciousness, that we should need
          to read it over an eternal number of times before we should ever be
          able to comprehend the love of God. So, then, you see I am not about
          to enter into the heritage of God's people at large; but I am going to
          speak of one peculiar item of that bright heritage as mentioned in my
          text; and that is preservation. "No weapon that is formed against thee
          shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise up against thee in
          judgment thou shalt condemn." I shall speak of this as being the
          heritage, not only of the church at large, but the personal and
          particular possession of every true believer, and every elect child of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, there is the promise that we shall have protection
          against the hand of men: "No weapon that is formed against thee shall
          prosper." Satan has always used the hand of man against the church of
          Christ. The weapon of physical force has ever been brought to bear
          against the church of God. From the day when first Cain with his club
          struck his brother Abel and laid him low, down to the time Zacharias
          the son of Barachias -- from that time until now, the weapon has been
          constantly used against the church of God. There has never been a time
          when a weapon has not been forged against the church of Christ. Yea,
          even at the present moment, as I stand here, and with the eye of fancy
          survey our world, I see a fire blazing -- fierce is the flame and high
          its pile of fuel. I see a monarch forging a weapon; a crowned tyrant
          longs to bring forth chains of iron for the liberties of Europe, and
          smaller despots long to destroy the germ of all true liberty, the
          glorious gospel of the blessed God. I see the armies ready against the
          Lord of hosts, ready to do battle against the servants of God. Still
          here is the sweet comfort; they may forge the weapon; they may fashion
          the sword; they may shut the prison door; they may confine the
          prisoners, they may make their instruments of torture; but they can
          not prosper; for God hath said it: He "breaketh the bow; and cutteth
          the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire." "No weapon
          that is formed against thee shall prosper." He will not let it do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us just look back through history, and see how God has fulfilled
          this gracious promise to his church in past days. He has one it
          sometimes in this way. He has not allowed the sword so much as to
          touch his church. At other times he has suffered the sword to do its
          work; and yet out of evil he hath brought forth good. Sometimes no
          weapon that has been formed against the church has prospered, because
          God has not suffered it so much as to touch the church. Look at many
          cases of history. There is the overthrow of Pharaoh. Look yonder,
          there he is at the head of all the chivalry of Egypt pursuing the
          chosen race. The sea divides to give refuge to the Lord's elect. Lo,
          they tread the pebbly bottom of the sea of Edom, while the waters
          stand like walls of snow-white crystal on the right and on the left.
          But the impious monarch, all unawed by this mighty marvel, shouts,
          "On, on, soldiers of Memphis! do ye fear to tread where slaves are
          bold?" See, they boldly dash between the watery heights; chariot and
          horse are in the sea, madly pursuing Israel. Ho, Israel! fear not the
          uplifted spear, dread not the rattling chariot; they are marching to
          their tombs, their weapons shall not prosper. Moses uplifts the rod of
          God, the parted floods embrace with eager joy, and grasp the helpless
          foe within their arms.
        </p>
        <p>"Over horse and over car,</p>
        <p>Over every man of war,</p>
        <p>Over Pharaoh's crown of gold</p>
        <p>The loud thundering billows rolled.</p>
        <p>Mid the water dark and dread,</p>
        <p>Down they sank, they sank like lead!"</p>
        <p>
          Again, my brethren, behold another glorious proof of the promise.
          Haman had conceived a hatred to Mordecai, and for his sake the whole
          race of Jews must perish. How deep he lays his plots, how readily he
          obtains the consent of the king, how sure is he of revenge. Even now
          in imagination he sees Mordecai swinging on the lofty gallows, and all
          his kindred given to slaughter. Ah, thou enemy, delight in thine
          imagination, for it shall be disappointed; rejoice in thy design, but
          it shall be utterly confounded. There is a God in the courts of
          heaven, and an Esther in the palace of Shushan. Thou thyself shalt be
          hanged on thine own gallows, and the race of David shall revenge the
          deed of the Agagite upon his sons. O, Israel, well mayest thou rejoice
          at the feast of Purim, for the weapon of the mighty is broken. Nor
          here alone can we see the promise fulfilled; for time would fail me to
          tell of conquered Amalek and routed Midian. Scarce can we speak of
          Philistia and her giants given to the beasts of prey, or Edom
          slaughtered by the sword. Let the armies witness who fled at the
          fancied rumbling of chariots, or that host who in one night became the
          inhabitants of the realms of death. Let the warriors who rest with
          their rusted swords beneath their earthy pillows rise from their long
          sleep and confess the futility of their efforts; yea, let monarchs now
          in the chains of hell bear witness to their own utter confusion when
          the Lord appeared in battle for his chosen. March on, despot; bid thy
          slaves rise against the free, crush the helpless, and usurp the
          dominions of thy neighbor; but know that the Lord is mightier than
          thou. Thy northern hordes are not invincible; and Britons, with the
          help of God, shall teach thee that in vain thou liftest the hand of
          robbery. Thou contendest with a nation in whose midst the elect of God
          are praying against thee, and thou shalt know that God has said unto
          her holy seed, "No weapon formed against thee shall prosper."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now another view of the subject presents itself. Sometimes God has
          suffered the enemy to exact upon us, and the sword has been use with
          terrible effect. O, there have been dark and gloomy days for the
          chosen church of Christ! When persecution has cried, "Havoc, and let
          slip the dogs of war," blood has flowed like water over the land! our
          enemies have triumphed. the martyr was bound to the stake, or was
          crucified upon the tree; the pastor was cut off, and the flocks were
          scattered. Cruel torture -- awful suffering was endured by the saints
          of God. The elect cried, and said, "O Lord, how long? let it repent
          thee concerning thy servants." The enemy laughed, and said, "Ah, ah!
          so would we have it." Zion was under a cloud. Her precious saints,
          comparable to fine gold, were esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of
          the hands of the potter, and her princes were trodden down like mire
          in the streets. O, my soul! how was it in that sad day, when the enemy
          came in upon her like a flood, and she could scarcely lift up the
          standard of the Lord against him? O God, there was an hour when thou
          wouldst not hear the cry of thine elect! It seemed as if thine ear was
          deaf; the plaint of the widow was unheeded; the groans, the agonies,
          and the cries of martyrs were unnoticed; and thou didst still allow
          the enemy to vex thy children. Persecution shook the land, and sent
          forth its burning lava of cruelty, devastating the fair fields of the
          church of God. But did the enemy prosper? Did he succeed? Did
          persecution destroy his church? Did the weapon formed against us
          prosper? No! Each time that the church had a wave pass over her she
          rose out of it, and lifted her fair countenance, fair as the moon, and
          terrible as an army with banners. She was all the more glorious for it
          all. Every time her blood was shed each drop became a man, and each
          man thus converted stood prepared to pour out the vital current from
          his veins to defend the cause. Ah! those were times when, instead of
          the church being diminished and brought low, God did multiply her, and
          persecution worked for her good instead of causing her evil. The
          persecutor did not destroy the church. Christ's church never sails so
          well as when she is rocked from side to side by the winds of
          persecution; when the spray of her blood dashes in the front, and when
          at every lurch she is well-nigh overwhelmed. Nothing has helped God's
          church so much as persecution; it has increased, and been strengthened
          by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will remember that this is not only the heritage of the church at
          large, but of every individual believer. And now I can speak to some
          poor souls who are in this place of worship. O brother! O sister!
          there is a word for thee this morning. "No weapon that is formed
          against thee shall prosper." There are some dear sisters who come into
          this house of prayer under fear of brutal husbands -- others, sons and
          daughters who have cruel fathers. I know there are some here who meet
          with dire and terrible persecution because they come to the house of
          God. O, little do some of us know when we meet here what our next
          neighbor on the seat has had to suffer to come up to this house! "I
          could a tale unfold would ruffle up your spirits" -- a tale of
          persecution endured by some of the saints of God in this place. This
          is a word for you: "No weapon that is formed against thee shall
          prosper." The blow of a brutal husband shall not injure you; it may
          injure your body, but it can not injure your soul. "Fear not them that
          kill the body, and afterward have no more that they can do, but fear
          him who can destroy both body and soul in hell." Why should you fear?
          God is on your side. Remember, Christ has said, "Rejoice, and be
          exceeding glad when they say all manner of evil against you falsely
          for my name's sake; for so persecuted they the prophets which were
          before you. Rejoice, and leap for joy, for great shall be your reward
          in heaven." Hold on, young man; hold on, young woman; still continue
          in the fear of God, and you shall find that persecution shall work for
          your good. But mark thee, persecutor, if thou art here this morning,
          there is a chain in hell of hot iron that shall be bound around thy
          waist; there are fiends that have whips of fire, and they shall
          scourge thy soul throughout eternity, because thou darest to put a
          stumbling-block in the way of God's children. Remember what Scripture
          saith: "Whosoever shall offend one of these little ones, it were
          better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that
          he were cast into the sea."
        </p>
        <p>
          The second portion of the heritage is, "Every tongue that shall rise
          against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn." Here is a protection
          from the tongue of men. Satan leaves no stone unturned against the
          church of God. He uses not simply the hand, but, what is oftener a
          harder weapon, the tongue. We can bear a blow sometimes, but we can
          not endure an insult. There is a great power in the tongue. We can
          rise from a blow which laid us low on the ground; but we can not so
          easily recover from slander; that lays the character low. "Every
          tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn."
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the church at large and see how she has condemned her
          adversaries. When first she came into the world, she had to oppose
          Judaism; but she has condemned it, and its doctrines are now effete:
          then up started philosophers, and said it was foolishness, because
          they found nothing of worldly wisdom in it. But what has become of the
          philosopher now? Where is the stoic who boasted of his wisdom? where
          the Epicurean who lectured in the streets of Greece? Where are they
          now? They are gone, and their names are only used as words that were
          -- as things that have ceased to be -- as figures of antiquity. Then
          Satan invented Mohammedanism in order to oppose the truth; but where
          is that? We have condemned it long ago. It is now a bloated carcass,
          almost without life, not able to stand. The cross has make the
          crescent wane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where are the various systems of infidelity which have arisen one
          after another? They are gone quite out of sight. Now and then we felt
          rather alarmed; because we heard that some great people were going to
          prove that the Bible was not true, and our creed was not sound. I
          remember talking with an old man once: "Ah," said he, "sir, this
          geology will quite ruin man's belief in the Bible." But where is
          geology now? Instead of opposing the gospel, it furnishes many
          powerful confirmations of the facts of revelation. Each one of the
          sciences has, in its imperfect condition, been used as a battering-ram
          against the truth of God; but as soon as it has been understood it has
          been made a pillar in Zion's outworks. Fear not, O son of God, that
          the perversions of men of science can damage our cause. Lying tongues
          we shall condemn. O infidelity! abortion of the night! thou hast been
          condemned a thousand times. Thou art a Protean creature, changing thy
          shape as ages change. Once thou wast a laughing idiotic plaything for
          Voltaire; then a bullying blasphemer with Tom Paine; then a cruel,
          blood-drinking fiend, fit mate for Robespierre; anon, a speculating
          theorist with Owen; and now a worldly, gross, secularizing thing for
          impious lecturers and profane admirers. I fear thee not, infidelity;
          thou art an asp, biting at iron, spending thy spleen, and breaking thy
          fangs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends, did you ever walk the centuries, and mark the rise and
          fall of various empires of unbelief? If so, you will seem to be on a
          battle-field, and you see corpses; you ask the name of the dead, and
          some one replies, that is the corpse of such a system, and that the
          carcase of such a theory; and, mark you, as surely as time rolls on,
          the now rampant style of infidelity will perish, and, in fifty years,
          we shall see the skeleton of an exploded scheme, and of its admirers
          the epitaph will be, "Here lies a fool, called of old, a secularist."
          Now, what shall we say of Mormonism, the haggard superstition of the
          West; or of Puseyism, the express image of Popery; or of Socinian and
          Arian heresies, of Arminian perversions, or of Antinomian abuse? What
          shall we say of each, but that their death-knell shall soon toll, and
          these children of hell shall sink back to their birth-place in the
          pit. And yon old and crazy church upon the seven hills has dared to
          hurl its anathemas at the saints of the Lord. Still doth she hold the
          wine-cup of abomination; still is she robed in scarlet, and her sway
          is over many waters; but she shall be condemned in judgment. Lo, the
          millstone in the hand of the archangel hastens to its fall, and
          Babylon the Great shall perish with a terrible overthrow. Then shall
          this cry go up from the Church of God, "Shout, O heavens, for the Lord
          hath done it; sing, O ye inhabitants of the earth, for the promise is
          accomplished, and every opposing tongue is condemned!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I wish to make this a personal heritage of each child of God --
          "every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment, you shall
          condemn." O! what a sweet thought that is for me, for there are many
          tongues busy about me. Some say, "He is a good man;" others say, "He
          is deceiving the people." Well, if God will convert more sinners, and
          bring more to his church, they may decide which way they like. I am
          not careful to answer any of the self-thought infallible in this
          matter. You never knew of a preacher who gathers a crowd, or who is
          doing any good, but he is sure to be slandered, and vilified, and so
          on; but here is a promise -- "Every tongue that shall rise against
          thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn." We can afford a little slander,
          because we know we shall have all the more to condemn. The more
          accusers, the more acquittals; the more slander, so much the more
          honor of God: so the enemy may just slander still for what we care;
          for "every tongue that shall rise against us in judgment we shall
          condemn."
        </p>
        <p>
          But I know that there are some of my hearers who believe and love the
          doctrines of grace; and sometimes you are called to dispute and
          contend for them. I know you are; I trust you are; I hope you love to
          "contend for the faith once delivered to the saints." I know what is
          the case with many of you: when you come to plead with an infidel you
          do not know what to say. Has it not been so with you many a time? You
          have said, "I almost wish I could hold my tongue, for the man has
          confounded me;" yet remember, "Every tongue that shall rise against
          thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn." Last time you had that dispute,
          you thought your adversary conquered, did you not? You thought wrong.
          He might glory in his intellectual prowess. He might say, "Oh, that
          man is nothing to me." But leave him alone till he gets to bed; and
          when the hours of darkness are around him, he will seriously begin to
          think. He conquered you in appearance; but now you master him. Wait
          till he is sick, and then your words shall ring in his ears; they
          shall come up again from the grave if he should survive you, and you
          will conquer him then. Do not be afraid to argue for the truth. Do not
          think that infidels are wise men; or Arminians are so exceedingly
          learned. Stand up for the truth; and there is so much solid learning
          and real truth to be found in the doctrines that we uphold, that none
          of you need be ashamed of them. They are mighty and must prevail. The
          mighty God of Jacob, by the demonstration of the Holy Ghost, makes
          them triumphant!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one that has risen against me in judgment may times, and I
          dare say he has troubled many of the dear people of the Lord here --
          that is Satan. He is always rising in judgment against us. Whenever we
          get into a little trouble, he comes and says, "You are no saint." If
          we commit a sin -- "You should not sin like that, if you had been a
          child of God; you have no interest in the covenant; you are an
          enthusiast, you have deceived yourself." How many times Satan has
          risen against me in judgment -- so risen that I have been fool enough
          to heed what he said. I have told him sometimes, "You are a liar, and
          the father of lies;" but at other times I have believed his malicious
          accusation. O, it is no easy thing to stand against the insinuations
          of the evil one. You, my brethren, are not strangers to his devices.
          He has set conscience at you, the hell-hounds of legal convictions
          howled upon you, and the drum of terrible doom thundered in you ears;
          then up stood the fiend himself and denied your union with Jesus,
          claiming you as his own prey and portion. Ah, how glorious the moment
          when our Advocate entered the forum of conscience, and assured us that
          he had pleaded our cause in the court of King's Bench above. And, oh,
          when he showed us the adversary's brief, spoiled by the nails of the
          cross, we felt that the tongue of Satan was condemned, and his
          calumnies hushed. Glorious Councillor, all praise to thine adorable
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the saints know also that they shall soon have a yet more public
          triumph over their cruel enemy. At the day of judgment, the foe of God
          and man shall be dragged from his cell, shall lift his brazen front
          with thunder scarred, receive his sentence, and begin a hell more
          terrible than all he has endured before. O saint, dost thou know that
          thou shalt judge him? Know you not that you shall judge angels? You,
          sons of God, shall sit as assessors with the firstborn Son, and when
          he shall pronounce the doom of the dragon, you shall solemnly say
          "Amen" to the sentence. Rejoice, O poor tried one; thou shalt tread
          upon the head of thine enemy, and thou shalt know that the promise is
          fulfilled in thine own experience -- "Every tongue that shall rise
          against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, beloved, I have spoken sufficiently for the present on this
          glorious heritage of the saints of God. The weapons are not to
          prosper, and the tongues are to be condemned. II. Now we must close up
          with THE SAINT'S WATCHWORD. What is that? "This is the heritage of the
          servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the
          Lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          In ancient times, if not at present, armies used to have their
          watchwords, by which they might recognize one another in the dark. We
          want a watchword now. It is very difficult to tell the children of God
          unless we have certain signs. God himself gives us the watchword.
          "Your righteousness is of me, saith the Lord." You can always tell a
          saint of God by this watchword. If he says, "My righteousness of God,"
          you may safely believe that he is a disciple of Jesus Christ. If he
          does not understand our shibboleth, he may not have lived in that
          country where they speak the pure language of Canaan, and that may
          excuse defects in his language. He may differ from us in some points,
          but if he sincerely says, "My righteousness is of God," you may safely
          conclude that he is not an enemy of truth. I mean "THE TRUTH as it is
          in Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          We may understand this watchword in two senses. It may mean that
          Christian justification in the eyes of the world is of God; and again,
          their righteousness and salvation is of God. O, there is to be a time
          when God's children shall come out clear of all slander, when
          falsehood shall be swept away, and they shall stand forth justified
          even by their enemies. Their slanderers shall have nothing to say
          against them. They shall share in the admiration which an assembled
          universe shall be constrained to give to him who doeth all things
          well. But this vindication will not be brought about by their own
          efforts. They have not been anxious to avoid reproach for Christ's
          sake. They have not wept and bemoaned themselves because they were
          counted the offscouring of all things. No; their righteousness, their
          entire clearing from the aspersions of malice and the calumnies of
          envy will come from Jehovah. The escutcheon of the church is in the
          Lord's hands, and he will wipe away all her defilement. The character
          of the saints God himself shall vindicate, and all liars shall have
          their portion in the lake of fire and brimstone. Let this be the
          pennon on our lance; let this be our cheering watchword, our
          vindication -- "Our righteousness is of the Lord." Now for the second
          meaning" "Their justifying righteousness is of me," saith the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if I wished to test you all, and might ask you only one question,
          I would ask this: What is your righteousness? Now come along in single
          file. What is your righteousness? O, I am as good as my neighbors. Go
          along with you; you are not my comrade. What is your righteousness?
          Well, I am rather better than my neighbors, for I go to chapel
          regularly. Off with you, sir; you do not know the watchword. And you
          next; what is your righteousness? I have been baptized, and am a
          member of the church. Yes, and so you may; and if that is your hope,
          you are in the gall of bitterness. Now, you next; what is your hope?
          O, I do all I can, and Christ makes up the rest. Rubbish! You are a
          Babylonian, you are no Israelite: Christ is no make-weight -- away
          with you. Here comes the last. What is your righteousness? My
          righteousness if filthy rags, except one righteousness which I have,
          which Christ wrought out for me on Calvary, imputed to me by God
          himself, which makes me pure and spotless as an angel. Ah, brother,
          you and I are fellow-soldiers: I have found you out; that is the
          watchword. "Your righteousness is of me, saith the Lord." I do not ask
          whether you are Churchmen, or whether you are Methodists, or
          Independents, or Baptists, if you do but know this watchword -- "Your
          righteousness is of me, saith the Lord." I can forgive all those other
          minor things, if you can sing --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, thy blood and righteousness,</p>
        <p>My beauty are, my glorious dress."</p>
        <p>
          Tell me you have got any other trust, and I will have nothing to do
          with you. Tell me you can work out your own salvation, and I will not
          acknowledge you for a brother. But if you tell me that from first to
          last you rely on Jesus, then I acknowledge you as a fellow-soldier;
          and I am glad to see you wherever I meet you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to wind up; we have had the heritage of the saints, and we have
          had the watchword of the saints. What next shall we say? We will say,
          how well God has kept his promise. Has he not? You must know that it
          is just 249 years ago -- it will be 250 next year -- the fifth jubilee
          -- since under the Parliament-house the train was laid, and the gun
          powder ready, to blow up the House of Lords and Commons, and utterly
          to destroy the nation. Ah, this night 249 years ago, how Satan gloated
          on the thought that he should destroy the church, and exalt his
          darlings to honors in the place of those who loved the Lord. Where are
          their mighty men? O! they said, the foundations will be removed; and
          what will the righteous do? They thought that surely their end would
          be accomplished. But how sadly were they disappointed! They were
          discovered. Down went the soldiers, and found out the plot; and Popery
          had been prevented from spreading throughout Great Britain. O, blessed
          be the name of the Lord! "no weapon that is formed against the church
          shall prosper." We glory because we can put our finger upon history
          and exclaim, God is true, and events are witnesses of his
          faithfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          O beloved, has the Holy Ghost given you an inwrought knowledge of the
          truth of this word of God? Have you experienced blesses deliverances
          from the right hand of the Most High? Many of you, I fear, have
          neither part nor lot in this matter, and you have true cause to lament
          you terrible loss in being unable to grasp these covenant blessings.
          But some of us may now anticipate the hour when we shall obtain
          complete redemption with all the blood-bought family, and then, ah,
          then, how shall we with rapture review delivering grace in all its
          thousand instances! Hark! hark! methought I heard sweet music;
          methought I heard a song descending from the regions up above, borne
          down by gales whose breath is sweet as that which comes from the spicy
          groves of Araby. I hear a sound not earthly: it is, it must be
          celestial, for no mortal sonnets can with these compare. O river of
          harmony! Where are the lips from which thou flowest? The heavens are
          opened; I see a host in white robes, with crowns upon their heads, and
          palm-branches in their hands. Who are these? whence come they? These
          are they who have passed through much tribulation. We have whitened
          our robes in the blood of the Lamb; therefore we are without fault
          before the throne of God, and we serve him day and night in his
          temple. Holy ones, repeat the song; saints of God, re-echo the chorus;
          repeat it yet again, that these ears may hear it. What do you sing?
          "No weapon that is formed against us hath prospered; every tongue that
          hath risen against us in judgment we have condemned." This is the
          heritage -- "Our righteousness is of the Lord." Farewell, saints of
          God! Now, saints below, take up the train, and sing it by holy,
          faithful, confident anticipation --
        </p>
        <p>"No weapon hath prospered, the foe is o'ercome;</p>
        <p>No tongue hath succeeded, the wise ones are dumb;</p>
        <p>The Lord is our glory, and each of the host</p>
        <p>Shall yet shout hosannah on Canaan's fair coast."</p>
        <p>Glory to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, world without end.</p>
        <p>ISAIAH 43:14-28; AND 44:1-8.</p>
        <p>
          Isaiah 43:14-16. Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of
          Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down
          all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. I am
          the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. Thus saith
          the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty
          water;
        </p>
        <p>
          Great events in history all have some connection with the Church of
          Christ. We may not always be able to see it, but we may rest assured
          that it is so. The rise and fall of empires have a great deal to do
          with the chosen people of God. So here he reminds them of what he did
          in the ancient days when he emote Egypt at the Red sea, and made a
          path for his people through the mighty waters.
        </p>
        <p>
          17. Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
          power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are
          extinct, they are quenched as tow.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a little blaze and a little smoke, and then all is over with
          the tow. So shall it be with those who set themselves up against the
          Lord; he shall confound their wisdom, and humble their pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          18, 19. Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the thing
          of old. Behold I will do a new thing;
        </p>
        <p>
          What God has done once, he can do again; but he can also make yet
          grander and more marvellous displays of his power and grace than he
          has ever yet given.
        </p>
        <p>
          19, 20. Now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even
          make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. The beast of
          the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give
          water, in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to
          my people, my chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          If then, O child of God, thou art in sore distress; if all around thee
          is comfortless as a waste, howling wilderness; yet do not despair: God
          can make a way for thee even there, and can supply thy needs. He open
          up a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the midst of the desert; joy
          and rejoicing may come to thee even in the depths of thy distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          21. This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
          praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will not be disappointed in his people. He made them that he might
          get glory out of them, and he will surely have it; none shall be able
          to prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          22-24. But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
          weary of me, O Israel. Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of
          thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices.
          I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee
          with incense. Thou hast brought me no sweet cane with money, neither
          hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made
          me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that this is the wearied Lord who is speaking, the Lord whose
          patience seems to be well-nigh exhausted by the provocations of his
          people; yet how wonderful is his message to them!
        </p>
        <p>
          25, 26. I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for my
          own sake, and will not remember thy sins. Put me in remembrance. Iet
          us together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If thou hast anything to say in thine own defense, out with it. Come
          to me, and let the cause of this quarrel be removed; let me hear thy
          plea if thou hast one."
        </p>
        <p>
          27, 28. Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
          transgressed against me. Therefore I have profaned the princes of the
          sanctuary and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          God justifies himself for his heavy strokes upon Israel, tells them
          that the reason lay in their own sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isaiah 44:1-3. Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant and Israel, whom I
          have chosen. Thus saith the LORD, that made thee, and formed thee from
          the womb, which will help thee; Fear not O Jacob, my servant; and
          thou, Jeshrun, whom I have chosen. For I will pour water upon him that
          is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon
          thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Think not that I am anxious to punish you for your sin. Only return
          to me, and I will be delighted to bless you. I will help you out of
          your troubles; I will supply your needs; and not only so, but I will
          bless your children generation after generation."
        </p>
        <p>
          4, 5. And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
          water courses. One shall say, I am the LORD'S, and another shall call
          himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his
          hand unto the LORD, and, surname himself by the name of Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          God still has power over human hearts; he can bring back to himself
          his wandering children.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD
          of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gathered up all into himself: as he is the first and the last,
          where is there space for any other god? He, therefore, would have all
