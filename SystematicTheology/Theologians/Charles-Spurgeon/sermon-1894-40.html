        <p>
          Arise, shine; for thy light is come,<br />And the glory of the LORD is
          risen upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,<br />And gross darkness
          the peoples:<br />But the LORD shall arise upon thee,<br />And his
          glory shall be seen upon thee.
        </p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>
          And nations shall come to thy light,<br />And kings to the brightness
          of thy rising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lift up thine eyes round about, and see:<br />They all gather
          themselves together, they come to thee: Thy sons shall come from
          far,<br />And thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then thou shalt see and be lightened,<br />And thine heart shall
          tremble and be enlarged;<br />Because the abundance of the sea shall
          be turned unto thee, The wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multitude of camels shall cover thee,<br />The dromedaries of
          Midian and Ephah;<br />They all shall come from Sheba, they shall
          bring gold and frankincense, And shall proclaim the praises of the
          LORD.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, The rams
          of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee;<br />They shall come up with
          acceptance on mine altar,<br />And I will beautify the house of my
          glory.
        </p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>
          Who are these that fly as a cloud,<br />And as the doves to their
          windows?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely the isles shall wait for me,<br />And the ships of Tarshish
          first,<br />To bring thy sons from far,<br />Their silver and their
          gold with them,<br />For the name of the LORD thy God,<br />And for
          the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee. And strangers
          shall build up thy walls,<br />And their kings shall minister unto
          thee:<br />For in my wrath I smote thee,<br />But in my favour have I
          had mercy on thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thy gates also shall be open continually,<br />They shall not be shut
          day nor night;<br />That men may bring unto thee the wealth of the
          nations, And their kings led with them:<br />For that nation and
          kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; Yea, those nations
          shall be utterly wasted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee,<br />The fir tree, the
          pine, and the box tree together;<br />To beautify the place of my
          sanctuary,<br />And I will make the place of my feet glorious.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the sons of them that afflicted thee<br />Shall come bending unto
          thee;<br />And all they that despised thee<br />Shall bow themselves
          down at the soles of thy feet.
        </p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p>
          And they shall call thee the City of the LORD,<br />The Zion of the
          Holy One of Israel.<br />Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated,<br />So
          that no man passed through thee,<br />I will make thee an eternal
          excellency,<br />A joy of many generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations,<br />And shalt suck the
          breast of kings:<br />And thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy
          saviour, And thy redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
        </p>
        <p>
          For brass I will bring gold,<br />And for iron I will bring silver,<br />And
          for wood brass,<br />And for stones iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also make thy officers peace,<br />And thine exactors
          righteousness;<br />Violence shall no more be heard in thy land,<br />Desolation
          nor destruction within thy borders;<br />But thou shalt call thy walls
          Salvation,<br />And thy gates Praise.
        </p>
        <p>5</p>
        <p>
          The sun shall be no more thy light by day,<br />Neither for brightness
          shall the moon give light unto thee: But the LORD shall be unto thee
          an everlasting light, And thy God thy glory.<br />Thy sun shall no
          more go down,<br />Neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:<br />For
          the LORD shall be thine everlasting light,<br />And the days of thy
          mourning shall be ended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thy people also shall be all righteous,<br />They shall inherit the
          land for ever;<br />The branch of my planting,<br />The work of my
          hands,<br />That I may be glorified.<br />The little one shall become
          a thousand,<br />And the small one a strong nation:<br />I the LORD
          will hasten it in its time.
