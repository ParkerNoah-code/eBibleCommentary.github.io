        <p>From the Discourse on Soul and Body.</p>
        <p>
          For this reason did the Father send His Son from heaven without a
          bodily form, that, when He should put on a body by means of the
          Virgin's womb, and be born man, He might save man, and gather together
          those members of His which death had scattered when he divided man.

          And further on: -- The earth shook, and its foundations trembled; the
          sun fled away, and the elements turned back, and the day was changed
          into night: for they could not endure the sight of their Lord hanging
          on a tree. The whole creation was amazed, marvelling and saying, "What
          new mystery, then, is this? The Judge is judged, and holds his peace;
          the Invisible One is seen, and is not ashamed; the Incomprehensible is
          laid hold upon, and is not indignant; the Illimitable is
          circumscribed, and doth not resist; the Impossible suffereth, and doth
          not avenge; the Immortal dieth, and answereth not a word; the
          Celestial is laid in the grave, and endureth! What new mystery is
          this?" The whole creation, I say, was astonished; but, when our Lord
          arose from the place of the dead, and trampled death under foot, and
          bound the strong one, and set man free, then did the whole creation
          see clearly that for man's sake the Judge was condemned, and the
          Invisible was seen, and the Illimitable was circumscribed, and the
          Impassible suffered, and the Immortal died, and the Celestial was laid
          in the gave. For our Lord, when He was born man, was condemned in
          order that He might show mercy, was bound in order that He might
          loose, was seized in order that He might release, suffered in order
          that He might feel compassion, died in order that He might give life,
          was laid in the grave that He might raise from the dead. <br />
