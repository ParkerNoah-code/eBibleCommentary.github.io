        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1835)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's Day Morning, April 12th, 1885, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Now consider how great this man was." -- Hebrews 7:4.</p>
        <p>
          CONSIDER how great Melchizedek was. There is something majestic about
          every movement of that dimly-revealed figure. His one and only
          appearance is thus fitly described in the Book of Genesis, -- "And
          Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the
          priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be
          Abram of the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into
          thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all." We see but little of him,
          yet we see nothing little in him. He is here and gone, as far as the
          historic page is concerned, yet is he "a priest for ever," and "it is
          witnessed that he liveth." Everything about him is on a scale majestic
          and sublime.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Consider how great this man was" in the combination of his offices.
          He was duly appointed both priest and king: king of righteousness and
          peace, and at the same time priest of the Most High God. It may be
          said of him that he sat as a priest upon his throne. He exercised the
          double office to the great blessedness of those who were with him; for
          his one act towards Abraham would seem to be typical of his whole
          life; he blessed him in the name of the Most High God. "Consider how
          great this man was" that he not only ruled his people with
          righteousness and brought them peace, but he was their representative
          towards God and God's representative to them; and in each character
          distributed divine blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Consider how great this man was" in the power of his benedictions.
          Abraham had already been greatly blessed so much so that he is
          described as "he that received the promises." Yet a receiver of
          promises so great, a man with whom God had entered into solemn
          covenant, was yet blessed by Melchizedek, and without all
          contradiction the less is blessed of the better. This great man yet
          further blessed the blessed Abraham, and the father of the faithful
          was glad to receive benediction at his hands. No small man this: no
          priest of second rank; but one who overtops the sons of men by more
          than head and shoulders, and acts a superior's part among the greatest
          of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Consider how great this man was" in supremacy over all around him. He
          met Abraham when he was returning as a conqueror from the overthrow of
          the robber kings; and the victorious patriarch bowed before him and
          gave him tithes of the best of the spoil. Without a moment's
          hesitation the man of God recognized the priest of God, and paid to
          him the tribute of a subject to the officer of a great king. In
          Abraham's bowing all the line of Aaronic priesthood did homage unto
          Melchizedek; for as the apostle saith, "Levi also, who receiveth
          tithes, paid tithes in Abraham, for he was yet in the loins of his
          father when Melchizedek met him." So that all kings in Abraham, and
          all priests in Abraham, did homage unto this man, who, as king and
          priest, was owned to be supreme. "Consider how great this man was"
          when Paul had once proved that Melchizedek was greater than all other,
          at least to the Hebrews; for the seed of Abraham can recognize none
          greater than Abraham; and since Abraham by paying tithes acknowledges
          his subordination to Melchizedek, it is clear that the priest of the
          Most High God was the greatest of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Consider how great this man was" as to the singularity of his person,
          "without father, without mother, without descent": that is to say, we
          know nothing as to his birth, his origin, or his history. Even this
          explanation hardly answers to the words, especially when it is added,
          "Having neither beginning of days, nor end of life." So mysterious is
          Melchizedek that many deeply-taught expositors think that he was
          veritably an appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ. They are inclined to
          believe that he was not a king of some city in Canaan, as the most of
          us suppose, but that he was a manifestation of the Son of God, such as
          were the angels that appeared to Abraham on the plains of Mamre, and
          that divine being who appeared to Joshua by Jericho, and to the three
          holy ones in the furnace. At any rate, you may well consider how great
          this man was when you observe how veiled in cloud is everything about
          his coming and going -- veiled because intended to impress us with the
          depth of the sacred meanings which were shadowed forth in him. How
          much more shall this be said of him of whom we ask --
        </p>
        <p>"Thy generation who can tell,</p>
        <p>Or count the number of thy years?"</p>
        <p>
          "Consider how great this man was" in the specialty of his office. He
          had no predecessor in his priesthood, and he had no successor. He was
          not one who took a holy office and then laid it down; but as far as
          the historic page of Scripture is concerned we have no note of his
          quitting this mortal scene; he disappears, but we read nothing of his
          death any more than of his birth. His office was perpetual, and passed
          not from sire to son; for he was the type of "One who is made not
          after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an
          endless life."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Consider how great this man was" in his being altogether unique.
          There is another "after the order of Melchizedek," the glorious
          Antitype in whom Melchizedek himself is absorbed; but apart from him
          Melchizedek is unique. Who can equal this strange, mysterious priest,
          prophet, king, sent of the Most High God to bless the father of the
          faithful? He is altogether alone: he receives no commission from the
          hands of men, nor from God by men; and he does not transmit to a
          successor what he had not received from a predecessor. Melchizedek
          stands alone: one mighty crag, rising out of the plain; a long Alp,
          whose brow is swathed in cloud sublime. "Consider how great this man
          was" but think not to measure that greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall leave you to that consideration; for my business this morning
          is not with Melchizedek, but with a greater than he. I shall take my
          text in its connection, but lift it up to a higher application.
          Beloved friends, if Melchizedek was so great, how much greater is that
          man whom Melchizedek represents! If the type is so wonderful what must
          the Antitype be! I invite you to consider "how great" is he of whom it
          is written, "The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou are a priest
          forever after the order of Melchizedek." I will not say "Consider how
          great this man was", for there is no verb: the "was" is inserted in
          italics by the translators. We are to consider "how great this man."
          Say "was" if you will, but read also "is," and "shall be." Consider
          how great this man was and is, and is to be, even the Man Christ
          Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          And first, this morning, let me exhort you to consider how great this
          man is: then let me assist you to consider how great this man is: and
          then let us practically improve our consideration of how great this
          man is, trying to turn it to holy account as the Holy Ghost may enable
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, LET ME EXHORT YOU TO CONSIDER HOW GREAT THIS MAN, THE
          LORD JESUS CHRIST, is.
        </p>
        <p>
          This subject claims your consideration. I do not think it should be a
          matter of option with you whether you will now consider the greatness
          of your Lord or not; it is his due and right that you should consider
          his greatness. For he of whom we speak, -- "this man," is one well
          known among us. If you be true to your profession he is one most dear
          to you, to whom you owe all things, aye, owe your very selves. He is
          one between whom and you there is a troth plighted: you are espoused
          unto him, your hearts are his, even as his heart is yours. If you do
          not consider him, who will? He has loved you, and given himself for
          you. Strangers may listen to our teaching at this time, and in vain we
          may cry,
        </p>
        <p>"Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by?</p>
        <p>Is it nothing to you that Jesus should die?"</p>
        <p>
          But you are no stranger, you are not even a guest in his house, but
          you are a child living at home with him. He is your brother, and much
          more; for he is bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh. All your
          interests are wrapped up in him. You are one with him: by an endless
          union, one. I claim, therefore, and I am sure you assent at once to
          the claim, that you should often consider your Lord, and the greatness
          of his nature, person, office, and work. His greatness should be your
          perpetual theme. I would urge that all other thoughts should now be
          banished, for this is your Lord's own day, and therefore to him it
          should be dedicated with glad consent. If you are in the Spirit on the
          Lord's day, you will, like John in Patmos, give all your thoughts to
          the Son of Man who walketh among the golden candlesticks. I urge it on
          you that you do now consider with your whole heart and mind, how great
          this man is. Do you not consent to the claim?
        </p>
        <p>
          Certainly the subject needs consideration; for, dear friends, we shall
          never gain an idea of how great he is unless we do consider, and
          consider much. Here is a great deep, and it cannot be fathomed by the
          thoughtless. You think you know Christ, and, blessed be his name, you
          do know him in a sense; but do you know the thousandth part of him?
          When the apostle Paul had known Christ for many years he wrote to the
          Philippians, and he then expressed himself as desiring to know Christ;
          for though he knew him to his own personal salvation, yet he felt that
          he did not know him to the full. He owned that he knew the love of
          Christ, but he added, "it passeth knowledge." Well may each of us who
          has been for years a student at the Master's feet exclaim, "I find
          myself a learner yet." I suppose the saints who have been in heaven
          now for thousands of years, and have been evermore adoring him, are
          still students of him. This is the philosophy which the most cultured
          mind shall never fully compass, -- "God manifest in the flesh."
          "Consider how great this man is!" This is a matter worthy of continual
          research, and calling for profound thought. You must weigh this
          subject, and turn it over, and meditate upon it the livelong day. You
          must let it lie both day and night upon your hearts as a bundle of
          camphor, perfuming the bosom in which it lies. You must look, and
          look, and look, and look again: still looking unto Jesus. The angels
          standing on the golden mercy-seat have ever their eyes bent downward,
          desiring to look within; and that must be your posture. Oh, you
          servants of the Lord, by looking to Jesus you began to live, by
          looking to him you shall continue to live, and your life shall find
          strength and growth. This sacred subject shall ever need more and more
          consideration from you. Oh the depths of the love, and wisdom, and
          glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ!
        </p>
        <p>
          I go a little further, and say that not only does my subject claim
          your consideration and need your consideration, but it solemnly
          commands it. The text is not a mere piece of advice; it is by
          inspiration that the apostle bids you today out of this sacred page,
          "Consider how great this man was." He charges you to think of
          Melchizedek but much more would he have you remember Melchizedek's
          Antitype. Oh, do not, my brethren, do not need to be pressed to this
          divine study: love it, never cease from it. Count every minute wasted
          in which you are not learning more about Jesus. Reckon all other
          knowledge to be as mere chaff and dog's meat as compared with the
          knowledge of Christ crucified. In these days of science, falsely so
          called, determine with the apostle to know nothing among men save
          Jesus Christ and him crucified. It is imperative upon you that you
          love the Lord your God with all your heart, and all your soul, and all
          your mind; and that God in Christ Jesus should call into exercise
          every faculty of your inner man, while, with blended intellect and
          emotion, you consider how great he was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow out this meditation, I pray you, because there is an exceeding
          great reward for any man who will "consider how great this man was." I
          find for myself that the only possibility of my living is living in
          Christ and unto Christ. Look you about and try to live by the wisdom
          of man. Unstable as water and fickle as the wind is the product of
          human wisdom. The history of philosophy, from the beginning until now,
          is the history of fools; and never was folly so self-evident as in the
          philosophy which is now dominant. I believe that within a century it
          will be found impossible to make men believe that educated men were
          ever so degraded as to accept the philosophy of the present hour; it
          will seem to be so altogether absurd and contrary to all reason and
          common sense, that it will be rejected with scorn as a popular
          delusion of a dark age. Even today this generation is kicking about
          like footballs the philosophies of preceding ages, and we may rest
          assured that future generations will do the same with the doting of
          today. I find, therefore, that I must come back to the revelation of
          God. Here is a rock beneath my feet -- "God was in Christ, reconciling
          the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them."
          Certain great facts concerning God and his Christ have been made known
          to us by the Holy Ghost, and these are infallibly sure. God's
          revelation is true, whatever man's dreams may be. On the basis of
          revelation there is foothold. A personal knowledge of Christ revealed
          by the Spirit is also a sure matter. I get to Jesus, I speak to him,
          and meditate upon him, and he rises before me greater than ever, till
          in his presence all the learning of men condenses into folly. He is
          "God only wise." Ah, then I live when he is all in all! My heart is
          glad and my glory rejoiceth when I forget all else save Christ Jesus
          my Lord. Therefore, brethren, I say that you shall find a great reward
          in full often coming near to your Lord, and considering again and
          again how great he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider his greatness, and I again remind you that the blessing comes
          only by consideration. I may speak to you this morning about the
          greatness of my Master, but I shall not succeed in fully declaring it.
          I am never more vexed with myself than when I have done my very best
          to extol his dear name! What is it but holding a candle to the sun?
          What are my lispings compared with the loud acclamations which such an
          one as he is might well expect from those who love him? You must
          carefully consider, or you will miss the blessing. It will not be
          enough for you to hear, or read; you must do your own thinking, and
          consider your Lord for yourselves. You may even read the Bible itself
          without profit, if you do not consider as well as read. The wine is
          not made by gathering the clusters, but by treading the grapes in the
          wine-vat: under pressure the red juice leaps forth. Not the truth as
          you read it, but the truth as you meditate upon it, will be a blessing
          to you. "Read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest." "Consider how great
          this man was." Shut yourselves up with Jesus, if you would know him.
          "Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors
          about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the
          indignation be overpast." In Christ there is shelter, and the more you
          consider him the greater your peace will be. Come and lay your finger
          into the prints of the nails, and thrust your hand into his side.
          Commune with the personal Christ, who ever liveth; and evermore
          "consider how great this man was."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I exhorted you to this duty; now let me try to help you in
          it. But what help will mine be unless the Divine Spirit be with me,
          that the word spoken may be with power?
        </p>
        <p>II. LET ME NEXT ASSIST YOU TO CONSIDER HOW GREAT THIS MAN WAS.</p>
        <p>
          And first, lest the very use of the expression, "this man," should
          leave anybody for a moment in doubt as to our faith in his Godhead, I
          bid you consider how great this man was in his relationship to God.
          For though he was man, he was not merely man. He was assuredly and
          truly man in all respects, "man of the substance of his mother," bone
          of our bone and flesh of our flesh; and yet he was indeed and of a
          truth very God. Do not think of him as a divine man, or as a human
          God; he was neither the one nor the other. He was perfectly man, yet
          he was infinitely God. Think, then, into what a position of honour and
          dignity his manhood was uplifted by union with the Godhead in one
          person. Born, growing, gathering strength, coming to manhood,
          suffering, dying, in all this he was man; yet he was never at any time
          less divine. Our Lord's humanity is not to be thought of apart from
          his deity, for he is one and indivisible. I have sometimes heard
          objections made against certain expressions in Dr. Watt's hymns in
          which our Lord is spoken of as the God that bled and died, and so
          forth. I fear that the objection is frequently aimed less at the poet
          than at the truth of the deity of our Lord: the objector figures as a
          critic because he dares not avow himself a heretic. Take note that in
          the Scriptures you shall find frequent confusions of speech upon the
          person of our Lord, intentionally made, in order to show that although
          the natures were distinct, yet they were indissolubly united in the
          one person of Jesus. Of his one person might popularly be predicated
          that which in strict accuracy could only be true of his humanity, or
          only of his deity. To the one person of our Lord will be found to be
          ascribed what he did both as God and as man, and it is not needful for
          us to be wise or accurate above what is written by the Spirit of God.
          It is possible to be so true to the letter as to be false to the
          spirit. Cavillers have no monopoly of wisdom. My Lord Jesus is to me
          no less a man because he is God. Oh, how my heart loves him! He is to
          me fairest of the sons of men, chief among ten thousand, and
          altogether lovely. But he is to me because of his manhood none the
          less, but all the more, "God over all, blessed for ever." Into the
          dust my spirit bows before his majesty, and my soul adores him. I ask
          you, therefore, to consider the greatness of his manhood because it
          never was apart from his Godhead, and cannot be thought of except in
          connection therewith. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
          and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
          Father, full of grace and truth." Inconceivable is the greatness of
          the man who is thus one with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You, my brethren, are not in doubt upon this vital matter; let me,
          therefore, ask you to consider "how great this man was" as to his
          relationship to men. Christ Jesus is the second man, the Lord from
          heaven. Adam, our first father, was the head of the race, and all men
          were in him as their representative: in him they stood in the garden;
          in him, alas, they fell when he broke the divine command, and the Lord
          took up the quarrel of his covenant, and cast him out of Paradise.
          "Oh, what a fall was there, my brethren: then you and I and all of us
          fell down." We inherit because of Adam's failure a nature whose
          tendencies are towards evil. Adam was a very great personage in
          relation to the race: he was the summary of all the generations, the
          fountain of the stream of humanity. To him we might apply the language
          of the prophet, "Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God. . . . Thou
          wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till
          iniquity was found in thee." As Adam came forth from God he was as a
          covering cherub, under whose wings the race nestled down. But now
          comes in the Lord Jesus Christ as the greater man, the representative
          man, in whom none are made to fall, but multitudes arise. In this man
          the Lord is again well pleased with men. Time was when God looked on
          rebellious man, and it repented him that he had made him; but now that
          he turns his eye to this perfect man he feels no such repentance; but,
          on the contrary, we read that "God was in Christ reconciling the world
          unto himself." For the sake of the man Christ Jesus he deals with the
          innumerable race of sinners in a way of long-suffering and pity, and
          does not destroy them. Long ago had the flood-gates been pulled up
          again, and man been swept away by a deluge, not of water but of fire,
          if it had not been that the long-suffering Lord looks on the
          Well-Beloved Christ and therefore spares mankind. Yea, more; for his
          sake he sends the gospel of peace to men, and in the name of Jesus
          glad tidings are sent to every creature. It has sometimes happened
          that the illustrious deed of one man has served to elevate a class, or
          even a nation into honour. A grand, heroic deed has welded you not
          only to that one person but to all his kith and kin. Consider, then,
          how great this man was, that the divine mind which cannot look upon
          sin without indignation, nevertheless was so charmed to look upon the
          person and character of this glorious Man, that an amnesty was
          proclaimed to the race, and a message was sent to the sons of men
          bidding them repent and turn to him and live. "Consider," then, "how
          great this man was."
        </p>
        <p>
          Come a little closer, and reach forward to that which will delight
          your hearts far more; consider the relationship of Christ to his own
          people. Now we get on sure ground, and feel a rock beneath our feet.
          Long before the heavens and the earth were made, God with prescient
          eye beheld the person of his Son as God in human nature, and he saw
          all his elect lying in him. The church is his body, "the fulness of
          him that filleth all in all." God the Father saw in the divine decree
          the mystical Christ, and he was well pleased with all his redeemed for
          Christ Jesus' sake. How wondrous was that transaction when in the
          council-chamber of eternity the covenant was made, and the Lord Jesus
          Christ became the surety of that covenant. He entered into covenant
          with the eternal God on the behalf of his chosen that he would make
          atonement for their sin, and would perfect the righteousness which
          should cover every one of them, and make them to be accepted in the
          Beloved. No actual sacrifice was offered for thousands of years; but
          see how great this man was, since on the strength of his bare promise
          the Lord continued to save men for thousands of years, admitting them
          to his infinite glory before the Mediator had appeared, or the
          Redeemer had put a hand to the work. Consider that you and I, and all
          of us who are in Christ, are this day beloved for his sake, accepted
          for his sake, justified for his sake. Still doth God embrace us in the
          arms of almighty love for his sake; for his sake heaven is being
          prepared for us; for his sake the treasures of the infinite are given
          to us; because we are the covenanted ones for whom he pledged his
          troth, and for whom in the fulness of time he poured out his heart's
          blood, that he might redeem us unto God. "Consider how great this man
          was." He is so great that all the saints are blessed in him. He is so
          great that we, as many as have believed, dwell evermore in the clefts
          of this great Rock, and find in him our castle and high tower. For ye
          are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is
          our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
          "Consider how great this man was."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me help you a little further, dear friends, to "consider how great
          this man was," by reminding you of the surroundings of his first
          advent. Thousands of years before his birth holy men had been speaking
          of him. Prophets and seers all pointed to him as The Coming One. "How
          great this man was," since the wisest and best of mankind all looked
          forward to his day with gladness. Think of that wonderful system of
          types, and emblems, and symbols which God ordained by his servant
          Moses; for the whole of this system was meant to set forth the
          Messiah, who would yet appear in the fulness of time. To him witnessed
          each bleeding sacrifice, each censer of sweet incense, each golden
          vessel, each curtain and wall of tabernacle or temple: all spoke
          concerning him. Ay, and more than that, all the histories of all the
          empires were all but concentric rings of which he was the center; for
          the Lord Jesus is the center of history, the sum total of all God's
          doings and manifestations among the sons of men. That was an august
          Person towards whom all the past had been labouring, and for whom all
          the present was agonizing. "How great this man was," that when he came
          the saints were watching for him: Simeon and Anna could not depart
          till he appeared. Angels stood on tip-toe ready to descend and sing,
          Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
          Humble shepherds, as they watched their flocks, did but wait for the
          signal to hasten to adore him; and wise men from the east forgot the
          fatigues of a long journey that they might lay their gold and incense
          at his feet. How great this man was, when being born and laid in a
          manger, the whole earth was moved by his appearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider too, "how great this man was," not only as to the outward
          circumstances of his coming, but as to the secret mystery of his
          birth. For this man was not "born in sin," as we are; neither was he
          "shapen in iniquity." This is a thing to be thought of and considered
          in our privacy, but it cannot be omitted here. Thus said the angel to
          the blessed Virgin, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
          power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy
          thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
          "Conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary," he was truly a
          man, but not fallen man. The method by which the pure human nature of
          the man Christ Jesus was produced is a great mystery, but it serves to
          make us see "how great this man was." I will say no more than this,
          that we have here the fulfillment of the promise, "Behold, a virgin
          shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
          Think of that word of old: "When he bringeth in the firstbegotten into
          the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him." Let
          us, therefore worship. Reverently forbearing all idle intrusion into
          the deep things of God, let us go to Bethlehem, and "consider how
          great this man was."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us look at his life. After he emerged from the obscurity of
          his childhood, what a life was that of our Lord! His greatest
          adversaries, unless they have been mad, have never dared to speak
          against his character. If the Christian religion were supposed to be
          an invention, the existence of the narrative of the life of Jesus
          would be more wonderful than the facts themselves. The conception of a
          perfect character requires a perfect mind, and a perfect mind would
          never have prepared a fiction and imposed it upon men as a veritable
          history. If the life of Jesus be a fable, then a perfect being has
          deceived us; and this it is not possible for us to imagine. The life
          of Jesus Christ is great throughout. It is so tender and so gentle
          that it is never little and mean: it is so unselfish that it never
          ceases to be majestic; it is so condescending that it is pre-eminently
          sublime. Above all, it is full of truth, transparent, artless,
          natural. No one ever thought of Jesus as acting a part yet; he is
          reality itself. He is so simple, so unaffected, so truly the holy
          child Jesus, that in this he is great above all. Never was a man so
          wholly seen as the Christ; and yet never was man so little understood.
          You have read memoirs of departed worthies, and you have felt, The
          biographer did well to say no more upon this point; but you never felt
          that anything need be reserved as to the character of Jesus. If his
          chronicles had kept on writing till the world itself had been made a
          library of the lives of Christ they would never have recorded an
          unworthy act or a regrettable word. It is not only that his pursuits
          were majestic, for he came to save men; that his motives were divine,
          for he revealed the Father; but it is himself that is so great -- I
          mean his soul, his spirit, the man himself. Look at Alexander, he is a
          great conqueror, but what a pitiful creature he appears when the
          drunkard's bowl has maddened him. What a poor thing is Napoleon as
          seen in privacy! In his captivity he was as petulant as a spoiled
          child. Consider the Lord Jesus, and it does not matter where you view
          him: in the wilderness he is grandly victorious over temptation, in
          the crowd he is greatly wise in answering those who would entrap him.
          Behold him in his agony in the Garden; was there ever such an
          Agoniser? Behold him as the crucified; did ever cross hold such a
          sufferer? When Jesus is least he is greatest, and when he is in the
          direst darkness his brightness is best revealed. In death he destroys
          death; in the grave he bursts the sepulcher. "Consider how great this
          man was": the field of his life is ample; do not be slow to
          investigate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I cannot speak as I would of him. The blaze of this Sun
          blinds me! Yet consider how great this man was in his death; for then
          he appeared as the great Sin-offering, putting away the sin of his
          people. The Lord had made to meet in him the iniquity of us all. What
          a weight was on him, yet he sustained it! The wrath of God on account
          of sin fell upon him who had never sinned, and he bore it all. A
          penalty which must have made a hell for us for ever was exacted of our
          Lord upon the cross, and he discharged it. He drank the whole of our
          bitter cup. He bore in himself all that was necessary to vindicate the
          divine justice until he could truly say, "It is finished." "Lama
          Sabachthani" is the most terrible word that ever came from human lips;
          and therefore "It is finished" is the greatest utterance that tongue
          ever gave forth. The work was colossal; what if I say it was infinite;
          and therefore our Lord Jesus when he cried "It is finished," had
          reached the summit of greatness. "Consider how great this man was."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, consider for a minute "how great this man was" when he
          rose again; for he could not be holden with the bonds of death, and
          his body could not see corruption. It was a great thing in itself for
          Christ to rise, but what I want you to remember is, that we all rose
          in him. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
          alive;" and especially his covenanted people were raised up together
          with him. There was for his redeemed a death in his death and a rising
          again in his rising again; for we have been made partakers of his
          resurrection, and we live in newness of life by his rising from the
          dead. This is his cry as he rises from the tomb, "Because I live ye
          shall live also." "Consider how great this man was" whose life imparts
          life to all who are in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he has gone up on high, and has led captivity captive. Think of
          the gifts which were showered down from heaven in consequence of this
          man's ascent into the highest. For the Holy Spirit descended never to
          return till the close of this dispensation, and now all the gifts that
          rest in the church of God, and all the works of regeneration,
          illumination, sanctification, and the like, which are wrought by the
          blessed Paraclete, are the effects of the entrance of this man into
          the secret place of the tabernacles of the Most High. Every soul
          regenerated, every heart comforted, every mind quickened, every eye
          illuminated, every creature spiritually blessed, reflects glory upon
          this man. How great is he!
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, I would we had time this morning to introduce you to this man
          as he now sits at the right hand of God, even the Father. There is no
          need for me to depict him; if there were it were impossible to me.
          What said the man who loved him best, and knew him best? "When I saw
          him I fell at his feet as dead." "Consider how great this man is" now,
          when every angel pays him homage, and at the name of Jesus every knee
          doth bow, of things in heaven; as by-and-by every knee shall bow of
          things on earth, and things that are under the earth, for Jesus Christ
          is Lord to the glory of God the Father. "Consider how great this man
          is," and then remember that he shall shortly come to be our Judge!
          Possibly, while I am yet speaking to you, he may appear; no man
          knoweth the day nor the hour; but "how great this man is" will be
          clearly seen when, in flaming fire, he shall take vengeance upon those
          that will not obey him. How "great" will he be when in the
          manifestation of his glory all believers shall be glorified. I think I
          hear, even now, sounding out of my theme, shouts of "hallelujah,
          hallelujah," from assembled worlds. Yes, the music peals forth loud
          and long, "King of kings, and Lord of lords. HALLELUJAH. For he shall
          reign for ever and ever. HALLELUJAH!" Break forth with your loud
          hosannas, oh, ye waiting spirits of believing men, for the time is at
          hand when he shall be admired in all them that believe! Consider how
          great this man is. I have but reached the fringe of my subject. We see
          but the skirts of our Lord's garments; his actual glory is
          unspeakable, unsearchable. Oh, the depths! Oh, the depths!
        </p>
        <p>
          III. This in a few words is THE PRACTICAL IMPROVEMENT of the whole
          subject, with which we must wind up. Consider how great this man was,
          and as you consider, believe in his infinite power to bless men. He is
          full of blessing as the sun is full of light, that he may shine upon
          his needy creatures. Christ is full of blessing that he may bless
          poor, needy, empty sinners. Dost thou say, poor sinner, "I am so great
          a sinner that he cannot save me"? Consider what this man did when he
          was here on earth; he went about and laid his hands on the diseased,
          and they were cured; he looked at devils, and they fled; he spoke to
          fevers and they disappeared. And he in heaven is, and if I may so say,
          greater than when he was here below, for here on earth he was veiled
          in humiliation, but now he is enthroned in infinite majesty, "able to
          save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever
          liveth to make intercession for them." Believe in the infinite
          blessedness treasured up in Christ for every believing soul, and come
          and take your share of it this morning. All that you want, and all
          that wish -- come and receive freely, for he doth graciously dispense
          it, and it is a part of his glory that he delights to enrich the
          children of men. Let faith in Jesus be one lesson -- may God write it
          on each heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then let us ascribe to our Lord Jesus Christ all the honour that
          our thoughts can compass. Let us give to him this day our very selves
          over again. Consider how great this man was, and go away feeling how
          greatly you are indebted to him, what great things you ought to do for
          him, and how little your greatest thing is when you have done it as
          compared with the greatness of his deservings.
        </p>
        <p>"Let him be crowned with majesty</p>
        <p>That bowed his head to death;</p>
        <p>And be his honour sounded high</p>
        <p>By all things that have breath."</p>
        <p>Do not you feel that question pressing upon your heart?</p>
        <p>"Oh what shall I do</p>
        <p>My Saviour to praise!"</p>
        <p>
          Do something; and having done it do more, and yet more. Give up your
          whole being to the showing forth of how great this Man is!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, considering how great this Man is do not be afraid, nor
          troubled, nor tumbled up and down in your thoughts about anything that
          is happening, or is yet to happen. "Consider how great this man was."
          Our wise men are going to do away with the old faith; modern culture
          means to stamp out old- fashioned orthodoxy. Christianity itself is
          getting to be effete, and something better is to supersede it. Listen!
          "Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The
          kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
          together, against the Lord, and against his anointed. He that sitteth
          in the heaven shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Yet
          have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion." One said to me the
          other day, "The current of thought does not seem to run in the
          direction of evangelical religion." Well, I said I should not believe
          in evangelical religion an atom the more if the current of thought did
          run that way. We do not believe according to the counting of heads.
          The currents of men's thoughts are so uncertain that you can better
          tell the flight of birds, or the changing of English weather. The
          gospel is perhaps the surer to be true because there are so few who
          believe it. It is according to our expectation that God's revealed
          truth should be abhorred and hated by the wise men of every
          generation. I shall not believe the gospel any the less if I am left
          alone, nor shall I believe it any the more if the whole world shall
          cry it up. Let God be true and every man a liar. He whose faith stands
          upon the consensus of popular opinion has placed his feet upon the
          sand, but he who has read his Bible and has been taught of the Spirit
          of God what truth is, will hold to it come what may. When you consider
          how great this man is, it seems to me that to be a fool for his sake
          is the highest wisdom, and that to cling to what he says is the best
          philosophy, and to believe him, and none beside is not alone a duty
          but a necessity of every Christian spirit. Be of good cheer, dear
          friends! Let no man's heart fail him because of modern doubt. Let no
          man be troubled because of the fierceness of the fight. I can hear
          already the sounding of the trumpets of the Lord's coming. He is not
          far away; even if thousands of years intervene before his feet touch
          the Mount of Olivet the victory will never be doubtful. All is done
          that is required for winning the battle, his blood has been shed, his
          life has been accepted as a ransom. The eternal decree has settled it,
          nothing can change it! "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and
          shall be satisfied." Amen.
