        <p>A Psalm of David.</p>
        <p>
          1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! and all my inward parts, bless his holy
          name.2. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! and forget not any of his benefits:
          3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
          4. Who redeemeth thy life from the grave; who crowneth thee with mercy
          and compassions; 5. Who satisfieth [or filleth] thy mouth with good:
          thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle's.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          1. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! The prophet, by stirring up himself to
          gratitude, gives by his own example a lesson to every man of the duty
          incumbent upon him. And doubtless our slothfulness in this matter has
          need of continual incitement. If even the prophet, who was inflamed
          with a more intense and fervent zeal than other men, was not free from
          this malady, of which his earnestness in stimulating himself is a
          plain confession, how much more necessary is it for us, who have
          abundant experience of our own torpor, to apply the same means for our
          quickening? The Holy Spirit, by his mouth, indirectly upbraids us on
          account of our not being more diligent in praising God, and at the
          same time points out the remedy, that every man may descend into
          himself and correct his own sluggishness. Not content with calling
          upon his soul (by which he unquestionably means the seat of the
          understanding and affections) to bless God, the prophet expressly adds
          his inward parts, addressing as it were his own mind and heart, and
          all the faculties of both. When he thus speaks to himself, it is as
          if, removed from the presence of men, he examined himself before God.
          The repetition renders his language still more emphatic, as if he
          thereby intended to reprove his own slothfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And forget not any of his benefits Here, he instructs us that God
          is not deficient on his part in furnishing us with abundant matter for
          praising him. It is our own ingratitude which hinders us from engaging
          in this exercise. In the first place, he teaches us that the reason
          why God deals with such liberality towards us is, that we may be led
          to celebrate his praise; but at the same time he condemns our
          inconstancy, which hurries us away to any other object rather than to
          God. How is it that we are so listless and drowsy in the performance
          of this the chief exercise of true religion, if it is not because our
          shameful and wicked forgetfulness buries in our hearts the innumerable
          benefits of God, which are openly manifest to heaven and earth? Did we
          only retain the remembrance of them, the prophet assures us that we
          would be sufficiently inclined to perform our duty, since the sole
          prohibition which he lays upon us is, not to forget them.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities He now enumerates the different
          kinds of the divine benefits, in considering which he has told us that
          we are too forgetful and slothful. It is not without cause that he
          begins with God's pardoning mercy, for reconciliation with him is the
          fountain from which all other blessings flow. God's goodness extends
          even to the ungodly; but they are, notwithstanding, so far from having
          the enjoyment of it, that they do not even taste it. The first then of
          all the blessings of which we have the true and substantial enjoyment,
          is that which consists in God's freely pardoning and blotting out our
          sins, and receiving us into his favor. Yea, rather the forgiveness of
          sins, since it is accompanied with our restoration to the favor of
          God, also sanctifies whatever good things he bestows upon us, that
          they may contribute to our welfare. The second clause is; either a
          repetition of the same sentiment, or else it opens up a wider view of
          it; for the consequence of free forgiveness is, that God governs us by
          his Spirit, mortifies the lusts of our flesh, cleanses us from our
          corruptions, and restores us to the healthy condition of a godly and
          an upright life. These who understand the words, who healeth all thy
          diseases, as referring to the diseases of the body, and as implying
          that God, when he has forgiven our sins, also delivers us from bodily
          maladies, seem to put upon them a meaning too restricted. I have no
          doubt that the medicine spoken of has a respect to the blotting out of
          guilt; and, secondly, to the curing us of the corruptions inherent in
          our nature, which is effected by the Spirit of regeneration; and if
          any one will add as a third particular included, that God being once
          pacified towards us, also remits the punishment which we deserve, I
          will not object. Let us learn from this passage that, until the
          heavenly Physician succor us, we nourish within us, not only many
          diseases, but even many deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 Who redeemeth thy life from the grave The Psalmist expresses more
          plainly what our condition is previous to God's curing our maladies --
          that we are dead and adjudged to the grave. The consideration that the
          mercy of God delivers us from death and destruction ought, therefore,
          to lead us to prize it the more highly. If the resurrection of the
          soul from the grave is the first step of spiritual life, what room for
          self-gloriation is left to man? The prophet next teaches us that the
          incomparable grace of God shines forth in the very commencement of our
          salvation, as well as in its whole progress; and the more to enhance
          the commendation of this grace, he adds the word compassions in the
          plural number. He asserts that we are surrounded with them; as if he
          had said, Before, behind, on all sides, above and beneath, the grace
          of God presents itself to us in immeasurable abundance; so that there
          is no place devoid of it. The same truth he afterwards amplifies in
          these words, thy mouth is satisfied, by which metaphor he alludes to
          the free indulgence of the palate, to which we surrender ourselves
          when we have a well-furnished table; for those who have scanty fare
          dare scarcely eat till they are half satisfied. Not that he approves
          of gluttony in greedily devouring God's benefits, as men give loose
          reins to intemperance whenever they have great abundance; but he
          borrowed this phraseology from the common custom of men, to teach us
          that whatever good things our hearts can wish flow to us from God's
          bounty, even to perfect satisfaction. Those who take the Hebrew word
          dy, adi, for ornament, mar the passage by a mere conceit of their own;
          and I am surprised how so groundless an imagination should have come
          into their minds, unless it may be accounted for from the circumstance
          that it is usual for men of a prying or inquisitive turn of mind, when
          they would show their ingenuity, to bring forward mere puerilities.
          The Psalmist next adds, that God was constantly infusing into him new
          vigor, so that his strength continued unimpaired, even as the Prophet
          Isaiah, (Isaiah 65:20) in discoursing on the restoration of the
          Church, says that a man of a hundred years old shall be like a child.
          By this mode of expression, he intimates that God, along with a very
          abundant supply of all good things, communicates to him also inward
          rigor, that he may enjoy them; and thus his strength was as it were
          continually renewed. From the comparison of the eagle, the Jews have
          taken occasion to invent, for the purpose of explanation, a fabulous
          story. Although they know not even the first elements of any science,
          yet so presumptuous are they, that whatever may be the matter treated
          of, they never hesitate to attempt to explain it, and whenever they
          meet with any thing which they do not understand, there is no figment
          so foolish that they do not bring forward, as if it were an oracle of
          God. Thus, for expounding the present passage, they give out that
          eagles, every tenth year, ascend to the elemental fire, that their
          feathers may be burnt, and that then they plunge themselves into the
          sea, and immediately new feathers grow upon them. But we may easily
          gather the simple meaning of the Prophet from the nature of the eagle,
          as described by philosophers, and which is well-known from
          observation. That bird continues fresh and vigorous, even to extreme
          old age, unenfeebled by years, and exempt from disease, until it
          finally dies of hunger. That it is long-lived is certain; but at last,
          its beak or bill grows so great that it cannot any longer take food,
          and, consequently, is forced to suck blood, or to nourish itself by
          drinking. Hence the ancient proverb in reference to old men who are
          addicted to drinking, The eagle's old age; for necessity then
          constrains eagles to drink much. But as drink alone is insufficient to
          maintain life, they die rather through hunger, than fail by the
          natural decay of strength. Now we perceive, without the help of any
          invented story, the genuine meaning of the Prophet to be, that as
          eagles always retain their rigor, and even in their old age are still
          youthful, so the godly are sustained by a secret influence derived
          from God, by which they continue in the possession of unimpaired
          strength. They are not always, it is true, full of bodily vigor while
          in this world, but rather painfully drag on their lives in continual
          weakness; still what is here said applies to them in a certain sense.
          This unquestionably is common to all in general, that they have been
          brought out of the grave, and have experienced God to be bountiful to
          them in innumerable ways. Were each of them duly to reflect how much
          he is indebted to God, he would say with good reason that his mouth is
          filled with good things; just as David, in Psalm 40:5, and 139:18,
          confesses that he was unable to reckon up the Divine benefits, because
          "they are more in number than the sands of the sea." Did not our own
          perverseness blind our understandings, we would see that, even in
          famine, we are furnished with food in such a manner, as that God shows
          us the manifold riches of his goodness. With regard to the renovation
          of our strength, the meaning is, that since, when our outward man
          decays, we are renewed to a better life, we have no reason to be
          troubled at the giving way of our strength, especially when he
          sustains us by his Spirit under the weakness and languishing of our
          mortal frames.<br />
