          9. (ph, phe,) He sent redemption to his people; (ts, tzaddi,) he hath
          commanded His covenant for ever: (q, koph,) holy and terrible is his
          name.10. (r, resh,) The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom:
          (s, schin,) good understanding have all they who do these things: (t,
          tau,) his praise endureth for ever.

          9 He sent redemption to his people What he had already stated is here
          repeated in different words. And as the deliverance of his people was
          the commencement of their salvation, it is first introduced; next is
          subjoined its confirmation in the law, by reason of which it comes to
          pass that God's adoption could never fail. For though, long prior to
          this, God had established his covenant with Abraham, which also was
          the occasion of the redemption of the people; yet what is here
          mentioned refers exclusively to the law, by which the covenant was
          ratified, never to be disannulled. The amount is, that, in the
          deliverance of the people, God did not act the part of a beneficial
          father, merely for a day, but that, in the promulgation of the law, he
          also establishedhis grace, that the hope of eternal life might
          continue for ever in the Church. Moreover, you must attend carefully
          to what I have elsewhere cautioned you against, and to which I shall
          advert more at length on Psalm 119, where the law is spoken of, That
          the commandments must not be taken always abstractly, for the Holy
          Spirit, in an especial manner, refers to the promises which are in
          Christ, by which God, in gathering his chosen people to himself, hath
          begotten them again to eternal life.

          10. The fear of Jehovah Having treated of the kindness of God, and
          paid a well-merited tribute to the law, the prophet goes on to exhort
          the faithful to reverence God, and be zealous in the keeping of the
          law. In calling the fear of God, The beginning or source of wisdom, he
          charges with folly those who do not render implicit obedience unto
          God. As if he should say, They who fear not God, and do not regulate
          their lives according to his law, are brute beasts: and are ignorant
          of the first elements of true wisdom. To this we must carefully
          attend; for although mankind generally wish to be accounted wise
          almost all the world lightly esteem God, and take pleasure in their
          own wicked craftiness. And as the very worst of men are reputed to be
          superior to all others in point of wisdom; and, puffed up with this
          confidence, harden themselves against God, the prophet declares all
          the wisdom of the world, without the fear of God, to be vanity or an
          empty shadow. And, indeed, all who are ignorant of the purpose for
          which they live are fools and madmen. But to serve God is the purpose
          for which we have been born, and for which we are preserved in life.
          There is, therefore, no worse blindness, no insensibility so
          grovelling, as when we contemn God, and place our affections
          elsewhere. For whatever ingenuity the wicked may possess, they are
          destitute of the main thing, genuine piety. To the same effect are the
          words which immediately follow, a good understanding have all they who
          keep God's commandments. There is great emphasis upon the qualifying
          adjunct tvv, tob; because the prophet, in inveighing against the
          foolish opinion to which we have already adverted, tacitly condemns
          those who delight in their own wicked craftiness. His meaning is, I
          admit, that they are usually deemed wise who look well to their own
          interests, who can pursue a temporising policy, who have the acuteness
          and artifice of preserving the favorable opinion of the world, and who
          even practice deception upon others. But even were I to grant that
          this character belongs to them, yet is their wisdom unprofitable and
          perverse, because true wisdom manifests itself in the observance of
          the law. Next he substitutes the keeping of God's commandments for the
          fear of God. For though all men, without exception, boast that they
          fear God, yet nothing is more common than for them to live in the
          neglect of his law. Hence the prophet very properly inculcates upon us
          the voluntary assumption of his yoke, and submission to the
          regulations of his word, as the most satisfactory evidence of our
          living in the fear of God. The term beginning has misled some, leading
          them to imagine that the fear of God was denominated the entrance of
          wisdom, as it were the alphabet, because it prepares men for true
          piety. Such an opinion is scarcely deserving of notice, seeing that,
          in Job 28:28, it is called "wisdom." In this passage fear is not to be
          understood as referring to the first or elementary principles of
          piety, as in 1 John 4:18, but is comprehensive of all true godliness,
          or the worship of God. The conclusion of the psalm requires no
          explanation; it being the object of the prophet simply to inculcate
          upon the faithful, that nothing is more profitable for them, than to
          spend their lives in the celebration of the praises of God.<br />
