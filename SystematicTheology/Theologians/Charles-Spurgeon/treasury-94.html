<p>DIVISION. </p>
<p>On this occasion we shall follow the divisions which our translators have 
    placed at the head of the Psalm, for they are pithy and suggestive.</p>
<p>Ps 91:1-2—The state of the godly.</p>
<p>Ps 91:3-8—Their safety.</p>
<p>Ps 91:9-10—Their habitation.</p>
<p>Ps 91:11-13—Their servants.</p>
<p>Ps 91:14-16—Their friend; with the effects of them all.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. He who dwells in the secret place of the most 
    High. <br/>
    The blessings here promised are not for all believers—but 
    for those who live in close fellowship with God. Every child of God looks 
    towards the inner sanctuary and the mercy-seat—yet all do not dwell in the 
    most holy place; they run to it at times, and enjoy occasional 
    approaches—but they do not habitually reside in the mysterious presence. </p>
<p align="justify">Those who through rich grace obtain unusual and 
    continuous communion with God, so as to abide in Christ and Christ in them, 
    become possessors of rare and special benefits, which are missed by those 
    who follow afar off, and grieve the Holy Spirit of God. Into the secret 
    place those only come, who know the love of God in Christ Jesus, and those 
    only dwell there to whom to live is Christ. To them the veil is rent, the 
    mercy-seat is revealed, the covering cherubs are manifest, and the solemn 
    glory of the Most High is apparent: these, like Simeon, have the Holy Spirit 
    upon them, and like Anna they depart not from the temple; they are the 
    courtiers of the Great King, the valiant men who keep watch around the bed 
    of Solomon, the virgin souls who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. </p>
<p align="justify">Elect out of the elect, they have "attained unto the 
    first three", and shall walk with their Lord in white, for they are worthy. 
    Sitting down in the august presence chamber where shines the mystic light of 
    the Shekinah, they know what it is to be raised up together, and to be made 
    to sit together with Christ in the heavenlies, and of them it is truly said 
    that their life is in Heaven. Special grace like theirs brings with it 
    special immunity. Outer court worshipers little know what belongs to the 
    inner sanctuary, or surely they would press on until the place of nearness 
    and divine familiarity became theirs. Those who are the Lord's constant 
    guests shall find that he will never allow any to be injured within his 
    gates; he has eaten the covenant salt with them, and is pledged for their 
    protection. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The Omnipotent Lord will shield all those who dwell with 
    him—they shall remain under his care as guests under the protection of their 
    host. In the most holy place the wings of the cherubim were the most 
    conspicuous objects, and they probably suggested to the psalmist the 
    expression here employed. </p>
<p align="justify">Those who commune with God are safe with Him, no evil can 
    reach them, for the outstretched wings of his power and love cover them from 
    all harm. This protection is <i>constant</i>—they abide under it, and it is
    <i>all-sufficient</i>, for it is the shadow of the Almighty, whose 
    omnipotence will surely screen them from all attack. No shelter can be 
    imagined at all comparable to the protection of Jehovah's own shadow. The 
    Almighty himself is where his shadow is, and hence those who dwell in his 
    secret place are shielded by himself. What a shade in the day of noxious 
    heat! What a refuge in the hour of deadly storm! Communion with God is 
    safety. The more closely we cling to our Almighty Father the more confident 
    may we be.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my 
    fortress. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">To take up a general truth and make it our own by 
    personal faith is the highest wisdom. It is but poor comfort to say 'the 
    Lord is <i>a</i> refuge,' but to say he is <i>my </i>refuge, is the essence 
    of consolation. </p>
<p align="justify">Those who believe should also speak, "I will say", for 
    such bold avowals honor God and lead others to seek the same confidence. Men 
    are apt enough to proclaim their doubts, and even to boast of them, indeed 
    there is a party nowadays of the most audacious pretenders to culture and 
    thought, who glory in casting suspicion upon everything. Hence it becomes 
    the duty of all true believers to speak out and testify with calm courage to 
    their own well grounded reliance upon their God. Let others say what they 
    will, be it ours to say of the Lord, "he is our refuge." </p>
<p align="justify">But what we say we must prove by our actions, we must fly 
    to the Lord for shelter, and not to an arm of flesh. The bird flies away to 
    the thicket, and the fox hastens to its hole, every creature uses its refuge 
    in the hour of danger. Even so in all peril or fear of peril let us flee 
    unto Jehovah, the Eternal Protector of his own. Let us, when we are secure 
    in the Lord, rejoice that our position is unassailable, for he is our 
    fortress as well as our refuge. No moat, drawbridge, wall, battlement, could 
    make us so secure as we are when the attributes of the Lord Almighty environ 
    us around. Behold this day the Lord is to us instead of walls and bulwarks! 
    Our ramparts defy the leagued hosts of Hell. Foes in flesh, and foes in 
    ghostly guise are alike balked of their prey when the Lord Almighty stands 
    between us and their fury, and all other evil forces are turned aside. Walls 
    cannot keep out the pestilence—but the Lord can.</p>
<p align="justify">As if it were not enough to call the Lord his refuge and 
    fortress, he adds,<b> My God! in him will I trust. </b></p>

<p align="justify">Now he can say no more; "my God" means all, and more than 
    all, that heart can conceive by way of security. It was most fit that he 
    should say "in him will I trust", since to deny faith to such a one were 
    willful wickedness and wanton insult. He who dwells in an impregnable 
    fortress, naturally trusts in it; and shall not he who dwells in God feel 
    himself well at ease, and repose his soul in safety? </p>
<p align="justify">O that we more fully carried out the psalmist's resolve! 
    We have trusted in God, let us trust him still. He has never failed us, why 
    then should we suspect him? <i>To trust in man is natural to fallen 
    nature—to trust in God should be as natural to regenerated nature</i>. Where 
    there is every reason and warrant for faith, we ought to place our 
    confidence without hesitancy or wavering. Dear reader, pray for grace to 
    say, "In him will I trust."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Surely he shall deliver you from the snare of 
    the fowler.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Assuredly no subtle plot shall succeed against one who 
    has the eyes of God watching for his defense. We are foolish and weak as 
    poor little birds, and are very apt to be lured to our destruction by 
    cunning foes—but if we dwell near to God, he will see to it that the most 
    skillful deceiver shall not entrap us.</p>
<p align="justify">"Satan the fowler who betrays<br/>
 Unguarded souls a thousand ways,"<br/>
    shall be foiled in the case of the man whose high and honorable condition 
    consists in residence within the holy place of the Most High.</p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"></font><font face="Verdana"><b>
<p align="justify">And from the deadly pestilence. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He who is a Spirit can protect us from evil spirits; he 
    who is mysterious can rescue us from mysterious dangers; he who is immortal 
    can redeem its from mortal sickness. There is a deadly pestilence of <i>
    error</i>, we are safe from that if we dwell in communion with the God of 
    truth. There is a fatal pestilence of <i>sin</i>, we shall not be infected 
    by it if we abide with the thrice Holy One. There is also a pestilence of <i>
    disease</i>, and even from that calamity our faith shall win immunity if it 
    be of that high order which abides in God, walks on in calm serenity, and 
    ventures all things for duty's sake. </p>
<p align="justify">Faith by cheering the heart keeps it free from the <i>
    fear </i>which, in times of pestilence, kills more than the plague itself. 
    It will not in all cases ward off disease and death—but where the man is 
    such as the first verse describes, it will assuredly render him immortal 
    where others die; if all the saints are not so sheltered it is because they 
    have not all such a close abiding with God, and consequently not such 
    confidence in the promise. </p>
<p align="justify">Such special faith is not given to all, for there are 
    diversities in the measure of faith. It is not of all believers that the 
    psalmist sings—but only of those who dwell in the secret place of the Most 
    High. Too many among us are weak in faith, and in fact place more reliance 
    in a pill than in the Lord and giver of life, and if we die of pestilence as 
    others die it is because we acted like others, and did not in patience 
    possess our souls. The great mercy is that in such a case our deaths are 
    blessed, and it is well with us, for we are forever with the Lord. 
    Pestilence to the saints shall not be harmful, but the messenger of Heaven.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. He shall cover you with your feathers, and under 
    his wings shall you trust.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">A wonderful expression! Had it been invented by an 
    uninspired man it would have verged upon blasphemy, for who would dare to 
    apply such words to the Infinite Jehovah? But as he himself authorized, yes, 
    dictated the language, we have here a <i>transcendent condescension</i>, 
    such as it becomes us to admire and adore. Does the Lord speak of his 
    feathers, as though he likened himself to a bird? Who will not see herein a 
    matchless love, a divine tenderness, which should both woo and win our 
    confidence? Even as a hen covers her chicks so does the Lord protect the 
    souls which dwell in him; let us cower down beneath him for comfort and for 
    safety. Hawks in the sky and snares in the field are equally harmless when 
    we nestle so near the Lord. His truth—his true promise, and his faithfulness 
    to his promise, shall be your shield and buckler.</p>
<p align="justify">Double armor has he who relies upon the Lord. He bears a 
    shield and wears an all surrounding coat of mail—such is the force of the 
    word "buckler." To quench fiery darts the truth is a most effectual shield, 
    and to blunt all swords it is an equally effectual coat of mail. Let us go 
    forth to battle thus harnessed for the war, and we shall be safe in the 
    thickest of the fight. It has been so, and so shall it be until we reach the 
    land of peace, and there among the "helmed cherubim and sworded seraphim," 
    we will wear no other ornament, his truth shall still be our shield and 
    buckler.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. You shall not be afraid for the terror by night.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Such <i>frail </i>creatures are we that both by night and 
    by day we are in danger, and so <i>sinful </i>are we that in either season 
    we may be readily carried away by fear; the promise before us secures the 
    favorite of Heaven both from danger and from the fear of it. </p>
<p align="justify">Night is the congenial hour of horrors, when alarms walk 
    abroad like beasts of prey, or ghouls from among the tombs; our fears turn 
    the sweet season of repose into one of dread, and though angels are abroad 
    and fill our chambers, we dream of demons and dire visitants from Hell. <i>
    Blessed is that communion with God which renders us impervious to midnight 
    frights, and horrors born of darkness</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Not to be afraid is in itself an unspeakable blessing, 
    since for every suffering which we endure from <i>real </i>injury, we are 
    tormented by a thousand griefs which arise from <i>fear </i>only. The shadow 
    of the Almighty removes all gloom from the shadow of night—once covered by 
    the divine wing, we care not what winged terrors may fly abroad in the 
    earth. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Nor for the arrow that flies by day. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Cunning foes lie in ambush, and aim the deadly shaft at 
    our hearts—but we do not fear them, and have no cause to do so. That arrow 
    is not made which can destroy the righteous, for the Lord has said, "No 
    weapon that is formed against you shall prosper." In times of great danger 
    those who have made the Lord their refuge, and therefore have refused to use 
    the carnal weapon, have been singularly preserved; the annals of the Quakers 
    bear good evidence to this.</p>
<p align="justify">Yet probably the main thought is, that from the cowardly 
    attacks of crafty malice those who walk by faith shall be protected, from 
    cunning <i>heresies </i>they shall be preserved, and in sudden <i>
    temptations </i>they shall be secured from harm. Day has its perils as well 
    as night, arrows more deadly than those poisoned by the Indian are flying 
    noiselessly through the air, and we shall be their victims unless we find 
    both shield and buckler in our God. O believer, dwell under the shadow of 
    the Lord, and none of the archers shall destroy you, they may shoot at you 
    and wound you grievously—but your bow shall abide in strength. When Satan's 
    quiver shall be empty, you shall remain uninjured by his craft and cruelty; 
    yes, his broken darts shall be to you as trophies of the truth and power of 
    the Lord your God.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It is shrouded in mystery as to its cause and cure, it 
    marches on, unseen of men, slaying with hidden weapons, like an enemy 
    stabbing in the dark—yet those who dwell in God are not afraid of it. 
    Nothing is more alarming than the assassin's plot, for he may at any moment 
    steal in upon a man, and lay him low at a stroke; and such is the <i>plague
    </i>in the days of its power, none can promise themselves freedom from it 
    for an hour in any place in the infected city. It enters a house men know 
    not how, and its very breath is mortal; yet those choice souls who dwell in 
    God shall live above fear in the most plague stricken places—they shall not 
    be afraid of the "plagues which in the darkness walk." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Famine may starve, or bloody war devour, earthquake may 
    overturn and tempest may smite—but amid all, the man who has sought the 
    mercy seat and is sheltered beneath the wings which overshadow it, shall 
    abide in perfect peace. Days of horror and nights of terror are for other 
    men; the godly man's days and nights are alike spent with God, and therefore 
    pass away in sacred quiet. His peace is not a thing of times and seasons, it 
    does not rise and set with the sun, nor does it depend upon the healthiness 
    of the atmosphere or the security of the country. </p>
<p align="justify">Upon the child of the Lord's own heart, pestilence has no 
    destroying power, and calamity no wasting influence: pestilence walks in 
    darkness—but he dwells in light; destruction wastes at noonday—but upon him 
    another sun has risen whose beams bring restoration. Remember that the voice 
    which says "you shall not fear" is that of God himself, who hereby pledges 
    his word for the safety of those who abide under his shadow, nay, not for 
    their safety only—but for their serenity. So far shall they be from being 
    injured that they shall not even be made to fear the ills which are around 
    them, since the Lord protects them.</p>
<p align="justify">"He, his shadowy plumes outspread.<br/>
    With his wing shall fence your head; <br/>
    And his truth around you wield,<br/>
    Strong as targe or bossy shield!<br/>
    Naught shall strike you with dismay,<br/>
    Fear by night, nor shaft by day."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. A thousand shall fall at your side and ten 
    thousand at your right hand. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">So terribly may the plague rage among men that the bills 
    of mortality may become very heavy and continue to grow ten times heavier 
    still—yet shall such as this Psalm speaks of, survive the scythe of death.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">It shall not come near you. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">It shall be so near as to be at your side, and yet not 
    near enough to touch you; like a fire it shall burn all around—yet shall not 
    the smell of it pass upon you.</p>
<p align="justify">How true is this of the plague of moral evil, of heresy, 
    and of backsliding. Whole nations are infected—yet the man who communes with 
    God is not affected by the contagion; he holds the truth when falsehood is 
    all the fashion. Professors all around him are plague smitten, the church is 
    wasted, the very life of religion decays—but in the same place and time, in 
    fellowship with God, the believer renews his youth, and his soul knows no 
    sickness. </p>
<p align="justify">In a measure this also is true of physical evil; the Lord 
    still puts a difference between Israel and Egypt in the day of his plagues. 
    Sennacherib's army is blasted—but Jerusalem is in health.</p>
<p align="justify">"Our God his chosen people saves<br/>
 Among the dead, amidst the graves."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. Only with your eyes shall you behold and see the 
    punishment of the wicked.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">The sight shall reveal both the justice and the mercy of 
    God; in them that perish the severity of God will be manifest. In the 
    believer's escape, the richness of divine goodness will be apparent. Joshua 
    and Caleb verified this promise. The Puritan preachers during the plague of 
    London must have been much impressed with this verse as they came out of 
    their hiding places to proclaim mercy and judgment to the dissolute age 
    which was so sorely visited with the plague. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The sight of God's judgments softens the heart, excites a 
    solemn awe, creates gratitude, and so stirs up the deepest kind of adoration</p></i>. 
    It is such a sight as none of us would wish to see, and yet if we did see it 
    we might thus be lifted up to the very noblest style of manhood. Let us but 
    watch providence, and we shall find ourselves living in a <i>school </i>
    where examples of the ultimate reward of sin are very plentiful. One case 
    may not be judged alone lest we misjudge—but instances of divine visitation 
    will be plentiful in the memory of any attentive observer of men and things. 
    From all these put together we may fairly draw conclusions, and unless we 
    shut our eyes to that which is self-evident, we shall soon perceive that <i>
    there is after all a moral ruler over the sons of men, who sooner or later 
    rewards the ungodly with due punishment.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verses 9-10.</p></b> Before expounding these verses I cannot 
    refrain from recording a personal incident illustrating their power to 
    soothe the heart, when they are applied by the Holy Spirit. In the year 
    1854, when I had scarcely been in London twelve months, the neighborhood in 
    which I labored was visited by Asiatic cholera, and my congregation suffered 
    from its inroads. Family after family summoned me to the bedside of the 
    smitten, and almost every day I was called to visit the grave. I gave myself 
    up with youthful ardor to the visitation of the sick, and was sent for from 
    all corners of the district by persons of all ranks and religions. I became 
    weary in body and sick at heart. My friends seemed falling one by one, and I 
    felt or imagined that I was sickening like those around me. A little more 
    work and weeping would have laid me low among the rest; I felt that my 
    burden was heavier than I could bear, and I was ready to sink under it. As 
    God would have it, I was returning mournfully home from a funeral, when my 
    curiosity led me to read a paper which was wafered up in a shoemaker's 
    window in the Dover Road. It did not look like a trade announcement, nor was 
    it, for it bore in a good bold handwriting these words: <b>Because you have 
    made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, your habitation; 
    there shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your 
    dwelling. 
</b>
<p align="justify">The effect upon my heart was immediate. Faith 
    appropriated the passage as her own. I felt secure, refreshed, girt with 
    immortality. I went on with my visitation of the dying in a calm and 
    peaceful spirit; I felt no fear of evil, and I suffered no harm. The 
    providence which moved the tradesman to place those verses in his window I 
    gratefully acknowledge, and in the remembrance of its marvelous power I 
    adore the Lord my God. </p>
<p align="justify">The psalmist in these verses assures the man who dwells 
    in God that he shall be secure. Though faith claims no merit of its own—yet 
    the Lord rewards it wherever he sees it. He who makes God his refuge shall 
    find him a refuge; he who dwells in God shall find his dwelling protected.
    </p>
<p align="justify">We must make the Lord our habitation by choosing him for 
    our trust and rest, and then we shall receive immunity from harm; no evil 
    shall touch us personally, and no stroke of judgment shall assail our 
    household. </p>
<p align="justify">The dwelling here intended by the original was only a 
    tent—yet the frail covering would prove to be a sufficient shelter from harm 
    of all sorts. It matters little whether our abode be a gypsy's hut or a 
    monarch's palace, if the soul has made the Most High its habitation. Get 
    into God and you dwell in all good, and ill is banished far away. It is not 
    because we are perfect or highly esteemed among men that we can hope for 
    shelter in the day of evil—but because our refuge is the Eternal God, and 
    our faith has learned to hide beneath his sheltering wing.</p>
<p align="justify">"For this no ill your cause shall daunt,<br/>
 No scourge your tabernacle haunt."</p>
<p align="justify">It is impossible that any ill should happen to the man 
    who is beloved of the Lord; <i>the most crushing calamities can only shorten 
    his journey and hasten him to his reward</i>. Ill to him is no ill—but only 
    good in a mysterious form. <i>Losses enrich him, sickness is his medicine, 
    reproach is his honor, death is his gain</i>.<i> No evil in the strict sense 
    of the word can happen to him, for everything is overruled for good</i>. 
    Happy is he who is in such a case. He is secure where others are in peril, 
    he lives where others die.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. For he shall give his angels charge over you.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Not one guardian angel, as some fondly dream—but all the 
    angels are here alluded to. They are the bodyguard of the princes of the 
    blood imperial of Heaven, and they have received commission from their Lord 
    and ours to watch carefully over all the interests of the faithful. When men 
    have a charge they become doubly careful, and therefore the angels are 
    represented as bidden by God himself to see to it that the elect are 
    secured. It is down in the marching orders of the hosts of Heaven that they 
    take special note of the people who dwell in God. It is not to be wondered 
    at that the servants are bidden to be careful of the comfort of their 
    Master's guests; and we may be quite sure that when they are specially 
    charged by the Lord himself they will carefully discharge the duty imposed 
    upon them. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To keep you in all your ways. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">To be a bodyguard, a garrison to the body, soul, and 
    spirit of the saint. The limit of this protection "in all your ways" is yet 
    no limit to the heart which is right with God. It is not the way of the 
    believer to go out of his way. He keeps in the way, and then the angels keep 
    him. The protection here promised is exceeding broad as to place, for it 
    refers to all our ways, and what do we wish for more? <i>How angels thus 
    keep us we cannot tell. </i>Whether they repel demons, counteract spiritual 
    plots, or even ward off the more subtle physical forces of disease, we do 
    not know. Perhaps we shall one day stand amazed at the multiplied services 
    which the unseen bands have rendered to us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. They shall bear you up in their hands.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">They, that is the angels, God's own angels, shall 
    cheerfully become our servants. As nurses carry little children, with 
    careful love, so shall those glorious spirits bear up each individual 
    believer. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Lest you dash your foot against a stone.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Even minor ills they ward off. It is most desirable that 
    we should not stumble—but as the way is rough, it is most gracious on the 
    Lord's part to send his servants to bear us up above the loose pebbles. If 
    we cannot have the way smoothed, it answers every purpose if we have angels 
    to bear us up in their hands.<i> Since the greatest ills may arise out of 
    little accidents, it shows the wisdom of the Lord that from the smaller 
    evils we are protected.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. You shall tread upon the lion and adder. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Over force and fraud shall you march victoriously; <i>
    bold opponents </i>and <i>treacherous adversaries </i>shall alike be trodden 
    down. When our shoes are iron and brass lions and adders are easily enough 
    crushed beneath our heel. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The young lion and the serpent shall you trample under 
    feet. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The strongest foe in power, and the most mysterious in 
    cunning, shall be conquered by the man of God. Not only from stones in the 
    way—but from serpents also, shall we be safe. To men who dwell in God the 
    most evil forces become harmless, they wear a charmed life, and defy the 
    deadliest ills. Their feet come into contact with the worst of foes, even 
    Satan himself nibbles at their heel—but in Christ Jesus they have the 
    assured hope of crushing Satan under their feet shortly. The people of God 
    are the </p>
<p align="justify">true lion kings and serpent tamers. Their dominion over 
    the powers of darkness makes them cry, "Lord, even the devils are subject 
    unto us through your word."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. Because he has set his love upon me, therefore 
    will I deliver him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Here we have the Lord himself speaking of his own chosen 
    one. Not because he deserves to be thus kept—but because with all his 
    imperfections he does love his God; therefore not the angels of God only—but 
    the <i>God of angels </i>himself will come to his rescue in all perilous 
    times, and will effectually deliver him. </p>
<p align="justify">When the heart is enamored with the Lord, all taken up 
    with him, and intensely attached to him, the Lord will recognize the sacred 
    flame, and preserve the man who bears it in his bosom. It is love—love set 
    upon God, which is the distinguishing mark of those whom the Lord secures 
    from ill.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will set him on high, because he has known my name. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The man has known the attributes of God so as to trust in 
    him, and then by experience has arrived at a yet deeper knowledge, this 
    shall be regarded by the Lord as a pledge of his grace, and he will set the 
    owner of it above danger or fear, where he shall dwell in peace and joy. 
    None abide in intimate fellowship with God unless they possess a warm 
    affection towards God, and an intelligent trust in him. These gifts of grace 
    are precious in Jehovah's eyes, and wherever he sees them he smiles upon 
    them. How elevated is the standing which the Lord gives to the believer. We 
    ought to covet it right earnestly. If we climb on high it may be 
    dangerous—but if God sets us there it is glorious.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him.
    </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">He will have need to pray, he will be led to pray aright 
    and the answer shall surely come. Saints are first called by God and then 
    they call upon God; such calls as theirs always obtain answers. Not without 
    prayer will the blessing come to the most favored—but by means of prayer 
    they shall receive all good things. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will be with him in trouble.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">Or "I am with him in trouble." Heirs of Heaven are 
    conscious of a special divine presence in times of severe trial. God is 
    always near in sympathy and in power to help his tried ones. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">I will deliver him, and honor him. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The man honors God, and God honors him. Believers are not 
    delivered or preserved in a way which lowers them, and makes them feel 
    themselves degraded; far from it, the Lord's salvation bestows honor upon 
    those it delivers. God first gives us conquering grace, and then rewards us 
    for it.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 16. With long life will I satisfy him.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The man described in this Psalm fills out the measure of 
    his days, and whether he dies young or old he is quite satisfied with life, 
    and is content to leave it. He shall rise from life's banquet as a man who 
    has had enough, and would not have more even if he could. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And show him my salvation. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The full sight of divine grace shall be his closing 
    vision. He shall look from Amana and Lebanon. Not with destruction before 
    him black as night—but with salvation bright as noonday smiling upon him he 
    shall enter into his rest.</p>
