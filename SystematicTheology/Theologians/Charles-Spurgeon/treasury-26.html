          TITLE. <b>A Psalm of David.</b> The sweet singer of Israel appears
          before us in this Psalm as one enduring reproach. In this he was the
          type of the great Son of David, and is an encouraging example to us to
          <i>carry the burden of slander to the throne of grace</i>. It is an
          ingenious surmise that this appeal to Heaven was written by David at
          the time of the assassination of Ishbosheth, by Baanah and Rechab, to
          protest his innocence of all participation in that treacherous murder.
          The tenor of the Psalm certainly agrees with the supposed occasion,
          but it is not possible with such a slender clue to go beyond
          conjecture.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. Unity of subject is so distinctly maintained, that there are
          no sharp divisions. David Dickson has given an admirable summary in
          these words: "He appeals to God", the supreme Judge, in the testimony
          of a good conscience, bearing him witness:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          first, of his endeavor to walk uprightly as a believer, Verses 1-3;
          <br />
          secondly, of his keeping himself from the contagion of the evil
          counsel, sinful causes, and examples of the wicked, Verses 4-5; <br />
          thirdly, of his purpose still to behave himself holily and
          righteously, out of love to be partaker of the public privileges of
          the Lord's people in the congregation, Verses 6-8.<br />
          Whereupon he prays to be free of the judgment coming upon the wicked,
          Verses 9-10.<br />
          according as he had purposed to eschew their sins, Verse 11 <br />
          and he closes the prayer with comfort and assurance of being heard,
          Verse 12.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Judge me, O Jehovah.</p></b> A solemn
        appeal to the just tribunal of the heart searching God, warranted by the
        circumstances of the writer, so far as regarded the particular offences
        with which he was wrongly charged. Worried and worn out by the injustice
        of men, the innocent spirit flies from its false accusers to the throne
        of Eternal Right. He had need have a clear case who dares to carry his
        suit into the King's Bench of Heaven. Such an appeal as this is not to
        be rashly made on any occasion; and as to the whole of our walk and
        conversation, it should never be made at all, except as we are justified
        in Christ Jesus. A far more fitting prayer for a sinful mortal is the
        petition, "Enter not into judgment with your servant."
        <b> <p align="justify">For I have walked in my integrity.</p></b
        ><i
          >He held integrity as his principle, and walked in it as his practice. </i
        >David had not used any traitorous or unrighteous means to gain the
        crown, or to keep it; he was conscious of having been guided by the
        noblest principles of honor in all his actions with regard to Saul and
        his family.
        <p align="justify">
          What a comfort it is to have the approbation of one's own conscience!
          If there be peace within the soul, the blustering storms of slander
          which howl around us are of little consideration.<i>
            When the little bird in my bosom sings a merry song, it is no matter
            to me if a thousand owls hoot at me from without.
          </i>
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">I have trusted also in the Lord.</p></b> Faith is
        the root and sap of integrity.
        <i>He who leans upon the Lord is sure to walk in righteousness. </i
        >David knew that God's covenant had given him the crown, and therefore
        he took no indirect or unlawful means to secure it. He would not slay
        his enemy in the cave, nor suffer his soldiers to smite him when he
        slept unguarded on the plain.
        <p align="justify">
          Faith will work hard for the Lord, and in the Lord's way, but she
          refuses so much as to lift a finger to fulfill the devices of
          unrighteous cunning.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Rebecca acted out a great falsehood in order to fulfill the Lord's
          decree in favor of Jacob—this was unbelief. But Abraham left the Lord
          to fulfill his own purposes, and took the knife to slay his son—this
          was faith.
        </p>
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            Faith trusts God to accomplish his own decrees.
          </p></i
        >
        Why should I steal when God has promised to supply my need? Why should I
        avenge myself when I know that the Lord has espoused my cause?<i>
          Confidence in God is a most effectual security against sin. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">Therefore I shall not slide.</p></b>Slippery as
        the way is, so that I walk like a man upon ice—yet faith keeps my feet
        from slipping, and will continue to do so. The
        <i>doubtful ways of policy </i>are sure sooner or later to give a fall
        to those who run therein. But
        <i>the ways of honesty, though often rough, are always safe. </i>We
        cannot trust in God if we walk crookedly<i
          >. Straight paths and simple faith bring the pilgrim happily to his
          journey's end. </i
        ><b> <p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b> There are three modes of trial
        here challenged, which are said in the original to refer to trial by
        <i>touch</i>, trial by <i>smell</i>, and trial by <i>fire</i>. The
        psalmist was so clear from the charge laid against him, that he
        submitted himself unconditionally to any form of examination which the
        Lord might see fit to employ.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Examine <i>me</i>, O Lord.</p></b
        >Look me through and through; make a minute survey; put me to the
        question, cross examine my evidence.
        <b> <p align="justify">And prove me.</p></b>Put me again to trial; and
        see if I would follow such wicked designs as my enemies impute to me.
        Try my thoughts and my heart. Assay me as metals are assayed in the
        furnace, and do this to my most secret parts, where my affections hold
        their court. See, O God, whether or not I love hatred, and treason, and
        deceit.
        <p align="justify">
          All this is a very bold appeal, and made by a man like David, who
          feared the Lord exceedingly, it manifests a most solemn and complete
          conviction of innocence. The expressions here used should teach us the
          <i
            >thoroughness of the divine judgment, and the necessity of being in
            all things profoundly sincere</i
          >—lest we be found wanting at the last.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Our enemies are severe with us with the severity of spite, and this a
          brave man endures without fear; but
          <i>God's severity is that of unswerving right. </i>Who shall stand
          against such a trial? The sweet singer says "Who can stand before his
          cold?" and we may well inquire,
          <i>"Who can stand before the heat of his justice?"</i>
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. For your loving-kindness is before my eyes.
          </p></b
        >
        An object of memory, and a ground of hope.<i>
          A sense of mercy received sets a fair prospect before the faithful
          mind in its gloomiest condition</i
        >, for it yields visions of mercies yet to come, visions not visionary
        but real.

        <p align="justify">
          Dwell, dear reader, upon that celestial word <i> loving-kindness</i>.
          It has a heavenly savor. Is it not an unmatchable word, unexcelled,
          unrivaled? The goodness of the Lord to us, should be before our eyes
          as a motive actuating our conduct. We are not under the bondage of the
          law, but we are under the sweet constraints of grace, which are far
          more mighty, although far more gentle.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Men sin with the law before their eyes—but divine love, when clearly
          seen, sanctifies the conversation. If we were not so forgetful of the
          way of mercy in which God walks toward us, we would be more careful to
          walk in the ways of obedience toward him.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And I have walked in your truth.</p></b> The
        psalmist was preserved from sin by his assurance of the truthfulness of
        God's promise, which truth he endeavored to imitate as well as to
        believe.
        <p align="justify">
          Observe from this verse that an
          <i
            >experience of divine love will show itself in a practical following
            of divine truth</i
          >. Those who neglect either the doctrinal or practical parts of truth,
          must not wonder if they lose the experimental enjoyment of it.
          <i>Some talk of truth, it is better to walk in it. </i>Some vow to do
          well in future, but their resolutions come to nothing. Only the
          regenerate man can say "I have walked in your truth."
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verses 4-5.</p></b>So far from being himself an
        open offender against the laws of God, the psalmist had not even
        associated with the lovers of evil. He had kept aloof from the men of
        Belial. A man is known by his company, and if we have kept ourselves
        apart from the wicked, it will always be evidence in our favor should
        our character be impugned. He who never went to sea, is clearly not the
        man who scuttled the ship.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. I have not sat with vain people.</p></b
        >True citizens have no dealings with traitors. David had no seat in the
        parliament of triflers. They were not his companions at feasts, nor his
        advisers in council, nor his associates in conversation. We must needs
        see, and speak, and trade, with men of the world—but we must on no
        account take our rest and solace in their empty society.
        <i>

        They are quite unworthy of a Christian's friendship. Moreover as this
        vanity is often allied with falsehood, it is well to save ourselves
        altogether from this untoward generation, lest we should be led from bad
        to worse and from tolerating the vain should come to admire the wicked.
        <b> <p align="justify">Neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p></b
        >Since I know that <i>hypocritical piety is double iniquity</i>, I will
        cease all acquaintance with pretenders. If I must need walk the same

        <p align="justify">
          The congregation of the hypocrites is not one with which we should

            drop their acquaintance now! </i

        <p align="justify">
          We must maintain the separated path with more and more circumspection

          >.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The resolution of the psalmist suggests, that even among professed
          followers of truth we must make distinctions, for as there are vain
          people out of the church, so
          <i
            >there are dissemblers in it and both are to be shunned with

          The washing of the hands is a significant action to set forth our

          As to <i>perfect innocence</i>, David does not here claim it, but he
          avows his innocence of the crimes whereof he was slanderously accused.
          There is, however, a sense in which we may be washed in absolute
          innocence, for the atoning blood makes us clean every whit. We ought
          never to rest satisfied short of a full persuasion of our complete

        wheat, and will find a separate place for distinct characters.

          In the former verses we see that the psalmist kept himself clear of
          profane people, and this is to be understood as a reason why he should
          not be thrust into their company at the last. Let us think of the doom
          of the wicked, and the prayer of the text will forcibly rise to our
          lips. Meanwhile, as we see the rule of judgment by which like is
          gathered to its like, we who have passed from death unto life have
          nothing to fear.

        <b> <p align="justify">Nor my life with bloody men.</p></b> Our soul
        sickens to hear them speak; their cruel dispatches, in which they treat
        the shooting of their fellow men as rare sport, are horrifying to us.
        Lord, let us not be shut up in the same prison with them; nay, the same
        paradise with such men would be a Hell, if they remained as they are
        now.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 10. In whose hands is mischief.</p></b>They
        have both hands full of it, plotting it and carrying it out.
        <b> <p align="justify">And their right hand</p></b>, with which they are
        most dexterous, <b>is full of bribes</b>. Like thieves who would steal
        with impunity, they carry a sop for the dogs of justice. He who gives
        bribes is every way as guilty as the man who takes them, and in the
        matter of our parliamentary elections the rich villain who give the
        bribe is by far the worse.
        <i>
          <p align="justify">
            Bribery, in any form or shape, should be as detestable to a
            Christian as carrion to a dove, or garbage to a lamb. Let those
            whose dirty hands are fond of bribes remember that neither death nor
            the devil can be bribed to let them escape their well earned doom.

            Verse 11. But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me and
            be merciful to me.

        >Here is the lover of godliness entering his personal protest against
        unrighteous gain. He is a Nonconformist, and is ready to stand alone in
        his Nonconformity.
        <i>Like a live fish, he swims against the stream. </i>Trusting in God,
        the psalmist resolves that the plain way of righteousness shall be his
        choice, and those who will, may prefer the tortuous paths of violence
        and deceit.
        <b> <p align="justify">Redeem me and be merciful to me.</p></b>Yet, he
        is by no means a boaster, or a self-righteous vaunter of his own
        strength, for he cries for redemption and pleads for mercy. Our
        integrity is not absolute nor inherent, it is a work of grace in us, and
        is marred by human infirmity. We must, therefore, resort to the
        redeeming blood and to the throne of mercy, confessing that though we
        are saints among men, we must still bow as sinners before God.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 12. My foot stands in an even place.</p></b
        >The song began in the minor, but it has now reached the major key.
        Saints often sing themselves into happiness.
        <p align="justify">
          The <b>even place </b>upon which our foot stands is the sure, covenant
          faithfulness, eternal promise and immutable oath of the Lord Almighty.
          There is no fear of falling from this solid basis, or of its being
          removed from under us. Established in Christ Jesus, by being vitally
          united to him, we have nothing left to occupy our thoughts but the
          praises of our God.

        <b>

        >Let us not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, and when
        assembled, let us not be slow to contribute our portion of thanksgiving.
        Each saint is a witness to divine faithfulness, and should be ready with
        his testimony. As for the slanderers, let them howl outside the door,
        while the children sing within.
