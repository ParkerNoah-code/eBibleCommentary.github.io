          Ordinations of presbyters and Levites, moreover, solemnly perform on a
          suitable occasion, and in the presence of many witnesses; and to this
          duty advance tried and learned men, that ye may be greatly gladdened
          by their fellowship and help. Place the confidence of your hearts
          without ceasing on the goodness of God, and declare these and the
          other divine words to succeeding generations: "For this is our God for
          ever and ever, and He will guide us to eternity." Given on the 7th
          November, in the consulship of the most illustrious Saturninus and
          Gallicanus.
