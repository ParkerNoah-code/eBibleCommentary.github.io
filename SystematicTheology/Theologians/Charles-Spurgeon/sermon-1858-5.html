        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.169)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 27, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"What have I done?" -- Jeremiah 8:6.</p>
        <p>
          PERHAPS NO FIGURE represents God in a more gracious light than those
          figures of speech, which represent him as stooping from his throne,
          and as coming down from heaven to attend to the wants and to behold
          the woes of mankind. We must have love for that God, who, when Sodom
          and Gomorrah were reeking with iniquity, would not destroy those
          cities, although he knew their guilt and their wickedness, until he
          had made an actual visitation to them and had sojourned for awhile in
          their streets. Methinks we can not help pouring out our heart in
          affection to that God, of whom we are told that he inclines his ear
          from the highest glory, and puts it to the lip of the faintest that
          breathes out the true desire. How can we resist feeling that he is a
          God whom we must love, when we know that he regards everything that
          concerns us, numbers the very hairs of our heads, bids his angels
          protect our footsteps lest we dash our feet against stones, marks our
          path end ordereth our ways. But especially is this great truth brought
          near to man's heart, when we recollect how attentive God is, not
          merely to the temporal interests of his creatures, but to their
          spiritual concerns. God is represented in Scripture as waiting to be
          gracious, or, in the language of the parable, when his prodigals are
          yet a great way off he sees them; he runs and falls upon their neck
          and kisses them. He is so attentive to everything that is good, even
          in the poor sinner's heart, that to him there is music in a sigh, and
          beauty in a tear; and in this verse that I have just read, he
          represents himself as looking upon man's heart and listening --
          listening, if possibly he may hear something that is good. "I
          hearkened and heard; I listened; I stood still, and I attended to
          them." And how amiable does God appear, when he is represented as
          turning aside, and as it were with grief in his heart, exclaiming, "I
          did listen, I did hearken, but they spake not aright; no man repented
          of his wickedness, saying, "What shall I do?" Ah! my hearer, thou
          never hast a desire toward God which does not excite God's hope; thou
          dost never breathe a prayer toward heaven which he does not notice;
          and though thou hast very often uttered prayers which have been as the
          morning cloud and as the early dew that soon passeth away, yet all
          these things have moved Jehovah's bowels; for he has been hearkening
          to thy cry and noticing the breathing of thy soul, and though it all
          hath passed away, yet it did not pass away unnoticed, for he remembers
          it even now. And oh! thou that art this day seeking a Saviour,
          remember, that Saviour's eyes are on thy seeking soul to-day. Thou art
          not looking after one who can not see thee; thou art coming to thy
          Father, but thy Father sees thee even in the distance. It was but one
          tear that trickled down thy cheek, but thy Father noticed that as a
          hopeful sign; it was but one throb that went through thy heart just
          now during the singing of the hymn, but God, the Loving, noticed even
          that, and thought upon it as at least some omen that thou wast not yet
          quite hardened by sin, nor yet given up by love and mercy.

          The text is "What have I done?" I shall just introduce that by a few
          words of affectionate persuasion, urging all now present to ask that
          question: secondly, I shall give them a few words of assistance in
          trying to answer it; and when I have so done, I shall finish by a few
          sentences of solemn admonition to those who have had to answer the
          question against themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, a few words of EARNEST PERSUASION, requesting every
          one now present, and more especially every unconverted person, to ask
          this question of himself, and answer it solemnly: "What have I done?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Few men like to take the trouble to review their own lives, most men
          are so near bankruptcy that they are ashamed to look at their own
          books. The great mass of mankind are like the silly ostrich, which,
          when hard pressed by the hunters, buries its head in the sand and
          shuts its eyes, and then thinks, because it does not see its pursuers,
          that therefore it is safe. The great mass of mankind, I repeat, are
          ashamed to review their own biographies; and if conscience and memory
          together could turn joint authors of a history of their lives
          throughout, they would buy a huge iron clasp and a padlock to it, and
          lock the volume up, for they dare not read it. They know it to be a
          book full of lamentation and woe, which they dare not read, and still
          go on in their iniquities. I have therefore a hard task in endeavoring
          to persuade you one and all to take down that book, and be its pages
          few or many, be they white or be they black, I have some difficulty in
          getting you to read them through. But may the Holy Spirit persuade you
          now, so that you may answer this question, "What have I done?" For
          remember, my dear friend, that searching yourself can do you no hurt.
          No tradesman ever gets the poorer by looking to his books; he may find
          himself to be poorer than he thought he was, but it is not the looking
          to the books that hath hurt him; he hath hurt himself by some ill
          trading before. Better, my friend, for you to know the past whilst
          there is yet time for repairing it, than that you should go
          blindfolded, hoping to enter the gates of Paradise and find out your
          mistake when alas! it is too late, because the door is shut. There is
          nothing to be lost by taking stock; you can not be any the worse for a
          little self examination. This of itself shall be one strong argument
          to induce you to do it; but remember you may be a great deal the
          better; for suppose your affairs are all right with God, why then you
          may make good cheer and comfort yourself for he that is right with his
          God has no cause to be sad. But ah! remember there are many
          probabilities that you are wrong. There are so many in this world that
          are deceived, that there are many chances that you are deceived too.
          You may have a name to live and yet be dead; you may be like John
          Bunyan's tree, of which he said "twas fair to look upon and green
          outside, but the inside of it was rotten enough to be tinder for the
          devils tinder box." You may this day thus stand before yourself your
          fellow creatures well whitewashed, and exceeding fair, but you may be
          like that Pharisee of whom Christ said, "Thou art a whited sepulcher,
          for inwardly thou art full of rottenness and dead men's bones." Now,
          man, however thou mayest wish to be self-deceived, for my own part I
          feel that I would a thousand times rather know my own state really
          than have the most pleasing conceptions about it and find myself
          deceived. Many a time have I solemnly prayed that prayer, "Lord, help
          me to know the worst of my own case; if I be still an apostate from
          thee, without God and without Christ, at least let me be honest to
          myself and know what I am." Remember, my friend, that the time you
          have for self-examination is, after all, very short. Soon thou wilt
          know the great secret. I perhaps may not say words rough enough to
          rend off the mask which thou now hast upon thee, but there is one
          called Death who will stand no compliment. You may masquerade it out
          to-day in the dress of the saint, but death will soon strip you, and
          you must stand before the judgment seat after death has discovered you
          in all your nakedness, be that naked innocence or naked guilt.
          Remember, too, though you may deceive yourself, you will not deceive
          your God. You may have light weights, and the beam of the scale in
          which you weigh yourself may not be honest, and may not therefore tell
          the truth; but when God shall try you he will make no allowances; when
          the everlasting Jehovah grasps the balances of justice and puts his
          law into one scale, ah, sinner, how wilt thou tremble when he shall
          put thee into the other; for unless Christ be thy Christ thou wilt be
          found light weight -- thou wilt be weighed in the balances and found
          wanting, and be cast away for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! what words shall I adopt to induce every one of you now to search
          yourselves! I know the various excuses that some of you will make.
          Some of you will plead that you are members of churches, and that,
          therefore, all is right with you. Perhaps you look across from the
          gallery, and you say to me, "Mr. Spurgeon, your hands baptized me but
          this year into the Lord Jesus, and you have often passed to me the
          sacramental bread and wine. Ah, my hearer, I know that, and I have
          baptized, I fear, many of you that the Lord hath never baptized; and
          some of you have been received into the church fellowship on earth who
          were never received by God. If Jesus Christ had one hypocrite in his
          twelve, how many hypocrites must I have here in nearly twelve hundred?
          Ah! my hearers, in this age it is a very easy thing to make a
          profession of religion: many churches receive candidates into their
          fellowship without examination at all; I have had such come to me, and
          I have told them, "I must treat you just the same as if you came from
          the world," because they said, "I never saw the minister; I wrote a
          note to the Church, and they took me in." Verily, in this age of
          profession, a man may make the highest profession in the world, and
          yet be at last found with damned apostates. Do not put off the
          question for that; and do not say, "I am too busy to attend to my
          spiritual concerns; there is time enough yet." Many have said that,
          and before their "time enough" has come, they have found themselves
          where time shall be no more. O! thou that sayest thou hast time
          enough, how little dost thou know how near death is to thee. There are
          some present that will not see New Year's Day; there is every
          probability that a very large number will never see another year. O,
          may the Lord our God prepare us each for death and for judgment, and
          bless this mornings exhortation to our preparation, by leading us to
          ask the question -- "What have I done?"
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, then, I am to help you to answer the question -- "What have I
          done?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian, true Christian, I have little to say to thee this morning.
          I will not multiply words, but leave the inquiry with thine own
          conscience. What hast thou done? I hear thee reply, "I have done
          nothing to save myself; for that was done for me in the eternal
          covenant, from before the foundation of the world. I have done nothing
          to make a righteousness for myself, for Christ said, It is finished;'
          I have done nothing to procure heaven by my merits, for all that Jesus
          did for me before I was born." But, say, brother, what hast thou done
          for him who died to save thy wretched soul? What hast thou done for
          his church? What hast thou done for the salvation of the world? What
          hast thou done to promote thine own spiritual growth in grace? Ah! I
          might hit some of you that are true Christians very hard here; but I
          will leave you with your God. God will chastise his own children. I
          will, however, put a pointed question. Are there not many Christians
          now present who can not recollect that they have been the means of the
          salvation of one soul during this year? Come, now; turn back. Have you
          any reason to believe that directly or indirectly you have been made
          the means this year of the salvation of a soul? I will go further.
          There are some of you who are old Christians, and I will ask you this
          question: Have you any reason to believe that ever since you were
          converted you have ever been the means of the salvation of a soul? It
          was reckoned in the East, in the time of the patriarchs, to be a
          disgrace to a woman that she had no children -- to have none born unto
          God through his instrumentality! And yet, there are some of you here
          that have been spiritually barren, and have never brought one convert
          to Christ; you have not one star in your crown of glory, and must wear
          a starless crown in heaven. Oh! I think I see the joy and gladness
          with which a good child of God looked upon me last week, when we had
          heard some one who had been converted to God by her instrumentality. I
          took her by the hand and said, "Well, now, you have reason to thank
          God." "Yes, sir," she said, "I feel a happy and an honored woman now.
          I have never, that I know of, before been the means of bringing a soul
          to Christ." And the good woman looked so happy; the tears were in her
          eyes for gladness. How many have you brought during this year? Come,
          Christian, what have you done? Alas! alas! you have not been barren
          fig-trees, but still your fruit is such that it can not be seen. You
          may be alive unto God, but how many of you have been very unprofitable
          and exceedingly unfruitful? And do not think that while I thus deal
          hardly with you I would escape myself. No, I ask myself the question,
          "What have I done?" And when I think of the zeal of Whitfield, and of
          the earnestness of many of those great evangelists of former times, I
          stand here astounded at myself, and I ask myself the question, "What
          have I done?" And I can only answer it with some confusion of face.
          How often have I preached to you, my hearers, the Word of God, and yet
          how seldom have I wept over you as a pastor should? How often ought I
          to have warned you of the wrath to come, when I have forgotten to be
          so earnest as I might have been. I fear lest the blood of souls should
          lie at my door, when I come to be judged of my God at last. I beseech
          you, pray for your minister in this thing, that he may be forgiven, if
          there has ever been a lack of earnestness, and energy, and
          prayerfulness, and pray that during the next year I may always preach
          as though I ne'er might preach again.
        </p>
        <p>"A dying man to dying men."</p>
        <p>
          I heard the moralist whilst I was questioning the Christian, say,
          "What have I done? Sir, I have done all I ought to have done. You may,
          as a Gospeller, stand there and talk to me about sins; but I tell you,
          Sir, I have done all that was my duty; I have always attended my
          church or chapel regularly every Sunday as ever a man or woman could;
          I have always read prayers in the family, and I always say prayers
          before I go to bed and when I get up in the morning. I don't know that
          I owe anybody anything, or that I have been unkind to anybody; I give
          a fair share to the poor, and I think if good works have any merit I
          certainly have done a great deal." Quite right, my friend, very right,
          indeed, if good works have any merit; but then it is very unfortunate
          that they have not any; for our good works, if we do them to save
          ourselves by them, are no better than our sins. You might as well hope
          to go to heaven by cursing and swearing, as by the merits of your own
          good works; for although good works are infinitely preferable to
          cursing and swearing in a moral point of view, yet there is no more
          merit in one than there is in the other, though there is less sin in
          one than in the other. Will you please to remember, then, that all you
          have been doing all these years is good for nothing? "Well, but, sir,
          I have trusted in Christ." Now, stop! Let me ask you a question. Do
          you mean to say, that you have trusted partly in Christ, and partly in
          your own good works? "Yes, sir." Well, then, let me tell you, the Lord
          Jesus Christ will never be a make weight; you must take Christ wholly,
          or else no Christ at all, for Christ will never go shares with you in
          the work of salvation. So, I repeat, all you have ever done is good
          for nothing. You have been building a card-house, and the tempest will
          blow it down; you have been building a house upon the sand, and when
          the rains descend and the floods come, the last vestige of it will be
          swept away forever. Hear ye the word of the Lord! "By the works of the
          law shall no flesh living be justified." "Cursed is every one that
          continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law
          to do them;" and in as much as you have not continued in all things
          that are written in the law you are transgressors of the law, and you
          are under the curse, and all that the law has to say to you is,
          "Cursed, cursed, cursed! Your morality is of no help to you whatever,
          as to eternal things."
        </p>
        <p>
          I turn to another character. He says, "Well, I don't trust in my
          morality nor in anything else; I say,
        </p>
        <p>'Begone dull care, I pray thee begone from me.'</p>
        <p>
          I have nothing to do with talking about eternity, as you would have
          me. But, sir, I am not a bad fellow after all. It is a very little
          that I ever do amiss; now and then a peccadillo, just a little folly,
          but neither my country, nor my friends, nor my own conscience, can say
          anything against me. True, I am none of your saints; I don't profess
          to be too strict; I may go a little too far sometimes, but it is only
          a little; and I dare say we shall be able to set all matters straight
          before the end comes." Well, friend, but I wish you had asked yourself
          the question, "What have I done?" -- it strikes me that if each of you
          would just take off that film, that films your heart and your life
          over, you might see a grievous leprosy lurking behind what you have
          done. "Well, for the matter of that," says one, "perhaps I may have
          taken a glass or two too much sometimes." Stop a bit! What is the name
          of that? Stutter as much as you like! Out with it! What is the name of
          it? "Why, it is just a little mirth, sir." Stop, let us have the right
          name of it. What do you call it in any one else? "Drunkenness, I
          suppose." Says another, "I have been a little loose in my talk
          sometimes." What is that? "It has been just a merry spree." Yes, but
          please to call it what it ought to be called -- lascivious
          conversation. Write that down. "Oh! no, sir; things are looking
          serious." Yes, they are indeed; but they do not look any more serious
          than they really are. Sometimes you have been out on the Sabbath day
          haven't you? "Oh! yes; but that has been only now and then -- just
          sometimes." Yes, but let us put it down what it is, and we will see
          what the list comes to. Sabbath-breaking! "Stop," you say, "I have
          gone no further, sir; certainly I have gone no further." I suppose in
          your conversation, sometimes during your life, you have quoted texts
          of Scripture to make jokes of them, haven't you? And sometimes you
          have cried out, when you have been a little surprised, "Lord, have
          mercy upon me, and such things. I don't venture to say you swear;
          though there is a Christian way of swearing that some people get into,
          and they think it is not quite swearing, but what it is besides nobody
          knows, and so we will put it down as swearing -- cursing and swearing.
          "Oh! sir, it was only when somebody trod on my toes, or I was angry."
          Never mind, put it down by its right name: we shall get a pretty good
          list against you by and by. I suppose that in trade you never
          adulterate your articles. "Well that is a matter of business in which
          you ought not to interfere." Well, it so happens I am going to
          interfere -- and if you please we will call it by its right name --
          stealing. We will put that down. I suppose you have never been hard
          with a debtor, have you? You have never at any time wished that you
          were richer, and sometimes half wished that your opposite neighbor
          would lose part of his custom, so that you might have it? Well, we
          will call it by its right name: that is "covetousness, which is
          idolatry." Now, the list seems to be getting black indeed. Besides
          that, how have you spent all this year; and though you have pretended
          sometimes to say prayers, have you ever really prayed? No, you have
          not. Well, then there is prayerlessness to put down. You have
          sometimes read the Bible, you have sometimes listened to the ministry
          but have you not, after all, let all these things pass away? Then I
          want to know whether that is not despising God, and whether we must
          not put that down under that name. Truly we need go but very little
          further; for the list already when summed up is most fearful, and few
          of us can escape from sins so great as these, if our conscience be but
          a little awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one man here who has grown very careless and indifferent
          to every point of morality, and he says, "Ah! young man, I could tell
          you what I have done during the year." Stop, sir, I don't particularly
          wish to know just now; you may as well tell it to yourself when you
          get home. There are young people here: it would not do them much good
          to know what you have done perhaps. You are no better than you should
          be, some people say; which means, you are so bad they would not like
          to say what you are. Do you suppose in all this congregation we have
          no debauched men -- none that indulge in the vilest sin and lust? Why,
          God's angel seems even now to be flying through our midst, and
          touching the conscience of some, to let them know in what iniquities
          they have indulged during the year. I pray God that my just simply
          alluding to them may be the means of startling your conscience. Ah! ye
          may hide your sins; the coverlet of darkness may be your shelter; you
          may think they shall never be discovered; but remember, every sin that
          you have done shall be read before the sun, and men, and angels shall
          hear it in the day of final account. Ah! my hearer, be thou moral or
          be thou dissolute, I beseech thee, answer this question solemnly
          to-day: "What have I done?" It would be as well if you took a piece of
          paper when you went home, and just wrote down what you have done from
          last January to December; and if some of you do not get frightened at
          it I must say you have got pretty strong nerves, and are not likely to
          be frightened at much yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I specially address myself to the unconverted man and I would help
          him to answer this question in another point of view. "What have I
          done?" Ah! man, thou that livest in sin, thou that art a lover of
          pleasure more than a lover of God, what hast thou done? Dost thou not
          know that one sin is enough to damn a soul for ever? Hast thou never
          read in Holy Scripture that cursed is he that sins but once? How
          damned then, art thou by the myriad sins of this one year! Recall, I
          beseech thee, the sins of thy youth and thy former transgressions up
          till now; and if one sin would ruin thee for ever, how ruined art thou
          now! Why, man, one wave of sin may swamp thee. What will these oceans
          of thy guilt do? One witness against thee will be enough to condemn
          thee: behold the crowds of follies and of crimes now gathered round
          the judgment-seat that have gone before thee into judgment. How wilt
          thou escape from their testimonies, when God shall call thee to his
          bar. What hast thou done? Come, man, answer this question. There are
          many consequences involved in thy sin, and in order to answer this
          question rightly thou must reply to every consequence, what hast thou
          done to thine own soul? Why, thou hast destroyed it; thou hast done
          thy best to ruin it for ever. For thine own poor soul thou hast been
          digging dungeons; thou hast been piling faggots; thou hast been
          forging chains of iron -- faggots with which to burn it, and fetters
          with which to bind it for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, thy sins are like sowing for a harvest. What a harvest is
          that which thou hast sown for thy poor soul! Thou hast sown the wind,
          thou shalt reap the whirlwind; thou hast sown iniquity, thou shalt
          reap damnation. But what hast thou done against the gospel? Remember,
          how many times this year thou hast heard it preached? Why, since thy
          birth there have been wagon-loads of sermons wasted on thee. Thy
          parents prayed for thee in thy youth; thy friends instructed thee till
          thou didst come to manhood. Since then how many a tear has been wept
          by the minister for thee! How many an earnest appeal has been shot
          into thine heart! But thou hast rent out the arrow. Ministers have
          been concerned to save thee, and thou cast never been concerned about
          thyself. What hast thou done against Christ? Remember, Christ has been
          a good Christ to sinners here; but as there is nothing that burns so
          well as that soft substance, oil, so there is nothing that will be so
          furious as that gentle-hearted Saviour, when he comes to be your
          Judge. Fiercer than a lion on his prey is rejected love. Despise
          Christ on the cross, and it will be a terrible thing to be judged by
          Christ on his throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again: what have you done for your children this year? Oh! there
          be some here present that have been doing all they could to ruin their
          children's souls. Tis solemn what responsibility rests upon a father;
          and what shall be said of a drunken father? -- the father that sets
          his children an example of drunkenness. Swearer, what have you done
          for your family? Haven't you, too, been twisting the rope for their
          eternal destruction? Will they not be sure to do as you do? Mother,
          you have several children, but this year you have never prayed for one
          of them, never put your arms round their necks as they kneeled at
          their little chair at night, and said, "Our Father;" you have never
          told them of Jesus that loved children, and once became a child like
          them. Ah, then, you too have neglected your children. I remember a
          mother who was converted to God in her old age, and she said to me --
          and I shall never forget the womanly grief -- "God has forgiven me,
          but I shall never forgive myself. For sir," she said, "I have
          nourished and brought up children but I have done it without any
          respect to religion." And then she burst into tears, and said, "I have
          been a cruel mother, sir; I have been a wretch!" "Why," said I, "my
          good woman, you have brought your children up." "Yes," said she, "my
          husband died when they were young, and left me with six of them, and
          these hands have earned their bread and found them clothes; no one,"
          she said, "can accuse me of being unkind to them in anything but this;
          but this is the worst of all; I have been a cruel mother to them, for
          while I fed their bodies I neglected their souls. But some have gone
          further than this. Ah, young man, you have not only done your best
          this year to damn yourself, but you have done your best to damn
          others! Remember, last January, you took that young man into the
          tavern for the first time, and laughed at all his boyish scruples, as
          you called them, and told him to drink away, as you did. Remember,
          when in the darkness of night you first led astray one young man whose
          principles were virtuous, and who had not known lust unless you had
          revealed it to him; you said at the time, "Come with me; I'll show you
          London life, I'll let you see pleasure!" That young man, when he first
          came to your shop, used to go to the house of God on Sunday, and
          seemed to bid fair for heaven -- "Ah," you say, "I have laughed
          religion out of Jackson, he doesn't go any where on a Sunday now
          except for a spree, and he is just as merry as any of us." Ah! sir,
          and you will have two hells when you are damned; you will have your
          own hell and his too, for he will look through the lurid flames upon
          you, and say, "Mayhap, I had never been here if you had not brought me
          here!" And ah! seducer, what eyes will be those that will glare at you
          through hell's horror? -- The eyes of one whom you led into iniquity!
          what double hells they will be to you as they glare on you like two
          stars, whose light is fury, and wither your blood for ever! Pause, ye
          that have led others astray, and tremble now. I paused myself, and
          prayed to God when I first knew a Saviour, that he would help me to
          lead those to Christ that I had ever in any way led astray. And I
          remember George Whitfield says when he began to pray, his first prayer
          was that God would convert those with whom he used to play at cards
          and waste his Sundays. "And blessed be God," he says, "I got every one
          of them."
        </p>
        <p>
          O my God, can I not detect in some face here astonishment and terror.
          Doth no man's knees knock together? Doth no man's heart quail within
          him because of his iniquity? Surely it cannot be so, else were your
          hearts turned to steel, and your bowels become as iron in the midst of
          you. Surely, if it be so, the words of God are most certainly true,
          wherein he saith, in the seventh verse of this chapter -- "The stork
          in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle, and the
          crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their coming; but my
          people know not the judgment of the Lord;" and certainly that prophet
          was true who said, "The ox knoweth its owner, and the ass his masters
          crib; but my people doth not know, Israel doth not consider." Oh, are
          ye so brutish as to let the reflections of that guilt pass over you
          without causing astonishment and terror? Then, surely we who feel our
          guilt have need to bend our knees for you, and pray that God might yet
          bring you to know yourselves; for, living and dying as you are,
          hardened and without hope, your lot must be horrible in the extreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          How happy should I be if I might hope that the great mass of you could
          accompany me in this humble confession of our faith; may I speak as if
          I were speaking for each one of you? It shall be at your option,
          either to accept what I say, or to reject it; but, I trust, the great
          multitude of you will follow me. "Oh, Lord! I this morning confess
          that my sins are greater than I can bear; I have deserved thy hottest
          wrath, and thine infinite displeasure; and I hardly dare to hope that
          thou canst have mercy upon me; but inasmuch as thou didst give thy Son
          to die upon the cross for sinners, thou hast also said, Look unto me
          and be ye saved all the ends of the earth,' Lord, I look to thee this
          morning, though I never looked before, yet I look now; though I have
          been a slave of sin to this moment, yet Lord, accept me, sinner though
          I be, through the blood and righteousness of thy Son, Jesus Christ. Oh
          Father, frown not on me; thou mayest well do so, but I plead that
          promise which says, Whosoever cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast
          out. Lord, I come --
        </p>
        <p>Just as I am, without one plea,</p>
        <p>But that thy blood was shed for me,</p>
        <p>And that thou bid'st me come to thee,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come.</p>
        <p>My faith doth lay its hand,</p>
        <p>On that dear head of thine,</p>
        <p>While like a penitent I stand,</p>
        <p>And there confess my sin.</p>
        <p>
          "Lord accept me, Lord pardon me, and take me as I am, from this time
          forth and for ever, to be thy servant whilst I live, to be thy
          redeemed when I die." Can you say that? Did not many a heart say it?
          Did I not hear many a lip in silence utter it? Be of good cheer, my
          brother, my sister, that if that came from your heart, you are as safe
          as the angels of heaven, for you are a child of God, and you shall
          never perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now I have to address a few words of AFFECTIONATE ADMONITION, and
          then I have done. It is a very solemn thing to think how years roll
          away. I never spent a shorter year in my life than this one, and the
          older I grow, the shorter the years get; and you, old men, I dare say,
          look back on your sixty and seventy years, and you say, "Ah, young
          man, they will seem shorter, soon!" No doubt, they will. "So teach us
          to number our days, O God, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."
          But, is it not a solemn thing, that there is another year nearly gone;
          and yet many of you are unsaved? You are just where you were last
          year. No, you are not, you are nearer death, and you are nearer hell,
          except you repent; and, perhaps, even what I have said this morning
          will have no effect upon you. You are not altogether hardened, for you
          have had many serious impressions. Scores of times you have wept under
          discourses, and yet all has been in vain, for you are what you were. I
          beseech you, answer this question, "What have I done?" for, remember,
          there will be a time when you will ask this question, but it will be
          too late. When Is that -- say you -- on the death bed? No, it is not
          too late there.
        </p>
        <p>"While the lamp holds out to burn,</p>
        <p>The vilest sinner may return."</p>
        <p>
          But it will be too late to ask, "What have I done?" when the breath
          has gone out of your body. Just suppose the monument as it used to be,
          before they caged it round. Suppose a man going up the winding
          staircase to the top, with a full determination to destroy himself. He
          has got on the outside of the railings. Can you imagine him for a
          moment saying, "What have I done?" just after he has taken his leap.
          Why, methinks some spirit in the air might whisper, "Done? you have
          done what you can never undo. You are lost -- lost -- lost!" Now,
          remember that you that have not Christ, are to-day going up that
          spiral stair-case; perhaps, to-morrow you will be standing in the
          article of death upon the palisading, and when death has gotten you,
          and you are just leaping from that monument of life down to the gulf
          of despair, that question will be full of horror to you. "What have
          you done?" But the answer for it will not be profitable, but full of
          terror. Methinks, I see a spirit launched upon the sea of eternity. I
          hear it say, "What have I done?" It is plunged in flaming waves, and
          cries, "What have I done?" It sees before it a long eternity; but it
          asks the question again, "What have I done?" The dread answer comes;
          thou hast earned all this for thyself. Thou knewest thy duty, but thou
          didst it not; Thou wast warned, but thou didst despise the warning.
          Ah! hear the doleful soliloquy of such a spirit. The last great day is
          come; the flaming throne is set, and the great book is opened. I hear
          the leaves as with terrible rustle they are turned over. I see men
          motioned to the right or to the left, according to the result of that
          great book. And what have I done? I know that to me sin will be
          destruction, for I have never sought a Saviour. What is that? The
          Judge has fixed his eye on me. Now, it is on me turned. Will he say,
          "Depart ye cursed," unto me? Oh! let me be crushed for ever, rather
          than bear that sight. There is no noise, but the finger is lifted, and
          I am dragged out of the crowd, and singly I stand before the Judge. He
          turns to my page, and before he reads it, my heart quakes within me.
          "Be it so," says he, "it has never been blotted with my blood. You
          despised my calls; you laughed at my people; you would have none of my
          mercy; you said that you would take the wages of unrighteousness. You
          shall have them, the wages of sin is death." Ah! me, and is he about
          to say, "Depart, ye cursed?" Yes, with a voice louder than a thousand
          thunders, he says, "Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
          for the devil and his angels." Ah! it is all true now. I laughed at
          the minister, because he preached about hell; and here am I in hell,
          myself. Ah! I used to wonder why he wanted to frighten us so. Ah! I
          would to God he had frightened me more, if he might but have
          frightened me out of this place. But now, here am I lost, and there is
          no escape. I am in darkness so dark, there is not a ray of light can
          ever reach me. I am shut up so close, that not one of the bolts and
          bars can ever be removed. I am damned for ever. Ah! that is a dreary
          soliloquy. I cannot tell it to you. Oh! if you were there, yourselves,
          if you could only know what they feel, and see what they endure, then
          would you wonder that I am not more earnest in preaching the Gospels
          and you would marvel, not that I wish to make you weep, but that I did
          not weep far more myself, and preach more solemnly. Ah! my hearers, as
          the Lord my God liveth, before whom I stand, I shall one day stand
          acknowledged by our conscience as having been a true witness unto you
          this morning; for there is not one of you here today, but will be
          without excuse, if you perish. You have been warned, I have warned you
          as earnestly as I can. I have no more powers to spend, no more arts to
          try, no more persuasion that I can use. I can only conclude by saying,
          I beseech you, fly to Jesus. I entreat you, as immortal spirits that
          are bound for endless weal or woe, fly ye to Christ; seek for mercy at
          his hands; trust in him, and be saved; and, at your peril, reject my
          solemn warning. Remember, ye may reject it, but ye reject not me, but
          him that sent me. Ye may despise it, but ye despise not me, but a
          greater than Moses, even Jesus Christ the Lord; and when ye come
          before his bar, piercing will be his language, and terrible his words,
          when he condemns you for ever, for ever, for ever, without hope, for
          ever, for ever, for ever. May God deliver us from that, for Jesus'
          sake. Amen.<br />
