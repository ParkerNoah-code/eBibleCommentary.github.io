          12. Let there be none prolonging mercy to him: and let there be none
          to pity his fatherless children.13. Let his posterity be cut off; in
          the next generation let their name be effaced.14. Let the iniquity of
          his fathers be remembered before Jehovah; and let not the sin of his
          mother be blotted out.15. Let them be before Jehovah continually, and
          let him cut off their memorial from the earth. 16. Because he forgot
          to show mercy, but persecuted the afflicted and poor man, and the
          sorrowful in heart, that he might slay him.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          12 Let there be none prolonging mercy to him. To continue to show
          humanity and mercy is, according to the Hebrew idiom, equivalent to
          constant and successive acts of kindness; and it also sometimes
          denotes pity, or the being moved to sympathy, when, through the lapse
          of years, anger is appeased, and even one's calamity melts the heart
          of the man who bore hatred towards him. Accordingly, there are some
          who understand this clause to mean, that there will be none to show
          kindness to his offspring; which interpretation is in conformity with
          the next clause of the verse. David, however, includes also the wicked
          man himself along with his children; as if he should say, Though he
          visibly pine away under such calamities, and these descend to his
          children, yet let no one show pity towards them. We are aware it not
          unfrequently happens, that the long-continued misfortune of an enemy
          either excites the sympathy of men of savage dispositions, or else
          makes them forget all their hatred and malevolence. But in this part
          of the psalm, David expresses a desire that his enemy and all his
          posterity may be so hated and detested, that the people may never be
          wearied with beholding the calamities which they endure, but may
          become so familiarised with the spectacle, as if their hearts were of
          iron. At the same time, let it be remarked, that David is not rashly
          excited by any personal anguish to speak in this manner, but that it
          is as God's messenger he declares the punishment which was impending
          over the ungodly. And verily the law accounts it as one of the
          judgments of God, his hardening men's hearts, so that they who have
          been passionately and unmercifully cruel, should find no sympathy,
          Deuteronomy 2:30. It is just that the same measure which they have
          used towards others, should also be meted out to themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Let his posterity be cut off. This is a continuation of the same
          subject, upon the consideration of which the prophet had just now
          entered, that God would visit the iniquities of the fathers upon their
          children. And as he had to deal with the whole court of Saul, and not
          with any single individual, he here employs the plural number. But as
          in deeds of wickedness, there are always some who are the prime
          movers, and act as the ringleaders of others, we need not be surprised
          that having spoken of one person, he next addresses the many, and then
          returns to the same person. The more natural and simple mode of
          explanation is to refer it to his offspring, for the Hebrew term which
          signifies posterity is collective, implying a multitude, and not a
          single individual only. This is a heavier imprecation than the former.
          It sometimes happens, that a family, overthrown by an unexpected
          disaster, rises up again at a subsequent period; here, however, it is
          the wish of the prophet, that the wicked may be so completely ruined,
          as never to be able to regain their former state; for thus much is
          implied in their name being effaced in the next generation, or after
          the lapse of ages.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as the destruction which he denounces against the houses and
          families of the wicked is so extensive, that God punishes them in the
          person of their posterity, so he desires that God may remember the
          iniquities of their fathers and mothers, in order that their
          condemnation may be complete; and this is a principle in perfect
          accordance with the commonly received doctrine of Scripture. God, out
          of regard to his covenant, which is in force to a thousand
          generations, extends and continues his mercy towards posterity; but he
          also punishes iniquity unto the third and fourth generation. In doing
          this he does not involve the guiltless with the wicked
          indiscriminately, but by withholding from the reprobate the grace and
          illumination of his Spirit, he prepares the vessels of wrath for
          destruction, even before they are born, Romans 9:21. To the common
          sense of mankind, the thought of such severity is horrifying: but then
          we must recollect, that if we attempt to measure the secret and
          inscrutable judgments of God by our finite minds, we do him wrong.
          Struck with horror at the severity of this threatening, let us improve
          it as the means of filling us with reverence and godly fear. In
          reference to the language of Ezekiel,
        </p>
        <p>
          "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, but the soul that
          sinneth, it shall die;" Ezekiel 18:20
        </p>
        <p>
          we know that in these words he disproves the groundless complaints of
          the people, who, boasting that they were guiltless, imagined that they
          were punished wrongfully. When, however, God continues his vengeance
          from the father to the children, he leaves them no room for palliation
          or complaint, because they are all equally guilty. We have already
          said, that vengeance commences when God in withdrawing his Spirit,
          both from the children and the fathers, delivers them over to Satan.
          Some may inquire how it comes to pass, that the prophet, in desiring
          that their sin may be continually before God's eyes, does not likewise
          add, let their name be blotted out from heaven, but merely wishes them
          to be cut off, and to perish in the world? My reply is, that he spoke
          agreeably to the custom of the age in which he lived, when the nature
          of spiritual punishments was not so well understood as in our times,
          because the period had not yet arrived, when the revelation of God's
          will was to be full and complete. Besides, it is the design of David,
          that the vengeance of God may be so manifest, that the whole world may
          acquiesce in his equity as a judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          16. Because he forgot to show mercy The prophet comes now to show that
          he had good reason for desiring such awful and direful calamities to
          be inflicted upon his enemies, whose thirst for cruelty was
          insatiable, and who were transported with rage, no less cruel than
          obstinate, against the afflicted and poor man, persecuting him with as
          little scruple as if they were attacking a dead dog. Even philosophers
          look upon cruelty, directed against the helpless and miserable, as an
          act worthy only of a cowardly and grovelling nature; for it is between
          equals that envy is cherished. For this reason the prophet represents
          the malignity of his enemies as being bitter in persecuting him when
          he was in affliction and poverty. The expression, the sorrowful in
          heart, is still more emphatic. For there are persons who,
          notwithstanding of their afflictions, are puffed up with pride; and as
          this conduct is unreasonable and unnatural, these individuals incur
          the displeasure of the powerful. On the other hand, it would be a sign
          of desperate cruelty to treat with contempt the lowly and dejected in
          heart. Would not this be to fight with a shadow? This insatiable
          cruelty is still farther pointed out by the phrase, forgetting to show
          mercy; the meaning of which is, that the calamities, with which he
          beheld this guiltless and miserable man struggling, fail to excite his
          pity, so that, out of regard to the common lot of humanity, he should
          lay aside his savage disposition. In this passage, therefore, the
          contrast is equally balanced on the one side between such obstinate
          pride, and on the other, the strict and irrevocable judgment of God.
          And as David spoke only as he was moved by the Holy Spirit, this
          imprecation must be received as if God himself should thunder from his
          celestial throne. Thus, in the one case, by denouncing vengeance
          against the ungodly, he subdues and restrains our perverse
          inclinations, which might lead us to injure a fellow-creature; and on
          the other, by imparting comfort to us, he mitigates and moderates our
          sorrow, so that we patiently endure the ills which they inflict upon
          us. The wicked may for a time revel with impunity in the gratification
          of their lusts; but this threatening shows that it is no vain
          protection which God vouchsafes to the afflicted. But let the faithful
          conduct themselves meekly, that their humility and contrition of
          spirit may come up before God with acceptance. And as we cannot
          distinguish between the elect and the reprobate, it is our duty to
          pray for all who trouble us; to desire the salvation of all men; and
          even to be careful for the welfare of every individual. At the same
          time, if our hearts are pure and peaceful, this will not prevent us
          from freely appealing to God's judgment, that he may cut off the
          finally impenitent. <br />
