          5. He hath founded the earth upon its foundations, so that it shall
          not be moved for ever.6. He hath covered it with the deep as with a
          garment: the waters shall stand above the mountains.7. At thy rebuke
          they shall flee; at the voice of thy thunder they shall haste away. 8.
          The mountains shall ascend, and the valleys shall descend to the place
          which thou hast founded for them.9. Thou hast fixed a bound over which
          they shall not pass; they shall not return to cover the earth.

          5 He hath founded the earth upon its foundations Here the prophet
          celebrates the glory of God, as manifested in the stability of the
          earth. Since it is suspended in the midst of the air, and is supported
          only by pillars of water, how does it keep its place so steadfastly
          that it cannot be moved? This I indeed grant may be explained on
          natural principles; for the earth, as it occupies the lowest place,
          being the center of the world, naturally settles down there. But even
          in this contrivance there shines forth the wonderful power of God.
          Again, if the waters are higher than the earth, because they are
          lighter, why do they not cover the whole earth round about? Certainly
          the only answer which philosophers can give to this is, that the
          tendency of the waters to do so is counteracted by the providence of
          God, that a dwelling-place might be provided for man. If they do not
          admit that the waters are restrained by the determinate appointment of
          God, they betray not only their depravity and unthankfulness, but also
          their ignorance, and are altogether barbarous. The prophet, therefore,
          not without reason, recounts among the miracles of God, that which
          would be to us wholly incredible, did not even experience show its
          truth. We are very base indeed if, taught by such undoubted a proof,
          we do not learn that nothing in the world is stable except in as far
          as it is sustained by the hand of God. The world did not originate
          from itself, consequently, the whole order of nature depends on
          nothing else than his appointment, by which each element has its own
          peculiar property. Nor is the language of the prophet to be viewed
          merely as an exhortation to give thanks to God; it is also intended to
          strengthen our confidence in regard to the future, that we may not
          live in the world in a state of constant fear and anxiety, as we must
          have done had not God testified that he has given the earth for a
          habitation to men. It is a singular blessing, which he bestows upon
          us, in his causing us to dwell upon the earth with undisturbed minds,
          by giving us the assurance that he has established it upon everlasting
          pillars. Although cities often perish by earthquakes, yet the body of
          the earth itself remains. Yea, all the agitations which befall it more
          fully confirm to us the truth, that the earth would be swallowed up
          every moment were it not preserved by the secret power of God.

          6. He hath covered it with the deep as with a garment, This may be
          understood in two ways, either as implying that now the sea covers the
          earth as a garment, or that at the beginning, before God by his
          omnipotent word held gathered the waters together into one place, the
          earth was covered with the deep. But the more suitable sense appears
          to be, that the sea is now the covering of the earth. At the first
          creation the deep was not so much a garment as a grave, inasmuch as
          nothing bears less resemblance to the adorning of apparel than the
          state of confused desolation and shapeless chaos in which the earth
          then was. Accordingly, in my judgment, there is here celebrated that
          wonderful arrangement by which the deep, although without form, is yet
          the garment of the earth. But as the context seems to lead to a
          different view, interpreters are rather inclined to explain the
          language as denoting, That the earth was covered with the deep before
          the waters had been collected into a separate place. This difficulty
          is however easily solved, if the words of the prophet, The waters
          shall stand above the mountains, are resolved into the potential mood
          thus, The waters would stand above the mountains; which is
          sufficiently vindicated from the usage of the Hebrew language. I have
          indeed no doubt that the prophet, after having said that God had
          clothed the earth with waters, adds, by way of exposition, that the
          waters would stand above the mountains, were it not that they flee
          away at God's rebuke. Whence is it that the mountains are elevated,
          and that the valleys sink down, but because bounds are set to the
          waters, that they may not return to overwhelm the earth? The passage
          then, it is obvious, may very properly be understood thus, -- that the
          sea, although a mighty deep, which strikes terror by its vastness, is
          yet as a beautiful garment to the earth. The reason of the metaphor
          is, because the surface of the earth stands uncovered. The prophet
          affirms that this does not happen by chance; for, if the providence of
          God did not restrain the waters, would they not immediately rush forth
          to overwhelm the whole earth? He, therefore, speaks advisedly when he
          maintains that the appearance of any part of the earth's surface is
          not the effect of nature, but is an evident miracle. Were God to give
          loose reins to the sea, the waters would suddenly cover the mountains.
          But now, fleeing at God's rebuke, they retire to a different quarter.
          By the rebuke of God, and the voice of his thunder, is meant the awful
          command of God, by which he restrains the violent raging of the sea.
          Although at the beginning, by his word alone, he confined the sea
          within determinate bounds, and continues to this day to keep it within
          them, yet if we consider how tumultuously its billows cast up their
          foam when it is agitated, it is not without reason that the prophet
          speaks of it, as kept in check by the powerful command of God; just
          as, both in Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 5:22) and in Job, (Job 28:25) God,
          with much sublimity, commends his power, as displayed in the ocean.
          The ascending of the mountains, and the descending of the valleys, are
          poetical figures, implying, that unless God confined the deep within
          bounds, the distinction between mountains and valleys, which
          contributes to the beauty of the earth, would cease to exist, for it
          would engulf the whole earth. It is said that God has founded a place
          for the valleys; for there would be no dry land at the foot of the
          mountains, but the deep would bear sway, did not God command the space
          there to be unoccupied by the sea, as it were contrary to nature.

          9. Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass The miracle spoken
          of is in this verse amplified, from its perpetuity. Natural
          philosophers are compelled to admit, and it is even one of their first
          principles, that the water is circular, and occupies the region
          intermediate between the earth and the air. It is entirely owing to
          the providence of God, that part of the earth remains dry and fit for
          the habitation of men. This is a fact of which mariners have the most
          satisfactory evidence. Yea, were even the rudest and most stupid of
          our race only to open their eyes, they would behold in the sea
          mountains of water elevated far above the level of the land. Certainly
          no banks, and even no iron gates, could make the waters, which in
          their own nature are fluid and unstable, keep together and in one
          place, as we see to be the case. I have just now said that
          earthquakes, which bring destruction upon some places, leave the
          globe, upon the whole, as it was before; and in like manner, although
          the sea, in some parts of the world, overpasses its boundaries, yet
          the law, which confines it; within certain limits, stands fast, that
          the earth may be a fit habitation for men. The Baltic Sea, in our own
          time, inundated large tracts of land, and did great damage to the
          Flemish people and other neighboring nations. By an instance of this
          kind we are warned what would be the consequence, were the restraint
          imposed upon the sea, by the hand of God, removed. How is it that we
          have not thereby been swallowed up together, but because God has held
          in that outrageous element by his word? In short, although the natural
          tendency of the waters is to cover the earth, yet this will not
          happen, because God has established, by his word, a counteracting law,
          and as his truth is eternal, this law must remain steadfast.<br />
