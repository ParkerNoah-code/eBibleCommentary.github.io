        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.502)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 29th, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "For the Lord, whose name is jealous, is a jealous God." -- Exodus
          34:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE PASSION OF JEALOUSY IN MAN is usually exercised in an evil manner,
          but it is not in itself necessarily sinful. A man may be zealously
          cautious of his honor, and suspiciously vigilant over another, without
          deserving blame. All thoughtful persons will agree that there is such
          a thing as virtuous jealousy. Self-love is, no doubt, the usual
          foundation of human jealousy, and it may be that Shenstone is right in
          his definition of it as "the apprehension of superiority," the fear
          lest another should by any means supplant us; yet the word "jealous"
          is so near akin to that noble word "zealous," that I am persuaded it
          must have something good in it. Certainly we learn from Scripture that
          there is such a thing as a godly jealousy. We find the Apostle Paul
          declaring to the Corinthian Church, "I am jealous over you with a
          godly jealousy, for I have espoused you to one husband that I may
          present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." He had an earnest,
          cautious, anxious concern for their holiness, that the Lord Jesus
          might be honored in their lives. Let it be remembered then, that
          jealousy, like anger, is not evil in itself, or it could never be
          ascribed to God; his jealousy is ever a pure and holy flame. The
          passion of jealousy possesses an intense force, it fires the whole
          nature, its coals are juniper, which have a most vehement flame; it
          resides in the lowest depths of the heart, and takes so firm a hold
          that it remains most deeply rooted until the exciting cause is
          removed; it wells up from the inmost recesses of the nature, and like
          a torrent irresistibly sweeps all before it; it stops at nothing, for
          it is cruel as the grave (Cant.8:6), it provokes wrath to the utmost,
          for it is the rage of a man, therefore he will not spare in the day of
          vengeance (Proverbs 6:34), and it over throws everything in the
          pursuit of its enemy, for "wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous;
          but who is able to stand before jealousy?" For all these reasons
          jealousy is selected as some faint picture of that tender regard which
          God has for His own Deity, honor, and supremacy, and the holy
          indignation which he feels towards those who violate his laws, offend
          his majesty, or impeach his character. Not that God is jealous so as
          to bring him down to the likeness of men, but that this is the nearest
          idea we can form of what the Divine Being feels -- if it be right to
          use even that word toward him -- when he beholds his throne occupied
          by false gods, his dignity insulted, and his glory usurped by others.
          We cannot speak of God except by using figures drawn from his works,
          or our own emotions; we ought, however, when we use the images, to
          caution ourselves and those who listen to us, against the idea that
          the Infinite mind is really to be compassed and described by any
          metaphors however lofty, or language however weighty. We might not
          have ventured to use the word, "jealousy" in connection with the Most
          High, but as we find it so many times in Scripture, let us with solemn
          awe survey this mysterious display of the Divine mind. Methinks I hear
          the thundering words of Nahum, "God is jealous and the Lord revengeth,
          the Lord revengeth and is furious, the Lord will take vengeance on his
          adversaries, and he reseryeth wrath for his enemies." My soul be thou
          humbled before the Lord and tremble at his name!
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Reverently, let us remember that THE LORD IS EXCEEDINGLY JEALOUS OF
          HIS DEITY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our text is coupled with the command -- "Thou shalt worship no other
          God." When the law was thundered from Sinai, the second commandment
          received force from the divine jealousy -- "Thou shalt not make unto
          thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in the
          heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
          under the earth; Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve
          them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God." Since he is the only
          God, the Creator of heaven and earth, he cannot endure that any
          creature of his own hands, or fiction of a creature's imagination
          should be thrust into his throne, and be made to wear his crown. In
          Ezekiel we find the false god described as "the image of jealousy
          which provoketh to jealousy," and the doom on Jerusalem for thus
          turning from Jehovah runs thus, "Mine eye shall not spare, neither
          will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head."
          False gods patiently endure the existence of other false gods. Dagon
          can stand with Bel, and Bel with Ashtaroth; how should stone, and
          wood, and silver, be moved to indignation; but because God is the only
          living and true God, Dagon must fall before his ark; Bel must be
          broken, and Ashtaroth must be consumed with fire. Thus saith the Lord,
          "Ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their
          groves;" the idols he shall utterly abolish. My brethren, do you
          marvel at this? I felt in my own soul while meditating upon this
          matter an intense sympathy with God. Can you put yourselves in God's
          place for a moment? Suppose that you had made the heavens and the
          earth, and all the creatures that inhabit this round globe; how would
          you feel if those creatures should set up an image of wood, or brass,
          or gold, and cry, "These are the gods that made us; these things give
          us life." What -- a dead piece of earth set up in rivalry with real
          Deity! What must be the Lord's indignation against infatuated rebels
          when they so far despise him as to set up a leek, or an onion, or a
          beetle, or a frog, preferring to worship the fruit of their own
          gardens, or the vermin of their muddy rivers, rather than acknowledge
          the God in whose hand their breath is, and whose are all their ways!
          Oh! it is a marvel that God hath not dashed the world to pieces with
          thunderbolts, when we recollect that even to this day milhons of men
          have changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made
          like to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed beasts, and
          creeping things. With what unutterable contempt must the living God
          look down upon those idols which are the work of man's hands -- "They
          have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
          they have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell
          not: they have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
          walk not: neither speak they through their throat." God hath
          longsuffering toward men, and he patiently endureth this madness of
          rebelhon; but, oh! what patience must it be which can restrain the
          fury of his jealousy, for he is a jealous God, and brooks no rival. It
          was divine jealousy which moved the Lord to bring all his plagues on
          Egypt. Careful reading will show you that those wonders were all aimed
          at the gods of Egypt. The people were tormented by the very things
          which they had made to be their deities, or else, as in the case of
          the murrain, their sacred animals were themselves smitten, even as the
          Lord had threatened -- "Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
          judgment: I am Jehovah." Was it not the same with ancient Israel? Why
          were they routed before their enemies? Why was their land so often
          invaded? Why did famine follow pestilence, and war succeed to famine?
          Only because "they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
          moved him to jealousy with their graven images. When God heard this,
          he was Froth, and greatly abhorred Israel." (Psalm 78:58-59.) How was
          it that at the last the Lord gave up Jerusalem to the flames, and bade
          the Chaldeans carry into captivity the remnant of his people? How was
          it that he abhorred his heritage, and gave up Mount Zion to be trodden
          under foot by the Gentiles? Did not Jeremiah tell them plainly that
          because they had walked after other gods and forsaken Jehovah,
          therefore he would cast them out into a land which they knew not?
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, the whole history of the human race is a record of the wars
          of the Lord against idolatry. The right hand of the Lord hath dashed
          in pieces the enemy and cast the ancient idols to the ground. Behold
          the heaps of Nineveh! Search for the desolations of Babylon! Look upon
          the broken temples of Greece! See the ruins of Pagan Rome! Journey
          where you will, you behold the dilapidated temples of the gods and the
          ruined empires of their foolish votaries. The moles and the bats have
          covered with forgetfulness the once famous deities of Chaldea and
          Assyria. The Lord hath made bare his arm and eased him of his
          adversaries, for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
        </p>
        <p>
          With what indignation, then, must the Lord look down upon that
          apostate harlot, called the Romish Church, when, in all her
          sanctuaries, there are pictures and images, relics and slivines, and
          poor infatuated beings are even taught to bow before a piece of bread.
          In this country, Popish idolatry is not so barefaced and naked as it
          is in other lands; but I have seen it, and my soul has been moved with
          indignation like that of Paul on Mars' Hill, when he saw the city
          wholly to idolatry; I have seen thousands adore the wafer, hundreds
          bow before the image of the Virgin, scores at prayer before a
          crucifix, and companies of men and women adoring a rotten bone or a
          rusty nail, because said to be the relic of a saint. It is vain for
          the Romanist to assert that he worships not the things themselves, but
          only the Lord through them, for this the second commandment expressly
          forbids, and it is upon this point that the Lord calls himself a
          jealous God. How full is that cup which Babylon must drink; the day is
          hastening when the Lord shall avenge himself upon her, because her
          iniquities have reached unto heaven, and she hath blasphemously
          exalted her Pope into the throne of the Host High, and thrust her
          priests into the office of the Lamb. Purge yourselves, purge
          yourselves of this leaven. I charge you before God, the Judge of quick
          and dead, if ye would not be partakers of her plagues, come out from
          her more and more, and let your protest be increasingly vehement
          against this which exalteth itself above all that is called God. Let
          our Protestant Churches, which have too great a savoar of Popery in
          them, cleanse themselves of her fornications, lest the Lord visit them
          with fire and pour the plagues of Babylon upon them. Renounce, my
          brethren, every ceremony which has not Scripture for its warrant, and
          every doctrine which is not established by the plain testimony of the
          Word of God. Let us, above all, never by any sign, or word, or deed,
          have any complicity with this communion of devils, this gathering
          together of the sons of Behal: and since our God is a jealous God, let
          us not provoke him by any affinity, gentleness, fellowship, or amity
          with this Mother of Harlots and abominations of the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          With what jealousy must the Lord regard the great mass of the people
          of this country, who have another God beside himself! With what
          indignation doth he look upon many of you who are subject to the
          prince of the power of the air, the god of this world! To you Jehovah
          is nothing. God is not in all your thoughts; you have no fear of Him
          before your eyes. Like the men of Israel, you have set up your idols
          in your heart. Your god is custom, fashion, business, pleasure,
          ambition, honor. You have made unto yourselves gods of these things;
          you have said, "These be thy gods, O Israel." Ye follow after the
          things which perish, the things of this world, which are vanity. O ye
          sons of men, think not that God is blind. He can perceive the idols in
          your hearts; he understandeth what be the secret things that your
          souls lust after; he searcheth your heart, he trieth your reins;
          beware lest he find you sacrificing to strange gods, for his anger
          will smoke against you, and his jealousy will be stirred. O ye that
          worship not God, the God of Israel, who give him not dominion over
          your whole soul, and live not to his honor, repent ye of your
          idolatry, seek mercy through the blood of Jesus, and provoke not the
          Lord to jealousy any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even believers may be reproved on this subject. God is very jealous of
          his deity in the hearts of his own people. Mother, what will he say of
          you, if that darling child occupies a more prominent place in your
          love than your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? Husband, what shall he
          say to you, and with what stripes shall he smite you, when your wife
          reigns as a goddess in your spirit? And wife, thou shouldest love thy
          husband -- thou doest well in so doing; but if thou exaltest him above
          God, if thou makest him to have dominion over thy conscience, and art
          willing to forsake thy Lord to please him, then thou hast made to
          thyself another god, and God is jealous with thee. Ay, and we may thus
          provoke him with the dead as well as with the living. A grief carried
          to excess, a grief nurtured until it prevents our attention to duty, a
          grief which makes us murmur and repine against the will of Providence
          is sheer rebelhon; it hath in it the very spirit of idolatry; it will
          provoke the Lord to anger, and he will surely chasten yet again, until
          our spirit becomes resigned to his rod. "Hast thou not forgiven God
          yet?" was the language of an old Quaker when he saw a widow who for
          years had worn her weeds, and was inconsolable in her grief -- "Hast
          thou not forgiven God yet?" We may weep under bereavements, for Jesus
          wept; but we must not sorrow so as to provoke the Lord to anger, we
          must not act as if our friends were more precious to us than our God.
          We are permitted to take solace in each other, but when we carry love
          to idolatry, and put the creature into the Creator's place, and rebel,
          and fret, and bitterly repine, then the Lord hath a rod in his hand,
          and he will make us feel its weight, for he is a jealous God. I fear
          there are some professors who put their house, their garden, their
          business, their skill, I know not what, at seasons into the place of
          God. It were not consistent with the life of godliness for a man to be
          perpetually an idolater, but even true believers will sometimes be
          overcome with this sin, and will have to mourn over it. Brethren, set
          up no images of jealousy, but like Jacob of old cry to yourselves and
          to your famihes, "Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
          clean." Let me warn those of you who neglect this that if you be the
          Lord's people you shall soon smart for it, and the sooner the better
          for your own salvation; while, on the other hand, to those ungodly
          persons who continue to live for objects other than divine, let me
          say, you not only smart in this life by bitter disappointments, but
          you shall also suffer eternal wrath in the life to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, let me push this matter home upon your consciences; let me carry
          this as at point of bayonet. Why, my hearers, there are some of you
          who never worship God. I know you go up to his house, but then it is
          only to be seen, or to quiet your conscience by having done your duty.
          How many of you merchants aim only to accumulate a fortune! How many
          of you tradesmen are living only for your famihes! How many young men
          breathe only for pleasure! How many young women exist only for
          amusement and vanity. I fear that some among you make your belly your
          god, and bow down to your own personal charms or comforts. Talk of
          idolaters! They are here to-day! If we desire to preach to those who
          break the first and second commandments we have no need to go to
          Hindostan, or traverse the plains of Africa. They are here. Unto you
          who bow not before the Lord let these words be given, and let them
          ring in your ears -- "The Lord whose name is jealous, is a jealous
          God." Who shall stand before him when once he is angry? When his
          jealousy burneth like fire and smoketh like a furnace, who shall
          endure the day of his wrath. Beware, lest he tear you in pieces, and
          there be none to deliver. Dreadful shall it be for you, if at the last
          you shall behold an angry God sitting in judgment. Pause now and
          meditate upon your doom, and think you see the Almighty robed in
          tempest and whirlwind.
        </p>
        <p>"His throne a seat of dreadful wrath,</p>
        <p>Girt with devouring flame;</p>
        <p>The Lord appears consuming fire,</p>
        <p>And Jealous is his name."</p>
        <p>God save you for Jesus' sake.</p>
        <p>II. The Lord IS JEALOUS OF HIS SOVEREIGNTY.</p>
        <p>
          He that made heaven and earth has a right to rule his creatures as he
          wills. The potter hath power over the clay to fashion it according to
          his own good pleasure, and the creatures being made are bound to be
          obedient to their Lord. He has a right to issue commands, he has done
          so -- they are holy, and just, and wise; men are bound to obey, but,
          alas, they continually revolt against his sovereignty, and will not
          obey him; nay, there be men who deny altogether that he is lying of
          kings, and others who take counsel together saying, "Let us break his
          bands in sunder, and cast away his cords from us." He that sitteth in
          the heavens is moved to jealousy by these sins, and will defend the
          rights of his crown against all comers, for the Lord is a great God,
          and a great King above all gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reminds us of the Lord's hatred of sin. Every time we sin, we do
          as much as say, "I do not acknowledge God to be my sovereign; I will
          do as I please." Each time we speak an ill-word we really say, "My
          tongue is my own, he is not Lord over my lips." Yea, and everytime the
          human heart wandereth after evil, and lusteth for that which is
          forbidden, it attempts to dethrone God, and to set up the Evil One in
          his place. The language of sin is "Who is the Lord that I should obey
          his voice; I will not have God to reign over me." Sin is a deliberate
          treason against the majesty of God, an assault upon his crown, an
          insult offered to his throne. Some sins, especially, have rebelhon
          written on their forehead -- presumptuous sins, when a man's
          conscience has been enlightened, and he knows better, and yet still
          forsakes the good and follows after evil; when a man's conscience has
          been aroused through some judgment, or sickness, or under a faithful
          ministry; if that man returns, like a dog to his vomit, he has,
          indeed, insulted the sovereignty of God. But have we not all done
          this, and are there not some here in particular of whom we once had
          good hope, but who have turned back again to crooked ways? Are there
          not some of you who, Sabbath after Sabbath, get your consciences so
          quickened that you cannot be easy in sin as others are and though you
          may, perhaps, indulge in sin, yet it costs you very dearly, for you
          know better? Did I not hear of one who sits in these seats often, but
          is as often on the ale bench? Did I not hear of another who can sing
          with us the hymns of Zion, but is equally at home with the lascivious
          music of the drunkard? Do we not know of some who in their business
          are anything but what they should be, yet for a show can come up to
          the house of God? Oh, sirs, oh, sirs, ye do provoke the Lord to
          jealousy! Take heed, for when he cometh out of his resting-place, and
          taketh to himself his sword and buckler, who are you that you should
          stand before the dread majesty of His presence! Tremble and be still!
          Humble yourselves, and repent of this your sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, if sin attacks the sovereignty of God, self-righteousness is
          equally guilty of treason: for as sin boasts, "I will not keep God's
          law," self-righteousness exclaims, "I will not be saved in God's way;
          I will make a new road to heaven; I will not bow before God's grace; I
          will not accept the atonement which God has wrought out in the person
          of Jesus; I will be my own redeemer; I will enter heaven by my own
          strength, and glorify my own merits." The Lord is very wroth against
          self-righteousness. I do not know of anything against which his fury
          burneth more than against this, because this touches him in a very
          tender point, it insults the glory and honor of his Son Jesus Christ.
          Joshua said to the children of Israel when they promised to keep the
          law -- "Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God; he is a
          jealous God; and he will not forgive your transgressions nor your
          sins." So I may well say to every self-righteous person, "You cannot
          keep the law, for God is a jealous God," carefully marking every
          fault, and just to mark your iniquities; nor will he forgive your
          iniquities so long as you attempt to win his favor by works of law.
          Throw away thy self-righteousness, thou proud one; cast it with all
          other idols to the moles and to the bats, for there is no hope for
          thee so long as thou dost cling to it. Self-righteousness is in itself
          the very height and crowning-point of rebelhon against God. For a man
          to say, "Lord, I have not sinned," is the gathering-up, the emphasis,
          the climax of iniquity, and God's jealousy is hot against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me add, dear friends, I feel persuaded that false doctrine,
          inasmuch as it touches God's sovereignty, is always an object of
          divine jealousy. Let me indicate especially the doctrines of
          free-will. I know there are some good men who hold and preach them,
          but I am persuaded that the Lord must be grieved with their doctrine
          though he forgives them their sin of ignorance. Free-will doctrine --
          what does it? It magnifies man into God; it declares God's purposes a
          nullity, since they cannot be carried out unless men are willing. It
          makes God's will a waiting servant to the will of man, and the whole
          covenant of grace dependent upon human action. Denying election on the
          ground of injustice it holds God to be a debtor to sinners, so that if
          he gives grace to one he is bound to do so to all. It teaches that the
          blood of Christ was shed equally for all men and since some are lost,
          this doctrine ascribes the difference to man's own will, thus making
          the atonement itself a powerless thing until the will of man gives it
          efficacy. Those sentiments dilute the scriptural description of man's
          depravity, and by imputing strength to fallen humanity, rob the Spirit
          of the glory of his effectual grace: this theory says in effect that
          it is of him that willeth, and of him that runneth, and not of God
          that showeth mercy. Any doctrine, my brethren, which stands in
          opposition to this truth -- "I will have mercy on whom I will have
          mercy," provokes God's jealousy. I often tremble in this pulpit lest I
          should utter anything which should oppose the sovereignty of my God;
          and though you know I am not ashamed to preach the responsibility of
          man to God -- if God be a sovereign, man must be bound to obey him --
          on the other hand, I am equally bold to preach that God has a right to
          do what he wills with his own, that he giveth no account of his
          matters and none may stay his hand, or say unto him, "What doest
          thou?" I believe that the free-will heresy assails the sovereignty of
          God, and mars the glory of his dominion. In all faithfulness, mingled
          with sorrow, I persuade you who have been deluded by it, to see well
          to your ways and receive the truth which sets God on high, and lays
          the creature in the dust. "The Lord reigneth," be this our joy. The
          Lord is our King, let us obey him and defend to the death the crown
          rights of the lying of kings, for he is a jealous God.
        </p>
        <p>
          While tarrying upon this subject, I ought also to remark that all the
          boastings of ungodly men, whenever they exalt themselves, seeing that
          they are a sort of claim of sovereignty, must be very vexatious to
          God, the Judge of all. When you glory in your own power, you forget
          that power belongeth only unto God, and you provoke his jealousy. When
          kings, parhaments, or synods, trespass upon the sacred domains of
          conscience, and say to men, "Bow down, that we may go over you" --
          when we make attempts to lord over another man's judgment, and to make
          our own opinions supreme, the Lord is moved to jealousy, for he
          retains the court of conscience for himself alone to reign in. Let us
          humbly bow before the dignity of the Most High, and pay our homage at
          his feet.
        </p>
        <p>"Glory to th' eternal King,</p>
        <p>Clad in majesty supreme!</p>
        <p>Let all heaven his praises sing,</p>
        <p>Let all worlds his power proclaim.</p>
        <p>O let my transported soul</p>
        <p>Ever on his glories gaze!</p>
        <p>Ever yield to his control,</p>
        <p>Ever sound his lofty praise!"</p>
        <p>
          Let us crown him every day! Let our holy obedience, let our devout
          lives, let our hearty acquiescence in all his will, let our reverent
          adoration before the greatness of his majesty, all prove that we
          acknowledge him to be King of kings, and Lord of lords, lest we
          provoke a jealous God to anger.
        </p>
        <p>III. THE LORD IS JEALOUS OF HIS GLORY.</p>
        <p>
          God's glory is the result of his nature and acts. He is glorious in
          his character, for there is such a store of everything that is holy,
          and good, and lovely in God, that he must be glorious. The actions
          which flow from his character, the deeds which are the outgoings of
          his inner nature, these are glorious too; and the Lord is very careful
          that all flesh should see that he is a good, and gracious, and just
          God; and he is mindfill, too, that his great and mighty acts should
          not give glory to others, but only to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          How, careful, then, should we be when we do anything for God, and God
          is pleased to accept of our doings, that we never congratulate
          ourselves. The minister of Christ should unrobe himself of every rag
          of praise. "You preached well," said a friend to Jolin Bunyan one
          morning. "You are too late," said honest Jolin, "the devil told me
          that before I left the pulpit." The devil often tells God's servants a
          great many things which they should be sorry to hear. Why, you can
          hardly be useful in a Sunday School but he will say to you -- "How
          well you have done it!" You can scarcely resist a temptation, or set a
          good example, but he will be whispering to you -- "What an excellent
          person you must be!" It is, perhaps, one of the hardest struggles of
          the Christian life to learn this sentence -- "Not unto us, not unto
          us, but unto thy name be glory." Now God is so jealous on this point
          that, while he will forgive his own servants a thousand things, this
          is an offense for which he is sure to chasten us. Let a believer once
          say, "I am," and God will soon make him say "I am not." Let a
          Christian begin to boast, "I can do all things," without adding
          "through Christ which strengtheneth me," and before long he will have
          to groan, "I can do nothing," and bemoan himself in the dust. Many of
          the sins of true Christians, I do not doubt, have been the result of
          their glorifying themselves. Many a man has been permitted by God to
          stain a noble character and to ruin an admirable reputation, because
          the character and the reputation had come to be the man's own, instead
          of being laid, as all our crowns must be laid, at the feet of Christ.
          Thou mayest build the city, but if thou sayest with Nebuchadnezzar,
          "Behold this great Babylon which I have builded!" thou shalt be
          smitten to the earth. The worms which ate Herod when he gave not God
          the glory are ready for another meal; beware of vain glory!
        </p>
        <p>
          How careful ought we to be to walk humbly before the Lord. The moment
          we glorify ourselves, since there is room for one glory only in the
          universe, we set ourselves up as rivals to the Most High. Penitent
          souls are always accepted, because they are not in God's way; proud
          souls are always rejected, because they are in God's way. Shall the
          insect of an hour glorify itself against the Sun which warmed it into
          life? Shall the potsherd exalt itself above the man that fashioned it
          upon the wheel? Shall the dust of the desert strive with the
          whirlwind? Or the drops of the ocean struggle with the tempest? O thou
          nothingness and vanity, thou puny mortal called man, humble thyself
          and reverence thy Great Creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us see to it that we never misrepresent God, so as to rob him of
          his honour. If any minister shall preach of God so as to dishonor him,
          God will be jealous against that man. I fear that the Lord hath heavy
          wrath against those who lay the damnation of man at God's door, for
          they dishonor God, and he is very jealous of his name. And those, on
          the other hand, who ascribe salvation to man must also be heavily
          beneath God's displeasure, for they take from him his glory. Ah,
          thieves! ah, thieves! will ye dare to steal the crown-jewels of the
          universe! Whither go ye, whither bear ye the bright pearls which ought
          to shine upon the brow of Christ? To put them on the brow of man?
          Stop! stop! for the Lord will not give his glory to another! Give unto
          the Lord, all ye righteous, give unto the Lord glory and strength;
          give unto him the honor that is due unto his name! Any doctrine which
          does not give all the honor to God must provoke him to jealousy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful, dear friends, that you do not misrepresent God yourselves.
          You who murmur; you who say that God deals hardly with you, you give
          God an ill character; when you look so melancholy, worldlings say,
          "The religion of Jesus is intolerable;" and so you stain the honor of
          God. Oh, do not do this, for he is a jealous God, and he will surely
          use the rod upon you if you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flash of holy pleasure crosses my mind. I am glad that he is a
          jealous God. It is enough to make us walk very carefully, but, at the
          same time, it should make us very joyful to think that the Lord is
          very jealous of his own honor. Then, brethren, if we believe in
          Christ, you and I are safe, because it would dishonor him if we were
          not; for his own name's sake and for his faithfulness' sake, he will
          never leave one of his people; since "His honor is engaged to save the
          meanest of his sheep." Now, if Christ could trifle with his own honor,
          if he had no jealousy, you and I might be afraid that he would suffer
          us to perish; but it never shall be. It shall be said on earth and
          sung in heaven at the last, that God has suffered no dishonorable
          defeats from the hands of either men or devils. "I chose my people,"
          saith the Eternal Father, "and they are mine now that I make up my
          jewels." "I bought my people," saith the eternal Son, "I became a
          surety for them before the Most High, and the infernal hon could not
          rend the meanest of the sheep." "I quickened my people," saith the
          Holy Spirit; the temptations of hell could not throw them down; their
          own corruptions could not overpower them; I have gotten the victory in
          every one of them, not one of them is lost; they are all brought
          safely to my right hand." Hide yourselves, then, under the banner of
          Jehovah's jealousy. It is bloody red, I know; its ensign bears a
          thunderbolt and a flame of fire; but hide yourselves, hide yourselves
          under it, for what enemy shall reach you there? If it be to God's
          glory to save me, I am entrenched behind munitions of stupendous rock.
          If it would render God inglorious to let me, a poor sinner, descend
          into hell; if it would open the mouths of devils and make men say that
          God is not faithful to his promise, then am I secure, for God's glory
          is wrapped up with my salvation, and the one cannot fail because the
          other cannot be tarnished. Beloved, let us mind that we be very
          jealous of God's glory ourselves since he is jealous of it. Let us say
          with Elijah -- "I am very jealous for the Lord God of hosts." May our
          lives, and conduct, and conversation prove that we are jealous of our
          hearts lest they should once depart from him; and may we smite with
          stern and unrelenting hand every sin and every thought of pride that
          might touch the glory of our gracious God; living to him as living
          before a jealous God.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. In the highest sense, THE LORD IS JEALOUS OVER HIS OWN PEOPLE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me only hint, that human jealousy, although it will exercise
          itself over man's reputation, rights, and honor, hath one particularly
          tender place: jealousy guardeth, like an armed man, the
          marriage-covenant. A suspicion here is horrible. Even good old Jacob,
          when he came to die, could not look upon his son Reuben without
          remembering his offense. "He went up to my couch," said the old man --
          and, as if the remembrance was too painful for him, he hurried on from
          Reuben to the next. The Lord has been graciously pleased to say of his
          people, "I am married unto you." The covenant of grace is a
          marriage-covenant, and Christ's Church has become his spouse. It is
          here that God's jealousy is peculiarly liable to take fire. Men cannot
          be God's favourites without being the subjects of his watchfulness and
          jealousy: that which might be looked over in another will be chastened
          in a member of Christ. As a husband is jealous of his honor, so is the
          Lord Jesus much concerned for the purity of his Church.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord Jesus Christ, of whom I now speak, is very jealous of your
          love, O believer. Did he not choose you? He cannot hear that you
          should choose another. Did he not buy you with his own blood? He
          cannot endure that you should think you are your own, or that you
          belong to this world. He loved you with such a love that he could not
          stop in heaven without you; he would sooner die than that you should
          perish; he stripped himself to nakedness that he might clothe you with
          beauty; he bowed his face to shame and spitting that he might lift you
          up to honor and glory, and he cannot endure that you should love the
          world, and the things of the world. His love is strong as death
          towards you, and therefore will be cruel as the grave. He will be as a
          cruel one towards you if you do not love him with a perfect heart. He
          will take away that husband; he will smite that child; he will bring
          you from riches to poverty, from health to sickness, even to the gates
          of the grave, because he loves you so much that he cannot endure that
          anything should stand between your heart's love and him. Be careful
          Christians, you that are married to Christ; remember, you are married
          to a jealous husband.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is very jealous of your trust. He will not permit you to trust in
          an arm of flesh. He will not endure that you should hew out broken
          cisterns, when the overflowing fountain is always free to you. When we
          come up from the wilderness leaning upon our Beloved, then is our
          Beloved glad, but when we go down to the wilderness leaning on some
          other arm; when we trust in our own wisdom or the wisdom of a friend
          -- worst of all, when we trust in any works of our own, he is angry,
          and will smite us with heavy blows that he may bring us to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is also very jealous of our company. It were well if a Christian
          could see nothing but Christ. When the wife of a Persian noble had
          been invited to the coronation of Darius, the question was asked of
          her by her husband -- "Did you not think the king a most beautiful
          man?" and her answer was -- "I cared not to look at the king; my eyes
          are for my husband only, for my heart is his." The Christian should
          say the same. There is nothing beneath the spacious arch of heaven
          comparable to Christ: there should be no one with whom we converse so
          much as with Jesus. To abide in him only, this is true love; but to
          commune with the world, to find solace in our comforts, to be loving
          this evil world, this is vexing to our jealous Lord. Do you not
          believe that nine out of ten of the troubles and pains of believers
          are the result of their love to some other person than Christ? Nail me
          to thy cross, thou bleeding Savior! Put thy thorn-crown upon my head
          to be a hedge to keep my thoughts within its bound! O for a fire to
          burn up all my wandering loves. O for a seal to stamp the name of my
          Beloved indelibly upon my heart! O love divine expel from me all
          carnal worldly loves, and fill me with thyself!
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friends, let this jealousy which should keep us near to Christ be
          also a comfort to us, for if we be married to Christ, and he be
          jealous of us, depend upon it this jealous husband will let none touch
          his spouse. Joel tells us that the Lord is jealous for his land, and
          Zechariah utters the word of the Lord, "I am jealous for Jerusalem,
          and for Zion with a great jealousy;" and then he declares that he will
          punish the heathen. And will he not avenge his own elect who cry unto
          him day and night? There is not a hard word spoken but the Lord shall
          avenge it! There is not a single deed done against us, but the strong
          hand of him who once died but now lives for us, shall take terrible
          vengeance upon all his adversaries. I am not afraid for the Church of
          God! I tremble not for the cause of God! Our jealous Husband will
          never let his Church be in danger, and if any smite her he will give
          them double for every blow. The gates of hell shall not prevail
          against his Church, but she shall prevail against the gates of hell.
          Her jealous Husband shall roll away her shame; her reproach shall be
          forgotten; her glory shall be fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and
          terrible as an army with banners, for he that is jealous of himself is
          jealous for her fair fame. The subject is large and deep; let us prove
          that we understand it, by henceforth walking very carefully; and if
          any say "Why are you so precise?" let this be our answer -- "I serve a
          jealous God."<br />
