        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1596)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Wednesday, April 27th, 1881, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At Exeter Hall.</p>
        <p>(The Annual Sermon on behalf of the Baptist Missionary Society)</p>
        <p>
          "Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I
          called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him For the Lord
          shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will
          make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the
          Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the
          voice of melody." -- Isaiah 51:2-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE second verse contains my actual text. It is the argument by which
          faith is led to look for the blessings promised in the third verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is habitual with some persons to spy out the dark side of every
          question or fact: they fix their eyes upon the "waste places," and
          they study them till they know every ruin, and are familiar with the
          dragons and the owls. They sigh most dolorously that the former times
          were better than these, and that we have fallen upon most degenerate
          days. They speak of "shooting Niagara," and of all sorts of frightful
          things. I am afraid that a measure of this tendency to write bitter
          things dwells in almost all of us at this present season, for certain
          discouraging facts which cannot be ignored are pressing heavily upon
          men's spirits. The habit of looking continually towards the
          wildernesses is injurious because it greatly discourages; and anything
          that discourages an earnest worker is a serious leakage for his
          strength. Perhaps a worse result than honest discouragement comes of
          depressing views, for they often afford an apology for indifference
          and inaction. The smallest peg suffices to hang an excuse upon when we
          are anxious to escape from the stern service of faith. "I pray thee
          have me excused," is a request which was supported in the parable by
          the flimsiest of pretences, and discouragement makes one of the same
          sort. The sluggard's argument is on this wise, -- "I will not attempt
          the work, for it is far too heavy for my poor strength. I fear the
          times are ill adapted to any special effort; indeed, I am not quite
          certain that success will ever attend the general work." It is
          therefore a dreadful thing when the Christian church begins to be
          discouraged, and means must be used to stay the evil. Such means we
          would use this day. Lo, we lift the standard of the divine promise.
          "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people," sounds out like a silver trumpet
          in the front of the host. Be encouraged, O ye of the faint heart;
          there are no more difficulties now than there were of old. The cause
          is no more in jeopardy than it was a thousand years ago. The result,
          the end, the consummation of all things is absolutely certain: it is
          in his hand who cannot fail, therefore be of good courage, and in
          waiting upon the Lord renew your strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, ye that are cast down, that there are other voices besides
          those of the bittern and owl from the "waste places." My text has near
          to it twice, nay, three times, "HEARKEN TO ME." You have listened long
          enough to dreary suggestions from within, to gloomy prophecies from
          desponding friends, to the taunts of foes, and to the horrible
          whisperings of Satan: now hearken to him who promises to make the
          wilderness like Eden, and the desert like the garden of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          O ye whose eyes are quick to discover evil, there are other sights in
          the world besides waste places and deserts, and hence my text hath
          near to it twice over the exhortation, "LOOK" -- "Look unto the rock
          whence ye are hewn"; "Look unto Abraham your father." Why should your
          eyes for ever ache over desolations? Probably you have seen as much in
          the wilderness as you are ever likely to see there. It does not take
          long to discover all the treasures and comforts of the burning sand;
          you have probably discovered them all by now. As for the discomforts
          and wants of the desert, you are perhaps as well acquainted with them
          as you need to be. Gaze no longer at the thirsty land and the burning
          sky; turn your eye where the finger of the Lord points by his word. If
          we enquire what it is that the Lord would have us observe, he answers,
          "Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you"; for
          there we may find comfort. O for the presence of the Holy Spirit, that
          the word may be full of the dew of heaven to refresh our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. We shall first look towards Abraham that we may see in him THE
          ORIGINAL OF GOD'S ANCIENT PEOPLE, the foundation stone, as it were, of
          the dispensation by which God blessed the former ages. In Judah was
          God known, his name was great in Israel: let us look to the rock
          whence Israel and Judah were hewn.
        </p>
        <p>
          We observe, first, that the founder of God's first people was called
          out of a heathen family. "Your fathers," says Joshua, "dwelt on the
          other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of
          Abraham, and they served other gods." Abraham, the founder of the
          great system in which God was pleased to reveal himself for so long a
          time, and to whose seed the oracles of God were committed, was a
          dweller in Ur of the Chaldees, the city of the moon-god. We cannot
          tell to what extent he was actually engrossed in the superstition of
          his fathers, but it is certain that the family was years afterwards
          tainted with idolatry; for in Jacob's day the teraph was still
          venerated, and Rachel stole her father's images. Abraham, therefore,
          was called out from the place of his birth, and from the household to
          which he belonged, that in a separated condition, as a worshipper of
          the one God, he might keep the truth alive in the world. Recollect,
          then, that the first man from whom sprang that wondrous nation which
          God hath not even yet cast away was originally himself an idolater,
          and had to be called out of his sinful state by effectual grace. Why,
          then, might not the Lord, if the cause of truth were this day reduced
          to its utmost extremity, again raise up a church out of one man? If an
          almost universal apostasy should hide the divine light, could he not
          kindle a torch among the heathen, and by its light illuminate the
          earth again? He could call out another Abraham, and bless him and
          increase him, and achieve the whole of his eternal purposes if all of
          us should sleep in the dust, and the visibly organised church of
          to-day should pass away as the snow of winter at the advent of spring.
          Is anything too hard for the Lord? Is he not able of these stones to
          raise up children unto Abraham? As to anything like discouragement, it
          ought to vanish at the thought that not only out of your
          Sunday-schools, your colleges, and your pulpits can God raise up
          leaders for his church, but he can find them in the very centre of
          heathenism. Where Satan's seat is, even there can the Lord raise up
          advocates for his cause. The thick darkness of superstition shall not
          prevent the chosen one from seeing the light, neither shall the
          bondage of sin hold back the captive from finding freedom and
          proclaiming it to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," you say, "but men are not called now, as Abraham was, by
          miraculous calls from heaven." I reply, -- The statement may be true;
          but God's visible means of calling men are now so many that there can
          seldom be need of miracle. The Lord can by his Spirit make one of the
          millions of Bibles scattered over the world to be as powerful a means
          of call as though he had sent an angel from heaven; yea, a solitary
          leaf of a printed tract, if wafted by the wind, or carried by the
          wave, may be borne where God shall bless it to the calling forth of a
          champion ordained of old to do great exploits. Where ordinary means
          are so plentiful wisdom resorts not to signs and wonders. Miracles
          were of admirable use while they were necessary; but now that they are
          no longer required the prudence of God forbids an extravagant display
          of the supernatural. Now that the word of God is scattered "thick as
          leaves in Valambrosa" everywhere by willing and ready hands, what need
          can there be of voices of the day or visions of the night? The same
          Spirit who called Abraham by a supernatural voice can call others by
          the word of truth. Instead of regarding it as a prodigy that a man
          should be unexpectedly called out from among the heathen I look for
          it, and shall not be surprised to hear that in the remoter provinces
          of China, or in the centre of Thibet, or in the recesses of Africa men
          have been raised up to found churches for our Lord Jesus. God can
          through the printed page or by hints and rumours passed from hand to
          hand convey enough instruction to call out more Abrahams and bless
          them, and increase his kingdom by them. "Omnipotence hath servants
          everywhere." Let us never dream that the God of Abraham is short of
          means for calling out chosen men to build up his church. Surely
          Christian people should never doubt the power of God to raise up
          lights in dark places when we remember that the greatest preacher of
          the gospel, namely, the apostle Paul, was drafted into the army of
          Christ from the ranks of his direst foes. The proud Pharisee, a
          fanatic of the fanatics, embittered against Christ, and persecuting
          his people, became the earnest advocate of Christ Jesus. Aforetime his
          breath was threatening and slaughter, yet on the road to Damascus he
          was conquered and transformed. As a lion roareth over his prey, so did
          Paul rejoice that the saints in Damascus were now in his power; but
          the Lord struck him down, and turned the lion to a lamb, and
          henceforth where sin abounded grace did much more abound. First in the
          ranks of Christian heroes stands the man who called himself the chief
          of sinners because he persecuted the church of God. My brethren, as
          Luther came from among the monks, so out of Rome, yea, from the
          Vatican itself, can God, if he wills, call another Luther. The
          darkness of the times cannot forbid it, for God is Light. The weakness
          of the church cannot hinder it, for all power belongeth unto God.
          There may not be among us to-day one whom God will so greatly honour
          as to make him a spiritual father of nations; but there may be such a
          one in the courts of Whitechapel or in the rookeries of St. Giles. The
          Christ, who was himself called the Galilean, despises no place or
          people. Our king is not particular as to the mine from which he digs
          his gold. The great seeker of precious souls full often finds his
          purest pearls in the deepest and the blackest waters. Take this, then,
          for encouragement, ye who tremble for the ark of God: he can build up
          a spiritual house for himself out of dark quarries, and find cedars
          for his temple in forests untraversed by the feet of missionaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," say you, "but Abraham was naturally a man of noble mould. Where
          do you find such a princely spirit as his?" I answer, Who made him? He
          that made him can make another like him. There is a grace of God which
          goes before what we are accustomed to call saving grace: I mean a
          grace of God which, in the creating of the nature, makes it a fit
          instrument for the grace which is after to be bestowed. By such
          sovereign favour one man is from his birth endowed with a superior
          mind and character, being adorned, even as a natural man, with much
          that is excellent in its own order. How often do you see among certain
          men of the world a generosity, honesty, open-heartedness, and nobility
          of disposition which are not grace, but which mark men out as fit to
          be leaders in all that is good when grace calls them into the divine
          service? The Lord can just as soon make a man after the type of
          Abraham as after any other type; and doubtless he has such in store
          even now, to whom his call will yet come. We may expect to see men of
          strong convictions converted into believers who "stagger not at the
          promise through unbelief." From among priests and pagans we may hope
          that the Lord will raise up pillars for his church. Is not this hope
          encouraged in your breasts as you "Look unto Abraham your father, and
          unto Sarah that bare you"?
        </p>
        <p>
          Look again and observe that Abraham was but one man. Do not be
          startled at the sound which seems to have such terrors for certain
          brethren. I have heard the cant of those who object to a "one-man
          ministry," a ministry to which all the while they usually submit in
          their own meetings; but to my ear there is music, and not terror, in
          the term "a one-man ministry." I bless God that all my hope of
          salvation hangs upon the divine ministry of the One Man. Is not
          Christ, as the servant of God, the very pattern of all ministries
          which are of God? Working out the Father's eternal purpose by a life
          which was necessarily unique in many points, he trod the wine-press
          alone; in this, however, he causes many of his people to have
          fellowship with him, even as in the case of Paul, who says, "At my
          first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me." I am bold
          also to say that the Lord has as a rule wrought more nobly by one man
          than by bands and corporations of men. He in whose seed all nations
          are blessed was but one. "I called him," saith he, "alone, and blessed
          him, and increased him." Nor is this a solitary instance. When the
          earth was utterly corrupt God conserved the race by a solitary
          preacher of righteousness, who prepared an ark for the saving of his
          house. See how one Joseph saved whole nations from famine, and one
          Moses brought out a race from bondage. Who was there to keep Israel
          right when Moses fell on sleep but the one man Joshua? What were the
          prosperous times in the era of the Judges but days when one man was to
          the front as a leader? When all the rest hid away in dens and caves,
          some Barak or Gideon, or Jephthah, or Samson came boldly forward and
          delivered Israel. One man, standing like a figure at the head of many
          ciphers, soon headed victorious thousands, through faith in God. What
          was there but one man in the days of David? The Philistines had still
          triumphed over the land if the one lad had not brought back Goliath's
          head, and if the one man had not again and again smitten the
          uncircumcised in the name of the Lord. Beloved, if we should ever be
          reduced, as we shall not be, to one man, yet by one man will God
          preserve his church, and work out his great purposes. I hope we shall
          never go into our chamber, and shut to the door, and cry with Elias,
          "I only am left, and they seek my life!" No, my brother, there are
          more faithful men in this world than you. The Lord has yet reserved to
          himself his thousands that have not bowed the knee to Baal. We are
          this day, not one man, but many, and we all desire to live for the
          glory of God, and for the spread of his gospel; but if our hosts were
          so diminished that we could be numbered by a little child upon his
          fingers, still there would be no excuse for dismay, for the God of
          Abraham still liveth, even he who created a people to his praise by
          one man, of whom he says, "I called him alone, and blessed him, and
          increased him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Think, my brethren, of the power for good or evil which may be
          enshrined in a single human life. What mischievous results may come of
          one man! One sinner destroyeth much good, and if there were but one
          person left who had knowledge of the ways of vice and the words of
          blasphemy that one man would suffice to infect the race with his
          abominations. If evil be so mighty, is not good with God in it quite
          as powerful? We may rightly measure quantities in reference to many
          things, but with others it is absurd. It would be ridiculous to
          measure the power of fire by the quantity which burns on pour hearth.
          Give us fit materials and a single match, and you shall see what fire
          can do. If ordinary fire, that may so readily be extinguished, is thus
          powerful, who shall venture to measure the power of the fire from
          heaven, which neither men nor devils can quench, the fire which fell
          at Pentecost, and burns among us still. Ye carry fire, ye servants of
          God; ye work with a heaven-sent force of boundless energy. Why,
          therefore, should you despair? If all the lights in the world were put
          out except a solitary lamp, there is enough fire in one wick to kindle
          all the lamps in the universe. What inch of ground remains for despair
          to stand upon?
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we are bound to notice that this one man was a lone man.
          He had not only to do the work of God, but he had nobody to help him.
          "I called him alone." True, he was attended by Lot -- a poor miserable
          lot he was, costing his noble uncle more trouble than he ever brought
          him profit. How little did he maintain or adorn the righteousness
          which, nevertheless, had saved him; true type of many a feeble
          professor in these days. Abraham was not backed by any society when he
          crossed the Euphrates and afterwards traversed the desert to sojourn
          in Canaan as a pilgrim and a stranger. If ever man was fairly cut
          adrift and cast upon the Lord it was the great father of the faithful.
          He certainly found no patronage in his onward course save the
          all-sufficient patronage of the Lord his God. When he came near to
          kings it was a source of trouble to him; it led to contention, and
          once to war; or else he felt bound to refuse their offers of gifts,
          and say as he did to the king of Sodom, "I will not take from a thread
          even to a shoe-latchet, and I will not take anything that is thine,
          lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich. "That same boastful
          sentence might be uttered by the State concerning some churches that I
          know of, but not concerning us: may God preserve us, my brethren, from
          every desire to come under obligations to earthly sovereignties, lest,
          becoming indebted to them, we should be bound to render suit and
          service at their bidding, such service being already due to "another
          king, one Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          Abraham had no prestige of parentage, rank, or title. If you had
          looked at the stately patriarch when he trod the plains of Mamre you
          would have seen about him a presence, a calm dignity, a truly regal
          manner; but that came to him solely through his faith in God and his
          communion with heaven. Abraham was distinguished from other men only
          by the grace of God. What grander difference can there be than that
          which is established by the existence of faith in the heart? Thus
          Abraham was in the fullest sense a lone man, unsupported by any of
          those outward distinctions which enable some men to do more than
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fulfilment of his calling rested on his loneliness; for he must
          get away from his kindred, and wander up and down with his flocks,
          even as the church of God now does, dwelling in a strange land, and
          feeding her flock apart. When he was alone God blessed Abraham, -- "I
          called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him." The blessing
          did not come to him in Charran while he still had some connection with
          the old stock; he was not yet become thoroughly nonconformist, but
          held in some small degree to the old house at home, and till the last
          link was snapped the blessing could not come. And now, my brother, if
          in the town or district where you live you seem to lose all your
          helpers; if they die one by one, and it seems as if nobody would be
          left to you; if even the prayer-meeting fails for want of earnest,
          pleading men, still persevere, for it is the lone man that God will
          bless. "He setteth the solitary in families." In your present forlorn
          condition you are learning sympathy with that lone man in Gethsemane,
          with that lone man upon the cross, who there vanquished all your foes.
          Remember that your enemies are thus beaten before you encounter them,
          and therefore you may readily overcome through the blood of the Lamb.
          Oh, be not afraid. Thus saith the Lord -- "I called him alone, and
          blessed him, and increased him." Grasp that, ye that dwell remote from
          human sympathy. Oh that our missionaries abroad may feel the rich
          comfort of this fact; for they full often, like lone sentinels, keep
          watch with eyes that long to see a friend. They are separated from
          intercourse with brethren, they miss the friendships which tend to
          comfort and confirm, but it is God that calls them alone, and he will
          bless them and increase them. The purer churches of to-day, standing
          alone as they do, because they dare not make unholy alliances with
          any, -- standing alone, I say, in simple trust in the living Lord --
          ought not to be afraid with any amazement, but attempt great things
          for God and expect great things from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once more, I cannot help asking your attention to the fact that
          Abraham was not only a man called from heathendom, one man, and a lone
          man; but he was a man who had to be stripped yet further. The blessing
          was -- "Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will
          multiply thee," but the manifest fulfilment of it was not by-and-by.
          As we have already seen, he must come away from his kindred and his
          father's house, and he must dwell in Palestine till the promised seed
          was born. But how long he waited for the expected heir! Twenty, yes,
          almost thirty years rolled away, and the man Abraham was ninety years
          old and nine. He is very old; and yet he is to be blessed with a son.
          He must number the full tale of a hundred years before Isaac can be
          born. This promised child was to be according to promise, and
          therefore it could not be born till nature was recognised as spent. As
          for Sarah -- it was not possible that she should become a mother at
          her advanced age, and yet it must be so, for God had said it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The believing pair had waited on till in an evil hour Sarah suggested
          a desperate attempt to fulfil the promise, in which she still firmly
          believed. That artifice broke down; it was a part of the divine plan
          that it should do so. The covenant promise was not to the seed after
          the flesh. When that scheme had been set aside, the Lord in his own
          time fulfilled his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joy! joy! in the house of Abraham and Sarah. What a feast there was
          that Isaac was born, filling the house with laughter. But he must die!
          "Get thee up," said God, "and take thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom
          thou lovest, and offer him for a burnt offering upon one of the
          mountains which I will tell thee of." The grand old man will do it. He
          will get up early in the morning, and the father and the son will
          journey together silently; for the aged heart is too full to talk. He
          believes God, and is sure that even if he should actually slay his son
          at God's command the promise would somehow be kept. Abraham could not
          tell how, but it was no business of his to tell how; he was fully
          persuaded that what God had promised he was able to perform. God had
          said to him "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," and he believed that
          God could raise Isaac from the dead, or in some other way achieve the
          promise. Thus he grasped the resurrection. He laid hold on a truth
          which was deeper than he knew of: by his faith he realised
          resurrection for Isaac though as yet the Lord Jesus had not shown the
          way by his own rising from the dead. What a stripping Abraham had
          endured! Who can describe what would have been the wretchedness of
          that aged parent if it had not been for his faith! Men intensely love
          the children of their old age. See how a grandchild is fondled by his
          grandsire, and thus must Isaac have been loved of Abraham and yet he
          must die by his father's own hand. Oh, most miserable among the
          miserable must he have been who stood there on Mount Moriah, called to
          such a duty, his heart breaking while his soul obeyed. Such,
          doubtless, would have been the case had not faith been his stay. Look,
          then, to Abraham your father, and say is he not the greatest of men,
          the grandest human representative of the great Father God himself, who
          in the fullness of time spared not his own Son, but freely delivered
          him up for us all? Likest to God among mortal men art thou Abraham,
          and therefore well mightest thou be his friend! In thy trial brought
          to such a stripping we may yet envy thee as we hear the Lord saying,
          "Now know I that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy
          son, thine only son from me." Now, if in all these trials Abraham was
          yet blessed, and God's purposes were accomplished in him, can we not
          believe that the same God can work by us also, despite our
          downcastings and humiliations? When we are utterly broken and crushed
          may not the Lord's strength be made perfect in our weakness? Let us
          not question the promise because of our personal deadness and
          inability, but believe God without wavering, for he hath said, "My
          grace is sufficient for thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, brothers and sisters, here is the sum and substance of this first
          head of my discourse: in looking to the rock whence we are hewn, we
          have to see the Lord working the greatest results from apparently
          inadequate causes. This teaches us to cease from calculating means,
          possibilities, and probabilities, for we have to deal with God, with
          whom all things are possible. Almighty God can assuredly do whatever
          he says he will do. Who is to hinder him? Let the voice ring out over
          all the earth, and let it be heard in hell itself -- who shall stay
          the arm of God when he wills to achieve a thing? He fears no
          opposition, and he needs no help. Of what did he make the world? With
          whom took he counsel? Who instructed him? And, if all the things that
          are have been spoken into existence by God alone, by his mere word,
          can he not yet build up his church, even if on her earthly side there
          should seem to be no material with which to raise her walls? Consider
          creation and remark what God hath wrought. See how all the millions of
          mankind have sprung from a single pair, because God blessed them in
          the beginning. But I must not multiply illustrations from nature or
          from history, for they rise spontaneously before your own minds.
          Refresh your faith by a reference to our own island history. If you
          would firmly believe in the conversion of the heathen remember what
          your fathers were when bloody rites were performed in the oak woods or
          amid the huge monoliths of Stonehenge. The Druidic system was as cruel
          and degrading as any that now curses a savage people; but the heralds
          of Jesus conquered. Where are the gods of the Druids now? Who
          reverences the golden sickle and the sacred oak? The thing is gone, as
          though it never had been. Why, then, should not other evil idolatries
          pass away? Look again at the triumph of Protestantism in this country.
          What was it at first? A thing utterly despised and hunted down. The
          stakes of Smithfield cannot be forgotten by those who dwell so near
          the spot. Yet, despite all, the gospel of God triumphed, and rood, and
          pyx, and image were broken in contempt. Let the days of the Puritans,
          the palmy days when God was known in England, tell how thoroughly
          Bible truth won the victory. Why not again? Why not everywhere? If you
          desire another illustration, look at our own body of Christians?
          History has hitherto been written by our enemies, who never would have
          kept a single fact about us upon the record if they could have helped
          it, and yet it leaks out every now and then that certain poor people
          called Anabaptists were brought up for condemnation. From the days of
          Henry II. to those of Elizabeth we hear of certain unhappy heretics
          who were hated of all men for the truth's sake which was in them. We
          read of poor men and women, with their garments cut short, turned out
          into the fields to perish in the cold, and anon of others who were
          burnt at Newington for the crime of Anabaptism. Long before your
          Protestants were known of, these horrible Anabaptists, as they were
          unjustly called, were protesting for the "one Lord, one faith, and one
          baptism." No sooner did the visible church begin to depart from the
          gospel than these men arose to keep fast by the good old way. The
          priests and monks wished for peace and slumber, but there was always a
          Baptist or a Lollard tickling men's ears with holy Scripture, and
          calling their attention to the errors of the times. They were a poor,
          persecuted tribe. The halter was thought to be too good for them. At
          times ill-written history would have us think that they died out, so
          well had the wolf done his work on the sheep. Yet here we are, blessed
          and multiplied; and Newington sees other scenes from Sabbath to
          Sabbath. As I think of your numbers and efforts, I can only say in
          wonder -- What a growth! As I think of the multitudes of our brethren
          in America, I may well say, What hath God wrought? Our history forbids
          discouragement. Never cause more hopeless once; none more hopeful
          to-day! It matters little what may yet happen, the cause is safe. What
          if all our Baptist organisations expire! What if but one man should be
          left faithful to the old banner, our Captain would yet triumph
          gloriously, for he saveth not by many nor by few. Though all else
          faileth, the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. This is the lesson
          which, I pray, we may all of us learn, and then, by faith, go forth to
          act upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. With great brevity, I shall dwell for a moment upon the second
          point, namely -- THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS CHOSEN MAN. The text
          says, "Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you,"
          and it must mean, -- consider him and see what he was, that you may
          learn from him. You perceive at once that his grand characteristic was
          his faith. In this faith many other most brilliant qualities are
          comprehended, but his faith lay at the bottom of all. Here is his
          epitaph: -- "Abraham believed God." That was a mainspring of all his
          acts, the glory of his life, "Abraham believed God." The men that God
          will work by, whatever else they have not, must have faith in God.
          Though it is to be desired that the believer should have every mental
          and moral qualification, yet it is astounding how, if there be real
          faith, a multitude of imperfections are swallowed up, and the man is
          still a power. I would mention Samson as an extreme case. He was the
          feeblest of men, and the least fitted to be a judge in Israel; but oh,
          what faith! And what wonders it achieved! A thousand men! He is like a
          child in his belief that God is with him. He never calculates at all;
          it is all the same to him whether there are a thousand or one. He
          flings himself upon the host, and has slain them before we can realise
          the deadly odds. A sword; no, he has no sword: an old jawbone of an
          ass is quite enough for an arm which God strengthens. See how he
          smites them, hip and thigh, till they lie in heaps before him. I do
          not suppose that it would have signified to Samson if there had been a
          million Philistines: with a thousand to one, a man is so thoroughly
          outnumbered that numbers cease to count. Here was an impossibility
          before him, and what could be worse. Brethren, when you do get off
          your feet, and must swim, you may as well have fifty fathoms of water
          beneath you as not, for you can but drown. In the case of faith,
          drowning is out of the question, and swimming is good in deep water,
          for there is no fear of striking against a rock. Faith glories in
          difficulties and infirmities, because the power of God doth rest upon
          her. If the work is barely possible to her strength faith hardly likes
          it; but she gets into her sphere when in trials far beyond human
          strength she laughs at impossibility, and cries, "It shall be done."
        </p>
        <p>
          Abraham's faith was such that it led him to obedience. He was called
          to go out, and he went, not knowing whither he went. His faith through
          grace led him to perseverance; for once in God's way he did not leave
          it, but still abode a sojourner with God. His faith led him to
          expectancy; he looked for the promised seed, and not only for an Isaac
          but for the Messiah. So clear was the vision of his expectancy that
          before his eyes Christ was set forth, visibly. Did not the Saviour,
          who knew all things, say, "Abraham saw my day; he saw it, and was
          glad"?
        </p>
        <p>
          The like faith also dwelt in the breast of Sarah; and, as we are told
          in the text to look to Sarah as well as Abraham, let us not fail to do
          so. The faith of Sarah was not little when she left home with her
          husband; forsaking her kith and kin from love to God, and to him whom
          she called "lord." She acted as if she had said to the great
          patriarch, "Where thou goest I will go; where thou dwellest I will
          dwell, for thy God is my God." Nor did the trial of her faith end with
          the moving, she had to take up with tent-life and all its
          inconveniences. It is the woman that knows the discomfort of domestic
          life under such circumstances. We never hear that she complained for a
          moment, though the cold of winter and the heat of summer are neither
          of them warded off by a tent. How readily she entertained her
          husband's guests. Though they might drop in at most unseasonable
          hours, or call her to bake bread in the heat of the day, she was glad
          to welcome strangers, for like her husband she was given to
          hospitality. I saw you smile, dear friends, when I mentioned domestic
          matters; but to me it is the solemnity of faith that men and women can
          not only pray and sing, but can put up with household discomforts out
          of obedience to God. Certain people look upon faith as a fine, airy,
          sentimental thing with which to roam among the stars, anticipate
          millenniums, and enjoy yourself in lofty contemplation. I believe far
          more in a faith which, whether it eats or drinks, does all to the
          glory of God; faith which like Sarah dwells in the tent and works
          there; faith which is cheerful over a scanty meal and drives away the
          fear of want; faith which can come down in life from the mansion to
          the cottage, if providence so decrees. From Abraham's comfortable home
          at Ur to his gipsy wanderings in Palestine the change must have been
          great, but Abraham may not have felt it one half as much as Sarah, for
          men can rough it and live out of doors, but the housewife knows all
          about it, and great was her Faith that she never raised a question
          about the propriety of her husband's course of life: and though she
          laughed when she was told that she should bear a son, yet remember
          that in the eleventh of Hebrews it is written -- "Through faith also
          Sarah herself received strength." She was the mother of Isaac, not in
          the power of the flesh, but through the energy of faith, therefore
          look at her as the text bids you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christian men and Christian women, mark well this fact -- that the
          characteristic of the person whom God will bless is that he believes
          and acts upon his belief. Without faith it is impossible to please
          God; but the man of faith is God's man. And why is this? I answer,
          because faith is the only faculty of our spirit which can grasp God's
          ideal. The greatest man, without faith, cannot tread in the divine
          footsteps. The ideas of God are as high above us as the heavens are
          above the earth: and therefore it is not by any fancied vastness of
          our feeble minds that we can ever rise into fellowship with God. Faith
          in the sight of God's thought whispers to herself -- "I cannot
          understand this great thing, nor need I wish to do so. What is my
          understanding? Perhaps I trust to it too much already. I am called to
          do what God bids me, without knowing why, and I am glad it is so, for
          now I can worship him by bowing before his sovereign will." There is a
          capacity about faith for grasping divine promises and purposes, a
          width, a breadth, a height, a depth, which can hold the infinite truth
          as no other power can do. Love alone can rival it, for it embraces the
          infinite God himself. With the far-reaching plans and promises of God
          faith alone is fit to deal; carnal reason is altogether out of the
          lists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith, too, has a great power of reception, and therein lies much of
          her adaptation to the divine purpose. Self-confidence, courage,
          resolution, cool reasoning, whatever else they are good at, are bad at
          humbly receiving. Those vessels which are full already are of no use
          as receivers; but faith presents her emptiness to God, and opens her
          mouth that God may fill it. Mercy needs not a jewel, but a casket into
          which to put her gems, and faith is exactly what she wants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, faith always uses the strength that God gives her. Pride
          would vapour with it, and doubt would evaporate it; but faith is
          practical, and economically uses the talent entrusted to her. Faith
          has already spent all her own strength, and she so yearns to achieve
          her purposes that she uses all the power that God will lend her. Faith
          eats her manna and leaves not a morsel for worms to breed in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith, too, can wait the Lord's time and place. When faith is weak men
          are in a dreadful hurry, but strong faith does not judge the Lord to
          be slack concerning his promise. As God achieves his purpose with
          infinite leisure, he loves a faith that is patient and looks not for
          its reward this day or the next. "He that believeth shall not make
          haste": that is to say, he shall not be ashamed or confounded by
          present trials so as to rush upon unbelieving actions. Faith leaves
          times and seasons with God to whom they belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          God loveth faith and blesseth it too, because it giveth him all the
          glory. The true believer will not allow a trace of self-glory to
          linger on his hands. "Where is boasting then?" was a question once
          asked in the house of faith, and the searchers examined every nook and
          corner in every chamber to find it, but they found it not. Then they
          said to faith, "Where is boasting?" She answered, "I shut him out."
          "It is excluded," shut out, and the door fastened in its face. You do
          not believe God if you boast of what you are doing: least of all do
          you believe if you pride yourself in your faith, for faith is not
          mistrustful of her God but of herself. Faith looks to God to keep her
          alive as well as to fulfil the promise that he has made to her. This
          then is the kind of faith which was characteristic of Abraham, and the
          question is, have we got it? Have we so much of it that God can
          largely bless us? The comfort is that, if we have it not, the author
          of faith can give it to us, and if we have it in scant measure he can
          increase our faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not this a solid reason why you and I should take heart? You who do
          not believe that missions will succeed; you who readily become
          discouraged and discourage others; I beg you go home and seek more
          faith. We cannot go down to the battle with such soldiers as you; you
          do but encumber the host. The men that lapped are the only ones that
          Gideon will take to war. Send the fearful ones to the rear and let
          them take care of the baggage, so that when the battle is won they may
          have a share of the spoil, according to David's law. For actual
          service and warfare we must have men of faith. Cromwell found that
          when his men came dressed in all sorts of suits and colours they were
          apt to injure one another in the melee, and so he put them all in
          uniform. The uniform of the Prince Immanuel is faith: no man may call
          himself a soldier of the cross who hath it not. This is the victory
          which overcometh the world, even your faith. Brother ministers, let us
          take heed lest we be found qualified for our ministry in all respects
          except this one. You have learning, eloquence, industry, honesty, but
          do you so believe in God as to expect his word to act divinely on
          men's hearts. Do you preach believingly? Do you pray believingly? I
          leave the question with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I have shown you, dear friends, that God effected his purpose,
          and raised up a chosen nation out of one man, whose chief
          characteristic was his faith: and now I want you to notice OUR
          RELATIONSHIP TO THAT ONE MAN. I dwelt upon that while reading the
          chapter (Romans 4.) There is a relation between us and Abraham even as
          Paul assures us in the epistle to the Galatians, "Know ye therefore
          that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
          Something, surely, is expected of the children of such a man as
          Abraham. O, for shame, thou unbelieving one! Is Abraham thy father?
          Art thou one of the faithful seed? Great mountains are often succeeded
          by low valleys. Perhaps that is the case with you; but it should not
          be so. The natural seed were cut off because they had no faith, let
          not those who are grafted in, think to do without it. It is by faith
          that you are a son at all. You disprove your pedigree if you tolerate
          unbelief. Oh! let nobody find fault with Abraham through you, and
          surely they may do so if they find you staggering. That staggering is
          a shocking business: staggering at God's promises is terrible. Abraham
          staggered not at the promise through unbelief. May we never dishonour
          the right noble grace of faith, but so believe that all men may know
          Abraham's God to be our God. O for abounding spiritual life, for the
          God of Abraham is not the God of the dead but of the living; and we
          can only live unto God by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, because we are the seed of Abraham, the apostle declares
          that the blessing of Abraham has come upon us also. I pray that all
          the friends and labourers in our Missionary Society may grasp the
          blessing of Abraham. What is it? It is a covenant favour that belongs
          to all who are the servants of God by faith. Here is the substance of
          it: "Surely blessing, I will bless thee, and in multiplying, I will
          multiply thee." That is the grand old covenant promise and it belongs
          to the church. Note that the blessing is attended with multiplying.
          Some friends are afraid of statistics which represent the increase of
          the churches; I am far more afraid of those statistics which will show
          that we do not increase as we could wish. The blessing of the church
          is the increase of the church. The two go together: "Blessing, I will
          bless thee, and in multiplying, I will multiply thee." How much are
          Christians to be multiplied in the world? At the present moment we do
          not seem to be increasing as fast as the population. I am afraid that
          the number of converted persons relatively to the population is
          scarcely as great as it was thirty years ago; we long to be multiplied
          at a very different rate from this -- and we shall be if we have faith
          in our God. Hear ye the covenant word: "Look now toward heaven, and
          tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him,
          So shall thy seed be. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the
          earth be blessed." These are lines from the covenant, which is sure to
          all the seed and can never be broken. We have been called and blessed,
          and it is of necessity that we increase also. We are bound to
          increase; we are destined to overrun the nations; the Hittites, the
          Hivites, the Amorites, of Popery, Mahometanism, and Idolatry are in
          the land, but their false systems are utterly to perish. Jesus at the
          head of his people shall drive them out -- I mean not the men, but
          their evil beliefs. They may take notice to quit, for he is coming
          before whom all men must bow. O that ere he himself shall appear his
          spiritual presence in the midst of his church might suffice for
          victory, that all mankind might call him blessed. We are bound to
          increase, till the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for
          us, and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose. Upon the
          church in her vigour shall yet descend the blessings of the tribes of
          Joseph. "His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
          are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people
          together to the ends of the earth." The success of truth is the battle
          of the Lord, and the increase of his church is according to his own
          promise, therefore in quietness we may possess our souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Last of all consider for a minute OUR POSITION BEFORE ABRAHAM'S
          GOD. Do not let anything that I have said about Abraham for a moment
          take your mind off from the Lord himself, because the pith of it all
          lies here, -- "I called him alone." Look to Abraham, but only as to
          the rock from which the Lord quarried his people:" your main thought
          must be Jehovah himself. "I, I called him alone, and blessed him." "I
          the Lord do all these things." Look unto the everlasting God who doeth
          great wonders, and stay yourselves upon him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us joyfully recollect that the Lord our God has not changed, nay,
          not in one jot or tittle. He is "the same yesterday, to-day, and for
          ever." There is so far a change in the revelation of him, that it is
          brighter now in the person of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, than
          it could have been through seer and vision; but that should be a
          motive for increased faith. "His arm is not shortened that he cannot
          save, neither is his ear heavy that he cannot hear." This God of
          Abraham is still almighty, and still in the midst of the covenanted
          ones. If the ages that have passed over his awful brow could wrinkle
          it and his strength could decay, then might we also decline in our
          confidence; but it is not so. He fainteth not, neither is weary. Our
          behaviour towards him, therefore, should resemble that of Abraham; and
          especially, representing, as we do many of us, the churches of Jesus
          Christ as ministers or deacons, we must never dishonour the Lord by
          unbelief. Doubt everything but God. Let God be true and every man a
          liar. This the everlasting decree which none can change, -- Christ
          must reign; he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be
          satisfied; the kings of the earth must bow before him. Do not doubt
          it, for God hath sworn by his own life that all flesh shall see his
          glory. Here is the grand argument for strong faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice next that the covenant of God has not changed. God hath not
          recalled his words, nor taken a pen and struck out his promises from
          the record. Read the covenant words, and write them upon the doorposts
          of your mission-house, "In blessing I will bless thee, and in
          multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and
          as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and in thy seed shall all the
          nations of the earth be blessed." This is the covenant with the one
          spiritual seed of Abraham, that is the marrow of it, and it has never
          been revoked. As I have said before, we read it now in clearer light,
          and understand better the fullness of its provisions, but the covenant
          is not disannulled. Let us go to God with any one promise of it, and
          we can say to him, "This is thy promise in Christ Jesus; and thou hast
          not spoken in secret in a dark place and withdrawn thy word and said
          to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye my face in vain." Such pleading will
          prevail. He will never run back from his word. Has he said, and will
          he not do it? Therefore let us cry, "Remember thy word unto thy
          servant upon which thou hast caused me to hope."
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is this also to be added, that this work which we desire the
          Lord to do is in some respects even less than that which he has done
          with Abraham. What ask we? Not that he should begin with one man to
          build up a nation, or create a church? No, but that Zion being
          builded, he should comfort her, and cause her waste places to rejoice.
          The field is the world, and the seed is ready for the sowing. The
          gospel is in the hands of those who have the best means of spreading
          it. Everything is ready for its ultimate triumph. The train is laid;
          we only need the heavenly fire to touch it, and the deed is
          accomplished. O that the work of the Lord may be speedily done; that
          the Lord may carry on his work of righteousness and make a short work
          in the earth. I say that if God has done this greater thing, if he has
          excavated a nation from the quarry of Abraham, we may well expect the
          self-same God to keep his covenant, to multiply his church, and build
          her up after the similitude of a palace. The time to favour Zion, even
          the set time, has come. Beside that; we have been already visited by
          God as Abraham had not been when first he was called. Abraham had not
          known the Lord till he called him, but our Sion is familiar with God,
          for she is the city of the great king. He dwelleth in our midst by his
          Holy Spirit, and holy hymn and prayer rise every day from the
          multitudes that fear him. The Lord hath redeemed, and justified, and
          saved his people, and surely we may look to him to refresh and revive
          his heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          What marvellous things hath God done on the face of the earth since
          Abraham's days! -- the stupendous marvel of incarnation, the height
          and depth of which none of us can measure; the wondrous work of
          redemption, the highest, grandest, divinest achievement of the Deity
          -- all this is done; what may we not expect after this? You know more
          of God than Abraham could know; I beseech you then, trust him, at
          least up to the level of the patriarch. How shall we forge an excuse
          if we do not? What can excuse us if we distrust so glorious a God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, it remains for me only to add this practical word. Let us
          throw ourselves more and more upon our God. If you have any work
          appointed you of the Lord, and it is within the compass of your
          strength, shame upon you if you do not perform it at once; but if it
          be beyond you, herein will God be glorified if you do it by his power.
          If there remaineth no might, wit, or wisdom in you, if you are deeply
          conscious of your weakness you are by this experience made the more
          fit to be used of the Lord, for when we are weak then are we strong.
          If you have confidence in God all things are possible to him that
          believeth. Oh, when will the church cast herself upon her God as men
          throw themselves into the stream when they mean to swim? They seek no
          longer for foothold, their foot leaves the spot whereon it rested, and
          they throw themselves trustfully upon the wave. The everlasting ocean
          of love and power is ready to upbear us: we shall swim gallantly to
          shore if we will but trust this blessed sea of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us begin to believe God and then let us act in daily life as if we
          believed him. The just shall live by faith. Some people have a faith
          which is for show, a Sunday faith, faith that cannot bear the wear and
          tear of every day life; varnished and gilded, but with no pure metal
          in it. The faith of Abraham could lead strings of camels and flocks of
          sheep away from Haran to Canaan. His was the faith which could drive
          the tent-pin into a foreign soil, or roll up the canvas and seek
          another unknown halting place. The faith of Abraham is a faith that
          saith to wayfaring men, "Turn in, and I will get you a little water
          and wash your feet." It is a practical, active, living, week-day,
          everyday faith. I will speak very broadly and plainly, and say we need
          a bread-and-cheese faith, that is to say, a faith which believes that
          God who feeds the ravens will send us our daily bread; a faith which
          believes that the heavenly Father who clothes the lilies will much
          more clothe his children; the faith that can believe God about the
          things that are actually around it, and that does not live in the
          region of fiction. See how God blessed Abraham with flocks and herds,
          and everything temporal as well as spiritual, because he walked in
          reference to these things along the line of faith; gave Lot his choice
          of pasturage, refused the offer of the king of Sodom, and resolutely
          paid the children of Heth the full price for the cave and the field.
          If we walk by faith in business life God may not in every case bless
          us with abundance of temporal mercies, but assuredly we shall be
          blessed. He may send us adversity, and poverty, but in these things
          faith is more than conqueror, glorying in tribulations also.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Lord's work of evangelising the world you must have a
          downright, practical faith; not a faith that will sing when the organ
          begins to play, and then be so busy fumbling the hymn paper as to
          forget the collection: not the faith of those who boast of Carey, and
          Marshman, and Knibb, but whose own names never appear in the
          subscription list for a single shilling: not a faith which sings --
        </p>
        <p>"Fly abroad thou mighty Gospel."</p>
        <p>but never lends a bit of down to make a feather for its wings.</p>
        <p>
          Let us hear the scripture, as it says, "Hearken! "If you have faith as
          a grain of mustard seed, "Hearken!" for you may hear the Sabbath bells
          ringing in the everlasting peace, and angel songs welcoming the reign
          of grace over all nations. Let the ears of deaf unbelief be unstopped,
          for the whole earth echoes with the praises of the Lord. Say not that
          the day is distant. Hearken! Let faith be the listener, and she will
          hear across the ages which divide us from the gladsome period. Then
          shall you listen all day and all night long for many a year, but never
          hear the roll of drum or roar of cannon. Hearken! Ye shall hear from
          the islands of the sea, and from the once benighted continents, psalms
          and hymns, and holy songs, ascending unto the one Jehovah and to his
          Christ. Hearken! for ears were never gladdened with sweeter music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then look! till you see the temples of false gods crumbling into dust.
          See how the shrines are tottering, and the idols breaking as though
          smitten with a rod of iron. Mohammed's crescent wanes, never to wax
          again; and she, of the Seven Hills, is hated of the kings, and they
          burn her with fire. "Come, behold the works of the Lord, what
          desolations he hath made in the earth! "Thy right hand, O Lord, hath
          dashed in pieces the enemy. They fall! They fall! They are as the
          slain. The day breaketh, and the shadows flee away. O ye watchers that
          look for the dawning, fall not asleep through sorrowful weariness. The
          morning cometh. It shall not tarry. Do you doubt it? Know ye not that
          the Lord reigneth? Is he not the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord
          mighty in battle. "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all
          flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
          it." If you doubt it, dissolve your Missionary Society, and do not
          pretend to do a work in which you have no faith; but if you believe in
          the triumph of God's work, and that you are called to it, behave
          worthily to so divine an enterprise. God do so to you as you deal with
          him in this matter. Amen.<br />
