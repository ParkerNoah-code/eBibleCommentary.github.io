          1. Let us now look at the inconsistent opinions of those heretics (for
          there are some two or three of them), how they do not agree in
          treating the same points, but alike, in things and names, set forth
          opinions mutually discordant. The first of them, Valentinus, who
          adapted the principles of the heresy called "Gnostic" to the peculiar
          character of his own school, taught as follows: He maintained that
          there is a certain Dyad (twofold being), who is inexpressible by any
          name, of whom one part should be called Arrhetus (unspeakable), and
          the other Sige (silence). But of this Dyad a second was produced, one
          part of whom he names Pater, and the other Aletheia. From this Tetrad,
          again, arose Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. These constitute
          the primary Ogdoad. He next states that from Logos and Zoe ten powers
          were produced, as we have before mentioned. But from Anthropos and
          Ecclesia proceeded twelve, one of which separating from the rest, and
          falling from its original condition, produced the rest of the
          universe. He also supposed two beings of the name of Horos, the one of
          whom has his place between Bythus and the rest of the Pleroma, and
          divides the created Æons from the uncreated Father, while the other
          separates their mother from the Pleroma. Christ also was not produced
          from the Æons within the Pleroma, but was brought forth by the mother
          who had been excluded from it, in virtue of her remembrance of better
          things, but not without a kind of shadow. He, indeed, as being
          masculine, having severed the shadow from himself, returned to the
          Pleroma; but his mother being left with the shadow, and deprived of
          her spiritual substance, brought forth another son, namely, the
          Demiurge, whom he also styles the supreme ruler of all those things
          which are subject to him. He also asserts that, along with the
          Demiurge, there was produced a left-hand power, in which particular he
          agrees with those falsely called Gnostics, of whom to we have yet to
          speak. Sometimes, again, he maintains that Jesus was produced from him
          who was separated from their mother, and united to the rest, that is,
          from Theletus, sometimes as springing from him who returned into the
          Pleroma, that is, from Christ; and at other times still as derived
          from Anthropos and Ecclesia. And he declares that the Holy Spirit was
          produced by Aletheia for the inspection and fructification of the
          Æons, by entering invisibly into them, and that, in this way, the Æons
          brought forth the plants of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Secundus again affirms that the primary Ogdoad consists of a right
          hand and a left hand Tetrad, and teaches that the one of these is
          called light, and the other darkness. But he maintains that the power
          which separated from the rest, and fell away, did not proceed directly
          from the thirty Æons, but from their fruits.
        </p>

          3. There is another, who is a renowned teacher among them, and who,
          struggling to reach something more sublime, and to attain to a kind of
          higher knowledge, has explained the primary Tetrad as follows: There
          is [he says] a certain Proarche who existed before all things,
          surpassing all thought, speech, and nomenclature, whom I call Monotes
          (unity). Together with this Monotes there exists a power, which again
          I term Henotes (oneness). This Henotes and Monotes, being one,
          produced, yet not so as to bring forth [apart from themselves, as an
          emanation] the beginning of all things, an intelligent, unbegotten,
          and invisible being, which beginning language terms "Monad." With this
          Monad there co-exists a power of the same essence, which again I term
          Hen (One). These powers then -- Monotes, and Henotes, and Monas, and
          Hen -- produced the remaining company of the Æons.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Iu, Iu! Pheu, Pheu! -- for well may we utter these tragic
          exclamations at such a pitch of audacity in the coining of names as he
          has displayed without a blush, in devising a nomenclature for his
          system of falsehood. For when he declares: There is a certain Proarche
          before all things, surpassing all thought, whom I call Monotes; and
          again, with this Monotes there co-exists a power which I also call
          Henotes, -- it is most manifest that he confesses the things which
          have been said to be his own invention, and that he himself has given
          names to his scheme of things, which had never been previously
          suggested by any other. It is manifest also, that he himself is the
          one who has had sufficient audacity to coin these names; so that,
          unless he had appeared in the world, the truth would still have been
          destitute of a name. But, in that case, nothing hinders any other, in
          dealing with the same subject, to affix names after such a fashion as
          the following: There is a certain Proarche, royal, surpassing all
          thought, a power existing before every other substance, and extended
          into space in every direction. But along with it there exists a power
          which I term a Gourd; and along with this Gourd there exists a power
          which again I term Utter-Emptiness. This Gourd and Emptiness, since
          they are one, produced (and yet did not simply produce, so as to be
          apart from themselves) a fruit, everywhere visible, eatable, and
          delicious, which fruit-language calls a Cucumber. Along with this
          Cucumber exists a power of the same essence, which again I call a
          Melon. These powers, the Gourd, Utter-Emptiness, the Cucumber, and the
          Melon, brought forth the remaining multitude of the delirious melons
          of Valentinus. For if it is fitting that that language which is used
          respecting the universe be transformed to the primary Tetrad, and if
          any one may assign names at his pleasure, who shall prevent us from
          adopting these names, as being much more credible [than the others],
          as well as in general use, and understood by all?
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Others still, however, have called their primary and first-begotten
          Ogdoad by the following names: first, Proarche; then Anennoetos;
          thirdly, Arrhetos; and fourthly, Aoratos. Then, from the first,
          Proarche, there was produced, in the first and fifth place, Arche;
          from Anennoetos, in the second and sixth place, Acataleptos; from
          Arrhetos, in the third and seventh place, Anonomastos; and from
          Aoratos, in the fourth and eighth place, Agennetos. This is the
          Pleroma of the first Ogdoad. They maintain that these powers were
          anterior to Bythus and Sige, that they may appear more perfect than
          the perfect, and more knowing than the very Gnostics! To these persons
          one may justly exclaim: "O ye trifling sophists!" since, even
          respecting Bythus himself, there are among them many and discordant
          opinions. For some declare him to be without a consort, and neither
          male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while others affirm him
          to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of a
          hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus
          may be formed the first conjunction.<br />
