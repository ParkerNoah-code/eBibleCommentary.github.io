          39. He spread out a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light
          during the night.40. He asked, and he brought quails, and filled them
          with the bread of heaven.41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed
          out; they ran in the dry places like a river.42. For he remembered his
          holy promise, which he had spoken to Abraham his servant.43. And he
          brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.

          39. He spread out a cloud for a covering The Psalmist enumerates
          certain miracles by which God continued his grace towards his people
          in the wilderness. This order is worthy of notice; for it was no small
          confirmation which was added to that incomparable work of redemption,
          when God ceased not to show himself the guide of their journey.
          Accordingly, after they had passed through the Red Sea, he spread a
          cloud over them by day to protect them from the heat of the sun; and
          during the night, he gave them light by a pillar of fire, that even in
          the midst of the darkness they might have a bright token of his
          presence. This continued display of his goodness was surely an
          unquestionable proof of his perpetual love, an open demonstration that
          he had adopted the children of Abraham, to foster them under his
          protection even to the end. What follows concerning quails, is
          introduced for a different purpose than that for which reference is
          made to the same fact in Psalm 78:26. In that passage, God's bringing
          in an abundance of quails is ascribed rather to his wrath than to his
          beneficence, that the people might satiate the flesh; and we have seen
          in the exposition of that place, that this is mentioned as a matter of
          reproach to them. But in the text before us, passing over their
          ingratitude, the prophet celebrates the unremitting exercise of the
          divine loving-kindness towards them. Some, however, may be rather
          inclined to take the word ask in a bad sense, because the people
          besought not God with humility, but through their impatience proceeded
          at once to murmuring, or rather arrogantly spake against him. Thus
          taken, the passage, by way of amplification, would mean that God,
          departing from his own right, humoured even their unhallowed lust. As,
          however, their fault is not here mentioned, let us rest in that
          meaning which is the most simple, namely, that the blessings by which
          God ratified the redemption which he had wrought are here clustered
          together. It next follows, that they were filled with the bread of
          heaven This appellation, as we have seen elsewhere, is given to the
          manna by way of eminence. The natural way in which the food which we
          eat is obtained is from the ground; but God then opened his hand more
          widely to the Jews, and fed them even from heaven. As it was not
          enough for them to be refreshed with food when they were hungry,
          unless they were also supplied with drink, it is added, that the rock
          was opened, and that the waters flowed from it through the dry places,
          or the desert.

          42. For he remembered his holy promise The Psalmist again mentions the
          cause why God dealt so graciously with that people, and sustained them
          so tenderly, namely, that he might fulfill his promise; for he had
          entered into a covenant with Abraham, engaging to be the God of his
          seed. Nor did the prophets without cause teach so carefully as we find
          them doing, that the free covenant is the fountain whence the
          deliverance, and the continual welfare of the people flowed. Thereby
          the grace of God became better known, since what took place, so far
          from happening upon the sudden, and without anticipation, was only the
          fulfillment of what he had promised four hundred years before. God
          then, for ages previous to this, gave the light of his word of
          promise, that his grace and truth might be brought the more distinctly
          into view. For this reason the prophet again repeats, that God was not
          led from some new cause to deliver his people, but that his design in
          doing so was to prove the faithfulness of his covenant, and to give it
          effect; just as if a man should dig up from the ground a treasure
          which he had buried in it. Nor is it to be doubted, that the prophet
          aimed at leading the faith of his countrymen still farther, -- that
          his object was that their posterity might be persuaded beyond all
          doubt, that as God had then proved, in the experience of that
          generation, the sure and substantial truth of his promise delivered
          many hundred years before, so he would not be to them otherwise than
          their fathers had found him to be in times past. Accordingly, he
          signalises this promise by the epithet, holy, intimating, that after
          the death of Abraham it retained its virtue and efficacy unimpaired.
          God had spoken it to Abraham; but the force of the covenant died not
          with him. God continued to show himself faithful towards the posterity
          of the patriarch.

          43. And he brought forth his people with joy The prophet makes mention
          of joy and gladness, the more highly to magnify the greatness of God's
          grace. It was no small matter, that at the very time when the
          Egyptians were afflicted by a severe and dreadful plague, -- when the
          whole kingdom was full of weeping and howling, -- and when in almost
          every house there was a dead body, -- the people who a little before
          were groaning in great distress, or rather lay almost dead, went forth
          with joyful hearts. By the appellation the chosen of God, they are
          reminded, that his favor was not thus exercised towards them on
          account of their own merits, or on account of the worth of their race,
          but because he had adopted them, that men having nothing left them in
          which to vaunt themselves might learn to glory in God alone.<br />
