        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.320)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, March 25th, 1860, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
          content." -- Philippians 4:11.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE APOSTLE Paul was a very learned man, but not the least among his
          manifold acquisitions in science was this -- he had learned to be
          content. Such learning is far better than much that is acquired in the
          schools. Their learning may look studiously back on the past, but too
          often those who cull the relics of antiquity with enthusiasm, are
          thoughtless about the present, and neglect the practical duties of
          daily life. Their learning may open up dead languages to those who
          will never derive any living benefit from them. Far better the
          learning of the apostle. It was a thing of ever-present utility, and
          alike serviceable for all generations, one of the rarest, but one of
          the most desirable accomplishments. I put the senior wrangler, and the
          most learned of our Cambridge men in the lowest form, compared with
          this learned apostle; for this surely is the highest degree in
          humanities to which a man can possibly attain, to have learned in
          whatsoever state he is, to be content. You will see at once from
          reading the text, upon the very surface, that contentment in all
          states is not a natural propensity of man. Ill weeds grow apace;
          covetousness, discontent, and murmuring, are as natural to man as
          thorns are to the soil. You have no need to sow thistles and brambles;
          they come up naturally enough, because they are indigenous to earth,
          upon which rests the curse; so you have no need to teach men to
          complain, they complain fast enough without any education. But the
          precious things of the earth must be cultivated. If we would have
          wheat, we must plough and sow; if we want flowers, there must be the
          garden, and all the gardener's care. Now, contentment is one of the
          flowers of heaven, and if we would have it, it must be cultivated. It
          will not grow in us by nature; it is the new nature alone that can
          produce it, and even then we must be specially careful and watchful
          that we maintain and cultivate the grace which God has sown in it.
          Paul says, "I have learned to be content;" as much as to say he did
          not know how at one time. It cost him some pains to attain to the
          mystery of that great truth. No doubt he sometimes thought he had
          learned, and then broke down. Frequently too, like boys at school, he
          had his knuckles rapped; frequently he found that it was not easy
          learning this task, and when at last he had attained unto it, and
          could say, "I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
          content," he was an old grey-headed man upon the borders of the grave,
          a poor prisoner shut up in Nero's dungeon at Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          We, my brethren, might well be willing to endure Paul's infirmities,
          and share the cold dungeon with him, if we too might by any means
          attain unto such a degree of contentment. Do not indulge, any of you,
          the silly notion that you can be contented without learning, or learn
          without discipline. It is not a power that may be exercised naturally,
          but a science to be acquired gradually. The very words of the next
          text might suggest this, even if we did not know it from experience.
          We need not be taught to murmur, but we must be taught to acquiesce in
          the will and good pleasure of the Lord our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the apostle had uttered these words, he immediately gave a
          commentary upon them. Read the 12th verse, "I know both how to be
          abased, and I know how to abound; everywhere and in all things I am
          instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to
          suffer need."
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice first, that the apostle said he knew how to be abased. A
          wonderful knowledge this. When all men honour us, then we may very
          well be content; but when the finger of scorn is pointed, at us, when
          our character is held in ill repute, and men hiss us by the wayside,
          it requires much gospel knowledge to be able to endure that with
          patience and with cheerfulness. When we are increasing, and growing in
          rank, and honour, and human esteem, it is easy work to be contented;
          but when we have to say with John the Baptist, "I must decrease," or
          when we see some other servant advanced to our place, and another man
          bearing the palm we all had longed to hold, it is not easy to sit
          still, and without an envious feeling cry with Moses, "Would to God
          that all the Lord's servants were prophets." To hear another man
          praised at your own expense, to find your own virtues made as a foil
          to set forth the superior excellence of some new rival -- this, I say,
          is beyond human nature, to be able to bear it with joy and
          thankfulness, and to bless God. There must be something noble in the
          heart of the man who is able to lay all his honours down as willingly
          as he took them up, when he can as cheerfully submit himself to Christ
          to humble him, as to lift him up and seat him upon a throne. And yet,
          my brethren, we have not any one of us learned what the apostle knew,
          if we are not as ready to glorify Christ by shame, by ignominy and by
          reproach, as by honour and by esteem among men. We must be ready to
          give up everything for him. We must be willing to go downwards, in
          order that Christ's name may ascend upwards, and be the better known
          and glorified among men. "I know how to be abased," says the apostle.
        </p>
        <p>
          His second piece of knowledge is equally valuable, "I know how to
          abound." There are a great many men that know a little how to be
          abased, that do not know at all how to abound. When they are put down
          in the pit with Joseph, they look up and see the starry promise, and
          the hope for an escape. But when they are put on the top of a
          pinnacle, their heads grow dizzy, and they are ready to fall. When
          they were poor they used to battle it, as one of our great national
          poets has said --
        </p>
        <p>"Yet many things, impossible to thought,</p>
        <p>Have been by Need to full perfection brought.</p>
        <p>The daring of the soul proceeds from thence,</p>
        <p>Sharpness of Wit, and active Diligence;</p>
        <p>Prudence at once and Fortitude it gives;</p>
        <p>And, if in patience taken, mends our lives."</p>
        <p>
          But mark the same men after success has crowned their struggles. Their
          troubles are over; they are rich and increased with goods. And have
          you not often seen a man who has sprung up from nothing to wealth, how
          purse-proud he becomes, how vain, how intolerant? Nobody would have
          thought that man ever kept a shop; you would not believe that man at
          any time ever used to sell a pound of candles, would you? He is so
          great in his own eyes, that one would have thought the blood of all
          the Caesars must flow in his veins. He does not know his old
          acquaintances. The familiar friend of other days he now passes by with
          scarce a nod of recognition. The man does not know how to abound; he
          has grown proud; he is exalted above measure. There have been men who
          have been lifted up for a season to popularity in the Church. They
          have preached successfully, and done some mighty work. For this the
          people have honoured them, and rightly so. But then they have become
          tyrants; they have lusted after authority; they have looked down
          contemptuously upon everybody else, as if other men were small
          pigmies, and they were huge giants. Their conduct has been
          intolerable, and they have soon been cast down from their high places,
          because they did not know how to abound. There was once a square piece
          of paper put up into George Whitfield's pulpit, by way of a notice, to
          this effect: -- "A young man who has lately inherited a large fortune,
          requests the prayers of the congregation." Right well was the prayer
          asked, for when we go up the hill we need prayer that we may be kept
          steady. Going down the hill of fortune there is not half the fear of
          stumbling. The Christian far oftener disgraces his profession in
          prosperity than when he is being abased. There is another danger --
          the danger of growing worldly. When a man finds that his wealth
          increases, it is wonderful how gold will stick to the fingers. The man
          who had just enough, thought if he had more than he required he would
          be exceedingly liberal. With a shilling purse he had a guinea heart,
          but now with a guinea purse he has a shilling heart. He finds that the
          money adheres, and he cannot get it off. You have heard of the spider
          that is called a "money spinner," I do not know why it is called so,
          except that it is one of the sort of spiders you cannot get off your
          fingers; it gets on one hand, then on the other hand, then on your
          sleeve; it is here and there; you cannot get rid of it unless you
          crush it outright: so it is with many who abound. Gold is a good thing
          when put to use -- the strength, the sinews of commerce and of charity
          -- but it is a bad thing in the heart, and begets "foul-cankering
          rust." Gold is a good thing to stand on, but a bad thing to have about
          one's loins, or over one's head. It matters not, though it be precious
          earth with which a man is buried alive. Oh, how many Christians have
          there been who seemed as if they were destroyed by their wealth! What
          leanness of soul and neglect of spiritual things have been brought on
          through the very mercies and bounties of God! Yet this is not a matter
          of necessity, for the apostle Paul tells us that he knew how to
          abound. When he had much, he knew how to use it. He had asked of God
          that he might be kept humble -- that when he had a full sail he might
          have plenty of ballast -- that when his cup ran over he might not let
          it run to waste -- that in his time of plenty he might be ready to
          give to those that needed -- and that as a faithful steward he might
          hold all he had at the disposal of his Lord. This is divine learning.
          "I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound." The apostle
          goes on to say, "everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to
          be full and to be hungry." It is a divine lesson, let me say, to know
          how to be full; for the Israelites were full once, and while the flesh
          was yet in heir mouth the wrath of God came upon them. And there have
          been many that have asked for mercies, that they might satisfy their
          own heart's lust; as it is written, "the people sat down to eat and
          drink, and rose up to play." Fulness of bread has often made fulness
          of blood, and that has brought on wantonness of spirit. When men have
          too much of God's mercies -- strange that we should have to say this,
          and yet it is a great fact -- when men have much of God's providential
          mercies, it often happens that they have but little of God's grace,
          and little gratitude for the bounties they have received. They are
          full, and they forget God; satisfied with earth, they are content to
          do without heaven. Rest assured, my dear hearers, it is harder to know
          how to be full than it is to know how to be hungry. To know how to be
          hungry is a sharp lesson, but to know how to be full is the harder
          lesson after all. So desperate is the tendency of human nature to
          pride and forgetfulness of God! As soon as ever we have a double stock
          of manna, and begin to hoard it, it breeds worms and becomes a stench
          in the nostrils of God. Take care that you ask in your prayers that
          God would teach you how to be full.
        </p>
        <p>
          The apostle knew still further how to experience the two extremes of
          fulness and hunger. What a trial that is! To have one day a path
          strewn with mercies, and the next day to find the soil beneath you
          barren of ever comfort. I can readily imagine the poor man being
          contented in his poverty, for he has been inured to it. He is like a
          bird that has been born in a cage, and does not know what liberty
          means. But for a man who has had much of this world's goods, and thus
          has been full, to be brought to absolute penury, he is like the bird
          that once soared on highest wing but is now encaged. Those poor larks
          you sometimes see in the shops, always seem as if they would be
          looking up, and they are constantly pecking at the wires, fluttering
          their wings, and wanting to fly away. So will it be with you unless
          grace prevent it. If you have been rich and are brought down to be
          poor, you will find it hard to know "how to be hungry." Indeed, my
          brethren, it must be a sharp lesson. We complain sometimes of the
          poor, that they murmur. Ah! We should murmur a great deal more than
          they do, if their lot fell to us. To sit down at the table, where
          there is nothing to eat, and five or six little children crying for
          bread, were enough to break the father's heart. Or for the mother,
          when her husband has been carried to the tomb, to gaze round on the
          gloom-stricken home, press her new-born infant to her bosom, and look
          upon the others, with widowed heart remembering that they are without
          a father to seek their livelihood. Oh! It must need much grace to know
          how to be hungry. And for the man who has lost a situation, and has
          been walking all over London -- perhaps a thousand miles -- to get a
          place, and he cannot get one, to come home, and know that when he
          faces his wife, her first question will be "Have you brought home any
          bread?" "Have you found anything to do?" and to have to tell her "No;
          there have been no doors open to me." It is hard to prove hunger, and
          bear it patiently. I have had to admire, and look with a sort of
          reverence on some of the members of this Church, when I have happened
          to hear afterwards of their privations. They would not tell anyone,
          and they would not come to me; but they endured their pangs in secret,
          struggled heroically through all their difficulties and dangers, and
          came out more than conquerors. Ah! Brothers and sisters, it looks an
          easy lesson when you come to see it in a book, but it is not quite so
          easy when you come to put it in practice. It is hard to know how to be
          full, but it is a sharp thing to know how to be hungry. Our apostle
          had learned both -- both how to abound, and to suffer need."
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus expounded to you the apostle Paul's own commentary, in
          enlarging upon the words of my text, let me return to the passage
          itself. You may now ask by what course of study did he acquire this
          peaceful frame of mind? And of one thing we may be quite certain, it
          was by no stoic process of self-government, but simply and exclusively
          by faith in the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may easily imagine a nobleman whose home is the abode of luxury,
          travelling through foreign parts for purposes of scientific discovery,
          or going forth to command some military expedition in the service of
          his country. In either case he may be well content with his fare, and
          feel that there is nothing to repine at. And why? Because he had no
          right to expect anything better; not because it bore any comparison
          with his rank, his fortune, or his social position at home. So our
          apostle. He had said "Our conversation or citizenship is in heaven."
          Travelling through earth as a pilgrim and stranger he was content to
          take travellers fare. Or entering the battle field, he had no ground
          of complaint that perils and distresses should sometimes encircle his
          path, while at other times a truce gave him some peaceful and pleasing
          intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, adverting to the text, you will notice that the word "herewith"
          is written in italics. If therefore we do not omit it, we need not lay
          upon it a heavy stress in the interpretation. There is nothing in
          hunger, or thirst, or nakedness, or peril, to invite our contentment.
          If we are content under such circumstances, it must be from higher
          motives than our condition itself affords. Hunger is a sharp thorn
          when in the hands of stern necessity. But hunger may be voluntarily
          endured for many an hour when conscience makes a man willing to fast.
          Reproach may have a bitter fang, but it can be bravely endured, when I
          am animated by a sense of the justice of my cause. Now Paul counted
          that all the ills which befell him were just incident to the service
          of his Lord. So for the love he bear to the name of Jesus, the
          hardships of servitude or self-mortification sat lightly on his
          shoulders, and were brooked cheerily by his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet a third reason why Paul was content, I will illustrate
          it. Many an old veteran takes great pleasure in recounting the dangers
          and sufferings of his past life. He looks back with more than
          contentment, oftentimes with self-gratulation, upon the terrible
          dangers and distresses of his heroic career. Yet the smile that lights
          his eye, and the pride that sits on his lofty wrinkled brow as he
          recounts his stories, were not there when he was in he midst of the
          scenes he is now describing. It is only since the dangers are past,
          the fears have subsided, and the issue is complete, that his
          enthusiasm has been kindled to a flame. But Paul stood on vantage
          ground here. "In all these things," said he, "we are more than
          conquerors." Witness his voyage toward Rome. When the ship in which he
          sailed was caught and driven before a tempestuous wind; when darkness
          veiled the skies; when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared;
          when hope failed every heart; -- he alone bore up with manly courage.
          And why? The angel of God stood by him, and said, Fear not. His faith
          was predestinarian, and as such, he had as much peaceful contentment
          in his breast while the tribulation lasted as when it had closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I want to commend the lesson of my text very briefly to the
          rich, a little more at length to the poor, and then with sympathy and
          counsel to the sick -- those who are sore-tried in their persons by
          suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, to the RICH. The apostle Paul says, "I have learned, in
          whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content." Now some of you have,
          as far as your circumstances are concerned, all that the heart can
          wish. God has placed you in such a position that you have not to toil
          with your hands, and in the sweat of your face gain a livelihood. You
          will perhaps think that any exhortation to you to be contented is
          needless. Alas! my brethren, a man may be very discontented though he
          be very rich. It is quite as possible for discontent to sit on the
          throne, as it is to sit on a chair -- a poor broken-backed chair in a
          hovel. Remember that a man's contentment is in his mind, not in the
          extent of his possessions. Alexander, with all the world at his feet,
          cries for another world to conquer. He is sorry because there are not
          other countries into which he may carry his victorious arms, and wade
          up to his loins in the blood of his fellow man, to slake the thrist of
          his insatiable ambition. To you who are rich, it is necessary that we
          give the same exhortation as to the poor: "learn to be content." Many
          a rich man who has an estate is not satisfied, because there is a
          little corner-piece of ground that belongs to his neighbour, like
          Naboth's vineyard that the king of Israel needed that he might make a
          garden of herbs hard by his palace. "What matters it," says he,
          "though I have all these acres, unless I can have Naboth's vineyard?"
          Surely a king should have been ashamed to crave that paltry half-acre
          of a poor man's patrimony. But yet so it is; men with vast estates,
          which they are scarcely able to ride over, may have that old
          horse-leech in their hearts, which always cries, "Give, give! More,
          more!" They thought when they had but little, that if they had ten
          thousand pounds it would be enough. They have it: they want twenty
          thousand pounds. When they have that, they still want more. Yes, and
          if you had it, it would be "A trifle more!" So would it continually
          be. As your possessions increased, so would the lust of acquiring
          property increase. We must, then, press upon the rich this
          exhortation: "Learn in your state, therewith to be content."
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, there is another danger that frequently awaits the rich man.
          When he has enough wealth and property, he has not always enough
          honour. If the queen would but make him a justice of the peace for the
          country, how glorious would my lord become! That done, he will never
          be satisfied till he is a knight; and if he were a knight, he would
          never be content until he became a baron; and my lord would never be
          satisfied till he was an earl; nor would he even then be quite content
          unless he could be a duke; nor would he be quite satisfied I trow
          then, unless there were a kingdom for him somewhere. Men are not
          easily satisfied with honour. The world may bow down at a man's feet;
          then he will ask he world to get up and bow again, and so keep on
          bowing for ever, for the lust of honour is insatiate. Man must be
          honoured, and though king Ahasuerus make Haman the first man in the
          empire, yet all this availeth nothing, so long as Mordecai in the gate
          doth not bow down to my lord Haman. Oh! Learn, brethren, in whatever
          state you are, therewith to be content.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here let me speak to the elders and deacons of this church.
          Brethren, learn to be content with the office you hold, not envious of
          any superior honour to exalt yourselves. I turn to myself, I turn to
          the ministry, I turn to all of us in our ranks and degrees in Christ's
          Church; we must be content with the honour, but to content to give it
          all up, knowing that it is but a puff of breath after all. Let us be
          willing to be the servants of the Church, and to serve them for
          nought, if need be even without the reward of their thanks, may we but
          receive at last the right good sentence from the lips of the Lord
          Jesus Christ. We must learn, in whatever state we are, therewith to be
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a little more length I have to counsel the POOR. "I have learned,"
          says the apostle, "in whatever state I am, therewith to be content."
        </p>
        <p>
          A very large number of my present congregation belong to those who
          labour hard, and who, perhaps, without any unkindly reflection, may be
          put down in this catalogue of the poor. They have enough -- barely
          enough, and sometimes they are even reduced to straitness. Now
          remember, my dear friends, you who are poor, there are two sorts of
          poor people in the world. There are the Lord's poor, and there are the
          devil's poor. As for the devil's poor: they become pauperized by their
          own idleness, their own vice, their own extravagance. I have nothing
          to say to them to-night. There is another class, the Lord's poor. They
          are poor through trying providences, poor, but industrious, --
          labouring to find all things honest in the sight of all men, but yet
          they still continue through an inscrutable providence to be numbered
          with the poor and needy. You will excuse me, brothers and sisters, in
          exhorting you to be contented; and yet why should I ask excuse, since
          it is but a part of my office to stir you up to everything that is
          pure and lovely, and of good report? I beseech you, in your humble
          sphere, cultivate contentment. Be not idle. Seek, if you can, by
          superior skill, steady perseverance, and temperate thriftiness, to
          raise your position. Be not so extravagant as to live entirely without
          care or carefulness; for he that provideth not for his own household
          with careful fore-thought, is worse than a heathen man and a publican;
          but at the same time, be contented; and where God has placed you,
          strive to adorn that position, be thankful to him, and bless his name.
          And shall I give you some reasons for so doing?
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, that if you are poor in this world so was your Lord. A
          Christian is a believer who hath fellowship with Christ; but a poor
          Christian hath in his poverty a special vein of fellowship with Christ
          opened up to him. Your Master wore a peasant's garb, and spoke a
          peasant's brogue. His companions were the toiling fishermen. He was
          not one who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared
          sumptuously every day. He knew what it was to be hungry and thirsty,
          nay, he was poorer than you, for he had not where to lay his head. Let
          this console you. Why should a disciple be above his Master, or a
          servant above his Lord? In your poverty, moreover, you are capable of
          communion with Christ. You can say, "Was Christ poor? Now can I
          sympathize with him in his poverty. Was he weary, and did he sit thus
          on the well? I am weary too, and I can have fellowship with Christ in
          that sweat which he wiped from his brow." Some of you brethren cannot
          go the length you can; it were wrong of them to attempt to do it, for
          voluntary poverty is voluntary wickedness. But inasmuch as God hath
          made you poor, you have a facility for walking with Christ, where
          others cannot. You can go with him through all the depths of care and
          woe, and follow him almost into the wilderness of temptation, when you
          are in your straits and difficulties for lack of bread. Let this
          always cheer and comfort you, and make you happy in your poverty,
          because your Lord and Master is able to sympathize as well as to
          succour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permit me to remind you again, that you should be contented, because
          otherwise you will belie your own prayers. You kneel down in the
          morning, and you say, "Thy will be done!" Suppose you get up and want
          your own will, and rebel against the dispensation of your heavenly
          Father, have you not made yourself out to be a hypocrite? The language
          of your prayer is at variance with the feeling of your heart. Let it
          always be sufficient for you to think that you are where God put you.
          Have you not heard the story of the heroic boy on board the burning
          ship? When his father told him to stand in a certain part of the
          vessel, he would not move till his father bade him, but stood still
          when the ship was on fire. Though warned of his danger he held his
          ground. Until his father told him to move, there would he stay. The
          ship was blown up, and he perished in his fidelity. And shall a child
          be more faithful to an earthly parent than we are to our Father, who
          is in heaven? He has ordered everything for our good, and can he be
          forgetful of us? Let us believe that whatever he appoints is best; let
          us choose rather his will than our own. If there were two places, one
          a place of poverty, and another a place of riches and honour, if I
          could have my choice, it should be my privilege to say, "Nevertheless,
          not as I will, but as thou wilt."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reflection suggests itself. If you are poor you should be well
          content with your position, because, depend upon it, it is the fittest
          for you. Unerring wisdom cast your lot. If you were rich, you would
          not have so much grace as you have now. Perhaps God knew, that did he
          not make you poor, he would never get you to heaven at all; and so he
          has kept you where you are, that he may conduct you thither. Suppose
          there is a ship of large tonnage to be brought up a river, and in one
          part of the river there is a shallow, should some one ask, "Why does
          the captain steer his vessel through the deep part of the channel?"
          His answer would be, "Because I should not get it into harbour at all
          if I did not take it by this course." So, it may be, you would remain
          aground and suffer shipwreck, if your Divine Captain did not always
          make you trace the deepest part of the water, and make you go where
          the current ran with the greatest speed. Some plants die if they are
          too much exposed; it may be that you are planted in some sheltered
          part of the garden where you do not get so much sun as you would like,
          but you are put there as a plant of his own righteous planting, that
          you may bring forth fruit unto perfection. Remember this, had any
          other condition been better for you than the one in which you are, God
          would have put you there. You are put by him in the most suitable
          place, and if you had had the picking of your lot half-an-hour
          afterwards, you would have come back and said, "Lord, choose for me,
          for I have not chosen the best after all." You have heard, perhaps,
          the old fable in Aesop, of the men that complained to Jupiter, of
          their burdens, and the god in anger bade them every one get rid of his
          burden, and take the one he would like best. They all came and
          proposed to do so. There was a man who had a lame leg, and he thought
          he could do better if he had a blind eye; the man who had a blind eye
          thought he could do better if he had to bear poverty and not
          blindness, while the man who was poor thought poverty the worst of
          ills; he would not mind taking the sickness of the rich man if he
          could but have his riches. So they all made a change. But the fable
          saith that within an hour they were all back again, asking that they
          might have their own burdens, they found the original burdens so much
          lighter than the one that was taken by their own selection. So would
          you find it. Then be content; you cannot better your lot. Take up your
          cross; you could not have a better trial than you have got; it is the
          best for you; it sifts you the most; it will do you the most good, and
          prove the most effective means of making you perfect in every good
          word and work to the glory of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And surely, my dear brethren, if I need to add another argument why
          you should be content, it were this: whatever your trouble, it is not
          for long; you may have no estate on earth, but you have a large one in
          heaven, and perhaps that estate in heaven will be all the larger by
          reason of the poverty you have had to endure here below. You may have
          scarcely a house to cover your head, but you have a mansion in heaven,
          -- a house not made with hands. Your head may often lie without a
          pillow, but it shall one day wear a crown. Your hands may be blistered
          with toil, but they shall sweep the strings of golden harps. You may
          have to go home often to dinner of herbs, but there you shall eat
          bread in the kingdom of God, and sit down at the marriage supper of
          the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>"The way may be rough, but it cannot be long,</p>
        <p>So we'll smooth it with hope and cheer it with song."</p>
        <p>
          Yet a little while, the painful conflict will be over. Courage,
          comrades, courage, -- glittering robes for conquerors. Courage, my
          brother, courage, thou mayest sooner become rich than thou dreamest
          of; perhaps there is e'en now, but a step between thee and thine
          inheritance. Thou mayest go home, peradventure, shivering in the cold
          March wind; but ere morning dawneth thou mayest be in thy Master's
          bosom. Bear up with thy lot then, bear up with it. Let not the child
          of a king, who has an estate beyond the stars, murmur as others. You
          are not so poor after all, as they are who have no hope; though you
          may seem poor, you are rich. Do not let your poor neighbours see you
          disconsolate, but let them see in you that holy calmness, that sweet
          resignation, that gracious submission, which makes the poor man more
          glorious than he that wears a coronet, and lifts the son of the soil
          up from his rustic habitation, and sets him among the princes of the
          blood-royal of heaven. Be happy, brethren, be satisfied and content.
          God will have you to learn, in whatever state you may be, therewith to
          be content.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now just one or two words to SUFFERERS. All men are born to
          sorrow, but some men are born to a double portion of it. As among
          trees, so among men, there are different classes. The cypress seems to
          have been created specially to stand at the grave's head and be a
          weeper; and there are some men, and some women, that seem to have been
          made on purpose that they might weep. There are the Jeremiahs of our
          race; they do not often know an hour free from pain. Their poor weary
          bodies have dragged along through a miserable life, diseased, perhaps,
          even from their birth, suffering some sorrowful infirmity that will
          not let them know even the gaiety and the frolic of youth. They grow
          up to mourning, and each year's suffering drives its ploughshare
          deeper into their brows, and they are apt -- and who can blame them?
          -- they are apt to murmur, and they say, "Why am I thus? I cannot
          enjoy the pleasures of life as others can; why is it?" "Oh!" says some
          poor sister, "consumption has looked on me; that fell disease has
          blanched my cheek. Why should I have to come, scarcely able to
          breathe, up to the house of God, and after sitting here, exhausted
          with the heat of this crowded sanctuary, to retire to my home, and
          prepare to engage in daily labour much too heavy for me; my very bed
          not yielding me repose, and my nights scared with visions and
          affrighted with dreams? -- why is this?" I say it these brothers and
          sisters mourn, we are not men to blame them, because, when we are
          sick, we brook it ill, and murmur more than they. I do admire
          patience, because I feel myself so incapable of it. When I see a man
          suffering, and suffering bravely, I often feel small in his presence.
          I wonder, yes, I admire and love this man who can bear pain, and say
          so little about it. We who are naturally healthy and strong, when we
          do suffer, we can hardly endure it. Caesar pules like a sick girl, and
          so do some of the strongest when they are brought down; while hose who
          are always enduring suffering bear it like heroes, -- martyrs to pain,
          and yet not uttering a complaint. There was good John Calvin, all his
          life long a victim of sickness; he was a complication of diseases. His
          visage, when he was a young man, as may be judged of from the
          different portraits of him, exhibited the signs of decay; and though
          he lived a long while, he seemed as if he was always going to die
          to-morrow. In the deepest of his agony, suffering from severe spinal
          pains and acute disease, the only cry he was ever known to utter was,
          "Domine usquequo? How long, Lord? How long, Lord?" A more repining
          expression than that he never used. Ah! but we get kicking against the
          pricks, murmuring and complaining. Brothers and sisters, the
          exhortation to you is to be content. Your pains are sharp, yet "his
          strokes are fewer than your crimes, and lighter than your guilt." From
          the pains of hell Christ has delivered you. Why should a living man
          complain? As long as you are out of hell, gratitude may mingle with
          your groans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, remember that all these sufferings are less than his
          sufferings. "Canst thou not watch with thy Lord one hour?" He hangs
          upon the tree with a world's miseries in his bowels; cannot you bear
          these lesser miseries that fall on you? Remember that all these
          chastenings work for your good; they are all making you ready; every
          stroke of your Father's rod is bringing you nearer to perfection. The
          flame doth not hurt thee; it only refines thee, and takes away thy
          dross. Remember too, that thy pain and sickness have been so greatly
          blessed to thee already, that thou never oughtest to rebel. "Before I
          was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept thy word." You have
          seen more of heaven through your sickness, than you ever could have
          seen if you had been well. When we are well, we are like men in a clay
          hut, we cannot see much light; but when disease comes and shakes the
          hut, and dashes down the mud, and makes the wattles in the wall
          tremble, and there is a crevice or two, the sunlight of heaven shines
          through. Sick men can see a great deal more of glory than men do when
          they are in health. This hard heart of ours, when it is undisturbed,
          waxes gross. When the strings of our harp are all unstrung, they make
          better music than when they are best wound up. There are some
          heaven-notes that never come to us but when we are shut up in the
          darkened chamber. Grapes must be pressed before the wine can be
          distilled. Furnace work is necessary to make us of any use in the
          world. We should be just the poorest things that can be, if we did not
          sometimes get sick. Perhaps, you that are frequently tried and
          frequently pained, would have been scarcely worth anything in the
          vineyard of Christ, if it had not been for this trial of your faith.
          You have a sharp filling, but if you had not been well filed, you
          would not have been an instrument fit for the Master's use, you would
          have grown so rusty. If he had kept you always free from suffering,
          you would have been often lacking those sweet cordials which the
          Physician of souls administers to his fainting patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be content then; but I feel as if I hardly must say it, because I am
          not sick myself. When I came to you once, from the chamber of
          suffering, pale, and thin, and sick, and ill, I remember addressing
          you from that text, that was blessed to some far away in America, --
          "If needs be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations." Then I
          think I might very justly have said to you, "In whatsoever state you
          are, be content;" but now that I am not suffering myself, I do not
          feel as if I can say it so boldly as I could then. But nevertheless,
          be it so, brothers and sisters; try if you can and imitate this
          beloved apostle Paul. "I have learned in whatsoever state I am,
          therewith to be content."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I dismiss you there is this one other sentence. You that love
          not Christ, recollect that you are the most miserable people in the
          world. Though you may think yourselves happy, there is no one of us
          that would change places with the best of you. When we are very sick,
          very poor, and on the borders of the grave, if you were to step in and
          say to us "Come, I will change places with you; you shall have my
          gold, and my silver, my riches, and my health," and the like, there is
          not one living Christian that would change places with you. We would
          not stop to deliberate, we would give you at once our answer -- "No,
          go your way, and delight in what you have; but all your treasures are
          transient, they will soon pass away. We will keep our sufferings, and
          you shall keep your gaudy toys." Saints have no hell but what they
          suffer here on earth; sinners will have no heaven but what they have
          here in his poor troublesome world. We have our sufferings here and
          our glory afterwards; you may have your glory here, but you will have
          your sufferings for ever and ever. God grant you new hearts, and right
          spirits, a living faith in a living Jesus, and then I would say to you
          as I have said to the rest -- man, in whatsoever state you are, be
          content.<br />
