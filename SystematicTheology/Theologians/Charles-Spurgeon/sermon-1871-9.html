        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.976)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, February 19th, 1871 by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>

          "And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which
          had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him, Friend, how
          camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was
          speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and
          foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall
          be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are
          chosen." -- Matthew 22:11-14.
        </p>
        <p>
          APPARENTLY the parable of the marriage feast would have been complete
          without this addition, but there was infinite wisdom in appending this
          sequel. This is seen practically in the experience of the church of
          God. Those who are permitted to see large additions to the church will
          find this parable of the wedding garment to be singularly appropriate
          and timely. Whenever there is a revival and many are brought to
          Christ, it seems inevitable that at the same time a proportion of
          unworthy persons should enter the church. However diligent may be the
          oversight there will be pretenders creeping in unawares who have no
          true part or lot in the matter, and hence, when the preacher is most
          earnest for the ingathering of souls to Christ, he needs to couple
          therewith a holy jealousy, lest those who come forward to make a
          profession of faith should be moved by carnal motives, and should not
          really have given their hearts to God. We must use the net to draw in
          the many, but all are not good fishes that are taken therein. On the
          threshing floor of Zion the heap is not all pure wheat, the chaff is
          mingled with the grain, and therefore the winnowing fan is wanted.
          God's furnace is in Zion, and there is good need for it, for the gold
          is yet in the ore and needs to be separated from the dross. Wood, hay,
          and stubble building is quick work, but it is a waste of effort; we
          need continually to examine our materials, and see that we use only
          gold, silver, and precious stones. It is most needful in times of
          religious excitement, to remind men that godliness does not consist in
          profession, but must be proved by inward vitality and outward
          holiness. Everything will have to be tested by a heart-searching God,
          and if, when he comes to search us, we are found wanting, we shall be
          expelled even from the marriage feast itself; for there is a way to
          hell from the very gates of heaven. In a word, it is well for all to
          be reminded that the enemies of the great King are not only outside
          the church, but they are even in it; while a part refuse to come to
          the wedding of his Son, others press into the banquet and are still
          his foes. May God grant that this subject may have a heart-searching
          effect. May it be as the north wind when it blows through the marrow
          of the bones. May it lead us to desire to be searched and tried of
          God, whether we are truly in the faith, or are reprobates in his
          esteem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parable may be discoursed upon under five heads. Here is an enemy
          at the feast; here is the king at the feast; that king becomes the
          judge at the feast; and hence the enemy becomes the criminal at the
          feast; and swiftly is removed by the executioner at the feast.

          He came into the banquet when he was bidden, but he came only in
          appearance, he came not in heart. The banquet was intended for the
          honour of the son, but this man meant not so; he was willing to eat
          the good things, but he intended no respect to the prince. He did not,
          like others, say, "I will not come, for I will not have this man to
          reign over me"; but he said, "I will come, but it shall be in such a
          way that the royal purpose shall not be served, but rather hindered. I
          shall be present as an onlooker, but take no share in the ceremony; I
          will, on the contrary, show that I have no care for the business in
          hand, except so far as it serves my turn." The man came in full
          exercise of self-will and self-love. He resolved to yield no homage,
          but to assert his independent self-sovereignty. He would show the king
          even at his table, where his bounties were so largely dispensed, that
          he was not afraid to affront him. When he came to the door of the
          feast, he found the guests all putting on the garment suitable for the
          marriage banquet. As here, in our own country, at a funeral, each
          mourner is expected to put on the articles of mourning which are
          provided, so at the wedding feast each person was expected to wear the
          bridegroom's favours, the garment which, as a badge, marked him as an
          attendant at the wedding, and as one who rejoiced in it. While others
          cheerfully put on this wedding dress the traitor would not; he
          resolved to defy the rules of the palace, and to insult the king by
          appearing in his own garments. He scorned to wear the livery of
          respectful joy, he preferred to make himself conspicuous by his daring
          insolence. The badge was intended to show that the wearer was a real
          participator in the joy of the feast, and for that very reason he
          would not put it on. He did not acknowledge the king nor the prince,
          nor care one atom about the gladsome event. He had no objection to be
          there, to eat the dainties, or recline upon the seats, and see the
          pomp and the show, but he was only in it, and not of it; he was there
          in body, but not in spirit. Are there not crowds of people whose union
          to the church is nothing better than an insult to God? Custom sways
          them, and not sincere faith. They have no regard to the great Head of
          the church or to the heart-searching God. They treat church membership
          as a trifle, and have no tenderness of heart touching the matter.
          They, in effect, say, "The table of the Lord is contemptible." "Spots
          are they in our feasts, feeding themselves without fear."
        </p>
        <p>
          Many a time the question has been asked: "What was the wedding
          garment?" It is a question which need not be curiously pried into. So
          many answers have been given that I conclude that if our Saviour had
          intended any one specific thing he would have expressed himself more
          plainly, so that we would have been able, without so much theological
          disputing, to have understood what he meant. It seems to me that our
          Lord intended much more than any one thing. The guests were bidden to
          come to the wedding to show their respect to the king and prince; some
          would not come at all, and so showed their sedition; this man came,
          and when he heard the regulation, that a certain garment should be put
          on, comely in appearance and suitable for the occasion, he determined
          that he would not wear it. In this act of rebellion, he went as far in
          opposition as they did who would not come at all, and he went a little
          further, for in the very presence of the guests and of the king he
          dared to declare his disloyalty and contempt. Alas, how many are
          willing enough to receive gospel blessings, but they are still at
          enmity with God and have no delight in the only Begotten Son. Such
          will dare to use the forms of godliness, and yet their hearts are full
          of rebellion against the Lord. The wedding garment represents anything
          which is indispensable to a Christian, but which the unrenewed heart
          is not willing to accept, anything which the Lord ordains to be a
          necessary attendant of salvation, against which selfishness rebels.
          Hence it may be said to be Christ's righteousness imputed to us, for
          alas, many nominal Christians kick against the doctrine of
          justification by the righteousness of the Saviour and set up their own
          self-righteousness in opposition to it. To be found in Christ, not
          having our own righteousness, which is of the law, but having the
          righteousness which is of God by faith, is a very prominent badge of a
          real servant of God, and to refuse it is to manifest opposition to the
          glory of God, and to the name, person, and work of his exalted Son.
          But we might with equal truth say that the wedding dress is a holy
          character, the imparted righteousness which the Holy Spirit works in
          us, and which is equally necessary as a proof of grace. If you
          question such a statement, I would remind you of the dress which
          adorns the saints in heaven. What is said of it? "They have washed
          their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Their robes
          therefore were such as once needed washing; and this could not be said
          in any sense of the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ; that was
          always perfect and spotless. It is clear then that the figure is
          sometimes applied to saints in reference to their personal character.
          Holiness is always present in those who are loyal guests of the great
          King, for "without holiness no man shall see the Lord." Too many
          professors pacify themselves with the idea that they possess imputed
          righteousness, while they are indifferent to the sanctifying work of
          the Spirit. They refuse to put on the garment of obedience, they
          reject the white linen which is the righteousness of saints. They thus
          reveal their self-will, their enmity to God, and their nonsubmission
          to his Son. Such men may talk what they will about justification by
          faith, and salvation by grace, but they are rebels at heart, they have
          not on the wedding dress any more than the self-righteous, whom they
          so eagerly condemn. The fact is, if we wish for the blessings of
          grace, we must in our hearts submit to the rules of grace without
          picking and choosing. It is idle to dispute whether the wedding
          garment is faith or love, as some have done, for all the graces of the
          Spirit and blessings of the covenant go together. No one ever had the
          imputed righteousness of Christ without receiving at the same time a
          measure of the righteousness wrought in us by the Holy Spirit.
          Justification by faith is not contrary to the production of good
          works: God forbid. The faith by which we are justified is the faith
          which produces holiness, and no one is justified by faith which does
          not also sanctify him and deliver him from the love of sin. All the
          essentials of the Christian character may be understood as making up
          the great wedding garment. In one word, we put on Christ, and he is
          "made of God unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
          redemption."
        </p>
        <p>
          The wedding garment is simply mentioned here as being a test of
          loyalty to those who came to the marriage feast, and as a mode by
          which rebellion was avowed and loyalty made apparent. Here was a man
          then who came into the gospel feast, and yet refused to comply with
          the command which related to that feast. He willfully preferred self
          to God, his heart was full of enmity and pride, he despised the gifts
          of grace, he scorned the rule of love, he stood a defiant rebel even
          at the banquet of mercy which his king had spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          His sin lay, first of all, in coming in there at all without the
          wedding garment. If he did not mean to be of one heart with his fellow
          guests and his lord, why did he come? If a man does not intend to
          yield himself up to God's will, why does he profess to be of God's
          church? If a man is not saved by the righteousness of Christ, why does
          he profess to be a believer in Christ? If he will not be obedient to
          Christ's holy will, why does he pretend to be follower of Christ? It
          is a grave mistake for any person to imagine that he can be in the
          church of God to his own advantage unless his heart is renewed, unless
          he means what he declares, and sincerely loves the rule under which he
          professes to put himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intruder's sin was aggravated by the fact that after he had
          unlawfully come into the feast he still continued there without the
          wedding robe. He does not appear to have had any compunction, or to
          have thought of amending his error. Only when the king came in and
          said, "Take him away," had the insolent rebel any idea of removing.
          Had he come in there, as I fear some of you have come into the church,
          under a mistake, thinking that there was no need of the wedding dress,
          when he looked around and saw all other persons wearing it, and
          observed that it was the peculiar mark of a guest, he would have felt
          uneasy and have gone to those who kept the royal wardrobe to get such
          a robe for himself; and then his sin in the matter would not have been
          laid to his charge. But he persisted in remaining where he was, and as
          he was. O my dear hearers, if you have already perpetrated the sin of
          union with the visible church of God without having the prerequisites,
          without being indeed submissive to God in heart and desirous to honour
          Christ, I entreat you, seek what is wanted, seek faith in God, seek a
          new heart, seek holiness of life, seek to become a loyal subject of
          the King, and be not content until you have these things, for the King
          will soon come in: he gives you time as yet, may he also give you
          grace to see to it that, being now where you ought never to have been,
          you may yet make your position a right one by obtaining that which
          will justify you in remaining where you are. The guest in his own
          clothes was a speckled bird amongst that company, it was possible for
          him even then to have become one of them; but he would not, he
          continued to defy the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          This persistence he retained though he probably knew the fate of those
          who had refused to come. He knew that the king had sent forth his
          armies and destroyed those wicked men who had molested his messengers,
          and yet he dared to recline at his ease in the very teeth, and defying
          the terrible power of the monarch. He made his brow as brass and
          hardened his heart as adamant, and forced his way into a position
          where his seditious spirit would be able to display itself
          conspicuously. He said within his soul, "I care nothing for this
          marriage. I will make sport of it; I will intrude myself into that
          feast and show my contempt. I will take the provisions, but the son
          shall have no honour from me, and the king shall not find me bend my
          will to his command." Thus he had the audacity to disport himself as a
          willful rebel at the feast of mercy. Are there any such among you
          here? The tendency will be for those who are not so to begin to
          condemn themselves. I know already one who has said, "I am that guest
          that had not on a wedding garment." She is not that one, for she is
          not even a member of the church, and therefore it cannot concern her;
          but many like her write bitter things against themselves. Another will
          be saying, "I am that one," whereas, if there be one that lives near
          to God and whose desire is to be like Christ, and to be in all things
          conformed to the divine will, he is the man. You who are most
          assuredly right will probably be suspicious that you are not, and you
          who are insincere and have never submitted yourselves to the will of
          God will probably say, "What does it matter? I am doing as well as
          others, I give as much, I attend the means as much, surely there can
          be no cause for concern In me." God grant that you may feel anxiety
          and fear before the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>II. We pass on to the next point -- THE KING AT THE FEAST.</p>
        <p>
          "The king came in to see the guests." What an honour and privilege
          this was to the poor creatures whom his royal munificence had brought
          together! Was it not indeed the chief point of the entire festival'?
          One of our greatest joys is to sing --
        </p>
        <p>The king himself comes near</p>
        <p>And feasts his saints today!</p>
        <p>
          What would church fellowship be if it had not the fellowship of God
          with it? To sit with my dear brethren and rejoice in their love is
          exceedingly delightful; but the best wine is fellowship with the
          Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. The king did not provide the
          banquet and leave his guests to eat by themselves, but he "came in,"
          and into every gospel church gathered according to his command the
          King will come. I am sure the most fervent desire of this church is
          that the King may personally visit us. We trust he is with us, but we
          want him yet more fully to reveal himself. Our cry is, "Come, great
          King, with all thy glorious power, with thy Spirit and with thy
          glorious Son, and manifest thyself to us as thou dost not unto the
          world."
        </p>
        <p>
          When the king came into the banqueting chamber he saw the guests, and
          they also saw him. It was a mutual revelation. Ever sweet is this to
          the saints, that their God looks upon them; his look brings no terror
          to our minds when we are loyal and loving. "Thou God seest me" is
          sweet music. We desire to abide for ever beneath the divine
          inspection, for it is an inspection of unbounded love. He sees our
          faults, it is to remove them; he notes our imperfections, it is to
          cleanse them away. Behold me, O great King, and lift up thine eyes
          upon me, accepting me in the Beloved. What joy it is to us who are
          saved in Christ Jesus that we also can see him! "Through a glass
          darkly," I grant you we behold him, for as yet we are not fit to
          behold the full splendour of his Godhead! but yet how sweetly doth he
          reveal himself to our souls and unveil his eternal love. Then it is
          that the feast is most fully a banquet of wine, when the banner of
          love waves over us, and the king's voice fills us with unspeakable
          delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The king came in to see his guests." This, I say, was the crowning
          point of the entire banquet. Observe that he came in after they were
          in their places. They did not see him before they had entered his
          halls. When an inferior entertains a superior he always advances to
          the door to meet him and waits until he comes. If her Majesty the
          Queen were entertained by one of her nobles, he would be in waiting,
          and at the threshold would meet her; but when a superior entertains an
          inferior the inferior may take his seat at the table, and when all is
          ready the noble host will come in. It is so in the banquet of mercy.
          You and I see nothing of God, by way of communion with him, until
          first we have been brought in by the message of mercy to the
          marriage-feast of the gospel; for, indeed, until then a sight of God
          would strike us with terror --
        </p>
        <p>"Till God in human flesh I see,</p>
        <p>My thoughts no comfort find;</p>
        <p>The holy, just, and sacred Three</p>
        <p>Are terrors to my mind;</p>
        <p>But when Immanuel's face appear,</p>
        <p>My hope, my joy, begins;</p>
        <p>His name forbids my slavish fear,</p>
        <p>His grace removes my sins."</p>
        <p>
          When I get to the banquet of mercy, then it is that I can dare to look
          at the King of kings, but not until then. What a joyous sight, a
          vision of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
          glory as he appears in the gospel, feasting us upon his fatlings. An
          incarnate God makes God visible to us and makes us happy in the sight.
          "How canst thou see my face and live?" was the old question, but,
          behold, it is answered this day. At the marriage union of Christ with
          his people we see the face of the King in his beauty, and our souls
          not only live, but we have life more abundantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observe, dear brethren, that the King has special times for this. He
          is not always in the festal chamber; to our sorrow we sometimes miss
          the King's presence at his table. We have the ordinances always, but
          we do not always enjoy the God of ordinances. The means of grace are
          abiding, but the grace of the means will come and go according to the
          sovereign good pleasure of our God. The King has his times of coming
          in. These are glad times to his people, but they are trying times to
          the mass of professors. When are these times? So far as unworthy
          guests are concerned, the times of God's visitation are those seasons
          when character is manifested. All times and periods do not reveal
          character. A lion may lie all day asleep, you may scarce know but what
          it is tame; but when the night brings the time for it to go forth to
          its prey, then it howls, and displays its ferocity. And so an ungodly
          man may lie down in the church of God with the lambs of the flock, and
          nothing may lead you to suspect his true character, but when the time
          comes for him to make profit by sin, or to get pleasure by sin, or to
          escape from persecution by sin, then you find out what he is. These
          providences are the King's coming in to scrutinize the guests. Changes
          in the conditions of the church, changes in the condition of the
          individual, all sorts of providential events go to make up the great
          sieve by which the wheat and the chaff are separated.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great and most solemn coming in of the King to see the guests is,
          when having looked over the church, unknown to us, he decides that
          such and such a hypocrite has had space enough for repentance and time
          enough for mischief, and must now be summoned to the dread tribunal by
          death. The time when the King comes in to see his guests is not the
          last judgment, for that is the coming of the Son and not of the
          Father, and if it were intended in the parable, we would read that the
          prince came in to see his guests. We are led to view the King himself
          as continually judging professors and detecting the rebels who place
          themselves among the saints; by this judgment of God men are taken
          away from the church in their transgressions, bound hand and foot, and
          cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of
          teeth. I do not know, my dear brethren, when God may be visiting this
          church, and taking away the men that are rebels in our midst, but I do
          know that when professors die it is not certain that all of them sleep
          in Jesus; but some of them are rooted up, like tares from among the
          wheat, and are bound up in bundles to burn. The division is going on
          constantly. The King's presence is known to believers in the joy which
          they feel, but it is made known to hypocrites by his cutting them off
          and appointing them their portion in eternal woe.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, however, there is any one time when we may be quite sure that the
          King comes in to see the guests, it is after large ingatherings from
          the world, for notice here, when the servants had gathered in guests
          in large numbers, it was then that the king came in. Now it will be
          after the time of revival which we are feeling just now, when I hope a
          great many will be added to the church, that the Lord will search and
          sift us. If there has been no visitation of the church before for
          purposes of love or judgment -- for they go together -- we shall be
          quite sure to have such a visit from the great Lord himself at this
          time.
        </p>
        <p>III. Solemnly think of THE JUDGE AT THE FEAST.</p>
        <p>
          To all the rest at the festival he was the king, the beloved monarch,
          the munificent donor of a splendid banquet, and all eyes feasted as
          they looked at him: it was joy enough to behold the king in his
          beauty, and to see his Son with all his royal jewels on, attired for
          the wedding feast; but he was a judge to the hypocritical intruder.
          The day of comfort to his saints is also the day of vengeance of our
          God. He who comes to comfort all that mourn comes at the same time to
          smite the rebellious with a rod of iron.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judge begins, as you perceive, by seeing, "He saw there a man."
          What eyes are those of Omniscience! The parable represents but one
          such man as present, yet the All-seeing King saw him at once, he fixed
          his flaming eyes on that one. I suppose it was a greater crowd than
          this, but the king fixed his eyes on the solitary offender at once.
          Does the parable speak of only one because we may expect to find only
          one hypocrite in a church? Alas! there have been many such at the
          wedding feast, but one only is mentioned to show us that if there were
          but one, God would find him out; and, being many, the sinners in Zion
          may be the more sure that they will not escape. It is possible that
          none of the guests may have noticed the man's garments; the parable
          makes no remark upon any expostulations made to him by others; perhaps
          they were all so taken up with the sight of the king, and so glad to
          be at the feast themselves, that they had no heart to make remarks
          upon others. But this is certain, that the king detected at once the
          absence of what was requisite to the marriage feast. It was not the
          presence of anything offensive, but the absence of something which was
          requisite. He did not say to the unworthy guest, "Thou hast rags upon
          thee," or "thou art filthy." or "thou hast an unwashed face"; he
          enquired solely into the absence of the peculiar badge which denoted a
          loving guest. God will judge, and does continually judge his church
          upon this question, the absence of what is absolutely necessary to
          being a Christian, the absence of honouring the Son, and obeying the
          Father. O soul, if thou art a professor of religion, and yet dost not
          love Jesus, and dost not fear the great King of kings, thou lackest
          the wedding robe, and what dost thou here? The King will see at once
          that thou lackest it. Thy morality, thy generosity, thy high sounding
          prayers, ay, and even thine eloquent discoursings, these cannot
          conceal from him the fact that thy heart is not with him. The one
          thing needful is to accept loyally the Lord as King.
        </p>
        <p>
          The king next began to deal with the rebel. Note how he spoke with
          him. He took him on his own ground. It was too high a day for the king
          to use rough speech; the man pretended to be a friend, and he
          addressed him as such, but though the word I doubt not was uttered
          softly, it must have stung him if he had any feeling left. Judas
          exemplified in his own person this character. When he gave the Saviour
          the traitor's kiss, our Lord addressed him as "friend." He pretended
          to be a friend. A friend, indeed, to insult his king at his own table,
          and to select for the insult the delicate occasion of the prince's
          marriage to which he had been hospitably invited! This was infamous!
          Friend indeed! Where will you find enemies if such shall be called
          friends? The king put it to him, "How camest thou in hither?" What
          business hast thou here? What could have induced thee so maliciously
          to defy me? To smite me in my tenderest point, and mock my guests, and
          trample on my son? Didst thou intend such daring insolence? "How
          camest thou in hither? In hither? Was there nowhere else to pour forth
          thy sedition, no other spot in which to play the traitor? Needest thou
          come into my palace, and to my table, and before my son on his wedding
          day to reveal thy enmity? Was there a need to do this?" So may the
          Lord say to some of us. "Were there no other ways to sin, but that you
          must profess to be my servant when you were not so? Were there no
          other bowls that you could drink from, that ye must profane the cups
          of my table? Was there no other bread that you could put into your
          wicked mouths but the bread that represents the body of my Son? Had
          you nowhere else to sin in that you must needs sin in the church?
          Could you do nothing else to show your spite but that you must make a
          lying profession of faith in my Son, who bled upon the cross to redeem
          the sons of men? Could you assail me nowhere else but through the
          wounds of my only-begotten Son? Could you vex my Spirit by no other
          means than by pretending to be my friend, and thrusting yourself in
          hither, while defiantly rejecting that which was necessary to do me
          honour, and to do my Son honour, at the festival of my grace?" I dare
          not dwell upon the topic. I give you the text; I pray that your
          conscience may preach the sermon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice however, one thing, and that is, that the king, when he thus
          turned a judge, dealt with this man only about himself. "How camest
          thou in hither?" Did I hear a whisper in some one's mind, "Well, if I
          am unfit to be a church member, there are a great many others who are
          in the same condemnation." What is that to you? See to thyself! When
          the king came in to see the guests he did not say to this man, "How
          came yonder persons here without the wedding garment?" His dealings
          were personal with him alone: "How camest thou in hither, not having
          on the wedding garment?" Professor, look to thyself, look to thyself.
          Let thy charity begin at home. Cast out the beam from thine own eye,
          and then mayst thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy
          brother's eye. He fixed on the one man, made him his entire audience,
          and directed to him the solemn question, "Friend, how camest thou in
          hither?" Ah, my dear hearers, as the pastor of this church it has been
          a very great joy to me to see our numbers increased; many have been
          added to us, and many have gone forth from us to form other churches;
          my joy has been constant in God concerning this matter. Our beloved
          brethren associated with me in office have done their best to keep any
          of you back who have sought membership in whom we could see no fruits
          corresponding. We have not used our office deceitfully; as in the
          sight of God we have tried to be neither too severe nor too lax, but
          for all that I cannot but know that there are some of you who are not
          Christians though you bear the name. Like those of old, you say you
          are Jews and are not, but do lie. I am not now speaking of any who
          have fallen into sin and have suffered our rebuke, or have been
          separated from us by excommunication and yet remain in the
          congregation; I mean others of you whose lives are all that could be
          desired openly, and yet there is a worm at the heart of your
          profession; you are not vitally godly, you have a name to live, and
          you keep that name untarnished as yet, but you are dead. Search ye
          yourselves; do not from this tabernacle descend into hell; let your
          prayer be, "Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody
          men." I am as concerned about myself as about you, that I should be
          found "accepted in the Beloved;" lest after having preached to others
          I myself should be a castaway! Do let it be a matter of solemn anxiety
          with each one. If you have never come to Jesus, come now; if you have
          never sought holiness of life, seek it now. If you have never had the
          wedding garment, it is yet procurable; go ye to him who freely gives
          it, the Lord will not refuse you; go to-day and he will accept you.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. He who was the unworthy guest is now THE CRIMINAL AT THE FEAST.
          The king has now become a judge to him; the question has been
          personally put to him, and he is speechless. Why is he silent? Surely
          it was because he was convicted of open, undeniable disloyalty. No
          evidence was required; he had come there on set purpose with malice
          aforethought to display his disloyalty, and had done so in the
          presence of the King. I do not think he represents at all a person who
          enters the church through ignorance, with a sincere but ignorant
          intention, but he pourtrays one who makes a profession without care to
          make it true -- willfully despising the Lord's commands. He is a man
          willing to be saved by grace, and professing to be so, but refusing to
          acknowledge his duty to God and his obligations to the Son. He was
          speechless; he could not have chosen a worse place, nor a more
          impertinent method of ventilating his disloyalty than that which he
          selected; there was nothing he could say in self-defense. At that
          moment, when the King looked him through and through, he saw the full
          horror of his position; his loins were loosed, like Belshazzar of old
          when he saw the handwriting on the wall; he saw now that his time to
          insult was over, and the day of retribution had come. He was taken in
          the very fact, and could not escape. He had been guilty of a
          superfluity of naughtiness, of an unnecessary extravagance of
          wickedness in coming into the feast to air his pride. He had committed
          a suicidal intrusion. He might have kept himself away at any rate, and
          not have thrust himself into the Judge's presence. He saw now that the
          cause of sedition was hopeless, the King was there and he was in his
          power and none could rescue him. Why did he not burst into tears? Why
          did he not confess the wrong? Why did he not say, "My king, I have
          insulted thee, have pity upon me"? His proud heart would not let him.
          Sin made him incapable of repentance. There is a verse in one of
          Hart's hymns which runs thus --
        </p>
        <p>"Fixed is their everlasting state:</p>
        <p>Could they repent, tis now too late."</p>
        <p>
          That is true enough, but it supposes an impossibility, and I think it
          would have been far better to have said --
        </p>
        <p>"Fixed is their everlasting state;</p>
        <p>They can't repent, tis now too late."</p>
        <p>
          Because the sinner goes on to sin he continues still to suffer; he
          will not turn, he cannot turn. As the Ethiopian cannot change his
          skin, nor the leopard his spots, so when sin has reached its height
          the man cannot bend, or bow, or retrace his steps. Oh, if he could
          have repented even then! But he could not; and the tears that came
          after the king had pronounced the sentence where no tears of
          penitence, but only of despairing pride. He stood speechless. It was
          not only that he had no excuse, but he would not confess his wrong.
          Have I anyone here in such a condition of heart, that while he has
          been sinning by making a false profession, and knows it, yet he
          sullenly refuses to confess his fault? Yield thee, man! Yield at once.
          Fall at the King's feet at once. Even if you are not a hypocrite, if
          you have any suspicion that you are, fall down and say, "My King, make
          me sincere; I submit myself to thy will, and am ready to put on the
          wedding badge; if there is any method by which I can honour thy Son, I
          cavil not at it; let me wear his colours, and be known by all men to
          be truly a lover of the great Prince."
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, lastly, while he stood speechless in the king's presence, the
          king gave place to THE EXECUTIONER, for he uttered these words, "Bind
          him hand and foot." He was lawless, make him feel the law; he said, "I
          am free, and I will do as I like," let him never be free again; bind
          him, pinion him. Executioner, do your duty, prepare him for death.
          Alas, there are some who are bound and pinioned even before the breath
          is out of their bodies. In their dying hours false professors have
          often found that they could not pray, and could not repent; like dying
          Spira, that arch-hypocrite and apostate, they have been sensible of
          misery, but not penitent, and no gospel promise has availed to comfort
          them. Their hearts were seared, they were twice dead before they were
          dead. Then came the sentence, "Take him away," which is sometimes
          executed by the church in her excommunications -- deceivers are taken
          away from the gospel feast by just discipline; but which is more fully
          carried out in the hour of death when the man's hope fails him. Ah,
          sirs, what will ye do if ye have no true grace in your hearts when you
          are taken away from the Lord's table, taken away from the baptism in
          which you gloried, taken away from the doctrines of the gospel which
          you understood so well by head, but which you did not know in your
          heart. John Bunyan's description of the man dragged by seven devils,
          bound with cords, comes up before my mind. "Bind him hand and foot and
          take him away." How thankful I am that the servants who brought them
          in are not the same who were commanded to take them away. The Douloi
          brought them in, the diakonoi took them away, the King has a special
          order of servants for the taking of deceivers away; his angels do that
          in the hour of death -- they execute his vengeance. He gives us
          ministers a better office, he bids us be his heralds of mercy. Then
          the judge said, "Cast him," fling him like a useless, worthless thing.
          That wretch has dared pollute my marriage feast, cast him away, as men
          fling weeds over the garden wall or shake off vipers into the fire.
          There is none in heaven or earth thought more despicable, more fit to
          be thrown away as rubbish and offal, than a man who had a Christian
          name, but had not the essentials of the Christian nature. Cast him
          away. Where? "Into outer darkness" far from the banquet hall where
          torches flame and lamps are bright; drive him out into the cold,
          chilly midnight air. He has once seen the light, it will be all the
          darker now for him when he is driven into the dark. There is no
          darkness so dark as the darkness of the man who once saw light. Cast
          him into outer darkness. What will he do there? We are not told what
          would be done to him, it was not needful; we learn elsewhere as much
          as could be revealed to us, but we are told what he did, for "there
          shall be weeping," not the gush of tears which gives relief but the
          everlasting dropping of scalding tears which create fresh sorrow and
          enlarge their own source. The outcast shed no tears of regret, but of
          sullen disappointment, because he could not after all dishonour the
          king, and had even served to illustrate the royal justice and power,
          and so had brought glory to the king whom he hated in soul. Then came
          the "gnashing of teeth," caused by wrath and envy because he could do
          no more mischief. No sorrow is equal to that of a malicious spirit,
          that having attempted a daring deed of atrocious wickedness, has been
          defeated and has contributed to the triumph of the good and excellent.
          The misery of hell is not a misery which God arbitrarily creates, it
          is the necessary result of sin, it is sin itself come to ripeness.
          Here you see the picture of the man who was insolent enough to come
          into the church without being a Christian, and now for ever he gnashes
          with his teeth against that glorious Majesty of heaven which it will
          never be in his power to injure, but which it will always be in his
          heart to hate; and this will be his hell -- that he hates God, this
          his darkness -- that he cannot see beauty in God, and this the
          outerness of the darkness -- that he cannot enter into God's will.
          "Depart ye cursed," is only love repelling that which is not lovely,
          it is only justice giving to man what his fallen nature craved after.
          "Get away from me, ye did not honour me; when ye did come to me it was
          with your lips only. Go where your hearts were; depart from me, you
          cursed." Oh, may God grant that not one here may come under the lash
          of this terrible parable, but may we be found of the Lord in peace in
          the day of his appearing. You see, then, how the Lord sifts us. First
          we are sifted by the preaching of the gospel, and many will not come
          -- there is one heap of chaff: next, by the judgment of God in his
          church, and others are found wanting -- there is another heap of
          chaff. Ah, when this is done, and the two great sieves are used, shall
          we be found among the wheat?
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you say, "the sermon has nothing to do with me, I never made a
          profession, I shall go home easy enough." Come hither friend, I must
          not let you go. There is a vagabond brought before the magistrate
          accused of theft, he says he is perfectly innocent, but he is
          convicted and has to suffer for it; after him comes a bragging fellow,
          who says, "I do not make any profession of being honest, I rob anybody
          I can, and I mean to do so, I do not pretend to keep the law." Why,
          methinks the magistrate would say, "I condemned the one who did at
          least pretend to something decent, but to you I give double
          punishment, you are evidently incorrigible, and your case needs no
          consideration." You who do not say you are Christians, who confess you
          are not, you avow yourselves the enemies of Christ; get no comfort
          therefore out of this parable I pray you, but yield yourselves to the
          Saviour, and believe in him, for he that believeth and is baptized
