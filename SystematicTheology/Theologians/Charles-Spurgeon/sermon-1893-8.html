          For, concerning the honours which widowhood enjoys in the sight of
          God, there is a brief summary in one saying of His through the
          prophet: "Do thou justly to the widow and to the orphan; and come ye,
          let us reason, saith the Lord." These two names, left to the care of
          the divine mercy, in proportion as they are destitute of human aid,
          the Father of all undertakes to defend. Look how the widow's
          benefactor is put on a level with the widow herself, whose champion
          shall "reason with the Lord!" Not to virgins, I take it, is so great a
          gift given. Although in their case perfect integrity and entire
          sanctity shall have the nearest vision of the face of God, yet the
          widow has a task more toilsome, because it is easy not to crave after
          that which you know not, and to turn away from what you have never had
          to regret. More glorious is the continence which is aware of its own
          right, which knows what it has seen. The virgin may possibly be held
          the happier, but the widow the more hardly tasked; the former in that
          she has always kept "the good," the latter in that she has found "the
          good for herself." In the former it is grace, in the latter virtue,
          that is crowned. For some things there are which are of the divine
          liberality, some of our own working. The indulgences granted by the
          Lord are regulated by their own grace; the things which are objects of
          man's striving are attained by earnest pursuit. Pursue earnestly,
          therefore, the virtue of continence, which is modesty's agent;
          industry, which allows not women to be "wanderers;" frugality, which
          scorns the world. Follow companies and conversations worthy of God,
          mindful of that short verse, sanctified by the apostle's quotation of
          it, "Ill interviews good morals do corrupt." Talkative, idle,
          winebibbing, curious tent-fellows, do the very greatest hurt to the
          purpose of widow-hood. Through talkativeness there creep in words
          unfriendly to modesty; through idleness they seduce one from
          strictness; through winebibbing they insinuate any and every evil;
          through curiosity they convey a spirit of rivalry in lust. Not one of
          such women knows how to speak of the good of single-husbandhood; for
          their "god," as the apostle says, "is their belly;" and so, too, what
          is neighbour to the belly.

          These considerations, dearest fellow-servant, I commend to you thus
          early, handled throughout superfluously indeed, after the apostle, but
          likely to prove a solace to you, in that (if so it shall turn out )
          you will cherish my memory in them.
