 </p>
</b></font><font face="Verdana">
<p align="justify">SUBJECT AND DIVISION. The song is in honor of Zion, or 
    Jerusalem, and it treats of God's favor to that city among the mountains, 
    the prophecies which made it illustrious, and the honor of being a native of 
    it. Many conceive that it was written at the founding of David's city of 
    Zion, but does not the mention of Babylon imply a later date? It would seem 
    to have been written after Jerusalem and the Temple had been built, and had 
    enjoyed a history, of which glorious things could be spoken. Among other 
    marvels of God's love in its later history, it had been untouched by 
    Sennacherib when other cities of Israel and Judah had fallen victims to his 
    cruelty. It was in Hezekiah's reign that Babylon became prominent, when the 
    ambassadors came to congratulate the king concerning his recovery, at that 
    time also Tyre would be more famous than at any period in David's day. But 
    as we have no information, and the point is not important, we may leave it, 
    and proceed to meditate upon the Psalm itself. We have no need to divide so 
    brief a song.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. His foundation is in the holy mountains. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The Psalm begins abruptly, the poet's heart was full, and 
    it gained vent on a sudden.</p>
<p align="justify">"God's foundation stands forever<br/>
    On the holy mountain towers; <br/>
    Zion's gates Jehovah favors<br/>
    More than Jacob's thousand bowers."</p>
<p align="justify">Sudden passion is evil—but bursts of holy joy are most 
    precious. God has chosen to found his earthly temple upon the mountains; he 
    might have selected other spots—but it was his pleasure to have his chosen 
    abode upon Zion. His election made the mountains holy, they were by his 
    determination ordained and set apart for the Lord's use. </p>
<p align="justify">The foundation of the church, which is the mystical 
    Jerusalem, is laid in the eternal, immutable, and invincible decrees of 
    Jehovah. He wills that the church shall be, he settles all arrangements for 
    her calling, salvation, maintenance and perfection, and all his attributes, 
    like the mountains round about Jerusalem, lend their strength for her 
    support. Not on the sand of carnal policy, nor in the morass of human 
    kingdoms, has the Lord founded his church—but on his own power and godhead, 
    which are pledged for the establishment of his beloved church, which is to 
    him the chief of all his works. </p>
<p align="justify">What a theme for meditation is the founding of the church 
    of God in the ancient covenant engagements of eternity; the abrupt character 
    of this first verse indicates long consideration on the part of the writer, 
    leading up to his bursting forth in wonder and adoration. Well might such a 
    theme cause his heart to glow. </p>
<p align="justify">Rome stands on her seven hills and has never lacked a 
    poet's tongue to sing her glories—but more glorious far are you, O Zion, 
    among the eternal mountains of God: while pen can write or mouth can speak, 
    your praises shall never lie buried in inglorious silence.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all 
    the dwellings of Jacob. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The gates are put for the city itself. The love of God is 
    greatest to his own elect nation, descended from his servant Jacob—yet the 
    central seat of his worship is dearer still; no other supposable comparison 
    could have so fully displayed the favor which Jehovah bore to Jerusalem—he 
    loves Jacob best and Zion better than the best. The mystical teaching of 
    these words is plain, God delights in the prayers and praises of Christian 
    families and individuals—but he has a special eye to the assemblies of the 
    faithful, and he has a special delight in their devotions in their church 
    capacity. </p>
<p align="justify">The great festivals, when the crowds surrounded the 
    temple gates, were fair in the Lord's eyes, and even such is the general 
    assembly and church of the first born, whose names are written in Heaven. 
    This should lead each separate believer to identify himself with the church 
    of God; where the Lord reveals his love the most, there should each believer 
    most delight to be found. Our own dwellings are very dear to us—but we must 
    not prefer them to the assemblies of the saints; we must say of the church—</p>
<p align="justify">"Here my best friends, my kindred dwell: <br/>
 Here God, my Savior reigns."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of 
    God. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This is true of Jerusalem. Her history, which is the 
    story of the nation of which she is the capital, is full of glorious 
    incidents, and her use and end as the abode of the true God, and of his 
    worship, was preeminently glorious. Glorious things were taught in the 
    streets, and seen in her temples. Glorious things were foretold of her, and 
    she was the type of the most glorious things of all. </p>
<p align="justify">This is yet more true of the church: she is founded in 
    grace—but her pinnacles glow with glory. Men may glory in her without being 
    braggarts, she has a luster about her brow which none can rival. Whatever 
    glorious things the saints may say of the church in their eulogies, they 
    cannot exceed what prophets have foretold, what angels have sung, or what 
    God himself has declared. Happy are the tongues which learn to occupy 
    themselves with so excellent a subject; may they be found around our fire 
    sides, in our market places, and in all the spots where men most congregate.
    </p>
<p align="justify">Never let your praises cease, O bride of Christ, you 
    fairest among women, you in whom the Lord himself has placed his delight, 
    calling you by that pearl of names, Hephzibah, "for my delight is in her." 
    Since the Lord has chosen you, and deigns to dwell in you, O city of beauty, 
    none can rival you, you are the eye of the world, the pearl, the queen of 
    all the cities of the universe; the true "eternal city", the metropolitan, 
    the mother of us all. The years to come shall unveil your beauties to the 
    astonished eyes of all peoples, and the day of your splendor shall come to 
    its sevenfold noon.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Selah. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">With the prospect before him of a world converted, and 
    the most implacable foes transformed into friends, it was fit that the 
    Psalmist should pause. How could he sing the glories of new born Tyre and 
    Ethiopia, received with open arms into union with Zion, until he had taken 
    breath and prepared both voice and heart for so divine a song.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to 
    those who know me.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">This shall be a glorious subject to speak of concerning 
    Zion, that her old foes are new born and have become her friends, worshiping 
    in the temple of her God. Rahab or Egypt which oppressed Israel shall become 
    a sister nation, and Babylon in which the tribes endured their second great 
    captivity, shall become a fellow worshiper; then shall there be mention made 
    in familiar talk of the old enmities forgotten and the new friendships 
    formed. </p>
<p align="justify">Some consider that these are the words of God himself, 
    and should be rendered "I will mention Rahab and Babylon as knowing me": but 
    we feel content with our common version, and attribute the words to the 
    Psalmist himself, who anticipates the conversion of the two great rival 
    nations and speaks of it with exultation. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">These also are to bow before the Lord. Philistia shall 
    renounce her ancient hate, Tyre shall not be swallowed up by thoughts of her 
    commerce, and distant Ethiopia shall not be too far off to receive the 
    salvation of the Lord. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">This man was born there. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The word man is inserted by the translators to the 
    marring of the sense, which is clear enough when the superfluous word is 
    dropped, "Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia—this was born there"—that is, 
    this nation has been born into Zion, regenerated into the church of God. Of 
    the new births of nations we will make mention, for it is at once a great 
    blessing and a great wonder. It is a glorious thing indeed when whole 
    nations are born unto God.</p>
<p align="justify">"Mark you well Philistia's legions,<br/>
    Lo, to seek the Lord they came; <br/>
    And within the sacred regions<br/>
    Tyre and Cush have found a home."</p>
<p align="justify">Many understand the sense of these verses to be that all 
    men are proud of their native country, and so also is the citizen of Zion, 
    so that while of one it is said, "he was born in Egypt" and of another, "he 
    came from Ethiopia", it would be equally to the honor of others that they 
    were home born sons of the city of God. The passage is not so clear that any 
    one should become dogmatic as to its meaning—but we prefer the 
    interpretation given above.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man 
    was born in her.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Not as nations only—but one by one, as individuals, the 
    citizens of the New Jerusalem shall be counted, and their names publicly 
    declared. Man by man will the Lord reckon them, for they are each one 
    precious in his sight; <i>the individual shall not be lost in the mass—but 
    each one shall be of high account</i>. What a patent of nobility is it, for 
    a man to have it certified that he was born in Zion; the twice born are a 
    royal priesthood, the true aristocracy, the imperial race of men. </p>
<p align="justify">The original, by using the noblest word for man, 
    intimates that many remarkable men will be born in the church, and indeed 
    every man who is renewed in the image of Christ is an eminent personage, 
    while there are some, who, even to the dim eyes of the world, shine forth 
    with a luster of character which cannot but be admitted to be unusual and 
    admirable. The church has illustrious names of prophets, apostles, martyrs, 
    confessors, reformers, missionaries and the like, which bear comparison with 
    the grandest names honored by the world, nay, in many respects far excel 
    them. Zion has no reason to be ashamed of her sons, nor her sons of her. 
    "Wisdom is justified of her children." </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And the highest himself shall establish her.</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">The only establishment worth having. When the numbers of 
    the faithful are increased by the new birth, the Lord proves himself to be 
    the builder of the church. The Lord alone deserves to wear the title of 
    Defender of the Faith; he is the sole and sufficient Patron and Protector of 
    the true church. There is no fear for the Lord's heritage, his own arm is 
    sufficient to maintain his rights. The Highest is higher than all those who 
    are against us, and the good old cause shall triumph over all.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. The Lord shall count, when he writes up the 
    people, that this man was born there. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">At the great census which the Lord himself shall take, he 
    will number the nations without exception and make an exact registry of 
    them, whether they were by their natural descent Babylonians or Tyrians, or 
    other far off heathen. May it be our happy lot to be numbered with the 
    Lord's chosen both in life and death, in the church roll below, and in the 
    church roll above. </p>
<p align="justify">Jehovah's census of his chosen will differ much from 
    ours; he will count many whom we should have disowned, and he will leave out 
    many whom we should have reckoned. <i>His registration is infallible</i>. 
    Let us pray then for that adoption and regeneration which will secure us a 
    place among the Heaven born. It was thought to be a great honor to have 
    one's name written in the golden book of the Republic of Venice, kings and 
    princes paid dearly for the honor—but the <i>book of life </i>confers far 
    rarer dignity upon all whose names are recorded therein.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. As well the singers as the players on 
    instruments shall be there. </p>
</b>
<p align="justify">In vision the Psalmist sees the citizens of Zion 
    rejoicing at some sacred festival, and marching in triumphant procession 
    with vocal and instrumental music. Where God is there must be joy, and where 
    the church is increased by numerous conversions the joy becomes exuberant 
    and finds out ways of displaying itself. Singers and dancers, Psalmists and 
    pipers, united their efforts and made a joyful procession to the temple, 
    inspired not by Bacchus, or by the Castalian fount—but by draughts from the 
    sacred source of all good, of which they each one sing </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">All my springs are in you.</p></b> 
<p align="justify">Did the poet mean that henceforth he would find all his 
    joys in Zion, or that to the Lord he would look for all inspiration, 
    comfort, strength, joy, life and everything. The last is the truest 
    doctrine. Churches have not such all sufficiency within them that we can 
    afford to look to them for all—but the Lord who founded the church is the 
    eternal source of all our supplies, and looking to him we shall never flag 
    or fail. </p>
<p align="justify">How truly does all our experience lead us to look to the 
    Lord by faith, and say "all my fresh springs are in you." The springs of my 
    faith and all my graces; the springs of my life and all my pleasures; the 
    springs of my activity and all its right doings; the springs of my hope, and 
    all its heavenly anticipations, all lie in you, my Lord. Without your Spirit 
    I would be as a dry well, a mocking cistern, destitute of power to bless 
    myself or others. O Lord, I am assured that I belong to the regenerate whose 
    life is in you, for I feel that I cannot live without you; therefore, with 
    all your joyful people will I sing your praises.</p>
