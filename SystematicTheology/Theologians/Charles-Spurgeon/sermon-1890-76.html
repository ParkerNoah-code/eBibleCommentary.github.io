          Habib the martyr, clad in flame, hath called to me out of the fire,
        </p>
        <p>
          That for him likewise I should fashion an image of beauty among the
          glorious.
        </p>
        <p>Comrade of conquerors, lo! he beckoneth to me out of the burning,</p>
        <p>That, as for the glory of his Lord, I should sing concerning him.</p>
        <p>
          In the midst of live coals stands the heroic man, and lo! he calleth
          to me,
        </p>
        <p>
          That I should fashion his image: but the blazing fire permits me not.
        </p>
        <p>His love is fervid, glowing is his faith;</p>
        <p>His fire also burneth, and who is adequate to recount his love?</p>
        <p>Nay, by reason of that love which led the martyr into the fire,</p>
        <p>No man is able to recount his beauties divine.</p>
        <p>For who shall dare enter and see in the blazing fire</p>
        <p>
          To whom he is like, and after what pattern he is to be fashioned among
          the glorious?
        </p>
        <p>
          Shall I fashion his image by the side of the youths, the children of
          the furnace?
        </p>
        <p>With Hananiah shall I reckon Habib? I know not.</p>
        <p>Lo! these were not burned there: how, then, is he like?</p>
        <p>He, I say, like them, when he was burned and the youths not?</p>
        <p>Which, I ask, the more beautiful -- Habib the martyr, or Azariah?</p>
        <p>
          Difficult for me is the image: how I am to look upon it, I know not.
        </p>
        <p>Lo! Michael was not burned by the flame;</p>
        <p>
          But Habib was burned: which, then, the more beautiful to him that
          looketh upon him?
        </p>
        <p>Who shall dare say that this is repulsive, or that;</p>
        <p>Or not so comely this as that, to him that beholdeth him?</p>
        <p>Three there are in the fire, and the flame cometh not near them;</p>
        <p>But one was burned: and how shall I suffice to tell</p>
        <p>
          That the Fourth form is that of Him who went down into the midst of
          the furnace,
        </p>
        <p>
          That He might fashion an image for Habib there along with those of the
          three?
        </p>
        <p>He giveth a place in the fire to him who was burned,</p>
        <p>
          That he may be, instead of Him the Fourth, by the side of the
          conquerors.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, if of the three the beauties be glorious, though they were not
          burned,
        </p>
        <p>
          How shall not this one, who was burned, be mingled with the glorious?
        </p>
        <p>If a man have the power either to be burned or not to be burned,</p>
        <p>
          Of this man, who was burned, more exalted was the beauty than that of
          the three.
        </p>
        <p>But, inasmuch as the Lord is the control of all things,</p>
        <p>
          He is to be praised, both where He rescues and where He delivers up.
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, too, the will of the three who were not burned,</p>
        <p>
          And of him who was burned, is one and the same, in this case and in
          that;
        </p>
        <p>And, had its Lord commanded the fire to burn them,</p>
        <p>Even those three on their part, burned they would have been;</p>
        <p>
          And, if He had signified to it that it should not burn that one man
          also,
        </p>
        <p>
          He would not have been burned; nor had it been of himself that he was
          rescued.
        </p>
        <p>To go into the fire was of their own will, when they went in;</p>
        <p>
          But that they were not burned -- because the Lord of the fire willed
          and commanded it.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore one equal beauty is that of him who was burned,</p>
        <p>
          And that of him who was not burned, because the will also was equal.
        </p>
        <p>Beloved martyr! exalted is thy beauty; exalted is thy rank:</p>
        <p>
          Graceful too thy crown, and mingled thy story with that of the
          glorious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choice gold art thou, and the fire hath tried thee, and resplendent is
          thy beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lo! into the King's crown art thou wrought, along with the
          victorious.
        </p>
        <p>Good workman! who, in the doctrine of the Son of God,</p>
        <p>
          Pursueth his course like a valiant man, because of the beauty of his
          faith.
        </p>
        <p>Habib the martyr was a teacher of that which is true;</p>
        <p>A preacher also, whose mouth was full of faith.</p>
        <p>
          Watchful was he, and prompt for service; and he encouraged with his
          teaching
        </p>
        <p>The household of the house of God, through his faith.</p>
        <p>Of light was he full, and he wrestled with the darkness</p>
        <p>
          Which overspread the country from the paganism which had darkened it.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Gospel of the Son was his mouth filled in the congregations;
        </p>
        <p>
          And as it were a leader of the way did he become to the villages when
          he arrived in them.
        </p>
        <p>Zealous he was, because he was concerned for the doctrine</p>
        <p>Divine, that he might establish the adherents of the faith.</p>
        <p>At the time when the winds of the pagans blew, a lamp was he,</p>
        <p>And flamed forth whilst they blew upon him, and went not out.</p>
        <p>
          All on fire was he, and filled with the love of his Lord, and was
          concerned
        </p>
        <p>For this -- that he might speak of Him without hindrance.</p>
        <p>The thorns of errour sprang up in the land from paganism;</p>
        <p>And, as much as in him lay, he rooted them out by his diligence.</p>
        <p>He taught, admonished, and confirmed in the faith,</p>
        <p>The friends of Christ, who were harassed by persecutors.</p>
        <p>Against sword and against fire did he wrestle,</p>
        <p>With love hot as the flame, and was not afraid.</p>
        <p>Like a two-edged brand, keen was</p>
        <p>His faith, and against error did he contend.</p>
        <p>Leaven did he prove to be in this land which had become exhausted</p>
        <p>
          Through fondness for the idols of vanity which error had brought in.
        </p>
        <p>He was like salt by reason of his savoury doctrine</p>
        <p>To this region, which had become insipid through unbelief.</p>
        <p>A deacon was he, and filled the place of a high-priest</p>
        <p>By the preaching and teaching of that which is true.</p>
        <p>He was to the flock a good shepherd whilst he was its overseer;</p>
        <p>And his life laid he down for the flock while he tended it.</p>
        <p>He chased away the wolf, and drove off from it the beast of prey.</p>
        <p>
          And he repaired the breaches, and gathered the lambs into their folds.
        </p>
        <p>He went out secretly and encouraged the congregations:</p>
        <p>He strengthened them, and exhorted them, and held them up.</p>
        <p>And he forged armour of faith, and put it on them,</p>
        <p>
          That they might not be ignominiously overthrown by the paganism which
          abounded.
        </p>
        <p>The flocks of the fold of the Son of God were being laid waste</p>
        <p>By persecutors: and he encouraged the lambs and the ewes.</p>
        <p>And he was an advocate to the household of faith;</p>
        <p>And he taught them not to be daunted by persecutors.</p>
        <p>He taught them to run to meet death,</p>
        <p>Without being afraid either of sword or of fire.</p>
        <p>In the teaching of the Son of God he prospered,</p>
        <p>So that his faith pursued its course without dread.</p>
        <p>
          Then errour grew envious, became furious, and was maddened, because of
          him;
        </p>
        <p>
          And she pursued after him, that she might shed upon the earth innocent
          blood.
        </p>
        <p>The Defamer, who hates the race of men,</p>
        <p>Laid snares for him, that he might rid the place of his presence.</p>
        <p>He who hateth the truth pursued after him to put him to death,</p>
        <p>
          That he might make his voice to cease from the teaching of the house
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And errour raised an outcry demanding that Habib should die, because
          she hated him;
        </p>
        <p>Vexation goaded her on, and she sought to take away his life.</p>
        <p>His story was talked about before the pagan judge of the country,</p>
        <p>And the dear fame of him reached the king: who in great rage,</p>
        <p>
          And because the diadem was interwoven with paganism, decreed death
        </p>
        <p>Against Habib, because he was full of faith.</p>
        <p>And, when the command reached the judge, he armed himself</p>
        <p>With rage and fury; and, with a mind thirsting for blood,</p>
        <p>And like hunters who lay nets for the young stag,</p>
        <p>After Habib did they go out to catch him.</p>
        <p>But this man was a preacher of the faith,</p>
        <p>Who in the highway of the crucifixion was prospering;</p>
        <p>
          And, that he might benefit by his teaching the children of his people,
        </p>
        <p>His work embraced the countries round about him.</p>
        <p>So, when error went out after him, she found him not:</p>
        <p>
          Not that he was fled, but that he had gone out to preach the Gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, because of the fury of the pagans, which was great beyond all
          that was meet,
        </p>
        <p>His kindred and his mother did they seize for his sake.</p>
        <p>Blessed art thou, O woman! mother since thou art of the martyr.</p>
        <p>
          For wherefore was it that they seized thee and bound thee,
          iniquitously?
        </p>
        <p>
          What do they require of thee, O thou full of beauty? What, I ask, have
          they required of thee?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lo! they require of thee that thou bring the martyr, that he may be a
          sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>Bring, oh bring thy sweet fruit to the place of the oblation --</p>
        <p>
          The fruit whose smell is fragrant, that it may be incense to the
          Godhead.
        </p>
        <p>Fair shoot, thy cluster bring from where it is,</p>
        <p>That its wine may be for a libation whose taste is sweet.</p>
        <p>
          The lamb heard that they were seeking him, that he might be a
          sacrifice;
        </p>
        <p>And he set out and came to the sacrificers rejoicing.</p>
        <p>He heard that others also were being afflicted for his sake,</p>
        <p>
          And he came that he might bear the suffering which was his, in the
          stead of many.
        </p>
        <p>The lot fell on him, to be himself alone a sacrifice;</p>
        <p>
          And the fire that was to offer him up was looking out for him until he
          came.
        </p>
        <p>Of the many who were bound for his sake</p>
        <p>Not one single person was seized to die, but only he.</p>
        <p>He it was that was worthy, and for him was martyrdom reserved;</p>
        <p>And to snatch the martyr's place no man was able.</p>
        <p>And therefore of his own will did he present himself</p>
        <p>To the judge, that he might be seized, and die for Jesus' sake.</p>
        <p>
          He heard that they sought him, and he came that he might be seized,
          even as they sought him:
        </p>
        <p>
          And he went in of himself before the judge, and dauntless was his
          look.
        </p>
        <p>He hid not himself, nor did he wish to flee from the judge:</p>
        <p>
          For with light was he imbued, and from the darkness he would not flee.
        </p>
        <p>No robber was he, no murderer, no thief,</p>
        <p>No child of night: but all his course was run in open day.</p>
        <p>Wherefore from his flock should the good shepherd flee,</p>
        <p>And leave his fold to be devoured by robbers?</p>
        <p>
          Wherefore should the physician flee, who goeth forth to heal diseases,
        </p>
        <p>And to cure souls by the blood of the Son of God?</p>
        <p>
          A fearless countenance did the brave man carry with him, and a great
          heart;
        </p>
        <p>And to meet death he ran, rejoicing, for Jesus' sake.</p>
        <p>He went in, he stood before the judge, saying to him:</p>
        <p>I am Habib, whom ye sought: lo! here I stand.</p>
        <p>
          And the pagan trembled, and amazement seized him, and he marvelled at
          him --
        </p>
        <p>At the man who was not afraid, either of sword or of fire.</p>
        <p>
          While he thought that he was fleeing apace, he entered in and mocked
          him;
        </p>
        <p>
          And the judge shook, for he saw him courageous in the very face of
          death.
        </p>
        <p>A disciple he of that Son of God who said:</p>
        <p>"Rise, come, let us go: for he that betrayeth me lo! is here."</p>
        <p>And to the crucifiers, again, He said: "Whom seek ye?"</p>
        <p>They say: "Jesus." And He said to them: "I am He."</p>
        <p>The Son of God of His own will came to the cross;</p>
        <p>
          And on Him the martyr looked, and presented himself uncompelled before
          the judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the pagan beheld him, and was smitten with fear, and was
          exasperated against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His rage was excited, and he began in his fury to put to him
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, as if he had been one who had shed on the ground the blood of the
          slain,
        </p>
        <p>He proceeded to question the saintly man, but he was not ashamed:</p>
        <p>Menacing him, and trying to terrify him, and to frighten him,</p>
        <p>
          And recounting the sufferings which were being prepared by him on his
          account.
        </p>
        <p>But Habib, when questioned, was not afraid,</p>
        <p>Was not ashamed, and was not frightened by the menaces he heard.</p>
        <p>Lifting up his voice, he confessed Jesus, the Son of God --</p>
        <p>That he was His servant, and was His priest, and His minister.</p>
        <p>At the fury of the pagans, roaring at him like lions,</p>
        <p>
          He trembled not, nor ceased from the confession of the Son of God.
        </p>
        <p>He was scourged, and the scourgings were very dear to him,</p>
        <p>Seeing that he bore a little of the stripes of the Son of God.</p>
        <p>
          He was put into bonds, and he looked on his Lord, whom also they had
          bound;
        </p>
        <p>
          And his heart rejoiced that in the path of His sufferings he had begun
          to walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          He ascended the block, and they tore him with combs, but his soul was
          radiant with light,
        </p>
        <p>
          Because he was deemed worthy that on him should come the agony of the
          sufferings of crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>In the pathway of death had he set his face to walk,</p>
        <p>And what could he desire to find in it but sufferings?</p>
        <p>
          The fire of sacrifice was betrothed to him, and for her did he look;
        </p>
        <p>
          And she on her part sent him combs, and stripes, and pains, to taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the while that she was coming, she sent him sufferings, that by
          means of them
        </p>
        <p>
          He might be prepared, so that when she met him she might not dismay
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sufferings purged him, so that, when the blazing fire should put him
          to the proof,
        </p>
        <p>There might not be any dross found in his choice gold.</p>
        <p>And he endured the whole of the pains that came upon him,</p>
        <p>
          That he might have experience of suffering, and in the burning stand
          like a brave man.
        </p>
        <p>And he accepted rejoicing the sufferings which he had to bear:</p>
        <p>For he knew that at their termination he should find death.</p>
        <p>And he was not afraid, either of death or of sufferings:</p>
        <p>For with that wine of the crucifixion his heart was drunk.</p>
        <p>
          He despised his body, while it was being dragged along by the
          persecutors;
        </p>
        <p>
          And his limbs, while they were being torn asunder in bitter agony.
        </p>
        <p>Scourges on his back, combs on his sides, stocks on his feet,</p>
        <p>And fire in front of him: still was he brave and full of faith.</p>
        <p>They taunted him: Lo! thou worshippest a man;</p>
        <p>But he said: A man I worship not,</p>
        <p>But God, who took a body and became man:</p>
        <p>Him do I worship, because He is God with Him that begat Him.</p>
        <p>The faith of Habib, the martyr, was full of light</p>
        <p>And by it was enlightened Edessa, the faithful city.</p>
        <p>
          The daughter of Abgar, whom Addæus betrothed to the crucifixion --
        </p>
        <p>Through it is her light, through it her truth and her faith.</p>
        <p>Her king is from it, her martyrs from it, her truth from it;</p>
        <p>The teachers also of her faith are from it.</p>
        <p>Abgar believed that Thou art God, the Son of God;</p>
        <p>And he received a blessing because of the beauty of his faith.</p>
        <p>Sharbil the martyr, son of the Edessæans, more-ever said:</p>
        <p>My heart is led captive by God, who became man.</p>
        <p>And Habib the martyr, who also was crowned at Edessa,</p>
        <p>Confessed these things: that He took a body and became man;</p>
        <p>That He is the Son of God, and also is God, and became man.</p>
        <p>Edessa learned from teachers the things that are true:</p>
        <p>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her, the faith;</p>
        <p>
          But to others, who were fraudulent teachers, she would not hearken.
        </p>
        <p>Habib the martyr, in the ear of Edessa, thus cried aloud</p>
        <p>Out of the midst of the fire: A man I worship not,</p>
        <p>But God, who took a body and became man</p>
        <p>Him do I worship. Thus confessed the martyr with uplifted voice.</p>
        <p>
          From confessors torn with combs, burnt, raised up on the block, slain
        </p>
        <p>And from a righteous king, did Edessa learn the faith,</p>
        <p>And she knows our Lord -- that He is even God, the Son of God;</p>
        <p>
          She also learned and firmly believed that He took a body and became
          man.
        </p>
        <p>Not from common scribes did she learn the faith:</p>
        <p>
          Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her; and she firmly believed
          them:
        </p>
        <p>And, if she be calumniated as having ever worshipped a man,</p>
        <p>She points to her martyrs, who died for Him as being God.</p>
        <p>A man I worship not, said Habib,</p>
        <p>
          Because it is written: "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in a man."
        </p>
        <p>Forasmuch as He is God, I worship Him, yea submit to be burned</p>
        <p>For His sake, nor will I renounce His faith.</p>
        <p>This truth has Edessa held fast from her youth,</p>
        <p>
          And in her old age she will not barter it away as a daughter of the
          poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her righteous king became to her a scribe, and from him she learned
        </p>
        <p>Concerning our Lord -- that He is the Son of God, yea God.</p>
        <p>Addæus, who brought the bridegroom's ring and put it on her hand,</p>
        <p>Betrothed her thus to the Son of God, who is the Only-begotten.</p>
        <p>Sharbil the priest, who made trial and proof of all gods,</p>
        <p>Died, even as he said, "for God who became man."</p>
        <p>Shamuna and Guria, for the sake of the Only-begotten,</p>
        <p>
          Stretched out their necks to receive the stroke, and for Him died,
          forasmuch as He is God.
        </p>
        <p>And Habib the martyr, who was teacher of congregations,</p>
        <p>Preached of Him, that He took a body and became man.</p>
        <p>
          For a man the martyr would not have submitted to be burned in the
          fire;
        </p>
        <p>But he was burned "for the sake of God who became man."</p>
        <p>
          And Edessa is witness that thus he confessed while he was being
          burned:
        </p>
        <p>
          And from the confession of a martyr that has been burned who is he
          that can escape?
        </p>
        <p>All minds does faith reduce to silence and despise --</p>
        <p>She that is full of light and stoopeth not to shadows.</p>
        <p>She despiseth him that maligns the Son by denying that He is God;</p>
        <p>Him too that saith "He took not a body and became man."</p>
        <p>In faith which was full of truth he stood upon the fire;</p>
        <p>
          And he became incense, and propitiated with his fragrance the Son of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all his afflictions, and in all his tortures, and in all his
          sufferings,
        </p>
        <p>Thus did he confess, and thus did he teach the blessed city.</p>
        <p>And this truth did Edessa hold fast touching our Lord --</p>
        <p>Even that He is God, and of Mary became a man.</p>
        <p>And the bride hates him that denies His God-head,</p>
        <p>And despises and contemns him that maligns His corporeal nature.</p>
        <p>And she recognises Him as One in Godhead and in manhood --</p>
        <p>The Only-begotten, whose body is inseparable from Him.</p>
        <p>And thus did the daughter of the Parthians learn to believe,</p>
        <p>
          And thus did she firmly hold, and thus does she teach him that listens
          to her.
        </p>
        <p>The judge, therefore, full of zeal for paganism, commanded</p>
        <p>
          That the martyr should be led forth and burned in the fire which was
          reserved for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And forthwith a strap was thrust into his mouth, as though he had been
          a murderer,
        </p>
        <p>His confession being kept within his heart towards God.</p>
        <p>
          And they hurried him away, and he went out from the judgment-hall,
          rejoicing
        </p>
        <p>
          That the hour was come when the crown should be given to his faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there went out with him crowds of people, that they might bear him
          company,
        </p>
        <p>Looking upon him, not as a dead man accompanied to his burial,</p>
        <p>
          But as a man who was going away that by means of fire he might become
          a bridegroom,
        </p>
        <p>
          And that there might be bestowed the crown which was by righteousness
          reserved for him.
        </p>
        <p>They looked upon him as upon a man entering into battle,</p>
        <p>
          And around him were spears, and lances, and swords, but he vanquished
          them.
        </p>
        <p>They beheld him going up like a champion from the contest,</p>
        <p>
          And in his triumph chaplets were brought to him by those who beheld.
        </p>
        <p>They looked upon him as he vanquished principalities and powers,</p>
        <p>Which all made war with him, and he put them to shame.</p>
        <p>
          The whole congregation of the followers of Christ exulted over him,
        </p>
        <p>
          Because he raised up the friends of the faith by the sufferings which
          he bore.
        </p>
        <p>There went forth with him the Church, a bride full of light;</p>
        <p>
          And her face was beaming on the beloved martyr who was united to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then did his mother, because it was the marriage-feast for her son,
        </p>
        <p>Deck herself in garments nobler than her wont.</p>
        <p>Since sordid raiment suited not the banquet-hall,</p>
        <p>
          In magnificent attire all white she clad herself right tastefully.
        </p>
        <p>Hither to the battle came down love to fight</p>
        <p>In the mother's soul -- the love of nature, and the love of God.</p>
        <p>
          She looked upon her son as he went forth to be put into the flame;
        </p>
        <p>
          And, forasmuch as there was in her the love of the Lord, she suffered
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yearnings of her mother's womb cried out on behalf of its fruit;
        </p>
        <p>But faith silenced them, so that their tumult ceased.</p>
        <p>Nature shrieked over the limb which was severed from her;</p>
        <p>
          But the love of the Lord intoxicated the soul, that she should not
          perceive it.
        </p>
        <p>Nature loved, but the love of the Lord did conquer in the strife</p>
        <p>
          Within the soul of the mother, that she should not grieve for her
          beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          And instead of suffering, her heart was filled with all emotions of
          joy;
        </p>
        <p>And, instead of mourning, she went forth in splendid apparel.</p>
        <p>
          And she accompanied him as he went out to be burned, and was elate,
        </p>
        <p>Because the love of the Lord vanquished that of nature.</p>
        <p>
          And clad in white, as for a bridegroom, she made a marriage-feast --
        </p>
        <p>She the mother of the martyr, and was blithe because of him.</p>
        <p>"Shamuna the Second" may we call this blessed one:</p>
        <p>
          Since, had seven been burned instead of one, she had been well
          content.
        </p>
        <p>One she had, and she gave him to be food for the fire;</p>
        <p>
          And, even as that one, if she had had seven, she had given them all.
        </p>
        <p>He was cast into the fire, and the blaze kindled around him;</p>
        <p>And his mother looked on, and grieved not at his burning.</p>
        <p>Another eye, which gazeth upon the things unseen,</p>
        <p>
          Was in her soul, and by reason of this she exulted when he was being
          burned.
        </p>
        <p>On the gems of light which are in martyrs' crowns she looked,</p>
        <p>
          And on the glory which is laid up for them after their sufferings;
        </p>
        <p>
          And on the promised blessings which they inherit yonder through their
          afflictions,
        </p>
        <p>And on the Son of God who clothes their limbs with light;</p>
        <p>
          And on the manifold beauties of that kingdom which shall not be
          dissolved,
        </p>
        <p>
          And on the ample door which is opened for them to enter in to God.
        </p>
        <p>On these did the martyr's mother look when he was being burned,</p>
        <p>
          And she rejoiced, she exalted, and in white did she go forth with him.
        </p>
        <p>She looked upon him while the fire consumed his frame,</p>
        <p>And, forasmuch as his crown was very noble, she grieved not.</p>
        <p>The sweet root was thrown into the fire, upon the coals;</p>
        <p>And it turned to incense, and cleansed the air from pollution.</p>
        <p>With the fumes of sacrifice had the air been polluted,</p>
        <p>And by the burning of this martyr was it cleansed.</p>
        <p>The firmament was fetid with the exhalations from the altars;</p>
        <p>
          And there rose up the sweet perfume of the martyr, and it grew sweet
          thereby.
        </p>
        <p>And the sacrifices ceased, and there was peace in the assemblies;</p>
        <p>
          And the sword was blunted, that it should no more lay waste the
          friends of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>With Sharbil it began, with Habib it ended, in our land;</p>
        <p>
          And from that time even until now not one has it slain, since he was
          burned.
        </p>
        <p>Constantine, chief of conquerors, took the empire,</p>
        <p>
          And the cross has trampled on the diadem of the emperor, and is set
          upon his head.
        </p>
        <p>Broken is the lofty horn of idolatry,</p>
        <p>
          And from the burning of the martyr even until now not one has it
          pierced.
        </p>
        <p>His smoke arose, and it became incense to the Godhead;</p>
        <p>And by it was the air purged which was tainted by paganism,</p>
        <p>And by his burning was the whole land cleansed:</p>
        <p>Blessed be he that gave him a crown, and glory, and a good name!</p>
        <p>
          Here endeth the Homily on Habib the martyr, composed by Mar Jacob.
