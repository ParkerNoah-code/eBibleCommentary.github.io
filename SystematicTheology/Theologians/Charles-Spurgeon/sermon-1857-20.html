        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.126)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, April 5, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          |Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is
          in Christ Jesus.| -- Rom.3:24.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE hill of comfort is the hill of calvary; the house of consolation
          is builded with the wood of the cross; the temple of heavenly cordials
          is founded upon the riven rock, riven by the spear which pierced its
          side. No scene in sacred history ever gladdens the soul like the scene
          on Calvary.
        </p>
        <p>|Is it not strange, the darkest hour</p>
        <p>That ever dawn'd on sinful earth</p>
        <p>Should touch the heart with softer power</p>
        <p>For comfort, than an angel's mirth?</p>
        <p>That to the cross the mourner's eye should turn,</p>
        <p>Sooner than where the stars of Bethlehem burn?|</p>
        <p>
          Nowhere does the soul ever find such consolation as on that very spot
          where misery reigned, where woe triumphed, where agony reached its
          climax. There grace hath dug a fountain, which ever gusheth with
          waters pure as crystal, each drop capable of alleviating the woes and
          the agonies of mankind. Ye have had your seasons of woe, my brethren
          and my sisters in Christ Jesus; and ye will confess it was not at
          Olivet that ye ever found comfort, not on the hill of Sinai, nor on
          Tabor; but Gethsemane, Gabbatha, and Golgotha have been a means of
          comfort to you. The bitter herbs of Gethsemane have often taken away
          the bitters of your life; the scourge of Gabbatha hath often scourged
          away your cares, and the groans of Calvary have put all other groans
          to flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have, this morning, then, a subject which I trust may be the means
          of comforting God's saints, seeing it takes its rise at the cross, and
          thence runs on in a rich stream of perennial blessing to all
          believers. You note, we have in our text, first of all, the redemption
          of Christ Jesus; secondly, the justification of sinners flowing from
          it; and then thirdly, the manner of the giving of this justification,
          |freely by his grace.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we have THE REDEMPTION THAT IS IN OR BY CHRIST JESUS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure of redemption is very simple, and has been very frequently
          used in Scripture. When a prisoner has been taken captive, and has
          been made a slave by some barbarous power, it has been usual, before
          he could be set free, that a ransom price should be paid down. Now, we
          being, by the fall of Adam, prone to guiltiness, and, indeed,
          virtually guilty, we were by the irreproachable judgment of God given
          up to the vengeance of the law; we were given into the hands of
          justice; justice claimed us to be his bond slaves for ever, unless we
          could pay a ransom, whereby our souls could be redeemed. We were,
          indeed, poor as owlets, we had not wherewith to bless ourselves. We
          were, as our hymn hath worded it, |bankrupt debtors;| an execution was
          put into our house; all we had was sold; we were left naked, and poor,
          and miserable, and we could by no means find a ransom; it was just
          then that Christ stepped in, stood sponsor for us, and, in the room
          and stead of all believers, did pay the ransom price, that we might in
          that hour be delivered from the curse of the law and the vengeance of
          God, and go our way, clean, free, justified by his blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me just endeavour to show you some qualities of the redemption
          that is in Christ Jesus. You will remember the multitude he has
          redeemed; not me alone, nor you alone, but |a multitude that no man
          can number,| which shall as far exceed the stars of heaven for number,
          as they exceed all mortal reckoning. Christ hath bought for himself,
          some out of every kingdom, and nation, and tongue, under heaven; he
          hath redeemed from among men some of every rank, from the highest to
          the lowest; some of every colour -- black and white; some of every
          standing in society, the best and the worst. For some of all sorts
          hath Jesus Christ given himself a ransom that they might be redeemed
          unto himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, concerning this ransom, we have to observe, that it was all paid,
          and all paid at once. When Christ redeemed his people, he did it
          thoroughly; he did not leave a single debt unpaid, nor yet one
          farthing for them to settle afterwards. God demanded of Christ the
          payment for the sins of all his people; Christ stood forward, and to
          the utmost farthing paid whate'er his people owed. The sacrifice of
          Calvary was not a part payment; it was not a partial exoneration, it
          was a complete and perfect payment, and it obtained a complete and
          perfect remittal of all the debts of all believers that have lived, do
          live, or shall live, to the very end of time. On that day when Christ
          hung on the cross, he did not leave a single farthing for us to pay as
          a satisfaction to God; he did not leave, from a thread even to a
          shoe-latchet, that he had not satisfied. The whole of the demands of
          the law were paid down there and then by Jehovah Jesus, the great high
          priest of all his people. And blessed be his name, he paid it all at
          once too. So priceless was the ransom, so princely and munificent was
          the price demanded for our souls, one might have thought it would have
          been marvellous if Christ had paid it by instalments; some of it now,
          and some of it then. King's ransoms have sometimes been paid part at
          once, and part in dues afterwards, to run through years. But not so
          our Saviour: once for all he gave himself a sacrifice; at once he
          counted down the price, and said, |It is finished,| leaving nothing
          for him to do, nor for us to accomplish. He did not drivel out a
          part-payment, and then declare that he would come again to die, or
          that he would again suffer, or that he would again obey; but down upon
          the nail, to the utmost farthing, the ransom of all people was paid,
          and a full receipt given to them, and Christ nailed that receipt to
          his cross, and said, |It is done, it is done; I have taken away the
          handwriting of ordinances, I have nailed it to the cross; who is he
          that shall condemn my people, or lay anything to their charge? for I
          have blotted out like a cloud their transgressions, and like a thick
          cloud their sins!|
        </p>
        <p>
          And when Christ paid all this ransom, will you just notice, that he
          did it all himself! He was very particular about that. Simon, the
          Cyrenian, might bear the cross; but Simon, the Cyrenian, might not be
          nailed to it. That sacred circle of Calvary was kept for Christ alone.
          Two thieves were with him there; not righteous men, lest any should
          have said that the death of those two righteous men helped the
          Saviour. Two thieves hung there with him, that men might see that
          there was majesty in his misery, and that he could pardon men and show
          his sovereignty, even when he was dying. There were no righteous men
          to suffer; no disciples shared his death; Peter was not dragged there
          to be beheaded, John was not nailed to a cross side by side with him;
          he was left there alone. He says, |I have trodden the wine press
          alone; and of the people there was none with me.| The whole of the
          tremendous debt was put upon his shoulders; the whole weight of the
          sins of all his people was placed upon him. Once he seemed to stagger
          under it: |Father, if it be possible.| But again he stood upright:
          |Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.| The whole of the
          punishment of his people was distilled into one cup; no mortal lip
          might give it so much as a solitary sip. When he put it to his own
          lips, it was so bitter, he well nigh spurned it -- |Let this cup pass
          from me.| But his love for his people was so strong, that he took the
          cup in both his hands, and
        </p>
        <p>|At one tremendous draught of love</p>
        <p>He drank damnation dry,|</p>
        <p>
          for all his people. He drank it all, he endured all, he suffered all;
          so that now for ever there are no flames of hell for them, no racks of
          torment; they have no eternal woes; Christ hath suffered all they
          ought to have suffered, and they must, they shall go free. The work
          was completely done by himself, without a helper.
        </p>
        <p>
          And note, again, it was accepted. In truth, it was a goodly ransom.
          What could equal it? A soul |exceeding sorrowful even unto death;| a
          body torn with torture; a death of the most inhuman kind; and an agony
          of such a character, that tongue cannot speak of it, nor can even
          man's mind imagine its horror. It was a goodly price. But say, was it
          accepted? There have been prices paid sometimes, or rather offered,
          which never were accepted by the party to whom they were offered, and
          therefore the slave did not go free. But this was accepted. The
          evidence I will shew you. When Christ declared that he would pay the
          debt for all his people, God sent the officer to arrest him for it; he
          arrested him in the garden of Gethsemane, and seizing upon him, he
          dragged him to the bar of Pilate, to the bar of Herod, and to the
          judgment seat of Caiaphas; the payment was all made, and Christ was
          put into the grave. He was there, locked up in durance vile, until the
          acceptance should have been ratified in heaven. He slept there a
          portion of three days in his tomb. It was declared that the
          ratification was to be this: the surety was to go his way as soon as
          ever his suretyship engagements had been fulfilled. Now let your minds
          picture the buried Jesus. He is in the sepulchre. Tis true he has paid
          all the debt, but the receipt is not yet given; he slumbers in that
          narrow tomb. Fastened in with a seal upon a giant stone, he sleeps
          still in his grave; not yet has the acceptance been given from God;
          the angels have not yet come from heaven to say, |The deed is done,
          God has accepted thy sacrifice.| Now is the crisis of this world; it
          hangs trembling in the balance. Will God accept the ransom, or will he
          not? We shall see. An angel comes from heaven with exceeding
          brightness; he rolls away the stone; and forth comes the captive, with
          no manacles upon his hands, with the grave clothes left behind him;
          free, never more to suffer, never more to die. Now,
        </p>
        <p>|If Jesus had not paid the debt,</p>
        <p>He ne'er had been at freedom set.|</p>
        <p>
          If God had not accepted his sacrifice, he would have been in his tomb
          at this moment; he never would have risen from his grave. But his
          resurrection was a pledge of God's accepting him. He said, |I have had
          a claim upon thee to this hour; that claim is paid now; go thy way.|
          And death gave up his royal captive, the stone was rolled into the
          garden, and the conqueror came forth, leading captivity captive.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, moreover, God gave a second proof of acceptance; for he took his
          only begotten Son to heaven, and set him at his right hand, far above
          all principalities and powers; and therein he meant to say to him,
          |Sit upon the throne, for thou hast done the mighty deed; all thy
          works and all thy miseries are accepted as the ransom of men.| O my
          beloved, think what a grand sight it must have been when Christ
          ascended into glory; what a noble certificate it must have been of his
          Father's acceptance of him! Do you not think you see the scene on
          earth? It is very simple. A few disciples are standing upon a hill,
          and Christ mounts into the air in slow and solemn movement, as if an
          angel sped his way by gentle degrees, like mist or exhalation from the
          lake into the skies. Can you imagine what is going on up yonder? Can
          you for a moment conceive how, when the mighty conqueror entered the
          gates of heaven, the angels met him,
        </p>
        <p>|They brought his chariot from on high,</p>
        <p>To bear him to his throne;</p>
        <p>Clapp'd their triumphant wings, and cried,</p>
        <p>'The glorious work is done'|</p>
        <p>
          Can you think how loud were the plaudits when he entered the gates of
          heaven? Can you conceive how they pressed on one another, to behold
          how he came conquering and red from the fight? Do you see Abraham,
          Isaac, Jacob, and all the saints redeemed, come to behold the Saviour
          and the Lord? They had desired to see him, and now their eyes behold
          him in flesh and blood, the conqueror over death and hell! Do you
          think you see him, with hell at his chariot- wheels, with death
          dragged as a captive through the royal streets of heaven? Oh, what a
          spectacle was there that day! No Roman warrior ever had such a
          triumph; none ever saw such a majestic sight. The pomp of a whole
          universe, the royalty of entire creation, cherubim and seraphim and
          all powers create, did swell the show; and God himself, the
          Everlasting One, crowned all, when he pressed his Son to his bosom,
          and said, |Well done, well done; thou hast finished the work which I
          gave thee to do. Rest here for ever, mine accepted one.| Ah, but he
          never would have had that triumph, if he had not paid all the debt.
          Unless his Father had accepted the ransom-price, the ransomer had
          never been so honoured; but because it was accepted, therefore did he
          so triumph. So far, then, concerning the ransom.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, by the help of God's Spirit, let me address myself to THE
          EFFECT OF THE RANSOM; being justified -- |justified freely by his
          grace through the redemption.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what is the meaning of justification? Divines will puzzle you, if
          you ask them. I must try the best I can to make justification plain
          and simple, even to the comprehension of a child. There is not such a
          thing as justification to be had on earth for mortal men, except in
          one way. Justification, you know, is a forensic term; it is employed
          always in a legal sense. A prisoner is brought to the bar of justice
          to be tried. There is only one way whereby that prisoner can be
          justified; that is, he must be found not guilty; and if he is found
          not guilty, then he is justified -- that is, he is proved to be a just
          man. If you find that man guilty, you cannot justify him. The Queen
          may pardon him, but she cannot justify him. The deed is not a
          justifiable one, if he were guilty concerning it; and he cannot be
          justified on account of it. He may be pardoned; but not royalty itself
          can ever wash that man's character. He is as much a real criminal when
          he is pardoned as before. There is no means among men of justifying a
          man of an accusation which is laid against him, except by his being
          proved not guilty. Now, the wonder of wonders is, that we are proved
          guilty, and yet we are justified: the verdict has been brought in
          against us, guilty; and yet, notwithstanding, we are justified. Can
          any earthly tribunal do that? No; it remained for the ransom of Christ
          to effect that which is an impossibility to any tribunal upon earth.
          We are all guilty. Read the 23rd verse, immediately preceding the text
          -- | For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.| There
          the verdict of guilty is brought in, and yet we are immediately
          afterwards said to be justified freely by his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, allow me to explain the way whereby God justifies a sinner. I am
          about to suppose an impossible case. A prisoner has been tried, and
          condemned to death. He is a guilty man; he cannot be justified,
          because he is guilty. But now, suppose for a moment that such a thing
          as this could happen -- that some second party could be introduced,
          who could take all that man's guilt upon himself, who could change
          places with that man, and by some mysterious process, which of course
          is impossible with men, become that man; or take that man's character
          upon himself; he, the righteous man, putting the rebel in his place,
          and making the rebel a righteous man. We cannot do that in our courts.
          If I were to go before a judge, and he should agree that I should be
          committed for a year's imprisonment, instead of some wretch who was
          condemned yesterday to a year's imprisonment, I could not take his
          guilt. I might take his punishment, but not his guilt. Now, what flesh
          and blood cannot do, that Jesus Christ by his redemption did. Here I
          stand, the sinner. I mention myself as the representative of you all.
          I am condemned to die. God says, |I will condemn that man; I must, I
          will -- I will punish him.| Christ comes in, puts me aside, and stands
          himself in my stead. When the plea is demanded, Christ says, |Guilty;|
          takes my guilt to be his own guilt. When the punishment is to be
          executed, forth comes Christ. |Punish me,| he says; |I have put my
          righteousness on that man, and I have taken that man's sins on me.
          Father, punish me, and consider that man to have been me. Let him
          reign in heaven; let me suffer misery. Let me endure his curse, and
          let him receive my blessing.| This marvellous doctrine of the changing
          of places of Christ with poor sinners, is a doctrine of revelation,
          for it never could have been conceived by nature. Let me, lest I
          should have made a mistake, explain myself again. The way whereby God
          saves a sinner is not, as some say, by passing over the penalty. No;
          the penalty has been all paid. It is the putting of another person in
          the rebel's place. The rebel must die; God says he must. Christ says,
          |I will be substitute for the rebel. The rebel shall take my place; I
          will take his.| God consents to it. No earthly monarch could have
          power to consent to such a change. But the God of heaven had a right
          to do as he pleased. In his infinite mercy he consented to the
          arrangement. | Son of my love,| said he, |you must stand in the
          sinner's place; you must suffer what he ought to have suffered; you
          must be accounted guilty, just as he was accounted guilty; and then I
          will look upon the sinner in another light. I will look at him as if
          he were Christ; I will accept him as if he were my only- begotten Son,
          full of grace and truth. I will give him a crown in heaven, and I will
          take him to my heart for ever and ever.| This is the way we are saved,
          |Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is
          in Christ Jesus.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, let me further go on to explain some of the characteristics
          of this justification. As soon as a repenting sinner is justified,
          remember, he is justified for all his sins. Here stands a man all
          guilty. The moment he believes in Christ, his pardon at once he
          receives, and his sins are no longer his; they are cast into the
          depths of the sea. They were laid upon the shoulders of Christ, and
          they are gone. The man stands a guiltless man in the sight of God,
          accepted in the beloved. |What!| say you, |do you mean that
          literally?| Yes, I do, That is the doctrine of justification by faith.
          Man ceases to be regarded by divine justice as a guilty being; the
          moment he believes on Christ his guilt is all taken away. But I am
          going a step further. The moment the man believes in Christ, he ceases
          to be guilty in God's esteem; but what is more, he becomes righteous,
          he becomes meritorious; for, in the moment when Christ takes his sins
          he takes Christ's righteousness; so that, when God looks upon the
          sinner who but an hour ago was dead in sins, he looks upon him with as
          much love and affection as he ever looked upon his Son. He himself has
          said it -- |As the Father loved me, so have I loved you.| He loves us
          as much as his Father loved him. Can you believe such a doctrine as
          that? Does it not pass all thought? Well, it is a doctrine of the Holy
          Spirit; the doctrine whereby we must hope to be saved. Can I to any
          unenlightened person illustrate this thought better? I will give him
          the parable we have given to us in the prophets -- the parable of
          Joshua the high-priest. Joshua comes in, clothed in filthy garments;
          those filthy garments representing his sins. Take away the filthy
          garments; that is pardon. Put a mitre on his head; clothe him in royal
          raiment; make him rich and fair; that is justification. But where do
          these garments come from? and where do those rags go to? Why, the rags
          that Joshua had on go to Christ, and the garments put on Joshua are
          the garments that Christ wore. The sinner and Christ do just what
          Jonathan and David did. Jonathan put his robes on David, David gave
          Jonathan his garments; so Christ takes our sins, we take Christ's
          righteousness; and it is by a glorious substitution and interchange of
          places that sinners go free and are justified by his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          |But,| says one, |no one is justified like that, till he dies.|
          Believe me, he is.
        </p>
        <p>|The moment a sinner believes,</p>
        <p>And trusts in his crucified God,</p>
        <p>His pardon at once he receives;</p>
        <p>Salvation in full, through his blood.|</p>
        <p>
          If that young man over there has really believed in Christ this
          morning, realizing by a spiritual experience what I have attempted to
          describe, he is as much justified in God's sight now as he will be
          when he stands before the throne. Not the glorified spirits above are
          more acceptable to God than the poor man below, who is once justified
          by grace. It is a perfect washing, it is perfect pardon, perfect
          imputation; we are fully, freely, and wholly accepted, through Christ
          our Lord. Just one more word here, and then I will leave this matter
          of justification. Those who are once justified are justified
          irreversibly. As soon as a sinner takes Christ's place, and Christ
          takes the sinner's place, there is no fear of a second change. If
          Christ has once paid the debt, the debt is paid, and it will never be
          asked for again; if you are pardoned, you are pardoned once for ever.
          God does not give man a free pardon under his own sign-manual, and
          then afterwards retract it and punish man: that be far from God so to
          do. He says, |I have punished Christ; you may go free.| And after
          that, we may |rejoice in hope of the glory of God,| that |being
          justified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
          Christ.| And now I hear one cry, |That is an extraordinary doctrine.|
          Well, so some may think; but let me say to you, it is a doctrine
          professed by all protestant churches, though they may not preach it.
          It is the doctrine of the Church of England, it is the doctrine of
          Luther, it is the doctrine of the Presbyterian church; it is
          professedly the doctrine of all Christian churches; and if it seems
          strange in your ears, it is because your ears are estranged, and not
          because the doctrine is a strange one. It is the doctrine of holy
          writ, that none can condemn whom God justifies, and that none can
          accuse those for whom Christ hath died; for they are totally free from
          sin. So that, as one of the prophets has it, God sees no sin in Jacob
          nor iniquity in Israel. In the moment they believe, their sins being
          imputed to Christ, they cease to be theirs, and Christ's righteousness
          is imputed to them and accounted theirs, so that they are accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I close up with the third point, upon which I shall be
          brief, and I hope very earnest: THE MANNER OF GIVING THIS
          JUSTIFICATION. John Bunyan would have it, that there are some whose
          mouths are set a watering for this great gift of justification. Are
          there not some here who are saying, |Oh! if I could be justified! But,
          Sir, can I be justified? I have been a drunkard, I have been a
          swearer, I have been everything that is vile. Can I be justified? Will
          Christ take my black sins, and am I to take his white robes? Yes, poor
          soul, if thou desirest it; if God has made thee willing, if thou dost
          confess thy sins, Christ is willing to take thy rags, and give thee
          his righteousness, to be thine for ever. |Well, but how is it to be
          obtained?| says one |must I be a holy man for many years, and then get
          it?| Listen! |Freely by his grace;| |freely,| because there is no
          price to be paid for it; |By his grace,| because it is not of our
          deservings. |But, O Sir, I have been praying, and I do not think God
          will forgive me, unless I do something to deserve it.| I tell you,
          Sir, if you bring in any of your deservings, you shall never have it.
          God gives away his justification freely; if you bring anything to pay
          for it, he will throw it in your face, and will not give his
          justification to you. He gives it away freely. Old Rowland Hill once
          went preaching at a fair; he noticed the chapmen selling their wares
          by auction; so Rowland said, |I am going to hold an auction too, to
          sell wine and milk, without money and without price. My friends over
          there,| said he |find a great difficulty to get you up to their price;
          my difficulty is to bring you down to mine.| So it is with men. If I
          could preach justification to be bought by you at a sovereign a piece,
          who would go out of the place without being justified? If I could
          preach justification to you by walking a hundred miles, would we not
          be pilgrims tomorrow morning, every one of us? If I were to preach
          justification which would consist in whippings and torture, there are
          very few here who would not whip themselves, and that severely too.
          But when it is freely, freely, freely, men turn away. |What! am I to
          have it for nothing at all, without doing anything?| Yes, Sir, you are
          to have it for nothing, or else not at all; it is |freely.| |But may I
          not go to Christ, lay some claim to his mercy, and say, Lord, justify
          me because I am not so bad as others?| It will not do, Sir, because it
          is |by his grace.| |But may I not indulge a hope, because I go to
          church twice a day?| No, Sir; it is |by his grace.| |But may I not
          offer this plea, I mean to be better?| No, sir; it is |by his grace.|
          You insult God by bringing your counterfeit coin to pay for his
          treasures. Oh! what poor ideas men have of the value of Christ's
          gospel, if they think they can buy it! God will not have your rusty
          farthings to buy heaven with. A rich man once, when he was dying, had
          a notion that he could buy a place in heaven by building a row of
          almshouses. A good man stood by his bed-side, and said, |How much more
          are you going to leave?| |Twenty thousand pounds.| Said he |That would
          not buy enough for your foot to stand on in heaven; for the streets
          are made of gold there, and therefore of what value can your gold be,
          it would be accounted nothing of, when the very streets are paved with
          it?| Nay, friends, we cannot buy heaven with gold nor good works, nor
          prayers, nor anything in the world. But how is it to be got? Why it is
          to be got for asking only. As many of us as know ourselves to be
          sinners may have Christ for asking for him. Do you know that you want
          Christ? You may have Christ! |Whosoever will, let him come and take of
          the water of life freely.| But if you cleave to your own notions, and
          say, |No, Sir, I mean to do a great many good things, and then I will
          believe in Christ.| -- Sir, you will be damned if you hold by such
          delusions. I earnestly warn you. You cannot be saved so. |Well, but
          are we not to do good works?| Certainly you are; but you are not to
          trust in them. You must trust in Christ wholly, and then do good works
          afterwards. |But,| says one, |I think if I were to do a few good
          works, it would be a little recommendation when I came.| It would not,
          sir; they would be no recommendation at all. Let a beggar come to your
          house in white kid gloves, and say he is very badly off, and wants
          some charity; would the white kid gloves recommend him to your
          charity? Would a good new hat that he has been buying this morning
          recommend him to your charity? |No,| you would say, |you are a
          miserable impostor; you do not want anything, and you shall not have
          anything either! Out with you!|
        </p>
        <p>
          The best livery for a beggar is rags, and the best livery for a sinner
          to go to Christ in, is for him to go just as he is, with nothing but
          sin about him. |But no;| say you, |I must be a little better, and then
          I think Christ will save me!| You cannot get any better, try as long
          as you please. And besides -- to use a paradox -- if you were to get
          better, you would be all the worse; for the worse you are, the better
          to come to Christ. If you are all unholy come to Christ; if you feel
          your sin, and renounce it, come to Christ; though you have been the
          most debased and abandoned soul, come to Christ; if you feel yourself
          to have nothing about you that can recommend you, come to Christ.
        </p>
        <p>|Venture on him, venture wholly;</p>
        <p>Let no other trust intrude.|</p>
        <p>
          I do not say this to urge any man to continue in sin. God forbid! If
          you continue in sin, you must not come to Christ; you cannot; your
          sins will hamper you. You cannot be chained to your galley- oar -- the
          oar of your sins -- yet come to Christ, and be a free man. No, sir, it
          is repentance; it is the immediate leaving off the sin. But mark thee,
          neither by repentance, nor by leaving off thy sin, can save thee. It
          is Christ, Christ, Christ -- Christ only.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I know you will go away, many of you, and try to build up your own
          Babel-tower, to get to heaven. Some of you will go one way to work,
          and some another. You will go the ceremony way: you will lay the
          foundation of the structure with infant baptism, build confirmation on
          it, and the Lord's supper. |I shall go to heaven,| you say; |Do not I
          keep Good Friday and Christmas-day? I am a better man than those
          dissenters. I am a most extraordinary man. Do I not say more prayers
          than any one?| You will be a long while going up that treadmill,
          before you get an inch higher. That is not the way to get to the
          stars. One says, |I will go and study the Bible, and believe right
          doctrine; and I have no doubt that by believing right doctrine I shall
          be saved.| Indeed you will not! You can be no more saved by believing
          right doctrine than you can by doing right actions. |There,| says
          another, |I like that; I shall go and believe in Christ, and live as I
          like.| Indeed you will not! For if you believe in Christ he will not
          let you live as your flesh liketh; by his Spirit he will constrain you
          to mortify its affections and lusts. If he gives you the grace to make
          you believe, he will give you the grace to live a holy life
          afterwards. If he gives you faith, he gives you good works after-
          wards. You cannot believe in Christ, unless you renounce every fault,
          and resolve to serve him with full purpose of heart. Methinks at last
          I hear a sinner say, |Is that the only door? And may I venture through
          it? Then I will. But I do not quite understand you; I am something
          like poor Tiff, in that remarkable book Dred.' They talk a great deal
          about a door, but I cannot see the door; they talk a great deal about
          the way, but I cannot see the way. For if poor Tiff could see the way,
          he would take these children away by it. They talk about fighting, but
          I do not see any one to fight, or else I would fight.| Let me explain
          it then. I find in the Bible, |This is a faithful saying, and worthy
          of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
          sinners.| What have you to do, but to believe this and trust in him?
          You will never be disappointed with such a faith as that. Let me give
          you over again an illustration I have given hundreds of times, but I
          cannot find another so good, so I must give it again. Faith is
          something like this. There is a story told of a captain of a
          man-of-war, whose son -- a young lad -- was very fond of running up
          the rigging of the ship; and one time, running after a monkey, he ran
          up the mast, till at last he got on to the maintruck. Now, the
          maintruck, you are aware, is like a large round table put on to the
          mast, so that when the boy was on the maintruck there was plenty of
          room for him; but the difficulty was -- to use the best explanation I
          can -- that he could not reach the mast that was under the table; he
          was not tall enough to get down from this maintruck, reach the mast,
          and so descend. There he was on the maintruck; he managed to get up
          there, somehow or other, but down he never could get. His father saw
          that, and he looked up in horror; what was he to do? In a few moments
          his son would fall down, and be dashed to pieces! He was clinging to
          the main-truck with all his might, but in a little time he would fall
          down on the deck, and there he would be a mangled corpse. The captain
          called for a speaking trumpet; he put it to his mouth, and shouted,
          |Boy, the next time the ship lurches, throw yourself into the sea.| It
          was, in truth, his only way of escape; he might be picked up out of
          the sea, but he could not be rescued if he fell on the deck. The poor
          boy looked down on the sea; it was a long way; he could not bear the
          idea of throwing himself into the roaring current beneath him; he
          thought it looked angry and dangerous. How could he cast himself down
          into it? So he clung to the main-truck with all his might, though
          there was no doubt that he must soon let go and perish. The father
          called for a gun, and pointing it up at him, said, |Boy, the next time
          the ship lurches, throw yourself into the sea, or I'll shoot you!| He
          knew his father would keep his word; the ship lurched on one side,
          over went the boy splash into the sea, and out went brawny arms after
          him; the sailors rescued him, and brought him on deck. Now, we, like
          the boy, are in a position of extra-ordinary danger, by nature, which
          neither you nor I can possibly escape of ourselves. Unfortunately, we
          have got some good works of our own, like that maintruck, and we cling
          to them so fondly, that we never will give them up. Christ knows that
          unless we do give them up, we shall be dashed to pieces at the last,
          for that rotten trust must ruin us. He, therefore, says, |Sinner, let
          go thine own trust, and drop into the sea of my love.| We look down,
          and say, |Can I be saved by trusting in God? He looks as if he were
          angry with me, and I could not trust him.| Ah, will not mercy's tender
          cry persuade you? -- |He that believeth shall be saved.| Must the
          weapon of destruction be pointed directly at you? Must you hear the
          dreadful threat -- |He that believeth not shall be damned?| It is with
          you now as with that boy -- your position is one of imminent peril in
          itself, and your slighting the Father's counsel is a matter of more
          terrible alarm, it makes peril more perilous. You must do it, or else
          you perish! Let go your hold! That is faith when the poor sinner lets
          go his hold, drops down, and so is saved; and the very thing which
          looks as if it would destroy him, is the means of his being saved. Oh!
          believe on Christ, poor sinners; believe on Christ. Ye who know your
          guilt and misery come, cast yourselves upon him; come, and trust my
          Master, and as he lives, before whom I stand, you shall never trust
          him in vain; but you shall find yourselves forgiven, and go your way
          rejoicing in Christ Jesus.<br />
