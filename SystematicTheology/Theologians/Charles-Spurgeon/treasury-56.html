          TITLE. <b>To the Chief Musician on stringed instruments</b>. The music
          was to be that of stringed instruments. Variety is to be studied in
          our tunes, and in all other matters relating to sacred song. Monotony
          is often the death of congregational praise. Providence is varied, and
          so should our recording songs be.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Maschil</p></b>. We are to learn and to teach by
        what we sing. Edification must not be divorced from psalmody.
        <b> <p align="justify">A Psalm of David</p></b>. David's productions
        were as plentiful as they are profitable. His varied life was for our
        benefit, for from it we derive these hymns, which at this hour are as
        fresh and as precious as when he wrote them.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            When the Ziphims came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself
            with us?
          </p></b
        >
        To curry favor with Saul they were guilty of gross inhospitality. What
        cared they what innocent blood was shed, just so that they earned the
        graceless monarch's smile! David came quietly among them, hoping for a
        little rest in his many flights, but they deserted him in his solitary
        abode, and betrayed him. He turns to God in prayer, and so strong was
        his faith that he soon sang himself into delightful serenity.
        <p align="justify">
          DIVISION. From verses 1-3, where the Selah makes a pause for us, the
          psalmist pleads with God, and then in the rest of the song, laying
          aside all doubt, he chants a hymn of joyful triumph. The vigor of
          faith is the death of anxiety, and the birth of security.<br />
           
        </p>
        <p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 1. Save me, O God.</p></b> You are my
        Savior; all around me are my foes and their eager helpers. No shelter is
        permitted me. Every land rejects me and denies me rest. But you, O God,
        will give me refuge, and deliver me from all my enemies.
        <b> <p align="justify">By your name</p></b>, by your great and glorious
        nature. Employ all your attributes for me. Let every one of the
        perfections which are blended in your divine name work for me. Is not
        your honor pledged for my defense?
        <b> <p align="justify">And judge me by your strength.</p></b> Render
        justice to me, for none else will or can. You can give me efficient
        justice, and right my wrongs by your omnipotence.
        <p align="justify">
          We dare not appeal to God in a bad cause, but when we know that we can
          fearlessly carry our cause before his justice, we may well commit it
          to his power.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 2. Hear my prayer, O God.</p></b> This has
        ever been the defense of saints. As long as God has an open ear we
        cannot be shut up in trouble. All other weapons may be useless, but all
        prayer is evermore available. No enemy can spike this gun.
        <b> <p align="justify">Give ear to the words of my mouth.</p></b> Vocal
        prayer helps the supplicant, and we keep our minds more fully awake when
        we can use our <i>tongues </i>as well as our <i>hearts</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          But what is prayer if God hear not? It is all one whether we babble
          nonsense or plead arguments—if our God grants us not a hearing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          When his case had become dangerous, David could not afford to pray out
          of mere custom, he must succeed in his pleadings, or become the prey
          of his adversary.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 3. For strangers are risen up against me.
          </p></b
        >
        Those who had no cause for ill will had gone against him—people to whom
        he could have given no offence, for they were strangers to him. They
        were aliens to his God also, and should these be allowed to worry and
        destroy him.
        <p align="justify">
          A child may well complain to his father when strangers come in to
          molest him. What right have they to interfere? Let them leave off
          meddling and mind their own concerns.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">And oppressors seek after my soul.</p></b> Saul,
        that persecuting tyrant, had stamped his own image on many more. Kings
        generally coin their own likeness. Saul led the way, and others followed
        seeking David's soul, his blood, his life, his very existence. Cruel and
        intense were they in their malice, they would utterly crush the godly
        man; no half measure would content them.
        <b> <p align="justify">They have not set God before them.</p></b> They
        had no more regard for right and justice than if they knew no God, or
        cared for none. Had they regarded God they would not have betrayed the
        innocent to be hunted down like a poor harmless stag. David felt that
        atheism lay at the bottom of the enmity which pursued him.
        <p align="justify">
          Godly men are hated for God's sake, and this is a good plea for them
          to urge in prayer.
        </p>
        <b> <p align="justify">Selah.</p></b> As if he said, "Enough of this,
        let us pause." He is out of breath with indignation. A sense of wrong
        bids him to suspend the music awhile. It may also be observed, that
        <i>more pauses would, as a rule, improve our devotions</i>. We are
        usually too much in a hurry—a little more holy meditation would make our
        words more suitable and our emotions more fervent.
        <b> <p align="justify">Verse 4. Behold, God is my helper.</p></b> He saw
        enemies everywhere, and now to his joy as he looks upon the band of his
        defenders, he sees one whose aid is better than all the help of men; he
        is overwhelmed with joy at recognizing his divine champion, and cries,<i>
          Behold</i
        >.
        <p align="justify">
          And is not this a theme for pious exultation in all time, that the
          great God protects us, his own people. What does the number or
          violence of our foes matter, when HE uplifts the shield of his
          omnipotence to guard us, and the sword of his power to aid us? Little
          do we care for the defiance of the foe, while we have the defense of
          God.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">The Lord is with those who uphold my soul.</p></b
        >
        The reigning Lord, the great <i>Adonai </i>is in the camp of my
        defenders. Here was a greater champion than any of the three mighties,
        or than all the valiant men who chose David for their captain. The
        psalmist was very confident, he felt so thoroughly that his heart was on
        the Lord's side that he was sure God was on his side.
        <p align="justify">
          He asked in the first verse for divine <i>deliverance</i>, and here he
          returns thanks for divine <i>upholding</i>. While we are seeking one
          mercy which we have not, we must not be unmindful of another which we
          have. It is a great mercy to have some friends left us, but a greater
          mercy still to see the Lord among them, for like so many ciphers our
          friends count for nothing until the Lord sets himself as a great unit
          in the front of them.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. He shall reward evil unto my enemies.
          </p></b
        >
        They worked for evil, and they shall have their wages. It cannot be that
        malice should go unavenged. It would be cruelty to the good, to be
        lenient to their persecutors. It is appointed, and so it must ever be,
        that those who shoot upward the arrows of malice—shall find them fall
        upon themselves1 The recoil of their own gun has often killed
        oppressors.
        <b> <p align="justify">Cut them off in your truth.</p></b> Not in
        ferocious revenge is this spoken, but as an Amen to the sure sentence of
        the just Judge. Let the veracity of your threatenings, be placed beyond
        dispute; the decree is right and just, let it be fulfilled. It is not a
        private desire, but the solemn utterance of a military man, a grossly
        injured man, a public leader destined to be a monarch, and a man well
        trained in the school of Moses, whose law ordains eye for eye, and tooth
        for tooth.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 6. I will freely sacrifice unto you.</p></b
        >
        Spontaneously will I bring my freewill offerings. So certain is he of
        deliverance, that he offers a vow by anticipation. His overflowing
        gratitude would load the altars of God with victims cheerfully
        presented. The more we receive from God, the more we ought to render to
        God. The <i>spontaneousness </i>of our gifts, is a great element in
        their acceptance; the Lord loves a cheerful giver.
        <b> <p align="justify">I will praise your name, O Lord.</p></b> As if no
        amount of sacrifice could express his joyful feelings, he resolves to be
        much in vocal thanksgiving. The name which he invoked in
        <i>prayer </i>(verse 1), he will now magnify in <i>praise</i>.
        <p align="justify">
          Note how roundly he brings it out: O Jehovah. This is ever the grand
          name of the revealed God of Israel, a name which awakens the most
          sublime sentiments, and so nourishes the most acceptable praise. None
          can praise the Lord so well as those who have tried and proved the
          preciousness of his name in seasons of adversity.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          The psalmist adds, <b>for it is good</b>, and surely we may read this
          with a double nominative, God's name is good, and so is his praise. It
          is of great use to our souls to be much in praise. We are never so
          holy or so happy as when our adoration of God abounds. Praise is good
          in itself, good to us, and good to all around us. If David's enemies
          are described in verse 3 as not setting God before them, he here
          declares that he is of a different mind from them, for he resolves to
          have the Lord in perpetual remembrance in his sacrifices and praises.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 7. For he has delivered me out of all trouble.
          </p></b
        >
        Up to that time deliverance had come; and for that danger also he felt
        that rescue was near. David lived a life of dangers and hair—breadth
        escapes—yet he was always safe. In the retrospect of his very many
        deliverances he feels that he must praise God, and looking upon the
        mercy which he sought as though it were already received, he sang this
        song over it—
        <p align="justify">
          "And a new song is in my mouth,<br />
          To long loved music set,<br />
          Glory to you for all the grace<br />
          I have not tasted yet."
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Out of all trouble our covenant God is pledged to bring us, and
          therefore even now let us uplift the note of triumph unto Jehovah, the
          faithful preserver of those who put their trust in him. Thus far have
          we proved his promise good; he changes not, and therefore in all the
          unknown future he will be equally our guardian and defense, "showing
          himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward
          him."
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            And my eye has seen his desire upon my enemies.
          </p></b
        >He knew that yet he should look on his haughty foes, gazing down on
        them in triumph—as now they looked on him in contempt. He desired this
        as a matter of justice, and not of personal pique. His righteous soul
        exulted because he knew that unprovoked malice would meet with a
        righteous punishment.
        <p align="justify">
          Could we keep out of our hearts all personal enmity as fully as the
          psalmist did in this Psalm, we might yet equally feel with him a
          sacred acquiescence and delight in that divine justice which will save
          the righteous and overthrow the malicious.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          In closing, let us trust that if we are as friendless as this man of
          God, we may resort in <i>prayer </i>as he did, exercise the like
          <i>faith</i>, and find ourselves before long <i>singing </i>the same
          joyous hymn of praise.
