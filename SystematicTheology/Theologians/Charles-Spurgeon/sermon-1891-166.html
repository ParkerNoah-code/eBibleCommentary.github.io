          1. If the Father, then, does not exercise judgment, [it follows] that
          judgment does not belong to Him, or that He consents to all those
          actions which take place; and if He does not judge, all persons will
          be equal, and accounted in the same condition. The advent of Christ
          will therefore be without an object, yea, absurd, inasmuch as [in that
          case] He exercises no judicial power. For "He came to divide a man
          against his father, and the daughter against the mother, and the
          daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law;" and when two are in one
          bed, to take the one, and to leave the other; and of two women
          grinding at the mill, to take one and leave the other: [also] at the
          time of the end, to order the reapers to collect first the tares
          together, and bind them in bundles, and burn them with unquenchable
          fire, but to gather up the wheat into the barn; and to call the lambs
          into the kingdom prepared for them, but to send the goats into
          everlasting fire, which has been prepared by His Father for the devil
          and his angels. And why is this? Has the Word come for the ruin and
          for the resurrection of many? For the ruin, certainly, of those who do
          not believe Him, to whom also He has threatened a greater damnation in
          the judgment-day than that of Sodom and Gomorrah; but for the
          resurrection of believers, and those who do the will of His Father in
          heaven. If then the advent of the Son comes indeed alike to all, but
          is for the purpose of judging, and separating the believing from the
          unbelieving, since, as those who believe do His will agreeably to
          their own choice, and as, [also] agreeably to their own choice, the
          disobedient do not consent to His doctrine; it is manifest that His
          Father has made all in a like condition, each person having a choice
          of his own, and a free understanding; and that He has regard to all
          things, and exercises a providence over all, "making His sun to rise
          upon the evil and on the good, and sending rain upon the just and
          unjust."

          2. And to as many as continue in their love towards God, does He grant
          communion with Him. But communion with God is life and light, and the
          enjoyment of all the benefits which He has in store. But on as many
          as, according to their own choice, depart from God, He inflicts that
          separation from Himself which they have chosen of their own accord.
          But separation from God is death, and separation from light is
          darkness; and separation from God consists in the loss of all the
          benefits which He has in store. Those, therefore, who cast away by
          apostasy these forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all
          good, do experience every kind of punishment. God, however, does not
          punish them immediately of Himself, but that punishment falls upon
          them because they are destitute of all that is good. Now, good things
          are eternal and without end with God, and therefore the loss of these
          is also eternal and never-ending. It is in this matter just as occurs
          in the case of a flood of light: those who have blinded themselves, or
          have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived of the enjoyment of
          light. It is not, [however], that the light has inflicted upon them
          the penalty of blindness, but it is that the blindness itself has
          brought calamity upon them: and therefore the Lord declared, "He that
          believeth in Me is not condemned," that is, is not separated from God,
          for he is united to God through faith. On the other hand, He says, "He
          that believeth not is condemned already, because he has not believed
          in the name of the only-begotten Son of God;" that is, he separated
          himself from God of his own accord. "For this is the condemnation,
          that light is come into this world, and men have loved darkness rather
          than light. For every one who doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh
          not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth
          truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that
          he has wrought them in God."<br />
