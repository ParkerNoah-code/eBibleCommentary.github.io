        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.70)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, March 16, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>"Zealous of good works." -- Titus 2:14.</p>
        <p>
          WE SHALL not be afraid of leading any of you into a legal spirit this
          morning through what we shall say, for after our frequent exhortations
          to avoid anything like trusting in your works, attended as they have
          been, we trust, by the Holy Spirit, we are not afraid that you will so
          misunderstand us, as to suppose that when we speak of good works,
          to-day, we shall in any way whatsoever wish you to imagine that they
          can promote your eternal salvation. We laboured when here the Sabbath
          morning before last, to let you know the difference between the two
          covenants, the covenant of grace and the covenant of works; we shall
          beg you to remember what we then said, and if by any slips of the
          tongue we should say anything that should look like legality, we beg
          you will put the two together, and wherein we shall err from the great
          truth of justification by faith, to reject our testimony.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zealous of good works." There are some who hear us preach high
          doctrine, and constantly declare that we are saved by grace through
          faith, and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God, who,
          therefore, suppose that we cannot preach good works, and that we could
          not preach a good sermon of exhortation to Christians, to live in
          holiness. Well, we will not say that we can preach a good sermon, but
          we will say that we will try and preach one as to that matter that
          shall be as good as theirs, and as much lead the children of God to
          live in holiness as any of their exhortations can do, grounded as they
          are on trusting in the flesh, and based as they are on threatenings,
          regulations and promises, which they hope will induce God's children,
          but which are well enough for slaves, though of little avail in
          operating on the true-born believer. The children of God are a holy
          people; -- for this very purpose were they born and brought into the
          world, that they should be holy; for this they were redeemed with
          blood and made a peculiar people. God's end in election, the end of
          all his purposes, is not answered until they become a people "zealous
          of good works."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this morning, we shall first of all tell you the nature of good
          works, for there are many things called good works that are not so at
          all; secondly, we shall trace good works to their origin -- find where
          good works come from; thirdly, we shall attempt to show you the use of
          good works; and we shall close up by endeavoring to prove that our
          doctrines, those of free, distinguishing, discriminating grace, have a
          tendency to make us who believe them "zealous of good works."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we are about to answer the question, WHAT ARE GOOD
          WORKS? Now, I dare say we shall offend many here when we tell them
          what good works are; for in our opinion good works are the rarest
          things in the world, and we believe we might walk for many a mile
          before we should see a good work at all. We use the word good now in
          its proper sense. There are many works which are good enough between
          man and man, but we shall use the word good in a higher sense to-day
          as regards God. We think we shall be able to show you that there are
          very few good works anywhere, and that there are none out of the pale
          of Christ's church. We think, if we read Scripture rightly, that no
          work can be good unless it is commanded of God. How this cuts off a
          large portion of what men will do in order to win salvation! The
          Pharisee said he tithed mint, anise, and cummin; could he prove that
          God commanded him to tithe his mint, his anise, and his cummin?
          Perhaps not. He said he fasted so many times a week; could he prove
          that God told him to fast? If not, his fasting was no obedience. If I
          do a thing that I am not commanded to do, I do not obey in doing it.
          Vain, then, are all the pretences of men, that by mortifying their
          bodies, by denying their flesh, by doing this, that, or the other,
          they shall therefore win the favour of God. No work is good unless God
          has commanded it. A man may build a long row of almshouses, but if he
          build without reference to the commandment, he has performed no good
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: nothing is a good work unless it is done with a good motive;
          and there is no motive which can be said to be good but the glory of
          God. He who performs good works with a view to save himself, does not
          do them from a good motive, because his motive is selfish. He who does
          them also to gain the esteem of his fellows and for the good of
          society, has a laudable motive, so far as man is concerned; but it is,
          after all, an inferior motive. -- What end had we in view? If for the
          benefit of our fellow-creatures, then let our fellow-creatures pay us;
          but that has nought to do with God. Work is not good, unless a man
          does it with a view to God's glory, and he has been brought into
          subjection to God's divine will, so that in everything he has an eye
          to the Most High, and works in order to promote his glory and honor in
          the world. And even, beloved, when our works are done from the best
          motives, nothing is a good work unless it is done with faith; for
          "without faith it is impossible to please God." Like Cain, we may
          build the altar, and lay the first fruits of the salt of faith, there
          it will lie -- it will not be accepted by God, for without faith it is
          impossible to please him. Bring me a man who all his life long has
          been spending his health and strength for his fellow-creatures; fetch
          me some public officer, who has fully discharged his trust, who has
          laboured night and day, even to the wearing down of his constitution,
          because he believed that England expected every man to do his duty,
          and he wished to do it; bring me that man; let me see all his
          charitable works; let me witness the most lavish benevolence, the most
          profuse bounty; tell me that he has always, with a consistent motive,
          laboured for his country; and then, if he cannot answer this question.
          "Dost thou believe in the Son of God?" I shall be bound in all honesty
          to tell him that he has not done a solitary good work in all his life,
          so far as God is concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, when we have faith in God, and perform all our works with
          the best of motives, even then we have not so much as a solitary good
          work, until the blood of Christ is sprinkled thereon. Looking on all
          that we have ever done in our lives, can we find a solitary thing
          which we dare call good until Christ's blood is put upon it? Grant
          there is something good about it, for the Spirit wrought it in our
          souls; there is much also that is evil about it, for even our best
          exercises are so terribly spoiled, marred, and ruined by the sins and
          imperfections that are in them, that we dare not call them good, until
          Jesus Christ hath sprinkled them with his blood, and taken the stain
          away. Oh how often have I thought to myself, "Now, I have laboured to
          preach God's word; I have not spared, at all times, before friends or
          foes, and I hope I have not shunned to declare the whole counsel of
          God!" And yet, beloved, how many of those sermons have not been good
          works at all, because I had not an eye to my Master's honor at the
          time, or because there was not faith mixed with them but I preached in
          a desponding, low, miserable frame; or, perhaps, I had some natural
          aim, even in the winning of souls; for I have often feared, even when
          we rejoice to see souls converted, that we may have some evil motive,
          such as honoring ourselves, that the world may say, "See how many
          souls are brought to God by him!" And even when the church associates
          in doing holy works, have you not noticed that something selfish
          creeps in -- a wish to exalt our own church, to glorify our own
          people, and to make ourselves mighty. I am sure, beloved, if you sit
          down and pull your good works to pieces, you will find so many bad
          stitches in them that they need to be all unstitched and done over
          again. There are so many spots and blurs about them, that you need to
          have them washed in the blood of Christ to make them good for
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, do you think you have any good works? "Oh!" you say
          "I am afraid I have not many myself-nay, I know I have not; but thanks
          be unto his love, he who accepted my person in Christ, accepts my
          works through Christ; and he who blessed me in him, that I should be a
          chosen vessel, has been pleased to accept that which he himself poured
          into the vessel, to the praise of the glory of his grace, where he
          hath made me accepted in the beloved.'"
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, ye moralists, ye who have trusted in yourselves that ye are
          righteous, if what I have said be true, what has become of all your
          holiness? You are saying "I am a charitable man." Grant that you are!
          I tell you to go and appeal to your fellow-creatures, and let them pay
          you for your charity. You say, "Ay, but I am a consistent and moral
          man. I am a great credit to the country; if all men would act as I do,
          what a good thing for this world and generation!" Of course you have
          served your generation. Then send in your bill, and let your
          generation pay you. I tell you, you have toiled for nought; you have
          only sown the wind, and likely enough you will reap the whirlwind. God
          owes you nothing; you have not lived to his honor; you must honestly
          confess that you have not performed a single action with a desire to
          please him; you have laboured to please yourself -- that has been the
          highest motive you have had; you felt that if you were good you would
          go to heaven, and that if you were evil you would be sure to go to
          hell. You have been thoroughly selfish, from first to last. Reckon up
          your accounts and settle with yourself. God owes you nothing; you have
          done nothing for him; and if you have, then consider within yourself,
          you have so much violated God's commands, and so frequently done all
          you could to injure your Maker, if it were possible, that all your
          accounts are easily struck off. And as for your good works, where are
          they? Where are they? Ah! it is a figment and a fiction, a laugh and a
          dream. Good works in sinners? There are no such things. Augustine well
          said, "Good works, as they are called, in sinners, are nothing but
          splendid sins." This is true of the best works of the best man, who is
          out of Christ, they are nothing but splendid sins -- vanished sins.
          God forgive you, dear friends, for your good works! You have as great
          need to be forgiven for your good works as you have for your bad ones,
          if you are out of Christ; for I reckon they are both alike, bad, if
          they come to be sifted.
        </p>
        <p>II. And now, secondly, WHERE DO GOOD WORKS COME FROM?</p>
        <p>
          It is an old maxim, that nature can never rise above itself. Water,
          coming from the top of a hill, will rise as high as its source; but
          unless there is some extraordinary pressure put upon it, it will never
          rise higher. So of human nature, Scripture says it is exceedingly
          vile; we cannot expect good works out of an evil nature. Can a bitter
          well send forth sweet water? As poison groweth not on healthful trees,
          with healthful fruit, so cannot healthy fruit grow on poisonous trees.
          We must not look for good works in an evil nature any more than we
          should look for the grapes of Sorek on the vines of Gomorrah. We
          cannot expect to find good works coming from nature; truly it is vain
          and idle to think that good works can arise from the natural man.
          "Where, then," you ask, "do they come from?" We answer, good works
          come from a real conversion, brought about by the Spirit of God. Until
          our conversion, there is not the shadow of goodness about us. In the
          eye of the world we may be reputable and respectable, but in the eye
          of God we are nothing of the sort. Could we look into our hearts, as
          we sometimes look into other people's faces, we should see very much
          there which would drive out of our souls the very imagination of good
          works before our heart is changed. How many things there are in the
          world, which we have upon our tables and which we even eat, that if we
          were to put beneath our microscope we should be afraid to touch, for
          we should see all kinds of loathsome creatures creeping and crawling
          about in them -- such things as we never conceived! and so it is with
          human nature. When once the human heart is put under the microscope of
          Scripture, and we see it with a spiritual eye, we see it to be so vile
          and filthy, that we are quite sure that until we have a new heart and
          a right spirit, it would be just as impossible to expect to find good
          works in an unrighteous, unconverted man, as to hope to see fire
          burning in the midst of the ocean. The two things would be
          incongruous. Our good works, if we have any, spring from a real
          conversion; yet more, they spring also from a constant spiritual
          influence exercised upon us, from the time of conversion even until
          the hour of death. Ah! Christian, thou wouldst have no good works if
          thou hadst no fresh influence day by day. Thou wouldst not find the
          grace given thee at the first hour sufficient to produce fruit to-day.
          It is not like the planting of a tree in our hearts, which naturally
          of itself bringeth forth fruit; but the sap cometh up from the root of
          Jesus Christ. We are not trees by ourselves, but we are branches fixed
          on the living vine. Good works, I know whence you come! Ye come
          floating down on the stream of grace, and if I did not have that
          stream of grace always flowing, I should never find good works coming
          from me. Good works from the creature? Impossible! Good works are the
          gifts of God, his choice pearls, which he sendeth down with his grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again: we think that good works spring from union with Christ. We
          believe that the more a man knows and feels himself to be one with
          Jesus, the more holy will he be. The very fact that Christ and the
          Christian become one, makes the Christian Christ-like. Why is a
          Christian's character like Christ's character? Only for this reason,
          that is joined and united to the Lord Jesus Christ. Why doth that
          branch bring forth grapes? Simply because it has been engrafted into
          the vine, and therefore it partakes of the nature of the stem. So,
          Christian, the only way whereby thou canst bring forth fruit to God is
          by being grafted into Christ and united with him. You Christians who
          think you can walk in holiness without keeping up perpetual fellowship
          with Christ have made a great mistake. If you would be holy, you must
          live close to Jesus. Good works spring only thence. Hence we draw the
          most powerful reasons against anything like trusting in works; for as
          works are only the gift of God, how utterly impossible does it become
          for an unrighteous, unconverted, ungodly man, to produce any such good
          works in himself. And if they are God's gifts, how little merit can
          there be in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. We have thus tried to trace good works to their origin and
          foundation. And now we come to the third point, which is, WHAT IS THE
          USE OF GOOD WORKS?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am rather fond of being called an Antinomian, for this reason, that
          the term generally applied to those who hold truth very firmly and
          will not let it go. But I should not be fond of being an Antinomian.
          We are not against the law of God. We believe it is no longer binding
          on us as the covenant of salvation; but we have nothing to say against
          the law of God. "The law is holy; we are carnal, sold under sin." None
          shall charge us truthfully with being Antinomians. We do quarrel with
          Antinomians; but as for some poor souls, who are so inconsistent as to
          say the law is not binding, and yet try to keep it with all their
          might, we do not quarrel with them! they will never do much mischief;
          but we think they might learn to distinguish between the law as a
          covenant of life and a direction after we have obtained life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, we do love good works. Do you ask, of what use are they? I
          reply, first: Good works are useful as evidences of grace. The
          Antinomian says, -- But I do not require evidences; I can live without
          them. This is unreasonable. Do you see yonder clock? That is the
          evidence of the time of day. The hour would be precisely the same if
          we had not that evidence. Still, we find the clock of great use. So we
          say, good works are the best evidence of spiritual life in the soul.
          Is it not written, "We know that we have passed from death unto life,
          because we love the brethren?" Loving the brethren is a good work.
          Again, "If any man abide in me, he shall bring forth fruit." Fruits of
          righteousness are good works, and they are evidence that we abide in
          Christ. If I am living in sin day by day, what right have I to
          conclude I am a child of God? A man comes to this chapel, and while he
          hears the gospel, he exclaims, "What delicious truth! what heavenly
          doctrine!" Yet when he leaves the place, you may see him enter one
          public-house for another, and get intoxicated. Has this man any right
          to think himself an heir of heaven? The man who comes to God's house,
          and drinks "wine on the lees, well refined," and then goes away and
          drinks the cup and enjoys the company of the ungodly, gives no
          evidence that he is a partaker of divine grace. He says, "I do not
          like good works." Of course he does not. "I know I shall not be saved
          by good works." Of this we are certain, for he has none to be saved
          by. Many are ready enough to say,
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to the cross I cling;"</p>
        <p>
          who believe they are children of God, because, though they have no
          good works as evidence, they think they have faith. Ah, sir! you have
          faith, and there is another gentleman quite as respectable as you are,
          who has faith; I shall not tell you his name this morning, but he is
          better than you are, for it is said, "He believes and trembles," while
          you sit unmoved by the most powerful appeals. Yes you who think you
          are children of God while you live in sin, you are in the most
          dreadful error. There is no delusion, if you except the delusion of
          the Pharisee, which is more dreadful than the delusion of a man, who
          thinks that sin and grace can reign together. The Christian has sins
          of heart, over which he groans and laments, but as regards his outward
          life, he is kept, so that the evil one touches him not; the Lord keeps
          him under the shadow of his wing; he doth not, except in some falls,
          allow him to turn out of the way. Works are the evidence of our faith;
          by faith our souls are justified before God; by works our faith is
          justified before ourselves and fellow-men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we think good works are the witnesses or testimony to other
          people of the truth of what we believe. Every Christian was sent into
          the world to be a preacher; and just like every other creature that
          God has made, he will always be preaching about his Lord. Doth not the
          whole world preach God? Do not the stars, while they shine, look down
          from heaven and say there is a God? Do not the winds chaunt God's name
          in their mighty howling? Do not the waves murmur it upon the shore, or
          thunder it in the storms? Do not the floods and the fields, the skies
          and the plains, the mountains and the valleys, the streamlets and the
          rivers, all speak for God? Assuredly they do; and a new-born creature
          -- the man created in Christ -- must preach Jesus Christ wherever he
          goes. This is the use of good works. He will preach, not with his
          mouth always, but with his life. The use of good works is, that they
          are a Christian's sermon. A sermon is not what a man says, but what he
          does. You who practice are preaching; it is not preaching and
          practising, but practising is preaching. The sermon that is preached
          by the mouth is soon forgotten, but what we preach by our lives is
          never forgotten. There is nothing like faithful practice and holy
          living, if we would preach to the world. The reason why Christianity
          does not advance with a mightier stride, is simply this: -- that
          professors are in a large measure a disgrace to religion, and many of
          those who are joined to the church have no more godliness than those
          who are out of it. If I preached such a contradictory sermon on a
          Sunday as some of you have preached the most part of your lives, you
          would go out and say, "We will not go again till he can be a little
          more consistent with himself." There is a difference in the very tone
          of the voice of some people when they are in the chapel engaged in
          prayer, and when they are in the workshop; you would hardly think them
          the same persons. Out upon your inconsistency! Professors, take heed
          lest your inconsistencies should blot your evidence, and some of you
          should be found manifesting, not inconsistency, but a most fearful
          consistency, because living in sin and iniquity, and therefore being
          consistent with yourselves in hypocrisy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the third place, good works are of us to a Christian as an
          adornment. You will all remember that passage in the Scriptures, which
          tells us how a woman should adorn herself. "Whose adorning let it not
          be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold,
          or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the
          heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek
          and quiet spirit." The adornment of good works, the adornment in which
          we hope to enter heaven, is the blood and righteousness of Jesus
          Christ; but the adornment of a Christian here below, is his holiness,
          his piety, his consistency. If some people had a little more piety,
          they would not require such a showy dress; if they had a little more
          godliness, to set them off, they would have no need whatever to be
          always decorating themselves. The best ear-rings that a woman can
          wear, are the ear-rings of hearing the Word with attention. The very
          best ring that we can have upon our finger is the ring which the
          father puts upon the finger of the prodigal son, when he is brought
          back; and the very best dress we can ever wear, is a garment wrought
          by the Holy Spirit, the garment of a consistent conduct. But it is
          marvellous, while many are taking all the trouble they can to array
          this poor body, they have very few ornaments for their soul; they
          forgot to dress the soul. Oh! no; they are too late at chapel, all
          because of that other pin, which they might have left out. They come
          here just when the service is beginning, because, forsooth, they have
          so much to put on, they could not be expected to be here in time. And
          there are Christian men and Christian women, who forget what God has
          written in his word, which is as true now as ever it was, that
          Christian women should array themselves with modesty. It would be a
          good thing, perhaps, if we went back to Wesley's rule, to come out
          from the world in our apparel, and to dress as plainly and neatly as
          the Quakers, though alas! they have sadly gone from their primitive
          simplicity. I am obliged to depart a little sometimes, from what we
          call the high things of the gospel; for really the children of God
          cannot now be told by outward appearance from the children of the
          devil, and they really ought to be; there should be some distinction
          between the one and the other; and although religion allows
          distinction of rank and dress, yet everything in the Bible cries out
          against our arraying ourselves, and making ourselves proud, by reason
          of the goodliness of our apparel. Some will say, "I wish you would
          leave that alone!" Of course you do, because it applies to yourself.
          But we let nothing alone which we believe to be in the Scriptures; and
          while I would not spare any man's soul, honesty to every man's
          conscience and honesty to myself demands, that I should always speak
          of that which I see to be an evil breaking out in the Church. We
          should always take care that in everything we keep as near as possible
          to the written Word. If you want ornaments here they are. Here are
          jewels, rings, dresses, and all kinds of ornament; men and women, ye
          may dress yourselves up till ye shine like angels. How can you do it?
          By dressing yourselves out in benevolence, in love to the saints, in
          honesty and integrity, in uprightness, in godliness, in
          brotherly-kindness, in charity. These are the ornaments which angels
          themselves admire, and which even the word will admire; for men must
          give admiration to the man or the woman who is arrayed in the jewels
          of a holy life and godly conversation. I beseech you, brethren, "adorn
          the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Thus have I told you the use of good works. Now just a moment or
          two to tell you that the religion which we profess in this place, and
          which we preach, is CALCULATED TO PRODUCE GOOD WORKS IN THE CHILD OF
          GOD.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some say that what is called Calvinism, which is an alias for the true
          gospel, is calculated to lead men into sin. Now, we will refute that,
          just by reminding them, that the holiest people in the world have been
          those who professed the doctrine which we hold. If you ask who in the
          dark ages were the great moral lights of the world, the answer will
          be, such as Athanasius, Ambrose, Chrysostom; and then coming lower
          still, such men as Wickliffe, Jerome of Prague, and Calvin; and every
          one of these held the doctrines which we love to proclaim. And just
          let me remind you, there never were better men in the world than the
          Puritans, and every one of them held fast the truth we love. I
          happened to find in a book the other day a statement which pleased me
          so much, that I thought I would read it to you. The writer says, "The
          Puritans were the most resolved Protestants in the nation; zealous
          Calvinists; warm and affectionate preachers. They were the most pious
          and devout people in the land; men of prayer in secret and in public,
          as well as in their families. Their manner of devotion was fervent and
          solemn, depending on the assistance of the Divine Spirit. They had a
          profound reverence for the holy name of God, and were great enemies
          not only to profane swearing, but to foolish talking and jesting. They
          were strict observers of the Lord's day, spending the whole of it in
          public and private devotion and charity. It was the distinguishing
          mark of a Puritan, in these times, to see him going to church twice a
          day, with his Bible under his arm; and while others were at plays and
          interludes, at revels, or walking in the fields, or at the diversions
          of bowling, fencing, &amp;c., on the eve of the Sabbath, these with
          their families were employed in reading the Scriptures, singing
          psalms, repeating sermons, catechising their children, and prayer. Nor
          was this the work only of the Lord's day, but they had their hours of
          family devotion in the week days; they were circumspect, as to all
          excess in eating and drinking, apparel, and lawful diversions; being
          frugal, industrious, exact in their dealings, and solicitous to give
          every one his own." That is a noble testimony to puritanic truth and
          the power of the gospel. But I have one, which I think will please
          you, in another part of the book. A learned Infidel says of the modern
          Calvinists and Jansenists, that "When compared with their antagonists,
          they have excelled, in no small degree, in the most rigid and
          respectable virtues; that they have been an honor to their own age,
          and the best model for imitation to every age succeeding." Only think
          of an infidel speaking like that. I think it was an infidel that said,
          "Go the Arminians to hear about good works; but go to the Calvinists
          to see them exhibited." And even Dr. Priestly, who was a Unitarian,
          admits that, "They who hold the doctrines of grace, have less apparent
          conformity to the world, and more of a principle of real religion,
          than his own followers: and that they who, from a principle of
          religion, ascribe more to God and less to man than others, have the
          greatest elevation of piety."
        </p>
        <p>
          And just now, as the Unitarians are bringing up all their great men --
          so great that we never heard their names to this day -- and
          endeavouring to do all they can in London, to bring people to
          Unitarianism, we would just tell them this fact. Dr. Priestly ascribes
          the coolness of Unitarianism to their becoming more indifferent to
          religious doctrine -- and accounts for the fact of their chapels not
          being well attended, by saying that Unitarians have a very slight
          attachment to their religious doctrines. What a mercy! for if they
          continued to hold them, they would inevitably be lost. A man who
          denies the divinity of Christ is sure to be lost. It is idle for them
          to talk of their being Christians; they might as well talk of being
          holy angels. The best proof I can give you of the holy tendency of our
          doctrines is this great fact, viz.: -- That in every age those who
          have held the doctrines of grace have exhibited in their lives a holy
          walk and conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once more: in just hastily running over the doctrines, we ask,
          what could more tend to make men holy, than the truths we preach? Do
          we not teach you, that God has chosen to himself a people who must be
          holy? Is that an unholy doctrine? Do we not tell you that God has
          chosen to himself a people who in this world shall show forth his
          praise, by holy living? Is that an unholy doctrine? And we have told
          you that the Holy Ghost gives a new heart, and a right spirit, and
          that there is something more required than you can do yourselves; that
          you are unable to perform such good things as God expects from you,
          therefore God the Spirit must renovate you. Do you call that an unholy
          doctrine? Is the doctrine, that men by nature are vile and need
          renewing grace, unholy? And the doctrine that the true saints will
          certainly hold on to the end: is that unholy? Methinks the contrary to
          these doctrines are the most unholy in the world. Is the doctrine that
          only those who believe have an interest in the blood of Christ an
          unholy thing? Is the doctrine that I preach, that Christ has redeemed
          only such as live in holiness, having been brought thereto by the Holy
          Ghost, an unholy thing? Methinks not. We challenge all those who love
          to speak against our doctrines to prove that there is a single one of
          them which has an unholy tendency. Charge us with not holding good
          works? Come and try to get into our church, and you will soon have a
          proof that you are wrong. Why, we would not have you, sir, if you
          would give us a thousand pounds, unless we considered you were a holy
          man. If you have not good works, it will be a long time before we will
          receive you; and if you were to steal into our church, you would be
          turned out in a week, if you lived in sin and unrighteousness; for it
          would soon be reported to the pastor and deacons, and you would see
          whether we did not hold the necessity of good works. If you did not
          exhibit them every day we would cast you out from amongst us, and have
          no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
          reprove them. Our church order is the best refutation of the calumny.
        </p>
        <p>
          What more can we say, then? We hope we have proved our points to all
          honest and consistent men. We only send you away, ye hypocrites, with
          this ringing in your ears, "Except ye have the spirit of Christ, ye
          are none of his." Except ye live like Christ, ye shall not be with
          Christ at last; if your spirit be not sanctified in this world, you
          will not find that God will sanctify you when you come before his
          throne. But you, poor sinners, who have no holiness of your own, and
          no good works at all; I know you have not any, because you are not a
          child of God. Do you feel that you have not? Come then, and Christ
          will give you some: he will give you himself. If you believe on the
          Lord Jesus, he will wash you from all your sins, give you a new heart,
          and henceforth your life shall be holy, your conduct shall be
          consistent, he shall keep you to the end, and you shall most assuredly
          be saved. God bless this testimony to any such as are living in sin,
          that they may be reclaimed from it; for Christ's sake! Amen.<br />
