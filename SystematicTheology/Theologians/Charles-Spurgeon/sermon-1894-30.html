          All wisdom cometh from the Lord,<br />And is with him for ever.<br />The
          sand of the seas,<br />And the drops of rain,<br />And the days of
          eternity, who shall number?<br />The height of the heaven,<br />And
          the breadth of the earth, and the deep,<br />And wisdom, who shall
          search them out?<br />Wisdom hath been created before all things,<br />And
          the understanding of prudence from everlasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed?<br />And who hath known
          her shrewd counsels?<br />There is one wise,<br />Greatly to be
          feared,<br />The Lord sitting upon his throne:<br />He created her,<br />And
          saw, and numbered her,<br />And poured her out upon all his works.<br />She
          is with all flesh according to his gift;<br />And he gave her freely
          to them that love him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fear of the Lord<br />Is glory and exultation,<br />And gladness,
          and a crown of rejoicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fear of the Lord<br />Shall delight the heart,<br />And shall give
          gladness, and joy, and length of days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoso feareth the Lord,<br />It shall go well with him at the last,<br />And
          in the day of his death he shall be blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fear the Lord<br />Is the beginning of wisdom;<br />And it was
          created together with the faithful in the womb. With men she laid an
          eternal foundation;<br />And with their seed shall she be had in
          trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fear the Lord<br />Is the fulness of wisdom;<br />And she satiateth
          men with her fruits.<br />She shall fill all her house with desirable
          things, And her garners with her produce.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fear of the Lord<br />Is the crown of wisdom,<br />Making peace
          and perfect health to flourish.<br />He both saw and numbered her;<br />He
          rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, And exalted the
          honour of them that hold her fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fear the Lord<br />Is the root of wisdom;<br />And her branches are
          length of days.
