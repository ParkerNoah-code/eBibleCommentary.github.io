        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1850)</p>
        <p>Intended for reading on Lord's-Day, July 26th, 1885,</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington,</p>
        <p>On the evening of June 7th, 1885</p>
        <p>
          "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
          whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
          life." -- John 3:16
        </p>
        <p>
          I WAS very greatly surprised the other day, in looking over the list
          of texts from which I have preached, to find that I have no record of
          ever having spoken from this verse. This is all the more singular,
          because I can truly say that it might be put in the forefront of all
          my volumes of discourses as the sole topic of my life's ministry. It
          has been my one and only business to set forth the love of God to men
          in Christ Jesus. I heard lately of an aged minister of whom it was
          said, "Whatever his text, he never failed to set forth God as love,
          and Christ as the atonement for sin." I wish that much the same may be
          said of me. My heart's desire has been to sound forth as with a
          trumpet the good news that "God so loved the world, that he gave his
          only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
          but have everlasting life."
        </p>
        <p>
          We are about to meet around the communion table, and I cannot preach
          from this text anything but a simple gospel sermon. Can you desire a
          better preparation for communion? We have fellowship with God and with
          one another upon the basis of the infinite love which is displayed in
          Jesus Christ our Lord. The gospel is the fair white linen cloth which
          covers the table on which the Communion Feast is set. The higher
          truths, those truths which belong to a more enlightened experience,
          those richer truths which tell of the fellowship of the higher life --
          all these are helpful to holy fellowship; but I am sure not more so
          than those elementary and foundation truths which were the means of
          our first entrance into the kingdom of God. Babes in Christ and men in
          Christ here feed upon one common food. Come, ye aged saints, be
          children again; and you that have long known your Lord, take up your
          first spelling-book, and go over your A B C again, by learning that
          God so loved the world, that he gave his Son to die, that man might
          live through him. I do not call you to an elementary lesson because
          you have forgotten your letters, but because it is a good thing to
          refresh the memory, and a blessed thing to feel young again. What the
          old folks used to call the Christ-cross Row contained nothing but the
          letters; and yet all the books in the language are made out of that
          line: therefore do I call you back to the cross, and to him who bled
          thereon. It is a good things for us all to return at times to our
          starting place, and make sure that we are in the way everlasting. The
          love of our espousals is most likely to continue if we again and again
          begin where God began with us, and where we first began with God. It
          is wise to come to him afresh, as we came in that first day when,
          helpless, needy, heavy-laden, we stood weeping at the cross, and left
          our burden at the pierced feet. There we learned to look, and live,
          and love; and there would we repeat the lesson till we rehearse it
          perfectly in glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          To-night, we have to talk about the love of God: "God so loved the
          world." That love of God is a very wonderful thing, especially when we
          see it set upon a lost, ruined, guilty world. What was there in the
          world that God should love it? There was nothing lovable in it. No
          fragrant flower grew in that arid desert. Enmity to him, hatred to his
          truth, disregard of his law, rebellion against his commandments; those
          were the thorns and briars which covered the waste land; but no
          desirable thing blossomed there. Yet, "God loved the world," says the
          text; "so" loved it, that even the writer of the book of John could
          not tell us how much; but so greatly, so divinely, did he love it that
          he gave his Son, his only Son, to redeem the world from perishing, and
          to gather out of it a people to his praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence came that love? Not from anything outside of God himself. God's
          love springs from himself. He loves because it is his nature to do so.
          "God is love." As I have said already, nothing upon the face of the
          earth could have merited his love, though there was much to merit his
          displeasure. This stream of love flows from its own secret source in
          the eternal Deity, and it owes nothing to any earth-born rain or
          rivulet; it springs from beneath the everlasting throne, and fills
          itself full from the springs of the infinite. God loved because he
          would love. When we enquire why the Lord loved this man or that, we
          have to come back to our Saviour's answer to the question, "Even so,
          Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight." God has such love in his
          nature that he must needs let it flow forth to a world perishing by
          its own wilful sin; and when it flowed forth it was so deep, so wide,
          so strong, that even inspiration could not compute its measure, and
          therefore the Holy Spirit gave us that great little word SO, and left
          us to attempt the measurement, according as we perceive more and more
          of love divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there happened to be an occasion upon which the great God could
          display his immeasurable love. The world had sadly gone astray; the
          world had lost itself; the world was tried and condemned; the world
          was given over to perish, because of its offenses; and there was need
          for help. The fall of Adam and the destruction of mankind made ample
          room and verge enough for love almighty. Amid the ruins of humanity
          there was space for showing how much Jehovah loved the sons of men;
          for the compass of his love was no less than the world, the object of
          it no less than to deliver men from going down to the pit, and the
          result of it no less than the finding of a ransom for them. The
          far-reaching purpose of that love was both negative and positive;
          that, believing in Jesus, men might not perish, but have eternal life.
          The desperate disease of man gave occasion for the introduction of
          that divine remedy which God alone could have devised and supplied. By
          the plan of mercy, and the great gift which was needed for carrying it
          out, the Lord found means to display his boundless love to guilty men.
          Had there been no fall, and no perishing, God might have shown his
          love to us as he does to the pure and perfect spirits that surround
          his throne; but he never could have commended his love to us to such
          an extent as he now does. In the gift of his only-begotten Son, God
          commended his love to us, in that while we were yet sinners, in due
          time Christ died for the ungodly. The black background of sin makes
          the bright line of love shine out the more clearly. When the lightning
          writes the name of the Lord with flaming finger across the black brow
          of the tempest, we are compelled to see it; so when love inscribes the
          cross upon the jet tablet of our sin, even blind eyes must see that
          "herein is love."
        </p>
        <p>
          I might handle my text in a thousand different ways to-night; but for
          simplicity's sake, and to keep to the one point of setting forth the
          love of God, I want to make you see how great that love is by five
          different particulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first is the GIFT: "God so loved the world, that he gave his
          only begotten Son." Consider, then, what this gift was that God gave.
          I should have to labour for expression if I were to attempt to set
          forth to the full this priceless boon; and I will not court a failure
          by attempting the impossible. I will only invite you to think of the
          sacred Person whom the Great Father gave in order that he might prove
          his love to men. It was his only-begotten Son -- his beloved Son, in
          whom he was well pleased. None of us had ever such a son to give. Ours
          are the sons of men; his was the Son of God. The Father gave his other
          self, one with himself. When the great God gave his Son he gave God
          himself, for Jesus is not in his eternal nature less than God. When
          God gave God for us he gave himself. What more could he give? God gave
          his all: he gave himself. Who can measure this love?
        </p>
        <p>
          Judge, ye fathers, how ye love your sons: could ye give them to die
          for your enemy? Judge, ye that have an only son, how your hearts are
          entwined about your first-born, your only-begotten. There was no
          higher proof of Abraham's love to God than when he did not withhold
          from God his son, his only son, his Isaac whom he loved; and there can
          certainly be no greater display of love than for the Eternal Father to
          give his only-begotten Son to die for us. No living thing will readily
          lose its offspring; man has peculiar grief when his son is taken; has
          not God yet more? A story has often been told of the fondness of
          parents for their children how in a famine in the East a father and
          mother were reduced to absolute starvation, and the only possibility
          of preserving the life of the family was to sell one of the children
          into slavery. So they considered it. The pinch of hunger became
          unbearable, and their children pleading for bread tugged so painfully
          at their heart-strings, that they must entertain the idea of selling
          one to save the lives of the rest. They had four sons. Who of these
          should be sold? It must not be the first: how could they spare their
          first-born? The second was so strangely like his father that he seemed
          a reproduction of him, and the mother said that she would never part
          with him. The third was so singularly like the mother that the father
          said he would sooner die than that this dear boy should go into
          bondage; and as for the fourth, he was their Benjamin, their last,
          their darling, and they could not part with him. They concluded that
          it were better for them all to die together than willingly to part
          with any one of their children. Do you not sympathize with them? I see
          you do. Yet God so loved us that, to put it very strongly, he seemed
          to love us better than his only Son, and did not spare him that he
          might spare us. He permitted his Son to perish from among men "that
          whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have everlasting
          life."
        </p>
        <p>
          If you desire to see the love of God in this great procedure you must
          consider how he gave his Son. He did not give his Son, as you might
          do, to some profession in the pursuit of which you might still enjoy
          his company; but he gave his Son to exile among men. He sent him down
          to yonder manger, united with a perfect manhood, which at the first
          was in an infant's form. There he slept, where horned oxen fed! The
          Lord God sent the heir of all things to toil in a carpenter's shop: to
          drive the nail, and push the plane, and use the saw. He sent him down
          amongst scribes and Pharisees, whose cunning eyes watched him, and
          whose cruel tongues scourged him with base slanders. He sent him down
          to hunger, and thirst, amid poverty so dire that he had not where to
          lay his head. He sent him down to the scourging and the crowning with
          thorns, to the giving of his back to the smiters and his cheeks to
          those that plucked off the hair. At length he gave him up to death --
          a felon's death, the death of the crucified. Behold that cross and see
          the anguish of him that dies upon it, and mark how the Father has so
          given him, that he hides his face from him, and seems as if he would
          not own him! "Lama sabachthani" tells us how fully God gave his Son to
          ransom the souls of the sinful. He gave him to be made a curse for us;
          gave him that he might die "the just for the unjust, to bring us to
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear sirs, I can understand your giving up your children to go to
          India on her Majesty's service, or to go out to the Cameroons or the
          Congo upon the errands of our Lord Jesus. I can well comprehend your
          yielding them up even with the fear of a pestilential climate before
          you, for if they die they will die honourably in a glorious cause; but
          could you think of parting with them to die a felon's death, upon a
          gibbet, execrated by those whom they sought to bless, stripped naked
          in body and deserted in mind? Would not that be too much? Would you
          not cry, "I cannot part with my son for such wretches as these. Why
          should he be put to a cruel death for such abominable beings, who even
          wash their hands in the blood of their best friend"? Remember that our
          Lord Jesus died what his countrymen considered to be an accursed
          death. To the Romans it was the death of a condemned slave, a death
          which had all the elements of pain, disgrace, and scorn mingled in it
          to the uttermost. "But God commendeth his love to- ward us, in that,
          while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Oh, wondrous stretch
          of love, that Jesus Christ should die!
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, I cannot leave this point till I have you notice when God gave
          his Son, for there is love in the time. "God so loved the world that
          he gave his Only Begotten Son." But when did he do that? In his
          eternal purpose he did this from before the foundation of the world.
          The words here used, "He gave his Only Begotten Son," cannot relate
          exclusively to the death of Christ, for Christ was not dead at the
          time of the utterance of this third chapter of John. Our Lord had just
          been speaking with Nicodemus, and that conversation took place at the
          beginning of his ministry. The fact is that Jesus was always the gift
          of God. The promise of Jesus was made in the garden of Eden almost as
          soon as Adam fell. On the spot where our ruin was accomplished, a
          Deliverer was bestowed whose heel should be bruised, but who should
          break the serpent's head beneath his foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the ages the great Father stood to his gift. He looked upon
          his Only Begotten as man's hope, the inheritance of the chosen seed,
          who in him would possess all things. Every sacrifice was God's renewal
          of his gift of grace, a reassurance that he had bestowed the gift, and
          would never draw back therefrom. The whole system of types under the
          law betokened that in the fulness of time the Lord would in very deed
          give up his Son, to be born of a woman, to bear the iniquities of his
          people, and to die the death in their behalf. I greatly admire this
          pertinacity of love; for many a man in a moment of generous excitement
          can perform a supreme act of benevolence, and yet could not bear to
          look at it calmly, and consider it from year to year; the slow fire of
          anticipation would have been unbearable. If the Lord should take away
          yonder dear boy from his mother, she would bear the blow with some
          measure of patience, heavy as it would be to her tender heart; but
          suppose that she were credibly informed that on such a day her boy
          must die, and thus had from year to year to look upon him as one dead,
          would it not cast a cloud over every hour of her future life? Suppose
          also that she knew that he would be hanged upon a tree to die, as one
          condemned; would it not embitter her existence? If she could withdraw
          from such a trial, would she not? Assuredly she would. Yet the Lord
          God spared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up for us all,
          doing it in his heart from age, to age. Herein is love: love which
          many waters could not quench: love eternal, inconceivable, infinite!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as this gift refers not only to our Lord's death, but to the ages
          before it, so it includes also all the ages afterwards. God "so loved
          the world that he gave" -- and still gives -- "his only begotten Son,
          that whosoever believeth in him might not perish, but have everlasting
          life." The Lord is giving Christ away to-night. Oh, that thousands of
          you may gladly accept the gift unspeakable! Will anyone refuse? This
          good gift, this perfect gift, -- can you decline it? Oh, that you may
          have faith to lay hold on Jesus, for thus he will be yours. He is
          God's free gift to all free receivers; a full Christ for empty
          sinners. If you can but hold out your empty willing hand, the Lord
          will give Christ to you at this moment. Nothing is freer than a gift.
          Nothing is more worth having than a gift which comes fresh from the
          hand of God, as full of effectual power as ever it was. The fountain
          is eternal, but the stream from it is as fresh as when first the
          fountain was opened. There is no exhausting this gift.
        </p>
        <p>"Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood</p>
        <p>Shall never lose it power</p>
        <p>Till all the ransomed church of God</p>
        <p>Be saved to sin no more."</p>
        <p>
          See, then, what is the love of God, that he gave his Son from of old,
          and has never revoked the gift. He stands to his gift, and continues
          still to give his dear Son to all who are willing to accept him. Out
          of the riches of his grace he has given, is giving, and will give the
          Lord Jesus Christ, and all the priceless gifts which are contained in
          him, to all needy sinners who will simply trust him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I call upon you from this first point to admire the love of God,
          because of the transcendent greatness of his gift to the world, even
          the gift of his only begotten Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now notice secondly, and, I think I may say, with equal
          admiration, the love of God in THE PLAN OF SALVATION. He has put it
          thus: "that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
          everlasting life." The way of salvation is extremely simple to
          understand, and exceedingly easy to practise, when once the heart is
          made willing and obedient. The method of the covenant of grace differs
          as much from that of the covenant of works as light from darkness. It
          is not said that God has given his Son to all who will keep his law,
          for that we could not do, and therefore the gift would have been
          available to none of us. Nor is it said that he has given his Son to
          all that experience terrible despair and bitter remorse, for that is
          not felt by many who nevertheless are the Lord's own people. But the
          great God has given his own Son, that "whosoever believeth in him"
          should not perish. Faith, however slender, saves the soul. Trust in
          Christ is the certain way of eternal happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what is it to believe in Jesus? It is just this: it is to trust
          yourself with him. If your hearts are ready, though you have never
          believed in Jesus before, I trust you will believe in him now. O Holy
          Spirit graciously make it so.
        </p>
        <p>What is it to believe in Jesus?</p>
        <p>
          It is, first, to give your firm and cordial assent to the truth, that
          God did send his Son, born of a woman, to stand in the room and stead
          of guilty men, and that God did cause to meet on him the iniquities of
          us all, so that he bore the punishment due to our transgressions,
          being made a curse for us. We must heartily believe the Scripture
          which saith, -- "the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with
          his stripes ye are healed." I ask for your assent to the grand
          doctrine of substitution, which is the marrow of the gospel. Oh, may
          God the Holy Spirit lead you to give a cordial assent to it at once;
          for wonderful as it is, it is a fact that God was in Christ
          reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
          them. Oh that you may rejoice that this is true, and be thankful that
          such a blessed fact is revealed by God himself. Believe that the
          substitution of the Son of God is certain; cavil not at the plan, nor
          question its validity, or efficacy, as many do. Alas! they kick at
          God's great sacrifice, and count it a sorry invention. As for me,
          since God has ordained to save man by a substitutionary sacrifice, I
          joyfully agree to his method, and see no reason to do anything else
          but admire it and adore the Author of it. I joy and rejoice that such
          a plan should have been thought of, whereby the justice of God is
          vindicated, and his mercy is set free to do all that he desires. Sin
          is punished in the person of the Christ, yet mercy is extended to the
          guilty. In Christ mercy is sustained by justice, and justice satisfied
          by an act of mercy. The worldly wise say hard things about this device
          of infinite wisdom; but as for me, I love the very name of the cross,
          and count it to be the centre of wisdom, the focus of love, the heart
          of righteousness. This is a main point of faith -- to give a hearty
          assent to the giving of Jesus to suffer in our place and stead, to
          agree with all our soul and mind to this way of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second thing is that you do accept this for yourself. In Adam's
          sin, you did not sin personally, for you were not then in existence;
          yet you fell; neither can you now complain thereof, for you have
          willingly endorsed and adopted Adam's sin by committing personal
          transgressions. You have laid your hand, as it were, upon Adam's sin,
          and made it your own, by committing personal and actual sin. Thus you
          perished by the sin of another, which you adopted and endorsed; and in
          like manner must you be saved by the righteousness of another, which
          you are to accept and appropriate. Jesus has offered an atonement, and
          that atonement becomes yours when you accept it by putting your trust
          in him. I want you now to say,
        </p>
        <p>"My faith doth lay her hand</p>
        <p>On that dear head of thine,</p>
        <p>While, like a penitent, I stand,</p>
        <p>And here confess my sin."</p>
        <p>
          Surely this is no very difficult matter. To say that Christ who hung
          upon the cross shall be my Christ, my surety, needs neither stretch of
          intellect, nor splendor of character; and yet it is the act which
          brings salvation to the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing more is needful; and that is personal trust. First comes
          assent to the truth, then acceptance of that truth for yourself, and
          then a simple trusting of yourself wholly to Christ, as a substitute.
          The essence of faith is trust, reliance, dependence. Fling away every
          other confidence of every sort, save confidence in Jesus. Do not allow
          a ghost of a shade of a shadow of a confidence in anything that you
          can do, or in anything that you can be; but look alone to him whom God
          has set forth to be the propitiation for sin. This I do at this very
          moment; will you not do the same? Oh, may the sweet Spirit of God lead
          you now to trust in Jesus!
        </p>
        <p>
          See, then, the love of God in putting it in so plain, so easy a way.
          Oh, thou broken, crushed and despairing sinner, thou canst not work,
          but canst thou not believe that which is true? Thou canst not sigh;
          thou canst not cry; thou canst not melt thy stony heart; but canst
          thou not believe that Jesus died for thee, and that he can change that
          heart of thine and make thee a new creature? If thou canst believe
          this, then trust in Jesus to do so, and thou art saved; for he that
          believes in him is justified. "He that believeth in him hath
          everlasting life." He is a saved man. His sins are forgiven him. Let
          him go his way in peace, and sin no more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I admire, first, the love of God in the great gift, and then in the
          great plan by which that gift becomes available to guilty men.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Thirdly, the love of God shines forth with transcendent
          brightness in a third point, namely, in THE PERSONS FOR WHOM THIS PLAN
          IS AVAILABLE, and for whom this gift is given. They are described in
          these words -- "Whosoever believeth in him." There is in the text a
          word which has no limit -- "God so loved the world"; but then comes in
          the descriptive limit, which I beg you to notice with care: "He gave
          his Only Begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him might not
          perish." God did not so love the world that any man who does not
          believe in Christ shall be saved; neither did God so give his Son that
          any man shall be saved who refuses to believe in him. See how it is
          put -- "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
          that whosoever believeth in him should not perish." Here is the
          compass of the love: while every unbeliever is excluded, every
          believer is included. "Whosoever believeth in him." Suppose there be a
          man who has been guilty of all the lusts of the flesh to an infamous
          degree, suppose that he is so detestable that he is only fit to be
          treated like a moral leper, and shut up in a separate house for fear
          he should contaminate those who hear or see him; yet if that man shall
          believe in Jesus Christ, he shall at once be made clean from his
          defilement, and shall not perish because of his sin. And suppose there
          be another man who, in the pursuit of his selfish motives, has ground
          down the poor, has robbed his fellow-traders, and has even gone so far
          as to commit actual crime of which the law has taken cognisance, yet
          if he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ he shall be led to make
          restitution, and his sins shall be forgiven him. I once heard of a
          preacher addressing a company of men in chains, condemned to die for
          murder and other crimes. They were such a drove of beasts to all
          outward appearances that it seemed hopeless to preach to them; yet
          were I set to be chaplain to such a wretched company I should not
          hesitate to tell them that "God so loved the world, that he gave his
          Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
          but have everlasting life." O man, if thou wilt believe in Jesus as
          the Christ, however horrible thy past sins have been they shall be
          blotted out; thou shalt be saved from the power of thine evil habits;
          and thou shalt begin again like a child newborn, with a new and true
          life, which God shall give thee. "Whosoever believeth in him," -- that
          takes you in, my aged friend, now lingering within a few tottering
          steps of the grave. O grey-headed sinner, if you believe in him, you
          shall not perish. The text also includes you, dear boy, who have
          scarcely entered your teens as yet: if you believe in him, you shall
          not perish. That takes you in, fair maiden, and gives you hope and joy
          while yet young. That comprehends all of us, provided we believe in
          the Lord Jesus Christ. Neither can all the devils in hell find out any
          reason why the man that believes in Christ shall be lost, for it is
          written, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." Do they
          say, "Lord, he has been so long in coming"? The Lord replies, -- "Has
          he come? Then I will not cast him out for all his delays." But, Lord,
          he went back after making a profession. "Has he at length come? Then I
          will not cast him out for all his backsliding." But, Lord, he was a
          foul-mouthed blasphemer. "Has he come to me? Then I will not cast him
          out for all his blasphemies." But, says one, "I take exception to the
          salvation of this wicked wretch. He has behaved so abominably that in
          all justice he ought to be sent to hell." Just so. But if he repents
          of his sin and believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, whoever he may be,
          he shall not be sent there. He shall be changed in character, so that
          he shall never perish, but have eternal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, observe, that this "whosoever" makes a grand sweep; for it
          encircles all degrees of faith. "Whosoever believeth in him." It may
          be that he has no full assurance; it may be that he has no assurance
          at all; but if he has faith, true and childlike, by it he shall be
          saved. Though his faith be so little that I must needs put on my
          spectacles to see it, yet Christ will see it and reward it. His faith
          is such a tiny grain of mustard seed that I look and look again but
          hardly discern it, and yet it brings him eternal life, and it is
          itself a living thing. The Lord can see within that mustard seed a
          tree among whose branches the birds of the air shall make their nests.
        </p>
        <p>"My faith is feeble, I confess,</p>
        <p>I faintly trust thy word;</p>
        <p>But wilt thou pity me the less?</p>
        <p>Be that far from thee, Lord!"</p>
        <p>
          O Lord Jesus, if I cannot take thee up in my arms as Simeon did, I
          will at least touch thy garment's hem as the poor diseased woman did
          to whom thy healing virtue flowed. It is written, "God so loveth the
          world that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
          him should not perish, but have everlasting life." That means me. I
          cannot preach at length to you to-night; but I would preach with
          strength. Oh that this truth may soak into your souls. Oh you that
          feel yourselves guilty; and you that feel guilty because you do not
          feel guilty; you that are broken in heart because your heart will not
          break; you that feel that you cannot feel; it is to you that I would
          preach salvation in Christ by faith. You groan because you cannot
          groan; but whoever you may be, you are still within the range of this
          mighty word, that "whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but
          have eternal life."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I commended God's love to you in those three points -- the
          divine gift, the divine method of saving, and the divine choice of the
          persons to whom salvation comes.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now fourthly, another beam of divine love is to be seen in the
          negative blessing here stated, namely, in THE DELIVERANCE implied in
          the words, "that whosoever believeth in him should not perish."
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that word to mean that whosoever believes in the Lord
          Jesus Christ shall not perish, though he is ready to perish. His sins
          would cause him to perish, but he shall never perish. At first he has
          a little hope in Christ, but its existence is feeble. It will soon die
          out, will it not? No, his faith shall not perish, for this promise
          covers it -- "Whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish." The
          penitent has believed in Jesus, and therefore he has begun to be a
          Christian; "Oh," cries an enemy, "let him alone: he will soon be back
          among us; he will soon be as careless as ever." Listen. "Whosoever
          believeth in Him shall not perish," and therefore he will not return
          to his former state. This proves the final perseverance of the saints;
          for if the believer ceased to be a believer he would perish; and as he
          cannot perish, it is clear that he will continue a believer. If thou
          believest in Jesus, thou shalt never leave off believing in him; for
          that would be to perish. If thou believest in him, thou shalt never
          delight in thine old sins; for that would be to perish. If thou
          believest in him, thou shalt never lose spiritual life. How canst thou
          lose that which is everlasting? If thou wert to lose it, it would
          prove that it was not everlasting, and thou wouldst perish; and thus
          thou wouldst make this word to be of no effect. Whosoever with his
          heart believeth in Christ is a saved man, not for to-night only, but
          for all the nights that ever shall be, and for that dread night of
          death, and for that solemn eternity which draws so near. "Whosoever
          believeth in him shall not perish;" but he shall have a life that
          cannot die, a justification that cannot be disputed, an acceptance
          which shall never cease.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is it to perish? It is to lose all hope in Christ, all trust in
          God, all light in life, all peace in death, all joy, all bliss, all
          union with God. This shall never happen to thee if thou believest in
          Christ. If thou believest, thou shalt be chastened when thou dost
          wrong, for every child of God comes under discipline; and what son is
          there whom the Father chasteneth not? If thou believest, thou mayest
          doubt and fear as to thy state, as a man on board a ship may be tossed
          about; but thou hast gotten on board a ship that never can be wrecked.
          He that hath union with Christ has union with perfection, omnipotence
          and glory. He that believeth is a member of Christ: will Christ lose
          his members? How should Christ be perfect if he lost even his little
          finger? Are Christ's members to rot off, or to be cut off? Impossible.
          If thou hast faith in Christ thou are a partaker of Christ's life, and
          thou canst not perish. If men were trying to drown me, they could not
          drown my foot as long as I had my head above water; and as long as our
          Head is above water, up yonder in the eternal sunshine, the least limb
          of his body can never be destroyed. He that believeth in Jesus is
          united to him, and he must live because Jesus lives. Oh what a word is
          this, "I give unto my sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish,
          neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave
          them to me is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out
          of my Father's hand."
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel that I have a grand gospel to preach to you when I read that
          whosoever believeth in Jesus shall not perish. I would not give two
          pins for that trumpery, temporary salvation which some proclaim, which
          floats the soul for a time and then ebbs away to apostasy. I do not
          believe that the man who is once in Christ may live in sin and delight
          in it, and yet be saved. That is abominable teaching, and none of
          mine. But I believe that the man who is in Christ will not live in
          sin, for he is saved from it; nor will he return to his old sins and
          abide in them, for the grace of God will continue to save him from his
          sins. Such a change is wrought by regeneration that the newborn man
          cannot abide in sin, nor find comfort in it, but he loves holiness and
          makes progress in it. The Ethiopian may change his skin, and the
          leopard his spots, but only grace divine can work the change; and when
          divine grace has done the deed the blackamore will remain white, and
          the leopard's spots will never return. It would be as great a miracle
          to undo the work of God as to do it; and to destroy the new creation
          would require as great a power as to make it. As only God can create,
          so only God can destroy; and he will never destroy the work of his own
          hands. Will God begin to build and not finish? Will he commence a
          warfare and end it before he has won the victory? What would the devil
          say if Christ were to begin to save a soul and fail in the attempt? If
          there should come to be souls in hell that were believers in Christ,
          and yet did perish, it would cast a cloud upon the diadem of our
          exalted Lord. It cannot, shall not, be. Such is the love of God, that
          whosoever believeth in his dear Son shall not perish: in this
          assurance we greatly rejoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The last commendation of his love lies in the positive -- IN THE
          POSSESSION. I shall have to go in a measure over the same ground
          again, let me therefore be the shorter. God gives to every man that
          believes in Christ everlasting life. The moment thou believest there
          trembles into thy bosom a vital spark of heavenly flame which never
          shall be quenched. In that same moment when thou dost cast thyself on
          Christ, Christ comes to thee in the living and incorruptible word
          which liveth and abideth for ever. Though there should drop into thy
          heart but one drop of the heavenly water of life, remember this, -- he
          hath said it who cannot lie, -- "The water that I shall give him shall
          be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life." When I
          first received everlasting life I had no idea what a treasure had come
          to me. I knew that I had obtained something very extraordinary, but of
          its superlative value I was not aware. I did but look to Christ in the
          little chapel, and I received eternal life. I looked to Jesus, and he
          looked on me; and we were one for ever. That moment my joy surpassed
          all bounds, just as my sorrow had aforetime driven me to an extreme of
          grief. I was perfectly at rest in Christ, satisfied with him, and my
          heart was glad; but I did not know that this grace was everlasting
          life till I began to read in the Scriptures, and to know more fully
          the value of the jewel which God had given me. The next Sunday I sent
          to the same chapel, as it was very natural that I should. But I never
          went afterwards, for this reason, that during my first week the new
          life that was in me had been compelled to fight for its existence, and
          a conflict with the old nature had been vigorously carried on. This I
          knew to be a special token of the indwelling of grace in my soul; but
          in that same chapel I heard a sermon upon "O wretched man that I am!
          who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" And the preacher
          declared that Paul was not a Christian when he had that experience.
          Babe as I was, I knew better than to believe so absurd a statement.
          What but divine grace could produce such a sighing and crying after
          deliverance from indwelling sin? I felt that a person who could talk
          such nonsense knew little of the life of a true believer. I said to
          myself, "What! am I not alive because I feel a conflict within me? I
          never felt this fight when I was an unbeliever. When I was not a
          Christian I never groaned to be set free from sin. This conflict is
          one of the surest evidences of my new birth, and yet this man cannot
          see it; he may be a good exhorter to sinners, but he cannot feed
          believers." I resolved to go into that pasture no more, for I could
          not feed therein. I find that the struggle becomes more and more
          intense; each victory over sin reveals another army of evil
          tendencies, and I am never able to sheathe my sword, nor cease from
          prayer and watchfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot advance an inch without praying my way, nor keep the inch I
          gain without watching and standing fast. Grace alone can preserve and
          perfect me. The old nature will kill the new nature if it can; and to
          this moment the only reason why my new nature is not dead is this --
          because it cannot die. If it could have died, it would have been slain
          long ago; but Jesus said, "I give unto my sheep eternal life"; "he
          that believeth on me hast everlasting life"; and therefore the
          believer cannot die. The only religion which will save you is one that
          you cannot leave, because it possesses you, and will not leave you. If
          you hold a doctrine which you can give up, give it up; but if the
          doctrines are burnt into you so that as long as you live you must hold
          them, and so that if you were burnt every ash would hold that same
          truth in it, because you are impregnated with it, then you have found
          the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not a saved man unless Christ has saved you for ever. But that
          which has such a grip of you that its grasp is felt in the core of
          your being is the power of God. To have Christ living in you, and the
          truth ingrained in your very nature -- O sirs, this is the thing that
          saves the soul, and nothing short of it. It is written in the text,
          "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that
          whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
          life." What is this but a life that shall last through your
          three-score years and ten; a life that shall last you should you
          outlive a century; a life that will still flourish when you lie at the
          grave's mouth; a life that will abide when you have quitted the body,
          and left it rotting in the tomb; a life that will continue when your
          body is raised again, and you shall stand before the judgment-seat of
          Christ; a life that will outshine those stars and yon sun and moon; a
          life that shall be co-eval with the life of the Eternal Father? As
          long as there is a God, the believer shall not only exist, but live.
          As long as there is a heaven, you shall enjoy it; as long as there is
          a Christ, you shall live in his love; and as long as there is an
          eternity, you shall continue to fill it with delight.
