            <p align="justify">
              There is no title to this psalm—but it is evidently a companion to
              the hundred and eleventh, and, like it, it is an alphabetical
              psalm. Even in the number of verses, and clauses of each verse, it
              coincides with its predecessor, as also in many of its words and
              phrases. The reader should carefully compare the two psalms line
              by line.

            <p align="justify">
              The subject of the poem before us is—the blessedness of the
              righteous man, and so it bears the same relation to the preceding
              which the moon does to the sun; for, while the first declares the
              glory of God, the second speaks of the reflection of the divine
              brightness in men born from above. God is here praised for the
              manifestation of his glory which is seen in his people, just as in
              the preceding psalm he was magnified for his own personal acts.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              The hundred and eleventh speaks of the great Father, and this
              describes his children renewed after his image. The psalm cannot
              be viewed as the extolling of man, for it commences with "Praise
              the Lord!" and it is intended to give to God all the honor of his
              grace which is manifested in the sons of God.

            <p align="justify">
              The subject is stated in the first verse, and enlarged upon under
              several heads from 2 to 9. The blessedness of the righteousness is
              set forth by contrast with the fate of the ungodly in verse 10.

            <p align="justify">
              This exhortation is never given too often; the Lord always
              deserves praise, we ought always to render it, we are frequently
              forgetful of it, and it is always well to be stirred up to it. The
              exhortation is addressed to all thoughtful persons who observe the
              way and manner of life of men that fear the Lord. If there be any
              virtue, if there be any praise, the Lord should have all the glory
              of it, for we are his workmanship.

            <p align="justify">
              According to the last verse of Psalm 111, the fear of the Lord is
              the beginning of wisdom; this man, therefore, has begun to be
              wise, and wisdom has brought him present happiness, and secured
              him eternal felicity.

              Jehovah is so great that he is to be feared and had in reverence
              by all them that are round about him, and he is at the same time
              so infinitely good that the fear is sweetened into filial love,
              and becomes a delightful emotion, by no means engendering bondage.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
              There is a slavish fear which is accursed; but that godly fear
              which leads to delight in the service of God is infinitely
              blessed. Jehovah is to be praised both for inspiring men with
              godly fear and for the blessedness which they enjoy in consequence
              thereof. We ought to bless God for blessing any man, and
              especially for setting the seal of his approbation upon the godly.
              His favor towards the God-fearing displays his character and
              encourages gracious feelings in others, therefore let him be
              praised.

              with delight. Cheerful obedience is the only acceptable obedience.
              He who obeys reluctantly is disobedient at heart—but he who takes
              pleasure in the command is truly loyal.

              been made righteous by grace renders all the praise to the Lord.

              all in all, the children of the righteous man commence life with
              greater advantages than others, and are more likely to succeed in

              Men call him a fool for his religion—but they do not find him so

              affairs, and with half an eye one can see that he is a man of
              sound sense. Such persons greatly commend godliness.
