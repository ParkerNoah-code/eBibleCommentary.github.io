          16. The trees of Jehovah shall be satiated; the cedars of Lebanon,
          which he hath planted; 17. For there the birds build their nests: the
          stork, whose dwelling is the fir trees.18. The high mountains are for
          the deer and the rocks are a place of shelter for the hedgehogs.

          16. The trees of Jehovah shall be satiated The Psalmist again treats
          of God's general providence in cherishing all the parts of the world.
          In the first place, he asserts, that by the watering of which he had
          spoken the trees are satiated, or filled with sap, that thus
          flourishing they may be a place of abode to the birds. He next
          declares, that the wild deer and conies have also their places of
          shelter, to show that no part of the world is forgotten by Him, who is
          the best of fathers, and that no creature is excluded from his care.
          The transition which the prophet makes from men to trees is as if he
          had said, It is not to be wondered at, if God so bountifully nourishes
          men who are created after his own image, since he does not grudge to
          extend his care even to trees. By the trees of the Lord, is meant
          those which are high and of surpassing beauty; for God's blessing is
          more conspicuous in them. It seems scarcely possible for any juice of
          the earth to reach so great a height, and yet they renew their foliage
          every year.<br />
