        had his own case in his mind's eye—yet he wrote not as a private person,
        but as an inspired prophet, and therefore his song is presented, for
        public and perpetual use, to the appointed guardian of the Temple
        psalmody.
        <b> <p align="justify">To the tune of 'Do Not Destroy'</p></b>. The

        "Destroy not" is solemnly pronounced.

        the Psalms of the Golden Secret, and the second of the "Destroy nots."
        These names if they serve for nothing else may be useful to aid the
        memory. Men give names to their horses, jewels, and other valuables, and
        these names are meant not so much to describe as to distinguish them,
        and in some cases to set forth the owner's high esteem of his treasure.
        After the same fashion the Oriental poet gave a title to the song he
        loved, and so aided his memory, and expressed his estimation of the
        strain.
        <p align="justify">
          We are not always to look for a meaning in these superscriptions, but
          to treat them as we would the titles of poems, or the names of tunes.

            Verse 1. Do you indeed speak righteousness, O congregation?
          </p></b
        >
        The enemies of David were a numerous and united band, and because they
        so unanimously condemned the persecuted one, they were apt to take it
        for granted that their verdict was a right one. "What everybody says,
        must be true," is a lying proverb based upon the presumption which comes
        of large combinations.
        <p align="justify">
          Have we not all agreed to hound the man to the death, and who dare
          hint that so many great ones can be mistaken?
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Yet the persecuted one lays the axe at the root by requiring his
          judges to answer the question whether or not they were acting
          according to justice. It were well if men would sometimes pause, and
          candidly consider this. Some of those who surrounded Saul were rather
          passive than active persecutors; they held their tongues when the
          object of royal hate was slandered; in the original, this first
          sentence appears to be addressed to them, and they are asked to
          justify their silence.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          Silence gives consent. He who refrains from defending the right, is
          himself an accomplice in the wrong.

          <p align="justify">Do you judge uprightly, O you sons of men?</p></b
        >
        You too are only men though dressed in a little brief authority. Your
        office for men, and your relation to men both bind you to rectitude; but
        have you remembered this? Have you not put aside all truth when you have
        condemned the godly, and united in seeking the overthrow of the
        innocent? Yet in doing this be not too sure of success, for you are only
        the "sons of men," and there is a God who can and will reverse your
        verdicts.
        <b>
          <p align="justify">Verse 2. Yes, in heart you work wickedness.</p></b
        >
        Down deep in your very souls you hold a rehearsal of the injustice you
        intend to practice, and when your opportunity arrives, you wreak
        vengeance with a gusto. Your hearts are in your wicked work, and your
        hands are therefore ready enough. Those very men who sat as judges, and
        pretended to so much indignation at the faults imputed to their victim,
        were in their hearts perpetrating all manner of evil.
        <b>

        They were deliberate sinners, cold, calculating villains. As righteous
        judges ponder the law, balance the evidence, and weigh the case, so the
        malicious dispense injustice with malice aforethought in cold blood.
        <p align="justify">
          Note in this verse that the men described sinned with
          <i> heart </i>and <i>hand</i>; <i>privately </i>in their heart,
          <i>publicly </i> in the earth; they worked and they weighed—they were
          active, and yet deliberate.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
          See what a generation saints have to deal with! Such were the foes of
          our Lord, a generation of vipers, an evil and adulterous generation;
          they sought to kill him because he was righteousness itself—yet they
          masked their hatred to his goodness by charging him with sin.

            Verse 3. The wicked are estranged from the womb.

        >
        It is small wonder that some men persecute the righteous seed of the
        woman, since <i>all of them are of the serpent's brood</i>, and enmity
        is set between them. No sooner born than alienated from God—what a
        condition to be found in! Do we so early leave the right track? Do we at
        the same moment begin to be men and commence to be sinners?
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            They go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
          </p></b
        >Every observer may see how very soon infants act lies. Before they can
        speak they practice little deceptive arts. This is especially the case
        in those who grow up to be adept in slander, they begin their evil trade
        early, and there is no marvel that they become adept in it. He who
        starts early in the morning, will go far before night. To be untruthful
        is one of the surest proofs of a fallen state, and since falsehood is
        universal, so also is human depravity.

            Verse 4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent.
          </p></b
        >Is man also a poisonous reptile? Yes, and his venom is even as that of
        a serpent. The viper has but death for the body in his fangs; but
        unregenerate man carries poison under his tongue, destructive to the
        nobler nature.

            They are like the deaf adder that stops her ear.

        >
        While speaking of serpents the psalmist remembers that many of them have
        been conquered by the charmer's are, but men such as he had to deal with
        no are could tame or restrain; therefore, he likens them to a serpent
        less susceptible than others to the charmer's music, and says that they
        refused to hear reason, even as the adder shuts her ear to those
        incantations which fascinate other reptiles.
        <i
          >Man, in his natural corruption, appears to have all the ill points of
          a serpent without its excellencies. O sin, what have you done! </i

          <p align="justify">
            Verse 5. Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
            ever so wisely.
          </p></b
        >Ungodly men are not to be won to right by arguments the most logical,
        or appeals the most pathetic. Try all your arts, you preachers of the
        word! Lay yourselves out to meet the prejudices and tastes of sinners,
        and you shall yet have to cry, "Who has believed our report?" It is not
        in your music, but in the sinner's ear that the cause of failure lies,
        and it is only the power of God that can remove it.
        <p align="justify">
          No, we call and call, and call in vain, until the arm of the Lord is
          revealed. This is at once the sinner's guilt and danger. He ought to
          hear, but will not—and because he will not hear, he cannot escape the
          damnation of Hell.
        </p>
        <b>
          <p align="justify">
            Verse 6. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth.
          </p></b
        >If they have no capacity for good, at least deprive them of their
        ability for evil. Treat them as the snake charmers do their serpents,
        extract their fangs, break their teeth. The Lord can do this, and he
        will. He will not allow the malice of the wicked to triumph, he will
        deal them such a blow as shall disable them from mischief.

        As if one brute creature had not enough of evil in it to complete the
        emblem of ungodly nature, another specimen of deadly beasts is fetched
        in. For fierce cruelty the wicked are likened to young lions, monsters
        in the prime of their vigor, and the fury of their lustiness. It is
        asked that their grinders may be smashed in, broken off, or dashed out,
        that the creatures may henceforth be harmless.
        <p align="justify">
          One can well understand how the banished son of Jesse, while poisoned
          by the venomous slander of his foes, and worried by their cruel power,
          should appeal to Heaven for a speedy and complete riddance from his
          enemies.

        Or like running streams whose waters are swiftly gone, so let them pass
        away. Or like water spilt which none can find again, so let them vanish

          Or perhaps the meaning is, when the ungodly man marches to the
          conflict, let his arrows and his bow drop into fragments, the string
          cut, the bow snapped, the arrows headless, the points blunted; so that
          the boastful warrior may not have wherewithal to hurt the object of
          his enmity. In either sense the prayer of the Psalm has often become
          fact, and will be again fulfilled as often as need arises.

        As the snail makes its own way by its slime, and so dissolves as it
        goes, or as its shell is often found empty, as though the inhabitant had

        are lit, before any heat can be brought to bear upon the pot, yes, even
        as soon as the fuel has touched the cooking vessel, a storm comes and
        sweeps all away; the pot is overturned, the fuel is scattered far and
        wide.

          Perhaps the figure may suppose the thorns, which are the fuel, to be
          kindled, and then the flame is so rapid that before any heat can be

          terrible one it is. The malicious wretch puts on his great seething
          pot, he gathers his fuel, he means to play the cannibal with the
          godly; but he reckons without the Lord Almighty, and the unexpected
