          1. In the first book, which immediately precedes this, exposing
          "knowledge falsely so called," I showed thee, my very dear friend,
          that the whole system devised, in many and opposite ways, by those who
          are of the school of Valentinus, was false and baseless. I also set
          forth the tenets of their predecessors, proving that they not only
          differed among themselves, but had long previously swerved from the
          truth itself. I further explained, with all diligence, the doctrine as
          well as practice of Marcus the magician, since he, too, belongs to
          these persons; and I carefully noticed the passages which they garble
          from the Scriptures, with the view of adapting them to their own
          fictions. Moreover, I minutely narrated the manner in which, by means
          of numbers, and by the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, they
          boldly endeavour to establish [what they regard as] truth. I have also
          related how they think and teach that creation at large was formed
          after the image of their invisible Pleroma, and what they hold
          respecting the Demiurge, declaring at the same time the doctrine of
          Simon Magus of Samaria, their progenitor, and of all those who
          succeeded him. I mentioned, too, the multitude of those Gnostics who
          are sprung from him, and noticed the points of difference between
          them, their several doctrines, and the order of their succession,
          while I set forth all those heresies which have been originated by
          them. I showed, moreover, that all these heretics, taking their rise
          from Simon, have introduced impious and irreligious doctrines into
          this life; and I explained the nature of their "redemption," and their
          method of initiating those who are rendered "perfect," along with
          their invocations and their mysteries. I proved also that there is one
          God, the Creator, and that He is not the fruit of any defect, nor is
          there anything either above Him, or after Him.2. In the present book,
          I shall establish those points which fit in with my design, so far as
          time permits, and overthrow, by means of lengthened treatment under
          distinct heads, their whole system; for which reason, since it is an
          exposure and subversion of their opinions, I have so entitled the
          composition of this work. For it is fitting, by a plain revelation and
          overthrow of their conjunctions, to put an end to these hidden
          alliances, and to Bythus himself, and thus to obtain a demonstration
          that he never existed at any previous time, nor now has any existence.
