          1. I have loved, because Jehovah shall hear the voice of my
          supplication.2. Because he hath inclined his ear to me, and during my
          days I will call upon him.3. The snares of death compassed me, and the
          sorrows of the grave found me: I found tribulation and grief.4. And I
          will call upon the name of Jehovah; I beseech thee, O Jehovah! deliver
          my soul.

          1 I have loved, because Jehovah will hear the voice of my
          supplication. At the very commencement of this psalm David avows that
          he was attracted with the sweetness of God's goodness, to place his
          hope and confidence in him alone. This abrupt mode of speaking, I have
          loved, is the more emphatic, intimating that he could receive joy and
          repose nowhere but in God. We know that our hearts will be always
          wandering after fruitless pleasures, and harassed with care, until God
          knit them to himself. This distemper David affirms was removed from
          him, because he felt that God was indeed propitious towards him. And,
          having found by experience that, in general, they who call upon God
          are happy, he declares that no allurements shall draw him away from
          God. When, therefore, he says, I have loved, it imports that, without
          God, nothing would be pleasant or agreeable to him. From this we are
          instructed that those who have been heard by God, but do not place
          themselves entirely under his guidance and guardianship, have derived
          little advantage from the experience of his grace.

          The second verse also refers to the same subject, excepting that the
          latter clause admits of a very appropriate meaning, which expositors
          overlook. The phrase, during my days I will call upon him, is
          uniformly understood by them to mean, I, who hitherto have been so
          successful in addressing God, will pursue the same course all my life
          long. But it should be considered whether it may not be equally
          appropriate that the days of David be regarded as denoting a fit
          season of asking assistance, the season when he was hard pressed by
          necessity. I am not prevented from adopting this signification,
          because it may be said that the prophet employs the future tense of
          the verb 'qr', ekra. In the first verse also, the term, he shall hear,
          is to be understood in the past tense, he has heard, in which case the
          copulative conjunction would require to be taken as an adverb of time,
          when, a circumstance this by no means unusual among the Hebrews. The
          scope of the passage will run very well thus: Because he has bowed his
          ear to me when I called upon him in the time of my adversity, and even
          at the season, too, when I was reduced to the greatest straits. If any
          are disposed to prefer the former exposition, I will not dispute the
          matter with them. The subsequent context, however, appears to
          countenance the latter meaning, in which David commences energetically
          to point out what those days were. And, with the design of magnifying
          God's glory according to its desert, he says that there was no way of
          his escaping from death, for he was like one among enemies, bound with
          fetters and chains, from whom all hope of deliverance was cut off. He
          acknowledges, therefore, that he was subjected to death, that he was
          overtaken and seized, so that escape was impossible. And as he
          declares that he was bound by the cords of death, so he, at the same
          the adds, that he fell into tribulation and sorrow And here he
          confirms what he said formerly, that when he seemed to be most
          forsaken of God, that was truly the proper time, and the right season
          for him to give himself to prayer.
