<p align="justify">TITLE and SUBJECT. <b>A prayer of David. </b><i>David 
    would not have been a man after God's own heart, if he had not been a man of 
    prayer</i>. He was a master in the sacred are of supplication. <i>He flies 
    to prayer in all times of need, as a pilot speeds to the harbor in the 
    stress of tempest</i>. So frequent were David's prayers that they could not 
    be all dated and entitled; and hence this simply bears the author's name, 
    and nothing more. The smell of the furnace is upon the present psalm, but 
    there is evidence in the last verse that he who wrote it came unharmed out 
    of the flame. We have in the present plaintive song, AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN 
    from the persecutions of earth. <i>A spiritual eye may see Jesus here</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISIONS. There are no very clear lines of demarcation 
    between the parts; but we prefer the division adopted by that precious old 
    commentator, David Dickson. </p>
<p align="justify">In verses 1-4, David craves justice in the controversy 
    between him and his oppressors. </p>
<p align="justify">In verses 5 and 6, he requests of the Lord grace to act 
    rightly while under the trial. </p>
<p align="justify">From verse 7-12, he seeks protection from his foes, whom 
    he graphically describes.</p>
<p align="justify">In verses 13 and 14, pleads that they may be 
    disappointed.</p>
<p align="justify">He closes the whole in the most comfortable confidence 
    that all would certainly be well with himself at the last.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. "Hear the right, O Lord." </p></b>He who is in the 
    worst case, makes the most noise; hence the oppressed soul is apprehensive 
    that its voice may be drowned, and therefore pleads in this one verse for a 
    hearing no less than three times. The troubled heart craves for the ear of 
    the great Judge, persuaded that with him to hear is to redress. <i>If our 
    God could not or would not hear us, our state would be deplorable indeed</i>; 
    and yet some professors set such small store by the mercy-seat, that God 
    does not hear them for the simple reason that they neglect to plead. As well 
    have no house, if we persist like gipsies in living in the lanes and 
    commons; as well have no mercy-seat as be always defending our own cause and 
    never going to God. There is more fear that we will not hear the Lord, than 
    that the Lord will not hear us. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Hear the right;"</p></b> it is well if our case is good in 
    itself and can be urged as a right one, for right shall never be wronged by 
    our righteous Judge. But if our suit be marred by our infirmities, it is a 
    great privilege that we may make mention of the righteousness of our Lord 
    Jesus, which is ever prevalent on high. Right has a voice which Jehovah 
    always hears; and if my wrongs clamor against me with great force and fury, 
    I will pray the Lord to hear that still louder and mightier voice of the 
    right, and the rights of his dear Son. 
<p align="justify">"Hear, O God, the Just One;" that is, "hear the Messiah," 
    is a rendering adopted by Jerome, and admired by Bishop Horsley, <i>whether 
    correct or not as a translation, it is proper enough as a plea. </i>Let the 
    reader plead it at the throne of the righteous God, even when all other 
    arguments are unavailing.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Attend unto my cry." </p></b>This shows the vehemence and 
    earnestness of the petitioner; he is no mere talker, he weeps and laments. 
    Who can resist a cry? A real hearty, bitter, piteous cry, might almost melt 
    a rock, there can be no fear of its prevalence with our heavenly Father. A 
    cry is our earliest utterance, and in many ways the most natural of human 
    sounds.<i> If our prayer should like the infant's cry be more natural than 
    intelligent, and more earnest than elegant, it will be none the less 
    eloquent with God.</i> <i>There is a mighty power in a child's cry to 
    prevail with a parent's heart.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"Give ear unto my prayer." </p></b>Some repetitions are not 
    vain. The reduplication here used is neither superstition nor tautology, but 
    is <i>like the repeated blow of a hammer hitting the same nail on the head 
    to fix it the more effectually</i>, or the continued knocking of a beggar at 
    the gate who cannot be denied an alms. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"That goes not out of deceptive lips."</p></b> Sincerity is 
    an essential condition in prayer. Lips of deceit are detestable to man and 
    much more to God. <i>In fellowship so hallowed as that of prayer, hypocrisy 
    even in the remotest degree is as fatal as it is foolish</i>.<i> 
    Hypocritical piety is double iniquity</i>. He who would feign and flatter 
    had better try his craft with a fool like himself, for to deceive the 
    all-seeing One is as impossible as to catch the moon in a net, or to lead 
    the sun into a snare. He who would deceive God is himself already most 
    grossly deceived. Our sincerity in prayer has no merit in it, any more than 
    the earnestness of a beggar in the street; but at the same time the Lord has 
    regard to it, through Jesus, and will not long refuse his ear to an honest 
    and fervent petitioner.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2. "Let my sentence come forth from your presence."</p></b> 
    The psalmist has now grown bold by the strengthening influence of prayer, 
    and he now entreats the Judge of all the earth to give sentence upon his 
    case. He has been libelled—basely and maliciously libelled; and having 
    brought his action before the highest court, he, like an innocent man, has 
    no desire to escape the inquiry, but even invites and sues for judgment. He 
    does not ask for secrecy, but would have the result come forth to the world. 
    He would have sentence pronounced and executed forthwith. 
<p align="justify">In some matters we may venture to be as bold as this; but 
    except we can plead something better than <i>our own supposed innocence</i>, 
    it were terrible presumption thus to challenge the judgment of a sin-hating 
    God. With Jesus as our complete and all-glorious righteousness we need not 
    fear, though the day of judgment should commence at once, and Hell open her 
    mouth at our feet, but might joyfully prove the truth of our hymn writer's 
    holy boast—</p>
<p align="justify">"Bold shall I stand in that great day;<br/>
    For who anything to my charge shall lay?<br/>
    While, through your blood, absolved I am,<br/>
    From sin's tremendous curse and shame."</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Let your eyes behold the things that are right."</p></b> 
    Believers do not desire any other judge than God, or to be excused from 
    judgment, or even to be judged on principles of partiality. No; our hope 
    does not lie in the prospect of favoritism from God, and the consequent 
    suspension of his law. We expect to be judged on the same principals as 
    other men, and through the blood and righteousness of our Redeemer we shall 
    pass the ordeal unscathed. 
<p align="justify">The Lord will weigh us in the scales of justice fairly 
    and justly. He will not use false weights to permit us to escape, but with 
    the sternest equity those balances will be used upon us as well as upon 
    others; and with our blessed Lord Jesus as our all in all we tremble not, 
    for we shall not be found lacking. In David's case, he felt his cause to be 
    so right that he simply desired the Divine eyes to rest upon the matter, and 
    he was confident that equity would give him all that he needed.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3, "You have proved my heart." </p></b>Like Peter, 
    David uses the argument, "You know all things, you know that I love you." It 
    is a most assuring thing to be able to appeal at once to the Lord, and call 
    upon our Judge to be a witness for our defense. "Beloved, if our heart 
    condemn us not, then we have confidence toward God." 
<b>
<p align="justify">"You have visited me in the night."</p></b> As if he had 
    said, "Lord, you have entered my house at all hours; and you have seen me 
    when no one else was near; you have come upon me unawares and marked my 
    unrestrained actions, and you know whether or not I am guilty of the crimes 
    laid at my door." <i>Happy man who can thus remember the omniscient eye, and 
    the omnipresent visitor—and find comfort in the remembrance.</i> 
<p align="justify">We hope we have had our midnight visits from our Lord, 
    and truly they are sweet; so sweet that the recollection of them sets us 
    longing for more of such condescending communings. </p>
<p align="justify">Lord, if indeed, we had been hypocrites, would we have 
    had such fellowship, or feel such hungerings after a renewal of it?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"You have tried me, and shall find nothing."</p></b> Surely 
    the Psalmist means nothing hypocritical or wicked in the sense in which his 
    slanderers accused him; for<i> if the Lord should put the best of his people 
    into the crucible, the dross would be a fearful sight</i>, and would make 
    penitence open her sluices wide. Assayers very soon detect the presence of 
    alloy, and when the chief of all assayers shall, at the last, say of us he 
    has found nothing, it will be a glorious hour indeed. "They are without 
    fault before the throne of God." Even here, as viewed in our covenant Head, 
    the Lord sees no sin in Jacob, nor perverseness in Israel; <i>even the 
    all-detecting glance of Omniscience can see no flaw where the great 
    Substitute covers all with beauty and perfection! 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress."</p></b> 
    Oh those sad lips of ours! We had need of firm resolve if we would keep them 
    from exceeding their bounds. <i>The number of sins of the tongue is as many 
    as the sins of all the rest of the man put together, and they are more 
    inveterate. </i>Hands and feet one may bind—but who can fetter the lips? 
    Iron bands may hold a madman—but what chains can restrain the tongue? It 
    needs more than a resolve to keep this nimble offender within its proper 
    range. Lion-taming and serpent-charming are not to be mentioned in the same 
    day as tongue-taming, for no man can tame the tongue. 
<p align="justify">Those who have to smart from the falsehoods of others 
    should be the more jealous over themselves; perhaps this led the Psalmist to 
    register this holy resolution; and, moreover, he intended thereby to aver 
    that if he had said too much in his own defense, it was not intentional, for 
    he desired in all-respects <i>to tune his lips to the sweet and simple music 
    of truth</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding all this David was slandered, as if to 
    show us <i>that the purest innocence will be bemired by malice. There is no 
    sunshine without a shadow, no ripe fruit unpecked by the birds.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. "Concerning the works of men."</p></b> While we are 
    in the midst of men we shall have their works thrust under our notice, and 
    we shall be compelled to keep a corner of our diary headed "concerning the 
    works of men." To be quite clear from the dead works of carnal humanit,y is 
    the devout desire of souls who are quickened by the Holy Spirit. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"By the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths 
    of the destroyer."</p></b>David had kept the highway of Scripture, and not 
    chosen the bye-paths of malice. 
<p align="justify">We would soon imitate the example of the worst of men if 
    the grace of God did not use the Word of God as the great preservative from 
    evil. All the ways of sin are the paths of Satan—the Apollyon or Abaddon, 
    both of which words signify <i>the destroyer</i>. Foolish indeed are those 
    who give their hearts to the old murderer, because for the time he panders 
    to their evil desires. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">That heavenly Book which lies neglected on many a shelf 
    is the only guide for those who would avoid the enticing and entangling 
    mazes of sin</p></i>. It is the best means of preserving the pilgrim from ever 
    treading those dangerous ways. We must follow the one or the other:
<p align="justify">the Book of Life, or the way of death;<br/>
    the word of the Holy Spirit, or the suggestion of the Evil Spirit. </p>
<p align="justify">David could urge as the proof of his sincerity that he 
    had no part or lot with the ungodly in their ruinous ways. How can we 
    venture to plead our cause with God, unless we also can wash our hands clean 
    of all connection with the enemies of the Great King?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5.</p></b> Under trial it is not easy to behave 
    ourselves aright; a candle is not easily kept alight when many envious 
    mouths are puffing at it. In evil times prayer is peculiarly needful, and 
    wise men resort to it at once. Plato said to one of his disciples, "When men 
    speak ill of you, live so that no one will believe them." This is good 
    enough advice, but he did not tell us how to carry it out. We have a precept 
    here incorporated in an example; <i>if we would be preserved, we must cry to 
    the Preserver, and enlist divine support upon our side. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">"Hold up my goings"</p></b>—as a careful driver holds up his 
    horse when going down hill. We have all sorts of paces, both fast and slow, 
    and the road is never long of one sort, but with God to hold up our goings, 
    nothing in the pace or in the road can cast down. He who has been down once 
    and cut his knees sadly, even to the bone, had need redouble his zeal when 
    using this prayer.
<p align="justify">And all of us, since we are so weak on our legs through 
    Adam's fall, had need use it every hour of the day. If a perfect father 
    fell, how shall an imperfect son dare to boast? </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"In your paths."</p></b> Forsaking Satan's paths, he prayed 
    to be upheld in God's paths. We cannot keep from evil without keeping to 
    good. <i>If the bushel be not full of wheat, it may soon be once more full 
    of chaff. </i>In all the appointed ordinances and duties of our most holy 
    faith, may the Lord enable us to run through his upholding grace! 
<b>
<p align="justify">"That my footsteps slip not."</p></b> What! slip in God's 
    ways? Yes, the road is good, but our feet are evil, and therefore slip, even 
    on the King's highway. 
<p align="justify">Who wonders if carnal men slide and fall in ways of their 
    own choosing, which like the valley of Siddim, are full of deadly 
    slime-pits? One may trip over an <i>ordinance </i>as well as over a <i>
    temptation</i>. Jesus Christ himself is a stumbling-block to some, and the 
    doctrines of grace have been the occasion of offence to many. <i>Grace alone 
    can hold up our goings in the paths of truth.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. "I have called upon you, for you will hear me, O 
    God." </p></b>You have always heard me, O my Lord, and therefore I have the 
    utmost confidence in again approaching your altar.<i> Experience is a 
    blessed teacher</i>. He who has tried the faithfulness of God in hours of 
    need, has great boldness in laying his case before the throne. The well of 
    Bethlehem, from which we drew such cooling draughts in years gone by, our 
    souls long for still; nor will we leave it for the broken cisterns of earth.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">"Incline your ear unto me, and hear my speech."</p></b> Stoop 
    out of Heaven and put your ear to my mouth; give me your ear all to myself, 
    as men do when they lean over to catch every word from their friend. The 
    Psalmist here comes back to his first prayer, and thus sets us an example of 
    pressing our suit again and again, until we have a full assurance that we 
    have succeeded.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. "Show your marvelous loving-kindness."</p></b> <i>
    Marvelous in its antiquity, its distinguishing character, its faithfulness, 
    its immutability, and above all, marvelous in the wonders which it works.
    </i>That marvelous grace which has redeemed us with the precious blood of 
    God's only begotten, is here invoked to come to the rescue. 
<p align="justify">That grace is sometimes hidden; the text says, <b>"Show 
    it." </b>Present enjoyments of divine love are matchless cordials to support 
    fainting hearts. </p>
<p align="justify">Believer, what a prayer is this! Consider it well. O 
    Lord, show your marvelous loving-kindness; show it to my <i>intellect</i>, 
    and remove my ignorance; show it to my <i>heart</i>, and revive my 
    gratitude; show it to my <i>faith</i>, and renew my confidence; show it to 
    my <i>experience</i>, and deliver me from all my fears. </p>
<p align="justify">The original word here used is the same which in Psalm 
    4:3 is rendered <i>set apart</i>, and it has the force of: Distinguish your 
    mercies, set them out, and set apart the choicest to be bestowed upon me in 
    this hour of my severest affliction. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"O you that save by your right hand them which put their 
    trust in you from those that rise up against them." </p></b>The title here given 
    to our gracious God is eminently consolatory. He is the God of salvation; it 
    is his present and perpetual habit to save believers; he puts forth his best 
    and most glorious strength, using his right hand of wisdom and might, to 
    save all those, of whatever rank or class, who trust themselves with him.
    
<i>
<p align="justify">Happy faith thus to secure the omnipotent protection of 
    Heaven! </p></i>Blessed God, to be thus gracious to unworthy mortals, when they 
    have but grace to rely upon you! The right hand of God is interposed between 
    the saints and all harm; God is never at a loss for means; his own bare hand 
    is enough. <i>He works without tools as well as with them.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8. "Keep me as the apple of the eye." </p></b>No part 
    of the body is more precious, more tender, and more carefully guarded than 
    the eye; and of the eye, no portion more peculiarly to be protected than the 
    central apple, the pupil, or as the Hebrew calls it, "the daughter of the 
    eye."
<p align="justify">The all-wise Creator has placed the eye in a 
    well-protected position; it stands surrounded by projecting bones like 
    Jerusalem encircled by mountains. Moreover, its great Author has surrounded 
    it with many tunics of inward covering, besides the hedge of the eyebrows, 
    the curtain of the eyelids, and the fence of the eyelashes; and, in addition 
    to this, he has given to every man so high a value for his eyes, and so 
    quick an apprehension of danger, that <i>no member of the body is more 
    faithfully cared for than the organ of sight</i>. Thus, Lord, keep you me, 
    for I trust I am one with Jesus, and so a member of his mystical body. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Hide me under the shadow of your wings." </p></b>Even as the 
    parent bird completely shields her brood from evil, and meanwhile cherishes 
    them with the warmth of her own heart, by covering them with her wings—so do 
    you with me, most condescending God, for I am your offspring, and you have a 
    parent's love in perfection. This last clause is in the Hebrew in the future 
    tense, as if to show that what the writer had asked for but a moment before 
    he was now sure would be granted to him. <i>Confident expectations should 
    keep pace with earnest supplication.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. "From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly 
    enemies, who compass me about."</p></b> The foes from whom David sought to be 
    rescued were wicked men. It is hopeful for us when our enemies are God's 
    enemies. They were deadly enemies, whom nothing but his death would satisfy.
    <i>The foes of a believer's soul are mortal foes most emphatically, for they 
    who war against our faith aim at the very life of our life. Deadly sins are 
    deadly enemies, and what sin is there which has not death in it? </i>These 
    foes oppressed David, they laid his spirit waste, as invading armies ravage 
    a country, or as wild beasts desolate a land. 
<p align="justify">He likens himself to a besieged city, and complains that 
    his foes compass him about. It may well quicken our business upward, when 
    all around us, every road, is blockaded by deadly foes. This is our daily 
    position,<i> for all around us dangers and sins are lurking. O God, protect 
    us from them all</i>.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. "They are inclosed in their own fat." </p></b>
    Luxury and gluttony beget vainglorious fatness of heart, which shuts up its 
    gates against all compassionate emotions and reasonable judgments. The old 
    proverb says that <i>full bellies make empty skulls</i>, and it is yet more 
    true that they frequently make empty hearts. 
<p align="justify">The rankest weeds grow out of the fattest soil. Riches 
    and self-indulgence are the fuel upon which some sins feed their flames. 
    Pride and fullness of bread were Sodom's twin sins. (Ezekiel 16:49.) Fed 
    hawks forget their masters; and the moon at its fullest is furthest from the 
    sun. Eglon was a notable instance that a well-fed corporation is no security 
    to life, when a sharp message comes from God, addressed to the inward vitals 
    of the body. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"With their mouth they speak proudly."</p></b> He who adores 
    himself, will have no heart to adore the Lord. Full of selfish pleasure 
    within his heart, the wicked man fills his mouth with boastful and arrogant 
    expressions. <i>Prosperity and vanity often lodge together. </i>Woe to the 
    fed ox when it bellows at its owner—the butcher's axe is not far off!
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. "They have now compassed us in our steps." </p></b>
    The fury of the ungodly is aimed not at one believer alone, but at all the 
    band; they have compassed <i>us. </i>All the race of the Jews were but a 
    morsel for Haman's hungry revenge, and all because of one Mordecai.<i> The 
    prince of darkness hates all the saints for their Master's sake</i>. The 
    Lord Jesus is one of the us, and herein is our hope. He is <i>the Breaker</i>, 
    and will clear a way for us through the hosts which environ us. 
<p align="justify">The hatred of the powers of evil is continuous and 
    energetic, for they watch every step, hoping that the time may come when 
    they shall catch us by surprise. If our spiritual adversaries thus compass 
    every step, how anxiously should we guard all our movements, lest by any 
    means we should be betrayed into evil! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth."</p></b> 
    Trapp witily explains this metaphor by an allusion to a bull when about to 
    run at his victim; he lowers his head, looks downward, and then concentrates 
    all his force in the dash which he makes. 
<p align="justify">It most probably denotes the malicious emnity with which 
    the enemy watches the steps of the righteous; as if they studied the ground 
    on which they trod, and searched after some wrong foot-mark to accuse them 
    for the past, or some stumbling-stone to cast in their future path to trip 
    them in days to come.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. They are like a lion hungry for prey, like a 
    great lion crouching in cover. </p></b>Lions are not more greedy, nor their ways 
    more cunning than are Satan and his helpers when engaged against the 
    children of God. The blood of souls the adversary thirsts after, and all his 
    strength and craft are exerted to the utmost to satisfy his detestable 
    appetite. 
<p align="justify">We are weak and foolish like sheep; but we have a 
    shepherd wise and strong, who knows the old lion's wiles, and is more than a 
    match for his force; therefore will we not fear, but rest in safety in the 
    fold. Let us beware, however, of our lurking foe; and in those parts of the 
    road where we feel most secure, let us look about us lest, perhaps, our foe 
    should leap upon us.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. "Arise, O Lord."</p></b> The more furious the 
    attack, the more fervent the Psalmist's prayer. His eye rests singly upon 
    the Almighty, and he feels that God has but to rise from the seat of his 
    patience, and the work will be performed at once. Let the lion spring upon 
    us, if Jehovah steps between, we need no better defense. When God meets our 
    foe face to face in battle, the conflict will soon be over. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Disappoint him."</p></b> Be beforehand with him, outwit and 
    outrun him. Appoint it otherwise than he has appointed, and so disappoint 
    him. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"Cast him down."</p></b> Prostrate him. Make him sink upon 
    his knees. Make him bow as the conquered bows before the conqueror. What a 
    glorious sight will it be to behold Satan prostrate beneath the foot of our 
    glorious Lord! Hasten, glorious day!
<b>
<p align="justify">"Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is your sword."
    </p></b>He recognizes the most profane and oppressive as being under the 
    providential rule of the King of kings, and used as<i> a sword in the divine 
    hand</i>. What can a sword do unless it be wielded by a hand? No more could 
    the wicked annoy us, unless the Lord permitted them so to do.
<p align="justify">Most translators are, however, agreed that this is not 
    the correct reading, but that it should be as Calvin puts it, "Deliver my 
    soul from the ungodly man by your sword." Thus David contrasts the<i> sword 
    of the Lord </i>with human aids and reliefs, and rests assured that he is 
    safe enough under the patronage of Heaven.</p>

<p align="justify">Verse 14.</p></b> Almost every word of this verse has 
    furnished matter for discussion to scholars, for it is very obscure. We 
    will, therefore, rest content with the common version, rather than distract 
    the reader with divers translations. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"From men which are your hand."</p></b> Having styled the 
    ungodly a sword in his Father's hand, he now likens them to that hand 
    itself, to set forth his conviction that God could as easily remove their 
    violence as a man moves his own hand. He will never slay his child with his 
    own hand. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"From men of the world,"</p></b> mere earthworms; not men of 
    the world to come, but mere dwellers in this narrow sphere of 
    mortality—having no hopes or wishes beyond the ground on which they tread.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">"Who have their portion in this life." </p></b>Like the 
    prodigal, they have their portion, and are not content to wait their 
    Father's time. Like <i>Passion </i>in the "Pilgrim's Progress," they have 
    their best things first, and revel during their little hour. 
<p align="justify">Luther was always afraid lest he should have his portion 
    here, and therefore frequently gave away sums of money which had been 
    presented to him. <i>We cannot have earth and Heaven too for our choice and 
    portion. Wise men choose that which will last the longest</i>. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Whose belly you fill with your hid treasure."</p></b> Their 
    sensual appetite gets the gain which it craved for.<i> God gives to these 
    swine the husks which they hunger for. A generous man does not deny dogs 
    their bones. </i>Just so, our generous God gives even his enemies enough to 
    fill them, if they were not so unreasonable as never to be content. 
<p align="justify">Gold and silver which are locked up in the dark 
    treasuries of the earth are given to the wicked liberally, and they 
    therefore roll in all manner of carnal delights. <i>Every dog has his day</i>, 
    and they have theirs, and a bright summer's day it seems; but ah! how soon 
    it ends in night! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"They are full of children."</p></b> This was their fondest 
    hope, that a race from their loins would prolong their names far down the 
    page of history, and God has granted them this also; so that they have all 
    that heart can wish. What enviable creatures they seem, but it is only <i>
    seeming</i>! 
<b>
<p align="justify">"They are full of children, and leave the rest of their 
    substance to their babes." </p></b>They were fat housekeepers, and yet leave no 
    lean wills. Living and dying they lacked for nothing but grace—and alas! 
    that lack spoils everything! They had a fair portion within the little 
    circle of time, but eternity entered not into their calculations.
<i>
<p align="justify">They were penny wise, but pound foolish.</p>
<p align="justify">They remembered the present, and forgot the future.</p>
<p align="justify">They fought for the shell, and lost the kernel. </p>
</i>
<p align="justify">How fine a description have we here of many a successful 
    merchant, or popular statesman; and it is, at first sight, very showy and 
    tempting, but in contrast with the glories of the world to come, what are 
    these paltry molehill joys. <i>Self, self, self</i>—all these joys begin and 
    end in basest selfishness; but oh, our God, how rich are those who begin and 
    end in you! From all the contamination and injury which association with 
    worldly men is sure to bring us, deliver you us, O God!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 15. As for me, I will see Your face in 
    righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake in Your likeness. </p>
<p align="justify">"As for me."</p></b> "I neither envy nor covet these men's 
    happiness, but hope is far better." To behold God's face and to be changed 
    by that vision into his image, so as to partake in his righteousness, this 
    is my noble ambition; and in the prospect of this I cheerfully waive all my 
    present enjoyments. My satisfaction is to come—I do not look for it here on 
    earth. I shall sleep awhile, but I shall wake at the sound of the trumpet; 
    wake to everlasting joy, because I arise in your likeness, O my God and 
    King! 
<p align="justify">Glimpses of glory godly men have here below to stay their 
    sacred hunger, but <i>the full feast awaits them in the upper skies</i>. 
    Compared with this deep, ineffable, eternal fullness of delight—the joys of 
    the worldlings are as a glowworm compared to the sun, or the drop of a 
    bucket compared to the ocean.</p>
