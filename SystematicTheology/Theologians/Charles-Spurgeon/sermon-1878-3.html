        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"Yea, he is altogether lovely." -- Solomons Song 5:16.</p>
        <p>
          NO WORDS can ever express the gratitude we owe to Him who loved us
          even when we were dead in trespasses and sins: the love of Jesus is
          unutterably precious and worthy of daily praise. No songs can ever
          fitly celebrate the triumphs of that salvation which he wrought
          singlehanded on our behalf: the work of Jesus is glorious beyond
          compare, and all the harps of angels fall short of its worthy honour.
          Yet I do believe, and my heart prompts me to say so, that the highest
          praise of every ransomed soul and of the entire Christian church
          should be offered to the blessed person of Jesus Christ, our adorable
          Lord. The love of his heart is excelled by the heart which gave forth
          that love, and the wonders of his hand are outdone by the hand itself,
          which wrought those godlike miracles of grace. We ought to bless him
          for what he has done for us as Mediator in the place of humble service
          under the law, and for what he suffered for us as Substitute on the
          altar of sacrifice from before the foundation of the world; and for
          what he is doing for us as Advocate in the place of highest honour at
          the right hand of the Majesty on high: but still the best thing about
          Christ is Christ himself. We prize his, but we worship him. His gifts
          are valued, but he himself is adored. While we contemplate, with
          mingled feelings of awe, admiration, and thankfulness, his atonement,
          his resurrection, his glory in heaven, and his second coming, still it
          is Christ himself, stupendous in his dignity as the Son of God, and
          superbly beautiful as the Son of man, who sheds an incomparable charm
          on all those wonderful achievements, wherein his might and his merit,
          his goodness and his grace appear so conspicuous. For him let our
          choicest spices be reserved, and to him let our sweetest anthems be
          raised. Our choicest ointment must be poured upon his head, and for
          his own self alone our most costly alabaster boxes must be broken.

          "He is altogether lovely." Not only is his teaching attractive, his
          doctrine persuasive, his life irreproachable, his character
          enchanting, and his work a self-denying labour for the common good of
          all his people, but he himself is altogether lovely. I suppose at
          first we shall always begin to love him because he first loved us, and
          even to the last his love to us will always be the strongest motive of
          our affection towards him; still there ought to be added to this
          another reason less connected with ourselves, and more entirely
          arising out of his own superlative excellence; we ought to love him
          because he is lovely and deserves to be loved. The time should come,
          and with some of us it has come, when we can heartily say "we love him
          because we cannot help it, for his all-conquering loveliness has quite
          ravished our hearts." Surely it is but an unripe fruit to love him
          merely for the benefits which we have received at his hand. It is a
          fruit of grace, but it is not of the ripest flavour; at least, there
          are other fruits, both new and old, which we have laid up for thee, O
          our beloved, and some of them have a daintier taste. There is a sweet
          and mellow fruit which can only be brought forth by the summer sun of
          fellowship -- love because of the Redeemer's intrinsic goodness and
          personal sweetness. Oh that we might love our Lord for his own sake,
          love him because he is so supremely beautiful that a glimpse of him
          has won our hearts, and made him dearer to our eyes than light. Oh
          that all true and faithful disciples of our beloved Lord would press
          forward towards that state of affection, and never rest till they
          reach it! If any of you have not reached it, you need not therefore
          doubt your own safety, for whatever the reason why you love Jesus, if
          you love him at all, it is a sure pledge and token that he loves you,
          and that you are saved in him with an everlasting salvation. Still
          covet earnestly the best gifts, and rise to the highest degree of
          devotion,. Love as the purest of the saints have loved; love as John
          the apostle loved, for still your Lord exceeds all the loving homage
          you can pay to him. Love his person, love himself; for he is better
          than all that he has done or given; and as from himself all blessings
          flow, so back to himself should all love return.
        </p>

          Our text tells us that Christ is altogether lovely. What a wealth of
          thought and feeling is contained in that exclamation! I am embarrassed
          to know how to preach on such a subject, and half inclined to wish it
          had not been laid so much upon my heart. What, I pray you, what is
          loveliness? To discern it is one thing, but it is quite another thing
          to describe it. There is not one amongst us but knows how to
          appreciate beauty, and to be enamoured of its attractions, but how
          many here could tell us what it is? Stand up, my brother, and define
          it. Perhaps while you were sitting down you thought you could easily
          tell the tale, but now you are on your feet you find that it is not
          quite so easy to clothe in words the thoughts which floated through
          your brain. What is beauty? Cold-blooded word-mongers answer, fitness.
          And certainly there is fitness in all loveliness. But do not tell me
          that beauty is mere fitness, for I have seen a world of fitness in
          this world which, nevertheless, seemed to me to be inexpressibly ugly
          and unlovable. A wise man tells me that beauty is proportion; but
          neither is this a full description by many a league. No doubt it is
          desirable that the features should be well balanced; the eyes should
          be fitly set, no one feature should be exaggerated, and none should be
          dwarfed.
        </p>
        <p>"In nature what affects our hearts,</p>
        <p>Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts;</p>
        <p>'Tis not a lip or eye we beauty call,</p>
        <p>But the joint force and full result of all."</p>
        <p>
          Harmony is beauty. Yet I have seen the chiselled marble, fashioned
          with skilful art into a well-nigh perfect form, which did not, could
          not, impress me with a sense of loveliness. There stands in one of the
          halls of the Vatican a statue of Antinous. Every feature in that
          statue is perfect in itself, and in complete harmony with all the
          rest. You could not find the slightest fault with eye or nose or
          mouth. It is indeed as much the ideal of male beauty as the Venus is
          of female charms, yet no one could ever have been enchanted with the
          statue, or have felt affection to the form which it represents. There
          is no expression whatever in the features. Everything is so adjusted
          and proportioned that you want a divergence to relieve you. The
          materialism is so carefully measured out that there needs a stir, a
          break in the harmony to give at least some semblance of a soul.
          Beauty, then, consists not in mere harmony, nor in balancing the
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loveliness surely is attractiveness. Yes, but that is another way of
          saying you do not know what it is. It is a something that attracts
          you, and constrains you to exclaim, "Nought under heaven so strongly
          doth allure." We feel its power, we become its slaves; but we cannot
          write with pen of cold steel, nor could we write even with a pen of
          lightning, a description of what it is. How, then, can I -- enamoured,
          entranced, enraptured as I am with him whom my soul loveth -- how can
          I speak of him? He is altogether lovely? Where shall I find words,
          terms, expressions that shall fitly set him forth? Unless the Eternal
          Spirit shall upraise me out of myself I must for ever be incapable of
          setting forth the Well-beloved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, were I baffled by nothing else, there is this, that the
          beauty of Christ is mysterious. It surpasses all the comeliness of
          human form. He may have had great beauty according to the flesh. That
          I cannot tell, but I should imagine that such a perfect soul as his
          must have inhabited a perfectly molded body. Never yet did you or I
          gaze with satisfaction upon the work of any painter who has tried to
          picture our Lord Jesus Christ. We have not blamed the great masters,
          but we have felt that the effort surpassed their powers. How could
          they photograph the sun? The loftiest conceptions of great artists in
          this case fall far short of the mark. When the brightness of the
          Father's glory is the subject the canvas glows in vain. Art sits at
          her easel and produces diligently many a draught of the sacred
          features; but they are all failures, and they must be. Who shall ever
          depict Immanuel, God-with-us? I suppose that, by-and-by, when our Lord
          had entered upon his active life, and encountered its struggles, his
          youthful beauty was marred with lines of sadness and sorrow. Still his
          courage so overshadowed his cares, the mercy he showed so surpassed
          the misery he shared, and the grace he dispensed so exceeded the
          griefs that he carried, that a halo of real glory must ever have shone
          around his brow. His countenance must still have been lovely even when
          surrounded with the clouds of care and grief. How can we describe even
          the marred visage? It is a great mystery, but a sure fact, that in our
          Lord's marred countenance his beauty is best seen. Anguish gave him a
          loveliness which else he had not reached. His passion put the
          finishing touch upon his unrivalled loveliness.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, brethren, I am not about to speak of Christ's loveliness after
          the flesh, for now after the flesh know we him no more. It is his
          moral and spiritual beauty, of which the spouse in the song most
          sweetly says, "Yea, he is altogether lovely." The loveliness which the
          eye dotes on is mere varnish when compared with that which dwells in
          virtue and holiness; the worm will devour the loveliness of skin and
          flesh, but a lovely character will endure for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. THIS IS RARE PRAISE. Let that be our first head. This is rare
          praise. What if I say it is unique? For of no other being could it be
          said, "Yea, he is altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          It means, first, that all that is in him is lovely, perfectly lovely.
          There is no point in our Lord Jesus that you could improve. To paint
          the rose were to spoil its ruddy hue. To tint the lily, for he is lily
          as well as rose, were to mar its whiteness. Each virtue in our Lord is
          there in a state of absolute perfection: it could not be more fully
          developed. If you were able to conceive of each virtue at its ripest
          stage it would be found in him. In the matter of transparent
          ingenuousness and sterling honesty, did ever man speak or act so
          truthfully as he? Ask, on the other hand, for sympathizing tenderness
          and love, was ever any so gentle as Jesus? Do you want reverence to
          God? how he bows before the Father. Do you want boldness before men?
          how he beards the Pharisees. You could not better anything which you
          find in Jesus. Wherever you shall cast your eye it may rest with
          satisfaction, for the best of the best of the best is to be seen in
          him. He is altogether lovely at every separate point, so that the
          spouse, when she began with his head, descended to his feet, and then
          lifting her eyes upward again upon a return voyage of delight, she
          looked into his countenance and summed up all that she had seen in
          this one sentence, "He is altogether lovely." This is rare praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he is all that is lovely. In each one of his people you will find
          something that is lovely, -- in one there is faith, in another
          abounding love; in one tenderness, in another courage, but you do not
          find all good things in any one saint -- at least not all of them in
          full perfection; but you find all virtues in Jesus, and each one of
          them at its best. If you would take the best quality of one saint, and
          the best quality of another -- yea, the best out of each and all the
          myriads of his people, you would find no grace or goodness among them
          all which Jesus does not possess in the fullest degree and in the
          highest perfection. He combines all the virtues, and gives them all a
          sweetness over and beyond themselves. In flowers you have a separate
          beauty belonging to each; no one flower is just like another, but each
          one blushes with its own loveliness: but in our Lord these separate
          and distinct beauties are found united in one. Christ is the posy in
          which all the beauties of the garden of perfection are bound up. Each
          gem has its own radiance: the diamond is not like the ruby, nor the
          ruby like the emerald; but Christ is that ring in which you have
          sapphire, ruby, diamond, emerald, set in choice order, so that each
          one heightens the other's brilliance. Look not for anything lovely out
          of Jesus, for he has all the loveliness. All perfections are in him
          making up one consummate perfection; and all the loveliness which is
          to be seen elsewhere is but a reflection of his own unrivalled charms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Jesus Christ -- this, moreover, is rare praise again -- there is
          nothing that is unlovely. You have a friend whom you greatly admire
          and fondly esteem, of whom, nevertheless, I doubt not you have often
          said to yourself in undertone, "I wish I could take away a little of
          the rough edge of his manners here and there." You never thought that
          of Christ. You have observed of one man that he is so bold as to be
          sometimes rude; and of another that he is so bland and amiable that he
          is apt to be effeminate. You have said, "That sweetness of his is
          exceedingly good, but I wish that it were qualified with sterner
          virtues." But there is nothing to tone down or alter in our divine
          Lord. He is altogether lovely. Have you not sometimes in describing a
          friend been obliged to forget, or omit, some rather prominent
          characteristic when you wished to make a favourable impression? You
          have had to paint him as the artist once painted Oliver Cromwell; the
          great wart over the eyebrow was purposely left out of the portrait.
          Cromwell, you know, said, "Paint me as I am, or not at all." We have,
          however, often felt that it was kind to leave out the warts when we
          were talking of those we esteemed, and to whom we would pay a graceful
          tribute. But there is nothing to leave out in Christ, nothing to hold
          back, or to guard, or to extenuate. In him is nothing redundant,
          nothing overgrown. He is altogether lovely. You never need put the
          finger over the scar in his case, as Apelles did when he painted his
          hero. No; tell it all out: reveal the details of his private life and
          secret thoughts, they need no concealment. Lay bare the very heart of
          Christ, for that is the essence of love and loveliness. Speak of his
          death-wounds, for in his scars there is more beauty than in the
          uninjured comeliness of another: and even when he lies dead in the
          tomb he is more comely than the immortal angels of God at their best
          estate. Nothing about our Lord needs to be concealed; even his cross
          at which his enemies stumble, is to be daily proclaimed, and it will
          be seen to be one of his choicest beauties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frequently, too, in commending a friend whom you highly appreciated,
          you have been prone to ask for consideration of his position, and to
          make excuse for blemishes which you would fain persuade us are less
          actual than apparent. You have remarked how admirable he acts
          considering his surroundings. Conscious that someone would hint at an
          imperfection, you have anticipated the current of conversation by
          alluding to the circumstances which rendered it so hard for your
          friend to act commendably. You have felt the need of showing that
          others influenced him, or that infirmity restrained him. Did you ever
          feel inclined to apologize for Christ? Did he not always stand
          unbending beneath life's pressure, upright and unmoved amidst the
          storms and tempests of an evil world? The vilest calumnies have been
          uttered against him, in the age just past which produced creatures
          similar to Thomas Paine, but they never required an answer; and as for
          the more refined attacks of our modern skepticism, they are for the
          most part unworthy even of contempt. They fall beneath the glance of
          truth, withered by the glance of the eye of honesty. We never feel
          concerned to vindicate the character of Jesus; we know it to be safe
          against all comers. No man has been able to conjure up an accusation
          against Jesus. They seek false witnesses, but their testimony agrees
          not together. The sharp arrows of slander fall blunted from the shield
          of his perfectness. Oh, no; he is altogether lovely in this sense --
          that there is nothing whatever in him that is not lovely. You may
          look, and look, and look again, but there is nothing in him that will
          not bear scrutiny world without end. Taking the lord Jesus Christ as a
          whole -- this is what our text intends to tell us -- he is
          inexpressibly lovely -- altogether lovely. The words are packed as
          tightly as they can be, but the meaning is greater than the words.
          Some translate the passage "He is all desires," and it is a good
          translation too, and contains a grand truth. Christ is so lovely that
          all you can desire of loveliness is in him; and even if you were to
          sit down and task your imagination and burden your understanding to
          contrive, to invent, to fashion the ideal of something that should be
          inimitable -- ay (to utter a paradox) if you could labour to conceive
          something which should be inconceivably lovely, yet still you would
          not reach to the perfection of Christ Jesus. He is above, not only all
          we think, but all we dream of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you all believe this? Dear hearers, do you think of Jesus in this
          fashion? We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. But
          no man among you will receive our witness until he can say, "I also
          have seen him, and having seen him, I set to my seal that he is
          altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now, secondly, as this is rare praise, so likewise IT IS
          PERPETUAL PRAISE. You may say of Christ whenever you look at him,
          "Yea, he is altogether lovely." He always was so. As God over all, he
          is blessed for ever, Amen. When in addition to his godhead, he assumed
          our mortal clay, was he not inimitably lovely then? The babe in
          Bethlehem was the most beautiful sight that ever the world beheld. No
          fairer flower ever bloomed in the garden of creation than the mind of
          that youth of Nazareth gradually unfolding, as he "grew, and waxed
          strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon
          him." All the while he lived on earth, what moral perfections, what
          noble qualities, what spiritual charms were about his sacred person!
          His life among men is a succession of charming pictures. And he was
          lovely in his bitter passion, when as the thick darkness overshadowed
          his soul he prayed, in an agony of desire, "Not my will, but thine, be
          done." The bloody sweat did not disfigure, but adorn him. And oh, was
          he not lovely when he died? Without resentment he interceded for his
          murderers. His patience, his self-possession, his piety, as "the
          faithful martyr," have fixed as the meridian of time the hour when he
          said, "It is finished," and "bowed his head," and "cried with a loud
          voice, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." He is lovely in
          his resurrection from the dead; beyond description lovely. Not a word
          of accusation did he utter against his cruel persecutors, though he
          had risen clothed with all power in heaven and in earth. With such
          tender sympathy did he make himself known to his sorrowing disciples,
          that despite the waywardness of their unbelief their hearts' instinct
          told them it was the same Jesus." He is altogether lovely.

          He will be lovely when he comes with solemn pomp, and sound of
          trumpet, and escort of mighty angels, and brings all his saints who
          have departed with him, and calls up those that are alive and remain
          on the earth till his advent, to meet him in the air. Oh, how lovely
          he will appear to the two throngs who will presently join in one
          company! How admirable will his appearance be! How eyes, ears, hearts
          and voices will greet him! With what unanimity the host redeemed by
          blood will account their highest acclamations as a trivial tribute to
          his honour and glory! "He is altogether lovely." Yea, and he shall be
          lovely for ever and ever when your eyes and mine shall eternally find
          their heaven in beholding him. "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
          to-day, and for ever," is always worthy of this word of praise --
          "altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us retrace our steps for a minute. The more we study the four
          gospels, the more charmed we are with the gospel; for as a modern
          author has well said, "The gospels, like the gospel, are most divine
          because they are most human." As followers of Jesus, rank yourselves
          with those men who companied with him all the time that he went in and
          out among them; and you shall find him lovely in all conditions.
          Lovely when he talks to a leper, and touches and heals him; lovely by
          the bedside when he takes the fever-stricken patient by the hand and
          heals her; lovely by the wayside, when he greets the blind beggar,
          puts his finger on his eyes and bids him see; lovely when he stands on
          the sinking vessel and rebukes the waves; lovely when he meets the
          bier and rekindles the life that had expired; lovely when he visits
          the mourners, goes with the sisters of Bethany to the new-made grave,
          and weeps, and groans, and -- majestically lovely -- bids the dead
          come forth. Lovely is he when he rides through the streets of
          Jerusalem upon a colt, the foal of an ass. Oh, had we been there, we
          would have plucked the palm branches, and we would have taken off our
          garments to strew the way. Hosannah, lovely Prince of Peace! But he
          was just as lovely when he came from the garden with his face all
          besmeared with bloody sweat; just as lovely when they said, "Crucify
          him, crucify him;" just as lovely, and if possible more so, when down
          those sacred cheeks there dripped the cursed spittle from the rough
          soldiers' mouths; ay, and loveliest, to my eyes loveliest of all, when
          mangled, wounded, fainting, bruised, dying, he said, "My God, my God,
          why hast thou forsaken me?" uttering a plaintive cry of utmost grief
          from the felon's gibbet whereon he died. Yea, view him where you will,
          in any place soever, is he not -- I speak to you who know him, and not
          to those who never saw him with the eye of faith -- is he not, in the
          night and in the day, on the sea and on the land, on earth and in
          heaven, altogether lovely?
        </p>
        <p>
          He is lovely in all his offices. What an entrancing sight to see the
          king in his beauty, with his diadem upon his head, as he now sits in
          yonder world of brightness! How charming to view him as a priest, with
          the Urim and Thummin, wearing the names of his people bejewelled on
          his breastplate! And what a vision of simple beauty, to see him as a
          prophet teaching his people in touching parables of homely interest,
          of whom they said, "Never man spake like this man"! The very tones of
          his voice, and the glance of his eyes, made his eloquence so supreme
          that it enthralled men's hearts. Yes, he is lovely, altogether lovely
          in any and every character. We know not which best beseems him, the
          highest or the lowliest positions. Let him be what he may -- Lamb or
          Shepherd, Brother or King, Saviour or Master, Foot-washer or Lord --
          in every relation he is altogether lovely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Get a view of him, my brethren, from any point and see whether he is
          not lovely. Do you recollect the first sight you ever had of him? It
          was on a day when your eyes were red with weeping over sin, and you
          expected to see the Lord dressed in anger coming forth to destroy you.
          Oh, it was the happiest sight I ever saw when I beheld my sins rolling
          into his sepulchre and when looking up I beheld him my substitute
          bleeding on the tree. Altogether lovely was he that day. Since then
          providence has given us a varied experience and taken us to different
          points of view that we might look at Christ, and see him under many
          aspects. We look at statues from several standpoints if we would
          criticize them. A great many in London are hideous from all points of
          view -- others are very well if you look at them this way, but if you
          go over yonder and look from another point the artist appears to have
          utterly failed. Now, beloved, look at Jesus from any point you like,
          and he is at his best from each and every corner. You have been in
          prosperity: God multiplied your children and blessed your basket and
          your store, -- was Jesus lovely then? Assuredly he was the light of
          your delights. Nothing he had given you vied with himself. He rose in
          your hearts superior to his own best gifts. But you tell me that you
          have been very sick, and you have lost one after another of your dear
          ones; your means have been reduced; you have come down in the world:
          say, then, is Jesus lovely now? I know that you will reply "Yes, more
          than ever is Christ delightful in mine eyes." Well, you have had very
          happy times, and you have been on the mount of hallowed friendship.
          The other Sunday morning many of us were up there, and thought like
          Peter that we should like to stay there for ever; and is not Jesus
          lovely when he is transfigured and we are with him? Yes, but at
          another time you are down in the depths with Jonah, at the bottom of
          the sea. Is not Christ lovely then? Yes, even there he hears our
          prayer out of his holy temple, and brings us again from the deep
          abyss. We shall soon lie dying. Oh, my brethren, what brave talk God's
          people have often given us about their Lord when they have been on the
          edge of the grave! That seems to be a time when the Well-beloved takes
          the veil off his face altogether and sits by the bedside, and lets his
          children look into his face, and see him as he is. I warrant you the
          saints forget the ghastliness of death when their hearts are ravished
          with the loveliness of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, hitherto, up to this point Jesus has been lovely; and now let us
          add that he will always be so. You know there are persons whom you
          account beautiful when you are young, but when you grow older in
          years, riper in judgment, and more refined in taste, you meet with
          others who look far more beautiful. Now, what think you of your Lord?
          Have you met with anyone in fact or in fable more beautiful than he?
          You thought him charming when you were but a babe in grace. What think
          you of him now? Taste, you know, grows, and develops with education:
          an article of virtue which fascinated you years ago has no longer any
          charms for you because your taste is raised. Has your spiritual taste
          outgrown your Lord's beauties? Come, brothers, does Christ go down as
          you learn truth more exactly and acquaint yourself more fully with
          him? Oh no. You prize him a thousand times more to-day than you did
          when the first impression of his goodness was formed in your mind.
          Some things which look very lovely at a distance lose their loveliness
          when you get near to them: but is it not true (I am sure it is) that
          the nearer you get to Christ the lovelier he is? Some things are only
          beautiful in your eyes for their novelty: you admire them when you
          have seen them once; if you were to see them a dozen times you would
          not care much about hem. What say you about my Master? Is it not true
          that the oftener you see him, the more you know him, and the more
          familiar your intercourse with him, the more he rises in your esteem?
          I know it is so; and well, therefore, did the spouse say, "He is
          altogether lovely."
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ is altogether lovely in this respect -- that, when men reproach
          him and rail at him, he is often all the lovelier in his people's
          eyes. I warrant you Christ has been better known by the burn-side in
          Scotland by his covenanting people than ever he has been seen under
          the fretted roof of cathedral architecture. Away there in lonely
          glens, amid the mosses and the hills, where Covenanters met for fear
          of Claverhouse and his dragoons, the Lord Jesus has shone forth like
          the sun in his strength. We have nowadays to be satisfied with his
          moonlight face, but in persecuting days his children have seen his sun
          face, and oh! how glad they have been. Hear how the saints sing in
          prison! Listen to their charming notes, even on the rack, when the
          glory of his presence fills their souls with heaven on earth, and
          makes them defy the torments of the flesh. The Lord Jesus is more
          lovely to the soul that can bear reproach for him than he is to any
          other. Put the cross on his back if you will, but we love him all the
          better for that. Nail up his hands, but we love him all the better for
          that. Now fasten his feet; ay, but our soul melteth with love to him,
          and she feels new reasons for loving him when she beholds the nails.
          Now stand ye around the cross, ye worldlings, and mock him if ye will.
          Taunt and jest, and jeer and jibe -- these do but make us love the
          better the great and glorious one, who "made himself of no reputation,
          and took upon him the form of a servant, and being found in fashion as
          a man, humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death
          of the cross."
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, you shall keep on looking at Christ from all these points of
          view till you get to heaven, and each time you shall be more enamoured
          of him. When you reach the celestial city and see him face to face,
          then shall you say, "The half has not been told us," but even here
          below Christ is altogether lovely to his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I leave that head just to notice, in the third place, that though
          this praise is rare praise and perpetual praise, yet also IT IS
          TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT PRAISE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Say ye that he is altogether lovely? It is not enough. It is not a
          thousandth part enough. No tongue of man, no tongue of angel, can ever
          set forth his unutterable beauties. "Oh," say you, "but it is a great
          word, though short; very full of meaning though soon spoken --
          altogether lovely." I tell you it is a poor word. It is a word of
          despair. It is a word which the spouse uttered, because she had been
          trying to describe her Lord and she could not do it, and so she put
          this down in very desperation: as much as to say, "There, the task is
          too great for me. I will end it. This is all I can say. Yea, he is
          altogether lovely.'" I am sure John Berridge was right when he said --
        </p>
        <p>Living tongues are dumb at best,</p>
        <p>We must die to speak of Christ.</p>
        <p>
          Brethren, the praise of the text is insufficient praise, I know,
          because it is praise given by one who had never seen him in his glory.
          It is Old Testament praise this, that he is altogether lovely: praise
          uttered upon report rather than upon actual view of him. Truly I know
          not how to bring better, but I shall know one day. Till then I will
          speak his praise as best I can, though it fall far short of his
          infinite excellence. Our text is cloth of gold, but it is not fit for
          our Beloved to put the sole of his foot upon. He deserves better than
          this, for this is only the praise of a church that had not seen him
          die, and had not seen him rise, and had not seen him in the splendour
          at the divine right hand. "Well," say you, "try if you can do better."
          No, I will not, because if I did praise him better, the style would
          not last long, for he is coming quickly, and the best thing the best
          speaker could ever say of him will be put out of date by the majesty
          of his appearing. His chariot is waiting at his door now, and he may
          soon come forth from his secret chambers and be among us, and oh! the
          glory -- oh! the glory! Paul, you know, stole a glance through the
          lattices one day when he was caught up into the third heaven. Somebody
          said to me, "I wonder Paul did not tell us what he saw." Ay, but what
          he saw he might not tell, and the words he heard were words which it
          were not lawful for a man to utter, and yet to live among this evil
          generation. We shall hear those words ourselves soon, and see those
          sights not many days hence, so let it stand as it does, "He is
          altogether lovely." But when you have thus summed up all that our poor
          tongues can express, you must not say, "Now we have described him." Oh
          no, sirs, ye have but held a candle to this glorious sun, for he is
          such an one as thoughts cannot compass, much less language describe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leave this point with the reflection, that God intends to describe
          him and set him forth one day. He is waiting patiently, for
          longsuffering is part of Christ's character; and God is setting forth
          the longsuffering of Christ in the patient waiting of these eighteen
          hundred years. But the day shall presently dawn and usher in the
          everlasting age when Christ shall be better seen, for every eye shall
          see him, and every tongue confess that he is Lord. The whole earth
          will one day be sweet with the praise of Jesus. Earth, did I say? This
          alabaster box of Christ's sweetness has too much fragrance in it for
          the world to keep it all to itself; the sweetness of our Lord's person
          will rise above the stars, and perfume worlds unknown. It will fill
          heaven itself. Eternity shall be occupied with declaring the praises
          of Jesus. Seraphs shall sing of it; angels shall harp it; the redeemed
          shall declare it. He is altogether lovely. The cycles of eternity as
          they revolve shall only confirm the statement of the blood-redeemed
          that he is altogether lovely. O that the day were come when we shall
          bow with them and sing with them! Wait a little while and be not
          weary, and you shall be at home, and then you shall know that I spoke
          the truth when I said that this was insufficient praise. Earth is too
          narrow to contain him, heaven is too little to hold him, eternity
          itself too short for the utterance of all his praises.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. So I close with this last thought, which may God bless, for
          practical uses. This praise is VERY SUGGESTIVE.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Christ be altogether lovely it suggests a question. suppose I never
          saw his loveliness. Suppose that in this house there should be souls
          that never saw anything in Christ to make them love him. If you were
          to go to some remote island where beauty consisted in having one eye
          and a twisted mouth, and a sea-green complexion, you would say, "Those
          people are strange beings." Such are the people of this world.
          spiritual beauty is not appreciated by them. This world appreciates
          the man who makes money, however reckless he may be of the welfare of
          others while scheming to heap up riches for himself. As for the man
          who slays his fellow-creatures by thousands, they mount him on a
          bronze horse, put him on an arch, or they pile up a column, and set
          him as near heaven as they can. He slew his thousands: he died
          blood-red: he was an emperor, a tyrant, a conqueror: the world feels
          his power and pays its homage. As for this Jesus, he only gave his
          life for men, he was only pure and perfect, the mirror of
          disinterested love. The vain world cannot see in him a virtue to
          admire. It is a blind world, a fool world, a world that lieth in the
          wicked one. Not to discern the beauties of Jesus is an evidence of
          terrible depravity. Have you, my dear friend, frankly to confess that
          you were never enamoured of him who was holy, harmless, and undefiled,
          and went about doing good? Then let this come home to you -- that the
          question is not as to whether Christ is lovely or not, the mistake is
          here -- that you have not a spiritually enlightened eye, a fine moral
          perception, nor even a well-regulated conscience, or you would see his
          loveliness at once. You are dark and blind. God help you to feel this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not love Christ? Then let me ask you why you do not? There was
          never a man yet that knew Christ that could give a reason for not
          loving him, neither is there such a reason to be discovered. He is
          altogether lovely. In nothing is he unlovable. Oh I wish that the good
          Spirit of God would whisper in your heart, and incline you to say, "I
          will see about this Christ. I will read of him. I will look at the
          four portraits of him painted by the evangelists, and if he be indeed
          thus lovely, no doubt he will win my heart as he appears to have won
          the hearts of others." I pray he may. But do not, I pray you, continue
          to deny Christ your love. It is all you can give him. It is a poor
          thing, but he values it. He would sooner have your heart than all the
          gold in Europe. He would sooner have the heart of a poor servant girl
          or of a poor humble labourer upon the soil than the queen's diadem. He
          loveth love. Love is his gem -- his jewel. He delights to win it, and
          if he be indeed altogether lovely, let him have it. You have known
          people, I dare say, whom you could not help loving. they never had to
          say to you, "Love me," for you were captivated at once by the very
          sight of them. In like manner many and many have only received one
          beam of light from the Holy Spirit, and have thereby seen who Jesus
          was, and they have at once said of him, "Thou hast ravished my heart
          with one look of thine eyes," and so it has been that all their life
          long they have loved their Lord. Now, the praise is suggestive still
          further. "Is Christ altogether lovely? Then do I love him? As a child
          of God, do I love him as much as I ought? I do love him. Yes, blessed
          be his name, I do love him. But what a poor, cold, chill love it is.
          How few are the sacrifices I make for him. How few are the offerings
          that I present to him. How little is the fellowship that I maintain
          with him." Brother, is there a rival in your heart? Do you allow
          anyone to come in between you and the "altogether lovely." If so,
          chase out the intruder. Christ must have all your heart, and let me
          tell you the more we love him the more bliss we shall have. A soul
          that is altogether given up to the love of Christ lives above care and
          sorrow. It has care and sorrow, but the love of Christ kills all the
          bitterness by its inexpressible sweetness. I cannot tell you how near
          a man may live to heaven, but I am persuaded that a very large
          proportion of the bliss of heaven may be enjoyed before we come there.
          There is one conduit pipe through which heavenly joy will flow, and if
          you draw from it you may have as much as you will. "Abide in me" says
          Christ; and if you do abide in his love you shall have his joy
          fulfilled in yourselves that your joy may be full. You will have more
          capacious vessels in heaven, but even now the little vessel that you
          have can be filled up to the brim by knowing the inexpressible
          loveliness of Jesus and surrendering your hearts to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh that I could rise to something better than myself. I often feel
          like a chick in the egg; I am picking my way out, and I cannot get
          clear of my prison. Fain would I chip the shell, come forth to
          freedom, develop wings, and soar heavenward, singing on the road.
          Would God that were our portion. If anything can help us to get out of
          the shell, and to begin to rise and sing, it must be a full and clear
          perception that Jesus is altogether lovely. Come, let us be married to
          him afresh to-night. Come, believing hearts, yield again to his
          charms; again surrender yourselves to the supremacy of his affection.
          Let us have the love of our espousals renewed. As you come to his
          table bethink you of the lips of Christ, of which the spouse had been
          speaking before she uttered my text, -- "His mouth is most sweet."
          There are three things about Christ's mouth that are very sweet. The
          first is his word: you have heart that. The second is his breath.
          Come, Holy Spirit, make thy people feel that. And the third is his
          kiss. May every believing soul have that sweet token of his eternal
          love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forgive my ramblings. May God bless to all his people the word that
          has been spoken. May some that never knew my Master ask to know him
          to-night. Go home and seek him. Read the word to find him. Cry to him
          in prayer and he will be found of you. He is so lovely that I should
          not live without loving him; and I shall deeply regret if any one of
          you shall spend another four-and-twenty hours without having had a
          sight of his divine face by faith.
