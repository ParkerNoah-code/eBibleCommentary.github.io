        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.232)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, January 2nd, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
          sanctified.| -- Hebrews 10:14.
        </p>
        <p>
          THINK OF THIS MORNING'S TEXT -- |The Lord WILL perfect that which
          concerneth me.| Is it not very grateful to observe, that what is just
          in one part of Scripture presented to us as a matter of faith, is in
          another place states as a matter of fact? Think of this evening's text
          -- |He HATH perfected us for ever.| This morning we went downwards,
          from faith to prayer. After having said in confidence, |The Lord will
          perfect that which concerneth me,| we meekly besought him -- |Forsake
          not the works of thine own hands,| -- sinking as it were to a lower
          note in the scale of music. Then we beheld Perfection in the dim
          obscurity of the future, like the sun veiled behind a cloud. Our faith
          rested on it as a thing at present unseen, our hearts yearned after it
          as an inheritance yet in reserve for us. Now to-night, this perfection
          is brought nigh to us, I thing accomplished, as an ever-present fact,
          whose eternal reality shines upon us with unclouded lustre. It is thus
          I read this verse -- |By one offering our Lord Jesus Christ HATH
          perfected for ever them that are sanctified.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been turning this text over, and over, and over in my mind, and
          praying about it, and looking into it, and seeking illumination from
          the Holy Spirit; but I was a long time before I could be clear about
          its exact meaning. It is very easy to select a meaning, and then to
          say, that is what the text means, and very easy also to look at
          something which lies upon the surface; but I am not quite so sure that
          after several hours of meditation any brother would be able to
          ascertain what is the Spirit's mind in this particular verse, |By one
          offering Christ hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.|
          When I was trying to find out what this meant, I thought I would read
          the chapters before it, and if I should happen to find out any word
          that should seem to be the key to this verse, I would then under the
          Spirit's guidance, seek to open this lock and mystery with the
          pick-lock which was there furnished to me. Well, I read the chapters,
          and I did find out a word which seemed to me to explain the whole of
          this verse. You must have patience with me, while I try to show you
          what I think it means; and then I think it will stand out in a very
          clear and glorious light.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the condition of the child of God -- what he is. He is a
          sanctified person |Them that are sanctified.| Secondly, what Christ
          has done for him: |He hath perfected for ever them that are
          sanctified.|
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE CHILDREN OF GOD ARE HERE INTENDED, UNDER THE TERM
          |SANCTIFIED;| they are described as sanctified persons. What does this
          mean? We usually say there are two meanings to the term |sanctified.|
          One is, |set apart.| God has set apart his people from before the
          foundation of the world, to be his chosen and peculiar inheritance. We
          are sanctified by God the Father. There is a second signification,
          which implies not the decree of the Father, but the work of the Holy
          Spirit. We are sanctified in Christ Jesus by the Holy Spirit when he
          subdues our corruptions, imparts to us graces, and leads us onward in
          the divine walk and life of faith. But the word here, I think,
          includes both of these senses; and I must try if I can to find a
          figure which will embrace them both. And what is the apostle speaking
          about? In the ninth chapter he is speaking about the tabernacle, and
          the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread, and the sanctuary,
          and the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid with gold,
          and the pot of manna; he is talking about priests, and about priestly
          things, and holy things; and he is declaring that all these things of
          which he speaks were sanctified things, but that though they were
          sanctified things, they wanted to be made perfect by the sprinkling of
          blood. Now, I believe, the sanctification of our text is to be
          understood in this sense. There were certain golden vessels that were
          used in the sanctuary which were never used for anything else but for
          the service of God. They were set apart, they were made holy, and they
          were kept strictly to be the vessels of the sanctuary of the Lord God.
          They were sanctified things. Again, in the sanctuary there were
          persons who did nothing else but wait upon the Lord. These were
          consecrated to their offices; for God chose the tribe of Levi, and out
          of the tribe of Levi he chose the house of Aaron. These persons were
          chosen, and then they were prepared. They underwent certain
          ceremonies, and divers washings, and so they were made ceremonially
          holy; and these priests were therefore sanctified persons, because
          they were set apart, dedicated and reserved to the special service of
          the Lord God. Now, brethren, that is just what you and I are, and what
          we ought to be. We are sanctified persons: that is to say, we are
          chosen by God to be the peculiar vessels which he will use in pouring
          out his mercy, and to be the special priests whom he shall employ in
          his divine worship in this world. No man had any right to take wine
          for his own drinking, and drink it out of the golden cups of the
          sanctuary. If he did so, he did it to his own destruction -- witness
          Belshazzar. He took the cups, and the golden candlesticks, and so
          forth, and used them in his debaucheries, and lo! he was swept away,
          and the handwriting on the wall foretold his doom. Even so, beloved
          brethren, Christian men are not to be used for anything but for God.
          They are a set-apart people; they are vessels of mercy, they are not
          for the devil's use, not for their own use, not for the world's use,
          but for their Master's use. He has made them on purpose to be used
          entirely, solely and wholly for him. Now, that is what is meant in
          this text by |sanctified.| We are sanctified persons, set apart for
          God's use, consecrated, just as the vessels, the cups, the
          candlesticks, and the tables, and the altars of the sanctuary, were
          sanctified unto God and set apart for his service; and I said, we that
          are priests are sanctified persons, not because of any holiness in our
          character, seeing there were some of them that were not holy in their
          character. My text does not touch character -- it touches position in
          the sight of God. We are not perfect in character, any one of us -- we
          are only perfect in position. There were two men who officiated as
          priests before God, namely the sons of Eli, who committed sin and
          iniquity before God; and yet they were set apart for God's service,
          mark you; and when they offered the sacrifices as priests, because
          they had been washed with water and sprinkled with blood, they were
          officially accepted as being sanctified persons. Now, brethren, the
          children of God are sanctified persons, to offer spiritual sacrifices
          unto God through Jesus Christ, and we have no right to do anything
          else but serve God. |What!| say you, |have not I to attend to my
          business?| Yes, and serve God in your business. |Am I not to look
          after my family?| Assuredly you are, and serve God in your family, but
          still you are to be a set-apart person; you are not to wear the white
          robe nor the breastplate, but still you are to think of yourself as
          being as much a priest as if the breastplate were on your breast, and
          the white robe about your loins; for ye are priests unto God and his
          Father. He hath made you a peculiar generation, a royal priesthood,
          and hath set you apart for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think that this first head of my sermon gives you an inkling of
          what the rest must mean. I have already hinted at what I think is the
          sense of the text. I have explained, I suppose, clearly enough in what
          sense God's people are a sanctified people, as understood in this
          verse. They are chosen and set apart and reserved to be God's
          instruments and God's servants, and thus they are sanctified.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now comes the second thing: IN WHAT SENSE ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND
          THAT CHRIST HAS PERFECTED THESE THAT ARE SANCTIFIED? Why, just this:
          When the golden vessels were brought into the temple or into the
          sanctuary, they were sanctified the very first moment that they were
          dedicated to God. No one dared to employ them for anything but holy
          uses. But they were not perfect. What did they need, then to make then
          perfect? Why, to have blood sprinkled on them; and, as soon as the
          blood was sprinkled on them, those golden vessels were perfect
          vessels, officially perfect. God accepted them as being holy and
          perfect things, and they stood in his sight as instruments of an
          acceptable worship. Just so was it with the Levites and the priests.
          As soon as ever they were set apart to their office; as soon as ever
          they were born, in fact, they were consecrated, they belonged to God;
          they were his peculiar priesthood. But they were not perfect until
          they had passed through divers washings, and had the blood sprinkled
          upon them. Then God looked upon them in their official priestly
          character, as being perfect persons. They were not perfect in
          character, I repeat, they were only perfect officially; perfect in the
          sight of God; and they stood before him to offer sacrifice as
          acceptably, as if they had been pure as Adam himself. Now, then, how
          does this refer to us, and what is the meaning of this text, that |by
          one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified?|
          Turn back a moment or two. You will find in the 9th chapter of the
          Hebrews, at the 6th verse, |Now when these things were thus ordained,
          the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the
          service of God. But into the second went the high priest alone once
          every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for
          the errors of the people.| Mark here. The first meaning of my text is
          this. The child of God is a priest, and as a priest he is sanctified
          to enter within the vail. He is now permitted to go into the place
          which was once within the vail, but which is not so now, because the
          vail is rent in twain; but the high priest could not go within the
          vail, because he was not perfect; he had to be sprinkled with the
          blood, and that made him officially perfect. It would not make him
          perfect merely to put on the breast-plate, or to wear the ephod; he
          was not perfect till the blood had been sprinkled upon him, and then
          he went within the vail. But when next year came round he was not fit
          to go within the vail till blood was sprinkled on him again; and the
          next year, though he was always a sanctified man, he was not always,
          officially, a perfect man. He had to be sprinkled with blood again.
          And so, year after year, the high priest who went within the vail,
          needed afresh to be made perfect, in order that he might obtain access
          to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is one sense of the text. The apostle says that we who are the
          priests of God have a right as priests to go to God's mercy-seat that
          is within the vail; but it were to our death to go there unless we
          were perfect. But we are perfect, for the blood of Christ has been
          sprinkled on us, and, therefore, our standing before God is the
          standing of perfection. Our standing, in our own conscience, is
          imperfection, just as the character of the priest might be imperfect.
          But that has nothing to do with it. Our standing in the sight of God
          is a standing of perfection; and when he sees the blood, as of old the
          destroying angel passed over Israel, so this day, when he sees the
          blood, God passes over our sins, and accepts us at the throne of his
          mercy, as if we were perfect. Therefore, brethren, let us come boldly;
          let us |draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having
          our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
          with pure water.| The apostle brings in, in the twenty-second verse of
          this tenth chapter, one inference which I have just drawn from my
          text. In having access to God, perfection is absolutely necessary. God
          cannot talk with an imperfect being. He could talk with Adam in the
          garden but he could not talk with you or with me, even in paradise
          itself, as imperfect creatures. How, then, am I to have fellowship
          with God, and access to his throne? Why, simply thus: -- |The blood of
          Christ hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,| and
          consequently we have access with boldness to the throne of the
          heavenly grace, and may come boldly in all our time of need. And what
          is better still, we are always perfect, always fit to come to the
          throne, whatever our doubts, whatever our sins. I say not this of the
          priest's character. We have nothing to do with that at present. We
          come before God in our station, not in our character, and therefore,
          we may come as perfect men at all times, knowing that God seeth no sin
          in Jacob, and no iniquity in Israel; for in this sense Christ hath
          perfected for ever, every consecrated vessel of his mercy. Oh! is not
          this a delightful thought, that when I come before the throne of God,
          I feel myself a sinner, but God does not look upon me as one? When I
          approach him to offer my thanksgivings, I feel that I am unworthy in
          myself; but I am not unworthy in that official standing in which he
          has placed me. As a sanctified and perfected thing in Christ, I have
          the blood upon me; God regards me in my sacrifice, in my worship, ay,
          and in myself, too as being perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh how joyful this is! And there is no need a second time to repeat
          this perfecting. It is an everlasting perfection; it allows a constant
          access to the throne of the heavenly grace. That is one meaning of the
          text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, a little further on, our apostle, in the 9th chapter of the
          Hebrews, says, at the 21st verse, |He sprinkled with blood both the
          tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry,| They were all
          sanctified vessels, you know, but they were not perfect vessels till
          they were sprinkled with the blood. |And almost all things are by the
          law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
          It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens
          should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with
          better sacrifices than these,| and so forth. Now, beloved, the vessels
          of the sanctuary, as I have said, were sanctified the moment they were
          put there, but they were not perfect; God could not therefore accept
          any sacrifice that was touched with the golden tongs or that lay upon
          the brazen altar, so long as those golden tongs and the brazen altar
          were imperfect. What was done to make them perfect? Why, they were
          sprinkled with blood; but they had to be sprinkled with blood ever so
          many times -- once, twice, thrice, multitudes of times, because
          continually they wanted making perfect. Now you and I are this day, if
          we are consecrated persons, like the vessels of the sanctuary.
          Sometimes we are like the censer -- God fills us with joy, and then
          the smoke of incense ascends from us; sometimes we are like the
          slaughter-knife that the priests used; we are enabled to deny our
          lusts, to deny ourselves, and put the knife to the neck of the victim,
          and sometimes we are like the altar, and upon us God is pleased to lay
          a sacrifice of labour, and there it smokes acceptably to heaven. We
          are made like sanctified things of his house. But, beloved, we, though
          we are sanctified, and he has chosen us to be the vessels of his
          spiritual temple, are not perfect till the blood is on us. Yet blessed
          be his name, that blood has once been put upon us, and we are
          perfected for ever. Is it not delightful to think that when God uses
          us in his service he could not use unhallowed instruments? The Lord
          God is so pure that he could not use anything but a perfect tool to
          work with. |Then surely he could never use me or use you.| Nay, but
          don't you see, the blood is on us, and we are the sanctified
          instruments of his grace; and moreover, we are the perfect instruments
          of his grace through the blood of Jesus. Oh! I delight to think that
          although in preaching the gospel I am in my own estimation and in
          yours rightly enough, imperfect; yet when God makes use of me in
          conversion, he does not make use of an imperfect man; no, he looks
          upon me in Christ as being perfect in Him, and then he says, |I can
          use this tool; I could not put my hand to an unholy thing, but I will
          look upon him as being perfected for ever in Christ, and therefore I
          can use him. Oh! Christian, do try to digest this precious thought: it
          has indeed been precious to my soul since I first laid hold upon it.
          You cannot tell what God may do with you, because if he uses you at
          all he does not use you as a sinner -- he uses you as a sanctified
          person; nay more, as a perfect person. I will repeat it; I do not see
          how a holy God could use an unholy instrument; but he puts the blood
          on us, and then he makes us perfect -- perfects us for ever, and then
          he uses us. And so I see the work of God tarried on by men whom we
          think are imperfect; but I never see God doing any of his deeds except
          with a perfect instrument; and if you ask me how he has done it, I
          tell you that all his consecrated ones, all whom he has sanctified to
          his use, he has first of all perfected for ever through the sacrifice
          of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we will have use more thought, and then I shall have given you
          the full meaning of the text. In the seventh chapter, the nineteenth
          verse, there is a word that is a key to the meaning of my text, and
          that helped me all through it; and I will give you the key now. |For
          the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope
          did, by the which we draw nigh unto God.| Then with this, compare the
          tenth chapter and first verse, |The law having a shadow of good things
          to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those
          sacrifices which they offered year by year, continually make the
          comers thereunto perfect.| There is the word |perfect;| and we have
          got it in the text; |for then,| says he, if they had been perfect,
          |would they not have ceased to be offered.| Why offer any more, if you
          are a perfect man? |If the sacrifice made is perfect, the worshippers,
          once purged, should have had no more conscience of sin.| Now mark. The
          Jewish sacrifice was never intended to make the Jews' moral character
          any better, and it did not; it had no effect upon what we call his
          sanctification; all the sacrifice dealt with was his justification,
          and the perfection would be sought after; the perfection is not of
          sanctification, which the Arminian talks about, but the perfection of
          official standing, as he stood justified before God. Now that is the
          meaning of the word |perfect| here. It does not mean that the
          sacrifice did not make the man perfectly holy, and perfectly moral,
          and so forth; the sacrifice had no tendency to do that; it was quite
          another matter. It means that it did not perfectly make him justified
          in his own conscience and in the sight of God, because he had to come
          and offer again. Now, here comes a man who is troubled in his
          conscience. He comes sighing up the temple, and he must speak to the
          priest. He says to the priest, |I have committed such-and-such a sin.|
          |Ah! says the priest, |You will never have any ease to your conscience
          unless you bring a sin offering. He brings a sin offering, and it is
          offered, and the man sees it burn and goes away. He has got faith --
          faith in the great sin offering that is to come -- and his conscience
          is easy. A day or two after, the same feelings arise; and what does he
          do? he goes to the priest again. |Ah!| says the priest, |you must
          bring another offering; you most bring a trespass offering.| He does
          that, and his conscience grows easier for a time; but the more his
          conscience gets quickened, the more he sees the unsatisfactory
          character of the offering he brings. At last, he says, |I am so
          uneasy; oh! that I could have a sacrifice every hour! For do you
          know,| says he, |while I can put my hand on the head of the victim, I
          feel so happy: when I come to see it slaughtered, and the blood
          flowing, I feel so easy; but I do not feel perfect. I will even go up
          to the temple,| he says, |that there I may live.| He sees a lamb
          slaughtered in the morning, and tears of joy are in his eye. |Oh!|
          says he |I have seen that lamb; and when I saw the blood of that lamb
          flowing, I felt so rejoiced,| Noon comes. |Ah!| says he, |my sins
          arise again; I have got a conscience, and where can I get relief for
          it?| And off he went to the temple; and there was another lamb in the
          evening, because God well knew that the sacrifices were themselves
          imperfect, only a shadow of the great substance, and that his people
          would need to have the service renewed, not only every year, but every
          day; nay, every morning and every evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, beloved, behold the glory of Christ Jesus as revealed to us
          in our text. |Those sacrifices could not make the comers thereunto
          perfect.| They could not feel in their own conscience that they were
          perfectly justified, and they wanted fresh offerings; but here to-day
          I see the slaughtered Lamb on Calvary, and it was but yesterday I
          rejoiced in him, and I can rejoice in him again to-day. Years ago I
          sought him and I found him. I do not want another Lamb; I do not want
          another sacrifice. I can still see that blood flowing, and I can feel
          continually that I have no more conscience of sin. The sins are gone;
          I have no more remembrance of them; I am purged from them: and as I
          see the perpetual flowing blood of Calvary, and the ever rising merits
          of his glorious passion, I am compelled to rejoice in this fact, that
          he hath perfected for ever me -- made me completely perfect through
          his sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, Christian, try and lay hold opon this meaning of the text.
          Christ has made your conscience at ease for ever; and if it disturbs
          you, recollect it has no cause to do so, if you are a believer in
          Christ; for hath not he given you that which will put away all
          conscience of sin? Oh! rejoice! It has purged you so entirely that you
          may sit down and rest. You may sing with the poet --
        </p>
        <p>|Turn, then, my soul, unto thy rest;</p>
        <p>The merits of thy great High Priest</p>
        <p>Speak peace and liberty.</p>
        <p>Trust in his efficacious blood,</p>
        <p>Nor fear thy banishment from God,</p>
        <p>Since Jesus died for thee.|</p>
        <p>
          Look at the text. Once again I am going to say the same things, lest I
          should not be quite understood. Dear brethren, we could not have
          access to God, unless on the footing of perfection; for God cannot
          walk and talk with imperfect creatures. But we are perfect; not in
          character, mark, for we are still sinners; but we are perfected
          through the blood of Jesus Christ, so that God can allow us to have
          access to him as perfected creatures. We may come boldly, because
          being sprinkled with the blood, God does not look on us as unholy and
          unclean, otherwise he could not allow us to come to his mercy seat;
          but he looks upon us as being perfected for ever through the one
          sacrifice of Christ. That is one thing. The other was this. We are the
          vessels of God's temple; he has chosen us to be like the golden pots
          of his sanctuary; but God could not accept a worship which was offered
          to him in unholy vessels. Those vessels, therefore, were made perfect
          by being sprinkled with blood. God could not accept the praise which
          comes from your unholy heart; he could not accept the song which
          springs from your uncircumcised lips, nor the faith which arises from
          your doubting soul, unless he had taken the great precaution to
          sprinkle you with the blood of Christ; and now, whatever he uses you
          for, he uses you as a perfect instrument, regarding you as being
          perfect in Christ Jesus. That, again, is the meaning of the text, and
          the same meaning, only a different phase of it. And, the last meaning
          is, that the sacrifices of the Jews did not give believing Jews peace
          of conscience for any length of time; they had to come again, and
          again, and again, because they felt that those sacrifices did not
          present to them a perfect justification before God. But behold,
          beloved, you and I are complete in Jesus. We have no need of any other
          sacrifice. All others we disclaim. He hath perfected us for ever. We
          may set our conscience at ease, because we are truly, really, and
          everlastingly accepted in him. |He hath perfected for ever them that
          are sanctified.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what have I to do, but to turn to you and ask this one question,
          and I have done. Are you a sanctified person? I have known a man say
          sometimes to a believer, |Well, you look so sanctified: ah! you are
          one of those sanctified fellows.| Well, if they said so to me, I
          should say, |I wish you would prove it.| What can be a more holy thing
          than to be a sanctified man? and what a more happy thing! Let me ask
          you, then, are you sanctified? Says one, |I feel so sinful.| That I do
          not ask you: I ask you whether you are set apart to God's service. Can
          you say,
        </p>
        <p>|Dear Lord, I give myself away,</p>
        <p>'Tis all that I can do?|</p>
        <p>
          Take me just as I am, and make use of me; I desire to be wholly thine?
          Do you feel that for you to live is Christ; that there is not any
          object you are living for but Christ -- that Christ is the great aim
          of your ambition, the great object of all your labours; that you are
          like Samson, a Nazarite, consecrated to God? Oh! then, remember that
          you are perfected in Christ. But, my hearer, if thou art not
          sanctified to God in this sense, if thou livest to thyself, to
          pleasure, and to the world, thou art not perfected in Christ, and what
          is to become of thee? God will give thee no access to him; God will
          not use thee in his service; thou hast no rest in thy conscience, and
          in the day when God shall come to separate the precious from the vile,
          he will say, |Those are my precious ones, who have the blood on them;
          but these have rejected Christ, they have lived to themselves, they
          were dead while they lived, and they are damned now they are dead.|
          Take heed of that! May God give you grace to be sanctified to God, and
          then shall you be for ever perfected through Christ.<br />
