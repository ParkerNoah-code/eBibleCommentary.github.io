        <p>Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 22nd, 1863, by the</p>
        <p>Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>"I will love them freely." -- Hosea 14:4.</p>
        <p>
          THIS SENTENCE IS A BODY of divinity in miniature. He who understands
          its meaning is a theologian, and he who can dive into its fullness is
          a true Master in divinity. "I will love them freely," is a
          condensation of the glorious message of salvation which was delivered
          to us in Christ Jesus our Redeemer. The sense hinges upon the word
          "freely." "I will love them freely." Here is the glorious, the
          suitable, the divine way by which love streams from heaven to earth.
          It is, indeed, the only way in which God can love such as we are. It
          may be that he can love angels because of their goodness; but he could
          not love us for that reason; the only manner in which love can come
          from God to fallen creatures is expressed in the word "freely." Here
          we have spontaneous love flowing forth to those who neither deserved
          it, purchased it, nor sought after it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the word "freely" is the very key-note of the text, we must
          observe its common meaning among men. We use the word "freely" for
          that which is given without money and without price. It is opposed to
          all idea of bargaining, to all acceptance of an equivalent, or that
          which might be construed into an equivalent. A man is said to give
          freely when he bestows his charity on applicants simply on the ground
          of their poverty, hoping for nothing again. A man distributes freely
          when, without asking any compensation, he finds it more blessed to
          give than to receive. Now God's love comes to men all free and
          unbought; without our having merit to deserve, or money to procure it.
          I know it is written, "Come, buy wine and milk," but is it not added
          "Without money and without price?" "I will love them freely;" that is
          "I will not accept their works in barter for my love; I will not
          receive their love as a recompense for mine; I will love them, all
          unworthy and sinful though they be."
        </p>
        <p>
          Men give "freely" when there is no inducement. A great many presents
          of late have been given to the Princess of Wales, and tis well and
          good; but the position of the Princess is such that we do not view it
          as any great liberality to subscribe to a diamond necklace, since
          those who give are honored by her acceptance. Now the freeness of
          God's love is shown in this, that the objects of it are utterly
          unworthy, can confer no honor, and have no position to be an
          inducement to bless them. The Lord loves them freely. Some persons are
          very generous to their own relations, but here, again, they can hardly
          be said to be free, because the tie of blood constrains them. Their
          own children, their own brother, their own sister -- if men will not
          be generous here, they must be mean through and through. But the
          generosity of our God is commended to us in that he loved his enemies,
          and while we were yet sinners in due time Christ died for us. The word
          "freely" is "exceeding broad" when used in reference to God's love to
          men. He selects those who have not the shadow of a claim upon him, and
          sets them among the children of his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the word "freely," when a favor is conferred without its being
          sought. It can hardly be said that our King in the old histories
          pardoned the citizens of Calais freely when his Queen had first to
          prostrate herself before him, and with many tears to induce him to be
          merciful. He was gracious, but he was not free in his grace. When a
          person has been long dogged by a beggar in the streets, though he may
          turn round and give liberally to be rid of the clamorous applicant, he
          does not give "freely." Remember, with regard to God, that his grace
          to man was utterly unsought. He does give grace to those who seek it,
          but none would ever seek that grace unless unsought grace had first
          been bestowed. Sovereign grace waiteth not for man, neither tarrieth
          for the sons of men. The love of God goes forth to men when they have
          no thought after him; when they are hastening after all manner of sin
          and wantonness. He loves them freely, and as the effect of that love,
          they then begin to seek his face. But it is not our seeking, our
          prayers, our tears, which incline the Lord to love us. God loves us at
          first most freely, without any entreaties or beseechings, and then we
          come both to entreat and to beseech his favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          That which comes without any exertion on our part comes to us
          "freely." The rulers digged the well, and as they digged it they sang
          "Spring up, O well!" In such a case, where a well must be digged with
          much labor, the water can hardly be described as rising freely. But
          yonder, in the laughing valley, the spring gushes from the hill-side,
          and lavishes its crystal torrent among the shining pebbles. Man
          pierced not the fountain, he bored not the channel, for, long ere he
          was born, or ever the weary pilgrim bowed himself to its cooling
          stream, it had leaped on its joyous way right freely, and it will do
          so, as long as the moon endureth, freely, freely, freely. Such is the
          grace of God. No labor of man procures it; no effort of man can add to
          it. God is good from the simple necessity of his nature; God is love,
          simply because it is his essence to be so, and he pours forth his love
          in plenteous streams to undeserving, ill-deserving, hell-deserving
          objects, simply because he "will have mercy on whom he will have
          mercy, and he will have compassion on whom will have compassion," for
          it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
          that sheweth mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ask an illustration of the word "freely," I point to yonder
          sun. How freely he scattereth his life-giving beams. Precious as gold
          are his rays, but he scattereth them like the dust; he sows the earth
          with orient pearl, and bejewels it with emerald and ruby and sapphire,
          and all most freely. You and I forget to pray for the sun's light, but
          it comes at its appointed season; yea, on that blasphemer who curses
          God, the day ariseth, and the sunlight warms him as much as the most
          obedient child of the heavenly Father. That sunbeam falls upon the
          farm of the miser, and upon the field of the churl, and bids the grain
          of the wicked expand in its genial warmth and produce its harvest.
          That sun shines into the house of the adulterer, into the face of the
          murderer, and the cell of the thief. No matter how sinful man may be,
          yet the light of day descends upon him unasked for and unsought. Such
          is the grace of God; where it comes it comes not because sought, or
          deserved, but simply from the goodness of the heart of God, which,
          like the sun, blesseth as it wills. Mark you the gentle winds of
          heaven, the breath of God to revive the languishing, the soft breezes.
          See the sick man at the sea-side, drinking in health from the breezes
          of the salt sea. Those lungs may heave to utter the lascivious song,
          but the healing wind is not restrained, and whether it be breast of
          saint or sinner, yet that wind ceaseth not from any. So in gracious
          visitations, God waiteth not till man is good before he sends the
          heavenly wind, with healing beneath its wings; even as he pleaseth so
          it bloweth, and to the most undeserving it cometh. Observe the rain
          which drops from heaven. It falls upon the desert as well as upon the
          fertile field; it drops upon the rock that will refuse its fertilizing
          moisture as well as upon the soil that opens its gaping mouth to drink
          it in with gratitude. See, it falls upon the hard-trodden streets of
          the populous city, where it is not required, and where men will even
          curse it for coming, and it falls not more freely where the sweet
          flowers have been panting for it, and the withering leaves have been
          rustling forth their prayers. Such is the grace of God. It does not
          visit us because we ask it, much less, because we deserve it; but as
          God wills it, and the bottles of heaven are unstopped, so God wills
          it, and grace descends. No matter how vile, and black, and foul, and
          godless, men may be, he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,
          and that free, rich, overflowing goodness of his can make the very
          worst and least deserving the objects of his best and choicest love.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do understand me. Let me not leave this point till I have well defined
          its meaning. I mean this, dear friends: when God says, "I will love
          them freely," he means that no prayers, no tears, no good works, no
          almsgivings are an inducement to him to love men, nay, that not only
          nothing, in themselves, but nothing anywhere else was the cause of his
          love to them; not even the blood of Christ; not even the groans and
          tears of his beloved Son. These are the fruits of his love, not the
          cause of it. He does not love because Christ died, but Christ died
          because the Father loved. Do remember that this fountain of love has
          its spring in itself, not in you, nor in me, but only in the Father's
          own gracious, infinite heart of goodness. "I will love them freely,"
          spontaneously, without any motive ab extra, but entirely because I
          choose to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the text we have two great doctrines. I will announce the first
          one; establish it; and then endeavor to apply it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. The first great doctrine is this, that THERE IS NOTHING IN MAN TO
          ATTRACT THE LOVE OF GOD TO HIM.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to establish this doctrine, and our first argument is found in
          the origin of that love. The love of God to man existed before there
          was any man. He loved his chosen people before any one of them had
          been created; nay, before the world had been made upon which man
          dwells he had set his heart upon his beloved and ordained them unto
          eternal life. The love of God therefore existed before there was any
          good thing in man, and if you tell me that God loved men because of
          the foresight of some good thing in them, I again reply to that, that
          the same thing cannot be both cause and effect. Now it is quite
          certain that any virtue which there may be in any man is the result of
          God's grace. Now if it be the result of grace it cannot be the cause
          of grace. It is utterly impossible that an effect should have existed
          before a cause; but God's love existed before man's goodness,
          therefore that goodness cannot be a cause. Brethren, the doctrine of
          the antiquity of divine love is graven as with the point of a diamond
          upon the very forehead of revelation; when the children were not yet
          born, neither having done good nor evil, the purpose of election still
          stood; while we were yet like clay in the mass of creatureship, and
          God had power to make of the same dump a vessel to honor or a vessel
          to dishonor, he chose to make his people vessels unto honor; this
          could not possibly have been because of any good thing in them, for
          they themselves were not, much less their goodness. Our Savior's words
          -- "Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight," reveal not
          only the sovereignty but the freeness of divine affection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you not know, dear friends, in the second place, that the whole
          plan of divine goodness is entirely opposed to the old covenant of
          works. Paul is very strong on this point, where he expressly tells us
          that if it be of grace it cannot be of works, and if it be of works it
          cannot be of grace, the two having no possibility of commingling. Our
          God, speaking by the prophet, says, "Not according to the covenant
          that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand
          to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake,
          although I was an husband unto them." The covenant of grace is as wide
          as the poles asunder from the covenant of works. Now the tenour of the
          covenant of works is this -- "This do and thou shalt live;" if, then,
          we do the thing which the covenant of works requires of us we live,
          and we live as the result of our own doing. But the very opposite must
          be the case in the covenant of grace. It can never be as the result of
          anything we do that we are saved under that covenant, or else the two
          are the same, or at least similar, whereas, the whole Bible through
          they are set in contradistinction the one against the other, as
          arranged upon opposite principles, and acting from different springs.
          Oh! you who think that anything in you can make God love you, stand at
          the foot of Sinai and learn the only thing that can lead God to accept
          man on the ground of law, and that is perfect obedience. Read the ten
          commandments through and see if you can keep one of them in the
          fullness of its spirit; and I am sure you will be compelled to cry out
          -- "Thy commandment is exceeding broad. Great God, I have sinned." And
          yet if you would stand on the footing of what you are, you must take
          the whole ten, and you must keep them throughout an entire life, and
          never fail in the slightest point, or else abhorred of God you must
          certainly be. The covenant of grace does not speak on that wise at
          all. It views man as guilty, and having nothing to merit; and it says,
          "I will, I will, I will;" it says not "If they will," but "I will and
          they shall. I will sprinkle pure water upon them and they shall be
          clean, and from all their iniquities I will cleanse them." That
          covenant does not look upon man as innocent, but as guilty. "When I
          passed by I saw them in their blood, and I said live; yea, when I saw
          them in their blood I said, live." The first covenant was a contract:
          "Do this and I will do that;" but the next has not the shadow of a
          bargain in it; it is -- "I will bless you, and I will continue to
          bless you; though you abound in transgressions, yet I will continue to
          bless till I make you perfect and bring you to my glory at the last."
          It cannot be, then, that there is anything in man that makes God love
          him, because the whole plan of the covenant is opposed to that of
          works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, the substance of Gods love -- the substance of the covenant
          which springs from God's love -- clearly proves that it cannot be
          man's goodness which makes God love him. If you should tell me that
          there was something so good in man that therefore God gave him bread
          to eat and raiment to put on, I might believe you. If you tell me that
          man's excellence constrained the Lord to put the breath into his
          nostrils, and to give him the comforts of this life, I might yield to
          you. But I see yonder, God himself made man; I see that God, that man,
          at last fastened to the tree; I see him on the tree expiring in
          agonies unknown, I hear his awful sliviek, -- "Eloi, Eloi, lama
          sabachthani; "I see the dreadful sacrifice of God's only-begotten Son,
          who was not spared but freely delivered up for us all, and I feel
          certain that it would be nothing short of blasphemy if I should admit
          that man could ever deserve such a gift as the death of Christ. The
          very angels in heaven with an eternity of obedience, could never have
          deserved so great a gift as Christ in the flesh dying for them; and
          oh! shall we who are all over foul and defiled, shall we look to that
          dear cross, and say, "I deserved that Savior?" Brethren, this were the
          height of infernal arrogance; let it be far from us; let us rather
          feel that we could not deserve such love as this, and that if God
          loves us so as to give his Son for us, it must be from some hidden
          motive in his own will, it cannot be because of any good thing in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, if you will remember the objects of God's love as well as the
          substance of it, you will soon see that it could not be anything in
          them which constrains God to love them. Who are the objects of God's
          love? Are they Pharisees, the men who fast twice in the week and pay
          tithes of all they possess? No, no, no. Are they the moralists who
          touching the law are blameless, and who walk in all the observances of
          their religion without a slip? No; the publicans and harlots enter the
          kingdom of heaven before them. Who are they who are the chosen of God?
          Let the whole tribe now in heaven speak for themselves, and they will
          say, "We have washed our roses; (they needed it; they were black,) and
          we have made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Appeal to any of
          the saints on earth, and they will tell you that they never could
          perceive any good thing in themselves. I have searched my own heart I
          hope with some degree of earnestness, and so far from finding any
          reason in myself why God should love me, I can find a thousand reasons
          why he should destroy me, and drive me for ever from his presence. The
          best thoughts we have are defiled with sin, our very faith is mixed
          with unbelief; the noblest devotion which we ever paid to God is far
          inferior to his deserts, and is marred with infirmity and fault.
          Remember that many of those who are the true servants of God were once
          the very worst servants of Satan. Does it not surprise you that men
          who were the companions of the harlot are now saints of the Most high?
          The drunkard, the blasphemer, the man who defied man's laws as well as
          God's -- such were some of us, but we are washed, but we are cleansed,
          but we are sanctified. I never did meet, and I never expect to meet
          with any saved soul that would ever for a moment tolerate the thought
          of there being any goodness in itself to merit God's esteem. No; vile
          and full of sin I am, and if thou hast mercy on me, O God, it is
          because thou wilt, for I merit none.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, constantly are we informed in Scripture that the love of God
          and the fruit of the love of God are a gift. "The wages of sin is
          death, but the gift of God is eternal life." Now, if the Lord stands
          bargaining with you and with me, and says, "I will give you this if --
          if -- if -- " then he does not love freely; but if, on the other hand,
          it is simply, and purely, and only a gift bestowed as such, not for
          any recompence afterwards to be given, then the gift is a pure and
          true gift, and so the text is warranted in saying, "I will love them
          freely." Now, the gift of God is eternal life, and dear friends, if
          you and I ever get it, we must obtain it as a free gift from God, but
          by no means as wages which we have earned, for our poor earnings will
          bring us death; only God's gift can yield us life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everywhere throughout the Word the Lord's love is greatly and
          wonderfully commended. We are told that as high as the heavens are
          above the earth so high are his ways above our ways. Now, if the Lord
          loved men for some loveliness in them, there would be nothing
          wonderful in it; you and I can do the same. I hope I can love a man
          who possesses moral excellence. You feel, each of you, that if a man's
          conduct towards you is grateful and good, you cannot but love him, or
          if you do not, it becomes a fault on your part. With reverence let me
          say it, if there be something good in man it is no wonder that God
          should love him; it would be unjust if he did not. If naturally in man
          there be any virtue, if there be any praise, if there be any
          commendable repentance, or any acceptable faith, man ought to be
          loved; this is not a thing to amaze the ages, nor to set the angels
          singing, nor to move the mountains and hills in astonisliment; but for
          God to love a man who is bad all over; to love him when there is every
          reason for hating him, when there is not a trace of goodness in him,
          oh! this is enough to make the rocks break their silence and the hills
          burst forth into music.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first doctrine. I cannot preach upon it as I would this
          morning, for my voice is very weak, and the pain of speaking distracts
          my mind; but it matters not how I preach upon it, for the subject
          itself is so exceedingly full of comfort to a really awakened soul,
          that it needs no garnishing of mine: choice dainties need no skill in
          the carver -- their own lusciousness secures them rich acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the practical use of it? To you who are going about to
          establish your own righteousness, here is a death-blow to your works,
          and carnal trustings. God will not love you meritoriously. God will
          love you freely. Wherefore go ye about, then, spending your money for
          that which is not bread, and your labor for that which satisfieth not.
          You may boast as you will, but you will have to come to God on a par
          with the worst of the worst; when you do come you will have to be
          accepted, you that are the best of men, just on the same terms as if
          you had been the foulest of the foul. Therefore go not about, busy not
          yourselves with all this fancied righteousness, but come to Jesus as
          you are, come now, without any works of yours, for you must so come or
          not at all. God has said, "I will love them freely," and depend upon
          it he will never love you in any other way. You may think you are
          toiling to heaven, when you shall be only tunnelling your way through
          mountains of self-righteousness down to the depths of hell.
        </p>
        <p>
          This doctrine offers comfort to those who do not feel fit to come to
          Christ. Do you not perceive that the text is a death-blow to all sorts
          of fitness? "I will love them freely." Now if there be any fitness
          necessary in you before God will love you then he does not love you
          freely, at least this would be a mitigation and a drawback to the
          freeness of it. But it is "I will love you freely." You say "Lord, but
          my heart is so hard." "I will love you freely." "But I do not feel my
          need of Christ as I could wish." "I will not love you because you feel
          your need; I will love you freely." "But I do not feel that softening
          of spirit that I could desire." Remember, the softening of spirit is
          not a condition, for there are no conditions; the covenant of grace
          has no conditionality whatever. These are the unconditional, sure
          mercies of David; so that you without any fitness may come and venture
          upon the promise of God which was made to you in Christ Jesus, when he
          said, "He that beheyeth on him is not condemned." No fitness is
          wanted; "I will love them freely." Sweep all that lumber and rubbish
          out of the way! Oh! for grace in your hearts to know that the grace of
          God is free, is free to you, without preparation, without fitness,
          without money, and without price!
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor does the practical use of our doctrine end here. There are some of
          you who say, "I feel this morning that I am so unworthy; I can well
          believe that God will bless my mother; that Christ will pity my
          sister; I can understand how yonder souls can be saved, but I cannot
          understand how I can be; I am so unworthy." "I will love them freely."
          Oh! does not that meet your case? If you were the most unworthy of all
          created beings, if you had aggravated your sin till you had become the
          foulest and most vile of all sinners, yet "I will love them freely,"
          puts the worst on an equality with the best, sets you that are the
          devil's cast-aways, on a par with the most hopeful. There is no reason
          for God's love in any man, if there is none in you, you are not worse
          off than the best of men, for there is none in them; the grace and
          love of God can come as freely to you as they can to those that have
          long been seeking them, for "I am found of them that sought me not."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet once more here. I think this subject invites backsliders to
          return; indeed, the text was specially written for such -- "I will
          heal their backsliding; I will love them freely." Here is a son who
          ran away from home. He enlisted for a soldier. He behaved so badly in
          his regiment that he had to be drummed out of it. He has been living
          in a foreign country in so vicious a way that he has reduced his body
          by disease. His back is covered with rags; his character is that of
          the vagrant and felon. When he went away he did it on purpose to vex
          his father's heart, and he has brought his mother's grey hairs with
          sorrow to the grave. One day the young lad receives a letter full of
          love. His father writes -- "Return to me, my child; I will forgive you
          all; I will love you freely." Now if this letter had said -- "If you
          will humble yourself so much, I will love you; if you will come back
          and make me such-and-such promises, I will love you;" if it had said,
          "If you will behave yourself for the future, I will love you," -- I
          can suppose the young man's proud nature rising; but surely this
          kindness will melt him. Methinks the generosity of the invitation will
          at once break his heart, and he will say, "I will offend no longer, I
          will return at once." Backslider! without any condition you are
          invited to return. "I am married unto you," saith the Lord. If Jesus
          ever did love you he has never left off loving you. You may have left
          off attending to the means of grace; you may have been very slack at
          private prayer, but if you ever were a child of God you are a child of
          God still, and he cries "How can I give thee up? How can I set thee as
          Admah? How can I make thee as Zeboim? My repentings are kindled
          together; I am God, and not man; I will return unto him in mercy.
          Return, backslider, and seek thine injured Father's face. I think I
          hear a murmur somewhere -- "Well, this is very, very, very Antinomian
          doctrine." Ay, objector, it is such doctrine as you will want one day;
          it is the only doctrine which can meet the case of really awakened
          sinners. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
          yet sinners, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Since it is written. "I will love them freely," we believe that
          NOTHING IN MAN CAN BE AN EFFECTUAL BAR TO GOD'S LOVE.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the same doctrine put in another shape. Nothing in man can be
          the cause of God's love, so nothing in man can be an effectual
          hindrance to God's love -- I mean such an effectual hindrance as to
          prevent God from loving man. How shall I prove it? If there be
          anything in any man which can be a bar to God's grace, then this would
          have been an effectual hindrance to its coming to any of the human
          race. All men were in the loins of Adam, and if there were a bar in
          you to God's love, that would have been in Adam; consequently, being
          in Adam, it would have been a block to God's love to the race
          altogether. If there be some sin in you, I say, which can effectually
          prevent God from showing grace to you, then that was in Adam, seeing
          you were in the loins of Adam, and it would therefore have been an
          effectual hindrance to God's grace from the race in any one of its
          members. Seeing God's grace found no barriers over which it could not
          leap, no floodgates which it could not burst, no mountains it could
          not overtop, I am persuaded there is nothing in you why God should not
          show his grace to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, one would think that if there be a bar in any it would have
          prevented the salvation of those who are undoubtedly saved. Mention
          any sin you like, and I will assure you upon divine authority that men
          have committed such sins and have yet been saved. Talk of a deed that
          has blackened the man's character for ever, that deed of foul adultery
          and murder; yet that did not stop God's love from flowing to David;
          and even if you have gone that length, and I suppose there is no
          person here who has gone farther, even that cannot prevent divine love
          from lighting upon you. As God does not love because there is
          excellence, so he does not refuse to love because there is sin. Let me
          select the case of Manasseh; he shed innocent blood very much; he
          bowed before idols; what was worse, he made his children to pass
          through the fire to the son of Hinnom, put his own child to death as a
          sacrifice to the false god, and yet for all that God's love laid hold
          upon him, and Manasseh became a bright star in heaven, though once as
          vile as the lost in hell. If there be anything in you, then, that
          makes you think God cannot love you, I reply, Impossible, for surely
          your sins do not exceed those of the chief of sinners. Paul says he
          was the chief of sinners, and he meant it; he spoke by inspiration,
          and there is no doubt he was. Now if the biggest of sinners has passed
          through the strait gate, there must be room for the next biggest; if
          the greatest sinner in the world has been saved, then there is a
          possibility for you and for me, for we cannot be such great sinners as
          the very chief of sinners. But I will dare to say that even if we
          were, even if we could exceed Paul, yet even that could be no barrier;
          for man's sin, to say the most of it, is but the act of a finite
          creature, but God's grace is the act of infinite goodness. God forbid
          that I should depreciate your offenses, they are loathsome, they are
          hellish in themselves; still they are only a creature's deeds, the
          deeds of a worm that to-day is and to-morrow is crushed; but the
          grace, the love, and the pity of God, oh! these are infinite, eternal,
          everlasting, boundless, matchless, quenchless, unconquerable, and
          therefore the grace of God can overcome and prove itself mightier than
          your guilt and sin. There is no bar, then, or else there would have
          been a bar in the case of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would it not mar the sovereignty of God if there should be a man in
          whom there was something that would effectually prevent God's love
          from flowing to him? Then it would not be, "I will have mercy on whom
          I will have mercy;" no, it would be "I will have mercy on those I can
          have mercy on; but there is such-and-such a man, I cannot have mercy
          on him, for he is gone too far." No, glory be to God for that sentence
          -- "I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy." The devil may say,
          "What, on that man, on that man! He has gone too far." "Ah!" but says
          God, "if I will it, he has not gone too far; I will have mercy on
          him." I do not know that I ever felt more the boundless sovereignty of
          the grace of God than when I looked that text in the face and saw it
          -- not "I will have mercy on those that are vialing to have it;" or,
          "I will have mercy on penitents," no -- "I will have mercy on whom I
          will have mercy." And so, if God wills to save you, there can be no
          bar to it, or else that would be a marring and a limiting of the
          sovereignty of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would not this be a great slur cast upon the grace of God? Suppose I
          could find out a sinner so vile that Jesus Christ could not reach him;
          why then the devils in hell would take him through their streets as a
          trophy; they would say, "This man was more than a match for God; his
          sin was too great for God's grace." What says the Apostle? "Where sin
          abounded" -- that is you, poor sinner; -- "where sin abounded" -- what
          sins you plunged into last night, and on other black occasions, --
          "where sin abounded" -- what? Condemnation? Hopeless despair? No,
          "Where sin abounded grace did much more abound." I think I see the
          conflict in the great arena of the universe. Man piles a mountain of
          sin, but God will match it, and he upheaves a loftier mountain of
          grace; man heaps up a still huger hill of sin, but the Lord overtops
          it with ten times more grace; and so the contest continues till at
          last the mighty God plucks up the mountains by the roots and buries
          man's sin beneath them as a fly might be buried beneath an Alp.
          Abundant sin is no barrier to the superabundant grace of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, dear friends, would it not detract glory from the gospel, if
          it could be proved that there was some man in whom the gospel could
          not work its way? Suppose that the gospel which is "worthy of all
          acceptation" could not meet certain cases. Suppose I picked out twelve
          men who were so diseased that the gospel remedy could not meet their
          case; oh! then I think I should stop my mouth from all glorying in the
          cross. I could no more say with the apostle, "God forbid that I should
          glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ," for then it would
          not be the power of God unto salvation to every one that beheyeth. No,
          it would be the power of God to all except that dozen. But oh! as
          often as I come into this pulpit, it gives me joy to know that I have
          a gospel to preach which is suitable to every case. A friend told me
          the other day that many notorious characters stole in at times. Thank
          God for that. "Ah!" said some, "but they come only to laugh." Never
          mind; thank God if they come. "Oh! but they will make mockery of it."
          Nay, the Lord knows how to turn mockers into weepers. Let us hope for
          the worst, and labor for the most hopeless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The love of God has provided means to meet the extremest case. They
          are twofold; the power of Christ, and the power of the Spirit. Do you
          tell me that sin is a barrier? I answer, "All manner of sin and of
          blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." "The blood of Jesus Christ, his
          Son, cleanseth from all sin." The atonement of Christ is capable of
          removing from men, all sorts, sizes, and dyes of iniquity. "Though
          your sins be as scarlet they shall be as wool; though they be red like
          crimson they shall be whiter than snow." "Ah," cries one, "man's
          hard-heartedness stands in the way of God's love." Beloved, the Holy
          Spirit is ready to meet the case of the hard heart. "Limit not the
          Holy One of Israel." Is anything too hard for the Lord? You tell me
          that unbelief is a bar. I answer "No," for cannot the Holy Spirit make
          the unbelieving believe, yea, if the Holy Spirit once comes into
          effectual contact with the most unbelieving and obstinate spirit it
          must believe at once. Look at the jailer, a few minutes ago he had
          been putting Paul in the stocks. What, what, what, what is this that
          comes over him? "What must I do to be saved?" "Believe," says the
          Apostle, and he does believe, and becomes as phant as a child. Out on
          the men who think that man is master over God! If he willed to stop at
          this moment the most bloody persecutor, the most filthy and licentious
          man, if he willed to turn the blackest-hearted atheist into one of the
          most brilhant of saints, there is nothing in his way to stop him; in a
          moment omnipotent love can do it; the means are provided, both in the
          blood of Christ for cleansing, and in the power of the Spirit for
          renewing the inner man. Therefore, I say it is established beyond
          doubt, that there is nothing in man which can conquer divine love.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is the practical use of this," says one. The practical use of
          this is to set the gate of mercy wide open. I like always to preach
          sermons which leave the door of mercy on the jar for the worst of
          sinners, but this morning I set it wide open. A man has dropped in
          here who has been thinking for years, "I gave myself up to sin in my
          youth, and I have gone astray ever since -- there is no hope for me."
          I tell you, soul, all that you have ever done is no bar to God's love
          to you, for he does not love you because of anything good in you, and
          that which is black in you cannot prevent his loving you if he so
          wills it. I tell thee what I would have thee do. I have seen those
          like unto thee come to the foot of the cross, and they have said --
        </p>
        <p>"Just as I am, and waiting not</p>
        <p>To rid my soul of one dark blot,</p>
        <p>To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,</p>
        <p>O Lamb of God, I come."</p>
        <p>
          If thou in thy soul canst now trust the love of God in Christ, thou
          art saved; no matter whosoever thou mayest be, thou art saved this
          morning, and thou shalt go out of this house a regenerate soul, for
          thou hast believed in Jesus, therefore the love of God is come to
          thee, all thy past life is forgotten and forgiven; all thy past
          ingratitude, and blasphemy, and sin are cast into the depths of the
          sea; and, as far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
          thy transgressions from thee. I have known the time when, if I had
          heard the sermon of this morning, faint and feeble though it be, I
          should have danced for joy. I feel an intense inward satisfaction and
          delight while preaching it, for I believe it is the opening of the
          prison to them that are bound. Christ died not for the righteous but
          for sinners. He gave himself for our sins and not for our
          righteousness; this old Lutheran doctrine -- this grand doctrine which
          shook old Rome to her very foundations, methinks must give poor
          sinners comfort and peace. I know that many will see nothing in it. Of
          course, none but the sick see any value in the healing medicine. I
          know there are some here who will think the sermon is not for them.
          Oh! may the Spirit of God make some accept of this comfort; but they
          will not unless the Spirit of God makes them. Too many of us are like
          foolish patients, who will not take the physician's medicine, and he
          has need to hold us, and thrust it down before we will take it. This
          is how the Lord dealeth with many, not against their will, but yet
          against their will as it used to be, he giveth them the medicine of
          his grace, and maketh them whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          To sum up all in one, what I mean is this: there have straggled in
          here this morning the poor working man, the struggling mechanic, the
          gay young fop, the man who leads a fast life, the wretch who leads a
          coarse life, the woman, perhaps, who has gone far astray; I mean to
          say to such, you are lost, but the Son of man is come to seek and to
          save you. I mean to say to you, sons and daughters of moral parents,
          who are not converted, but perhaps feel yourselves even worse than the
          immoral, I mean to say to you that you are not past hope yet. God will
          love you freely, and this is how his love is preached to you --
          "Whosoever beheyeth on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved." Come as
          you are; God will accept you as you are. Come as you are, without any
          preparation or fitness; come as you are, and where the cross is lifted
          high with the bleeding Son of God upon it, fall flat on your face,
          accepting the love manifested there, willingly receiving this day the
          grace which God willingly and freely gives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As sinners, without any qualification, as sinners, as undeserving
          sinners, my Lord will receive you graciously and love you freely.
