          17. Fools are afflicted on account of the way of their transgression,
          and by reason of their iniquities.18. Their soul loatheth all food;
          and they approach the gates of death.19. Then they cry unto Jehovah in
          their tribulation; He saves them from their straits.20. He sendeth his
          word, and healeth them, and rescues them from all their corruptions.
          21. Let them praise the mercy of Jehovah in his presence, and his
          marvelous works in the presence of the sons of men.22. And let them
          sacrifice the sacrifices of praise, and declare his works with
          rejoicings.

          17 Fools are afflicted on account of the way of their transgression.
          He comes to another species of chastisement. For as he observed above,
          that those were given over to captivity who refused to yield obedience
          to God, so now he teaches that others have been visited by God with
          disease, as the fruit of their transgressions. And when the
          transgressor shall find that it is God who is administering correction
          to him, this will pave the way for his arriving at the knowledge of
          his grace.

          He denominates those fools, who, thoughtlessly giving themselves up to
          sensuality, bring destruction upon themselves. The sin which they
          commit is not the result of ignorance and error only, but of their
          carnal affections, which depriving them of proper understanding, cause
          them to devise things detrimental to themselves. The maxim, that the
          fear of God is wisdom, must never be lost sight of. Hence it plainly
          follows, that they who shake off the yoke of God, and surrender
          themselves to Satan and sin, are the victims of their own folly and
          fury. And as constituting a principal ingredient of this madness, the
          prophet employs the term deletion or transgression; and subsequently
          he adds iniquities; because it happens that when once a man departs
          from God, from that moment he loses all self-control, and falls from
          one sin into another. But it is not of the distempers which commonly
          prevail in the world to which a reference is made in this passage, but
          to those which are deemed fatal, and in which all hope of life is
          abandoned, so that the grace of God becomes the more conspicuous when
          deliverance from them is obtained. When a man recovers from a slight
          indisposition, he does not so plainly discern the effects of God's
          power, as when it is put forth in a wonderful and notable manner to
          bring back some from the gates of death, and restores them to their
          wonted health and rigour. He says, therefore, that they are preserved
          from many corruptions, which is equivalent to his saying, that they
          are delivered from as many deaths. To this purport are the following
          words of the prophet, in which he says, that they approach the gates
          of death, and that they loathe all food We have already adverted to
          their calling upon God, namely, that when men are reduced to the
          greatest straits, they, by thus calling upon God for aid, acknowledge
          that they would be undone unless he wonderfully interposed for their
          deliverance.
        </p>
        <p>
          20 He sendeth his word. Again, in saying that they are delivered from
          destruction, the prophet shows that he is here alluding to those
          diseases which, in the opinion of men, are incurable, and from which
          few are delivered. Besides, he contrasts God's assistance with all the
          remedies which are in the power of man to apply; as if he should say,
          that their disease having baffled the skill of earthly physicians,
          their recovery has been entirely owing to the exertion of God's power.
          It is proper also to notice the manner in which their recovery is
          effected; God has but to will it, or to speak the word, and instantly
          all diseases, and even death itself, are expelled. I do not regard
          this as exclusively referring to the faithful, as many expositors do.
          I own, indeed, that it is of comparatively little consequence to us to
          be the subjects of bodily care, if our souls still remain unsanctified
          by the word of God; and hence it is the intention of the prophet that
          we consider the mercy of God as extending to the evil and unthankful.
          The meaning of the passage, therefore, is, that diseases neither come
          upon us by chance, nor are to be ascribed to natural causes alone, but
          are to be viewed as God's messengers executing his commands; so that
          we must believe that the same person that sent them can easily remove
          them, and for this purpose he has only to speak the word. And since we
          now perceive the drift of the passage, we ought to attend to the very
          appropriate analogy contained in it. Corporeal maladies are not
          removed except by the word or command of God, much less are men's
          souls restored to the enjoyment of spiritual life, except this word be
          apprehended by faith.

          And let them sacrifice This clause is subjoined by way of explanation,
          the more strongly to express how God is robbed of his due, if in the
          matter of sacrifice his providence be not recognised. Even nature
          itself teaches that some kind of homage and reverence is due to God;
          this is acknowledged by the heathens themselves, who have no other
          instructor than nature. We know too, that the practice of offering
          sacrifices has obtained among all nations; and doubtless it was by the
          observance of this ritual, that God designed to preserve in the human
          family some sense of piety and religion. To acknowledge the bounty and
          beneficence of God, is the most acceptable sacrifice which can be
          presented to him; to this subject, therefore, the prophet intends to
          recall the attention of the insensate and indifferent portion of men.
          I do not deny that there may be also an allusion to the ceremonial
          law; but inasmuch as in the world at large sacrifices formed part of
          the religious exercises, he charges those with ingratitude, who, after
          having escaped from some imminent peril, forget to celebrate the
          praises of their Great Deliverer.<br />
