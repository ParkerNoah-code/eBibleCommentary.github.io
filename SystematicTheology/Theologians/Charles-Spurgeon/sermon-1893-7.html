          It should give us all a great deal of hope and comfort that Jesus
          saved such a man as the penitent thief just before He went back to
          heaven. Every one who is not a Christian ought to be interested in
          this case, to know how he was converted. Any one who does not believe
          in sudden conversions ought to look into it. If conversions are
          gradual, if it takes six months, or six weeks, or six days to convert
          a man, there was no chance for this thief. If a man who has lived a
          good, consistent life cannot be converted suddenly, how much less
          chance for him! Turn to the 23d chapter of Luke, and see how the Lord
          dealt with him. He was a thief, and the worst kind of a thief, or else
          they would not have punished him by crucifixion. Yet Christ not only
          saved him, but took him up with Himself into glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us look at Christ hanging on the cross between the two thieves.
          The Scribes and Pharisees wagged their heads, and jeered at Him. His
          disciples had fled. Only His mother and one or two other women
          remained in sight to cheer Him with their presence among all the crowd
          of enemies. Hear those spiteful Pharisees mocking among themselves:
          "He saved others; Himself He cannot save." The account also says that
          the two thieves "cast the same in his teeth."
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>REVILING.</p>
        <p>
          The first thing we read, then, of this man is that he was a reviler of
          Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would think that he would be doing something else at such a time
          as that; but hanging there in the midst of torture, and certain to be
          dead in a few hours, instead of confessing his sins and preparing to
          meet that God whose law he had broken all his life, he is abusing
          God's only Son. Surely, he cannot sink any lower, until he sinks into
          hell!
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>UNDER CONVICTION.</p>
        <p>The next time we hear of him, he appears to be under conviction:</p>
        <p>
          "And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on Him, saying,
          If thou be Christ, save Thyself and us. But the other answering
          rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the
          same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward
          of our deeds: but this Man hath done nothing amiss."
        </p>
        <p>
          What do you suppose made so great a change in this man in these few
          hours? Christ had not preached a sermon, had given him no exhortation.
          The darkness had not yet come on. The earth had not opened her mouth.
          The business of death was going on undisturbed. The crowd was still
          there, mocking and hissing and wagging the head. Yet this man, who in
          the morning was railing at Christ, is now confessing his sins and
          rebuking the other thief. "We indeed justly!" No miracle had been
          wrought before his eyes. No angel from heaven had come to place a
          glittering crown upon His head in place of the bloody crown of thorns.
        </p>
        <p>What was it wrought such a change in him?</p>
        <p>
          I will tell you what I think it was. I think it was the Savior's
          prayer:
        </p>
        <p>"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>
        <p>I seem to hear the thief</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>TALKING TO HIMSELF</p>
        <p>in this way:</p>
        <p>
          "What a strange kind of man this must be! He claims to be king of the
          Jews, and the superscription over His cross says the same. But what
          sort of a throne is this! He says He is the Son of God. Why does not
          God send down His angels and destroy all these people who are
          torturing His Son to death? If He has all power now, as He used to
          have when He worked those miracles they talked about, why does He not
          bring out His vengeance, and sweep all these wretches into
          destruction? I would do it in a minute if I had the power. I wouldn't
          spare any of them. I would open the earth and swallow them up! But
          this man prays to God to forgive them! Strange, strange! He
          <i>must</i> be different from us. I am sorry I said one word against
          Him when they first hung us up here.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a difference there is between Him and me! Here we are, hanging on
          two crosses, side by side; but all the rest of our lives we have been
          far enough apart. I have been robbing and murdering, and He has been
          feeding the hungry, healing the sick, and raising the dead. Now these
          people are railing at us both! I begin to believe He must be the Son
          of God; for surely no man could forgive his enemies like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, that prayer of Christ's did what the scourge could not do. This
          man had gone through his trial, he had been beaten, he had been nailed
          to the cross; but his heart had not been subdued, he had raised no cry
          to God, he was not sorry for his sins. Yet, when he heard the Savior
          praying for His murderers, that
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>BROKE HIS HEART.</p>
        <p>
          It flashed into this thief's soul that Jesus was the Son of God, and
          that moment he rebuked his companion, saying:
        </p>
        <p>"Dost thou not fear God?"</p>
        <p>
          The fear of God fell upon him. There is not much hope of a man's being
          saved until the fear of God comes upon him. Solomon says, "The fear of
          God is the beginning of wisdom."
        </p>
        <p>
          We read in Acts that great fear fell upon the people; that was the
          fear of the Lord. That was the first sign that conviction had entered
          the soul of the thief. "Dost thou not fear God?" That was the first
          sign we have of life springing up.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>CONFESSING.</p>
        <p>
          Next, he confessed his sins: "We indeed justly." He took his place
          among sinners, not trying to justify himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man may be very sorry for his sins, but if he doesn't confess them,
          he has no promise of being forgiven. Cain felt badly enough over his
          sins, but he did not confess. Saul was greatly tormented in mind, but
          he went to the witch of Endor instead of to the Lord. Judas felt so
          bad over the betrayal of his Master that he went out and hanged
          himself; but he did not confess to God. True, he went and confessed to
          the priests, saying, "I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent
          blood"; but it was of no use to confess to them -- they could not
          forgive him.
        </p>
        <p>
          How different is the case of this penitent thief! He confessed his
          sins, and Christ had mercy on him there and then.
        </p>
        <p>
          The great trouble is, people are always trying to make out that they
          are not sinners, that they have nothing to confess. Therefore, there
          is no chance of reaching them with the Gospel. There is no hope for a
          man who folds his arms and says: "I don't think God will punish sin; I
          am going to take the risk." There is no hope for a man until he sees
          that he is under just condemnation for his sins and shortcomings. God
          never forgives a sinner until he confesses.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>JUSTIFYING CHRIST.</p>
        <p>
          The next thing, he justifies Christ: "This Man hath done nothing
          amiss."
        </p>
        <p>
          When men are talking against Christ, they are a great way from
          becoming Christians. Now he says, "He hath done nothing amiss." There
          was the world mocking him; but in the midst of it all, you can hear
          that thief crying out:
        </p>
        <p>"This Man hath done nothing amiss."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>FAITH.</p>
        <p>The next step is faith.</p>
        <p>
          Talk about faith! I think this is about the most extraordinary case of
          faith in the Bible. Abraham was the father of the faithful; but God
          had him in training for twenty-five years. Moses was a man of faith;
          but he saw the burning bush, and had other evidences of God. Elijah
          had faith; but see what good reason he had for it. God took care of
          him, and fed him in time of famine. But here was a man who perhaps had
          never seen a miracle; who had spent his life among criminals; whose
          friends were thieves and outlaws; who was now in his dying agonies in
          the presence of a crowd who were rejecting and reviling the Son of
          God. His disciples, who had heard His wonderful words, and witnessed
          His mighty works, had forsaken Him; and perhaps the thief knew this.
          Peter had denied Him with oaths and cursing; and perhaps this had been
          told the thief. Judas had betrayed Him. He saw no glittering crown
          upon His brow; only the crown of thorns. He could see no sign of His
          kingdom. Where were His subjects? And yet, nailed to the cross, racked
          with pain in every nerve, overwhelmed with horror, his wicked soul in
          a tempest of passion, this poor wretch managed to lay hold on Christ
          and trust Him for a swift salvation. The faith of this thief, how it
          flashes out amid the darkness of Calvary! It is one of the most
          astounding instances of faith in the Bible!
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was a boy I was a poor speller. One day there came a word to
          the boy at the head of the class which he couldn't spell, and none of
          the class could spell it. I spelled it; by good luck; and I went from
          the foot of the class to the head. So the thief on the cross passed by
          Abraham, Moses and Elijah, and went to the head of the class. He said
          unto Jesus:
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, remember me when thou comest into Thy kingdom."</p>
        <p>
          Thank God for such a faith! How refreshing it must have been to Christ
          to have one own Him as Lord, and believe in His kingdom, at that dark
          hour! How this thief's heart goes out to the Son of God! How glad he
          would be to fall on his knees at the foot of the cross, and pour out
          his prayer! But this he cannot do. His hands and feet are nailed fast
          to the wood, but they have not nailed his eyes and his tongue and his
          heart. He can at least turn his head and look upon the Son of God, and
          his breaking heart can go out in love to that One who was dying for
          him and dying for you and me, and he can say:
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom."</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>WHAT A CONFESSION</p>
        <p>
          of Christ that was! He called Him "Lord." A queer Lord! Nails through
          His hands and feet, fastened to the cross. A strange throne! Blood
          trickling down His face from the scars made by the crown of thorns.
          But He was all the more "Lord" because of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinner, call Him "Lord" now. Take your place as a poor condemned
          rebel, and cry out:
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, remember me!"</p>
        <p>
          That isn't a very long prayer, but it will prevail. You don't have to
          add -- "when Thou comest into Thy kingdom," because Christ is now at
          His Father's right hand. Three words; a chain of three golden links
          that will bind the sinner to his Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people think they must have a form of prayer, a prayer-book,
          perhaps, if they are going to address the Throne of Grace properly;
          but what could that poor fellow do with a prayer-book up there,
          hanging on the cross, with both hands nailed fast? Suppose it had been
          necessary for some priest or minister to pray for him, what could he
          do? Nobody is there to pray for him, and yet he is going to die in a
          few hours. He is out of reach of help from man, but God has laid help
          upon One who is mighty, and that One is close at hand. He prayed out
          of the heart. His prayer was short, but it brought the blessing. It
          came to the point: "Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy
          kingdom." He asked the Lord to give him, right there and then, what he
          wanted.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE ANSWERED PRAYER.</p>
        <p>
          Now consider the answer to his prayer. He got more than he asked, just
          as every one does who asks in faith. He only asked Christ to
          "remember" him; but Christ answered:
        </p>
        <p>"To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise!"</p>
        <p>
          Immediate blessing -- promise of fellowship -- eternal rest; this is
          the way Christ answered his prayer.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>DARKNESS.</p>
        <p>
          And now darkness falls upon the earth. The sun hides itself. Worse
          than all, the Father hides His face from His Son. What else is the
          meaning of that bitter cry:
        </p>
        <p>"My God! my God! Why hast Thou forsaken me?"</p>
        <p>
          Ah! It had been written, "Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree."
          Jesus was made a curse for us. God cannot look upon sin: and so when
          even His own Son was bearing our sins in His body, God could not look
          upon Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think this is what bore heaviest upon the Savior's heart in the
          garden when He prayed:
        </p>
        <p>"If it be possible, let this cup pass from me."</p>
        <p>
          He could bear the unfaithfulness of His friends, the spite of His
          enemies, the pain of His crucifixion, and the shadow of death; He
          could bear all these; but when it came to the hiding of His Father's
          face, that seemed almost too much for even the Son of God to bear. But
          even this He endured for our sins; and now the face of God is turned
          back to us, whose sins had turned it away, and looking upon Jesus, the
          sinless One, He sees us in Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the midst of all His agony, how sweet it must have been to Christ
          to hear that poor thief confessing Him!
        </p>
        <p>
          He likes to have men confess Him. Don't you remember His asking Peter,
          "Whom do men say that I am?" and when Peter answered, "Some people say
          you are Moses, some people say you are Elias, and some people say you
          are one of the old Prophets," He asked again, "But, Peter, whom do
          <i>you</i> say I am?" When Peter said, "Thou art the Son of God,"
          Jesus blessed him for that confession. And now this thief confesses
          Him -- confesses Him in the darkness. Perhaps it is so dark he cannot
          see Him any longer; but he feels that He is there beside him. Christ
          wants us to confess Him in the dark as well as in the light; when it
          is hard as well as when it is easy. For He was not ashamed of us, but
          bore our sins and carried our sorrows, even unto death.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a prominent man dies, we are anxious, to get his last words and
          acts.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE LAST ACT OF THE SON OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          was to save a sinner. That was a part of the glory of His death. He
          commenced His ministry by saving sinners, and ended it by saving this
          poor thief. "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
          captive delivered? But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the
          mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
          delivered." He took this captive from the jaws of death. He was on the
          borders of hell, and Christ snatched him away.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt Satan was saying to himself: "I shall have the soul of that
          thief pretty soon. He belongs to me. He has been mine all these
          years."
        </p>
        <p>
          But in his last hours the poor wretch cried out to the Lord, and He
          snapped the fetters that bound his soul, and set him at liberty. He
          threw him a passport into heaven. I can imagine, as the soldier drove
          his spear into our Savior's side, there came flashing into the mind of
          the thief the words of the prophet Zechariah:
        </p>
        <p>
          "In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David,
          and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness."
        </p>
        <p>You see, in the conversion of this thief, that</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>SALVATION IS DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FROM WORKS.</p>
        <p>
          Some people tell us we have to work to be saved. What has the man who
          believes that to say about the salvation of this thief? How could he
          work, when he was nailed to the cross?
        </p>
        <p>
          He took the Lord at His word, and believed. It is with the heart men
          believe, not with their hands or feet. All that is necessary for a man
          to be saved is to believe with his heart. This thief made a good
          confession. If he had been a Christian fifty years, he could not have
          done Christ more service there than he did. He confessed Him before
          the world; and for nineteen hundred years that confession has been
          told. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John all recorded it. They felt it so
          important that they thought we should have it.
        </p>
        <p>See how</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>SALVATION IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM ALL ORDINANCES</p>
        <p>-- not but that ordinances are right in their place.</p>
        <p>
          Many people think it is impossible for any one to get into the kingdom
          of God if he is not baptized into it. I know people who were greatly
          exercised because little children died unbaptized. I have seen them
          carry the children through the streets because the pastor could not
          come. I don't want you to think I am talking against ordinances.
          Baptism is right in its place; but when you put it in the place of
          salvation, you put a snare in the way. You cannot baptize men into the
          kingdom of God. The last conversion before Christ perished on the
          cross ought to forever settle that question. If you tell me a man
          cannot get into Paradise without being baptized, I answer, This thief
          was not baptized. If he had wanted to be baptized, I don't believe he
          could have found a man to baptize him.

          I have known people who had sick relatives, and because they could not
          get a minister to come to their house and administer the sacrament,
          they were distressed and troubled. Now, I am not saying anything
          against the ordinance by which we commemorate the death of our Lord,
          and remember His return. God forbid! But let me say that it is not
          necessary for salvation. I might die and be lost before I could get to
          the Lord's table; but if I get to the Lord I am saved. Thank God,
          salvation is within my reach always, and I have to wait for no
          minister. This poor thief certainly never partook of the sacrament.
          Was there a man on that hill that would have had faith to believe he
          was saved? Would any church to-day have received him into membership?
          He had not to wait for this. The moment he asked life, our Savior gave
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baptism is one thing; the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is another
          thing; and salvation through Christ is quite another thing. If we have
          been saved through Christ, let us confess Him by baptism, let us go to
          His table, and do whatever else He bids. But let us not make
          stumbling-blocks out of these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is what I call sudden conversion -- men calling on God for
          salvation and getting it. You certainly won't get it unless you call
          for it, and unless you take it when He offers it to you. If you want
          Christ to remember you -- to save you -- call upon Him.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>TWO SIDES.</p>
        <p>
          The cross of Christ divides all mankind. There are only two sides,
          those for Christ, and those against Him. Think of the two thieves;
          from the side of Christ one went down to death cursing God, and the
          other went to glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a contrast! In the morning he is led out, a condemned criminal;
          in the evening he is saved from his sins. In the morning he is
          cursing; in the evening he is singing hallelujahs with a choir of
          angels. In the morning he is condemned by men as not fit to live on
          earth; in the evening he is reckoned good enough for heaven. In the
          morning nailed to the cross; in the evening in the Paradise of God,
          crowned with a crown he should wear through all the ages. In the
          morning not an eye to pity; in the evening washed and made clean in
          the blood of the Lamb. In the morning in the society of thieves and
          outcasts; in the evening Christ is not ashamed to walk arm-in-arm with
          him down the golden pavements of the eternal city.
        </p>
        <p>The thief was</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>THE FIRST MAN TO ENTER PARADISE</p>
        <p>
          after the veil of the Temple was rent. If we could look up yonder, and
          catch a glimpse of the throne, we would see the Father there, and
          Jesus Christ at His right hand; and hard by we would see that thief.
          He is there to-day. Nineteen hundred years he has been there, just
          because he cried in faith:
        </p>
        <p>"Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom."</p>
        <p>
          You know Christ died a little while before the thief. I can imagine
          that He wanted to hurry home to get a place ready for His new friend,
          the first soul brought from the world He was dying to redeem. The Lord
          loved him because he confessed Him in that dark hour. It was a dark
          hour for many who reviled the Savior. You have heard of the child who
          did not want to die and go to heaven because he didn't know anybody
          there. But the thief would have one acquaintance. I can imagine how
          his soul leaped within him when he saw the spear thrust into our
          Savior's side, and heard the cry:
        </p>
        <p>"It is finished!"</p>
        <p>
          He wanted to follow Christ. He was in a hurry to be gone, when they
          came to break his legs. I can hear the Lord calling:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gabriel, prepare a chariot. Make haste. There is a friend of mine
          hanging on that cross. They are breaking his legs. He will soon be
          ready to come. Make haste, and bring him to me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The angel in the chariot swept down from heaven, took the soul of that
          penitent thief, and hastened back to glory. The gates of the city
          swung wide open, and the angels shouted welcome to this poor sinner
          who had been washed white in the blood of the Lamb.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that, my friends, is just what Christ wants to do for you. That is
          the business on which He came down from heaven. That is why He died.
          And if He gave such a swift salvation to this poor thief on the cross,
          surely He will give you the same if, like the penitent thief, you
          repent, and confess, and trust in the Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somebody says that this man "was saved at the eleventh hour." I don't
          know about that. It might have been the first hour with him. Perhaps
          he never knew of Christ until he was led out to die beside Him. This
          may have been the very first time he ever had a chance to know the Son
          of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many of you gave your hearts to Christ the very first time He
          asked them of you? Are you not farther along in the day than even that
          poor thief?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some years ago, in one of the mining districts of England, a young man
          attended one of our meetings and refused to go from the place till he
          had found peace in the Savior. The next day he went down into the pit,
          and the coal fell in upon him. When they took him out he was broken
          and mangled, and had only two or three minutes of life left in him.
          His friends gathered about him, saw his lips moving, and, bending down
          to catch his words, heard him say:
        </p>
        <p>"It was a good thing I settled it last night."</p>
        <p>
          Settle it now, my friends, once for all. Begin now to confess your
          sins, and pray the Lord to remember you. He will make you an heir of
          His kingdom, if you will accept the gift of salvation. He is just the
          same Savior the thief had. Will you not cry to Him for mercy?
        </p>
        <p>. . . . . . . . . .</p>
        <p>
          A cross, -- and one who hangs thereon, in sight<br />Of heaven and
          earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cruel nails are fast<br />In trembling hands and feet, the face is
          white<br />And changed with agony, the failing head<br />Is drooping
          heavily; but still again,<br />And yet again, the weary eyes are
          raised<br />To seek the face of One who hangeth pale<br />Upon another
          cross. He hears no shrill<br />And taunting voices of the crowd
          beneath,<br />He marks no cruel looks of all that gaze<br />Upon the
          woeful sight. He sees alone<br />That face upon the cross. Oh, long,
          long look,<br />That searcheth there the deep and awful things<br />Which
          are of God!
        </p>
        <p>
          In his first agony<br />And horror he had joined with them that
          spake<br />Against the Lord, the Lamb, who gave Himself<br />That day
          for us. But when he met the look<br />Of those calm eyes, -- he paused
          that instant; pale<br />And trembling, stricken to the heart, and
          faint<br />At sight of Him.<br />. . . . . . . .
        </p>
        <p>
          At length<br />The pale, glad lips have breathed the trembling prayer,
          "<i>O Lord, remember me!</i>" The hosts of God<br />With wistful
          angel-faces, bending low<br />Above their dying King, were surely
          stirred<br />To wonder at the cry. Not one of all<br />The shining
          host had dared to speak to Him<br />In that dread hour of woe, when
          Heaven and Earth<br />Stood trembling and amazed. Yet, lo! the
          voice<br />Of one who speaks to Him, who dares to pray,<br />"<i
            >O Lord, remember me!</i
          >" A sinful man<br />May make his pitiful appeal to Christ,<br />The
          sinner's Friend, when angels dare not speak.<br />And sweetly from the
          dying lips that day<br />The answer came.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, strange and solemn joy<br />Which broke upon the fading face of
          him<br />Who there received the promise: "<i>Thou shalt be</i><br /><i
            >In Paradise this night, this night, with Me</i
          >."
        </p>
        <p>. . . . . . . .</p>
        <p>
          O Christ, the King!<br />We also wander on the desert-hills,<br />Though
          haunted by Thy call, returning sweet<br />At morn and eve. We will not
          come to Thee<br />Till Thou hast nailed us to some bitter cross,<br />And
          <i>made</i> us look on Thine, and driven at last<br />To call on Thee
          with trembling and with tears. -- <br />Thou lookest down in love,
          upbraiding not,<br />And promising the kingdom!
        </p>
        <p>. . . . . . . .</p>
        <p>
          A throne, -- and one<br />Who kneels before it, bending low in new<br />And
          speechless joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the night on earth.<br />The shadows fall like dew upon the
          hills<br />Around the Holy City, but above,<br />Beyond the dark vale
          of the sky, beyond<br />The smiling of the stars, they meet once
          more<br />In peace and glory. Heaven is comforted, -- <br />For that
          strange warfare is accomplished now,<br />Her King returned with joy:
          and one who watches<br />The far-off morning in a prison dim,<br />And
          hung at noonday on the bitter cross,<br />Is kneeling at His feet, and
          tasteth now<br />The sweet, sweet opening of an endless joy.
