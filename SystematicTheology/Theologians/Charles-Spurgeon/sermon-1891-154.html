          1. Now, that He who at the beginning created man, did promise him a
          second birth after his dissolution into earth, Esaias thus declares:
          "The dead shall rise again, and they who are in the tombs shall arise,
          and they who are in the earth shall rejoice. For the dew which is from
          Thee is health to them." And again: "I will comfort you, and ye shall
          be comforted in Jerusalem: and ye shall see, and your heart shall
          rejoice, and your bones shall flourish as the grass; and the hand of
          the Lord shall be known to those who worship Him." And Ezekiel speaks
          as follows: "And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and the Lord led
          me forth in the Spirit, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and
          this place was full of bones. And He caused me to pass by them round
          about: and, behold, there were many upon the surface of the plain very
          dry. And He said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
          said, Lord, Thou who hast made them dost know. And He said unto me,
          Prophesy upon these bones, and thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones,
          hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord to these bones, Behold,
          I will cause the spirit of life to come upon you, and I will lay
          sinews upon you, and bring up flesh again upon you, and I will stretch
          skin upon you, and will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and
          ye shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as the Lord had
          commanded me. And it came to pass, when I was prophesying, that,
          behold, an earthquake, and the bones were drawn together, each one to
          its own articulation: and I beheld, and, lo, the sinews and flesh were
          produced upon them, and the skins rose upon them round about, but
          there was no breath in them. And He said unto me, Prophesy to the
          breath, son of man, and say to the breath, These things saith the
          Lord, Come from the four winds (spiritibus), and breathe upon these
          dead, that they may live. So I prophesied as the Lord had commanded
          me, and the breath entered into them; and they did live, and stood
          upon their feet, an exceeding great gathering." And again he says,
          "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will set your graves open, and cause
          you to come out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel;
          and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall open your
          sepulchres, that I may bring my people again out of the sepulchres:
          and I will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live; and I will place
          you in your land, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. I have said,
          and I will do, saith the Lord." As we at once perceive that the
          Creator (Demiurgo) is in this passage represented as vivifying our
          dead bodies, and promising resurrection to them, and resuscitation
          from their sepulchres and tombs, conferring upon them immortality also
          (He says, "For as the tree of life, so shall their days be" ), He is
          shown to be the only God who accomplishes these things, and as Himself
          the good Father, benevolently conferring life upon those who have not
          life from themselves.

          2. And for this reason did the Lord most plainly manifest Himself and
          the Father to His disciples, lest, forsooth, they might seek after
          another God besides Him who formed man, and who gave him the breath of
          life; and that men might not rise to such a pitch of madness as to
          feign another Father above the Creator. And thus also He healed by a
          word all the others who were in a weakly condition because of sin; to
          whom also He said, "Behold, thou art made whole, sin no more, lest a
          worse thing come upon thee:" pointing out by this, that, because of
          the sin of disobedience, infirmities have come upon men. To that man,
          however, who had been blind from his birth, He gave sight, not by
          means of a word, but by an outward action; doing this not without a
          purpose, or because it so happened, but that He might show forth the
          hand of God, that which at the beginning had moulded man. And
          therefore, when His disciples asked Him for what cause the man had
          been born blind, whether for his own or his parents' fault, He
          replied, "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the
          works of God should be made manifest in him." Now the work of God is
          the fashioning of man. For, as the Scripture says, He made [man] by a
          kind of process: "And the Lord took clay from the earth, and formed
          man." Wherefore also the Lord spat on the ground and made clay, and
          smeared it upon the eyes, pointing out the original fashioning [of
          man], how it was effected, and manifesting the hand of God to those
          who can understand by what [hand] man was formed out of the dust. For
          that which the artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb,
          [viz., the blind man's eyes], He then supplied in public, that the
          works of God might be manifested in him, in order that we might not be
          seeking out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another
          Father; knowing that this hand of God which formed us at the
          beginning, and which does form us in the womb, has in the last times
          sought us out who were lost, winning back His own, and taking up the
          lost sheep upon His shoulders, and with joy restoring it to the fold
          of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now, that the Word of God forms us in the womb, He says to
          Jeremiah, "Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; and before
          thou wentest forth from the belly, I sanctified thee, and appointed
          thee a prophet among the nations." And Paul, too, says in like manner,
          "But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, that
          I might declare Him among the nations." As, therefore, we are by the
          Word formed in the womb, this very same Word formed the visual power
          in him who had been blind from his birth; showing openly who it is
          that fashions us in secret, since the Word Himself had been made
          manifest to men: and declaring the original formation of Adam, and the
          manner in which he was created, and by what hand he was fashioned,
          indicating the whole from a part. For the Lord who formed the visual
          powers is He who made the whole man, carrying out the will of the
          Father. And inasmuch as man, with respect to that formation which, was
          after Adam, having fallen into transgression, needed the laver of
          regeneration, [the Lord] said to him [upon whom He had conferred
          sight], after He had smeared his eyes with the clay, "Go to Siloam,
          and wash;" thus restoring to him both [his perfect] confirmation, and
          that regeneration which takes place by means of the laver. And for
          this reason when he was washed he came seeing, that he might both know
          Him who had fashioned him, and that man might learn [to know] Him who
          has conferred upon him life.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. All the followers of Valentinus, therefore, lose their case, when
          they say that man was not fashioned out of this earth, but from a
          fluid and diffused substance. For, from the earth out of which the
          Lord formed eyes for that man, from the same earth it is evident that
          man was also fashioned at the beginning. For it were incompatible that
          the eyes should indeed be formed from one source and the rest of the
          body from another; as neither would it be compatible that one [being]
          fashioned the body, and another the eyes. But He, the very same who
          formed Adam at the beginning, with whom also the Father spake,
          [saying], "Let Us make man after Our image and likeness," revealing
          Himself in these last times to men, formed visual organs (visionem)
          for him who had been blind [in that body which he had derived] from
          Adam. Wherefore also the Scripture, pointing out what should come to
          pass, says, that when Adam had hid himself because of his
          disobedience, the Lord came to him at eventide, called him forth, and
          said, "Where art thou?" That means that in the last times the very
          same Word of God came to call man, reminding him of his doings, living
          in which he had been hidden from the Lord. For just as at that time
          God spake to Adam at eventide, searching him out; so in the last
          times, by means of the same voice, searching out his posterity, He has
          visited them.<br />
