        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.125)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Evening, March 22, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, What is
          the vine-tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the
          trees of the forest?| -- Ezekiel 15:1-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          THE JEWISH nation had arrogant ideas of themselves; when they sinned
          against God, they supposed that on account of the superior sanctity of
          their forefathers, or by reason of some special sanctity in
          themselves, they would be delivered, sin as they pleased. In
          consequence of the infinite mercy of Jehovah, which he had displayed
          toward them, in delivering them our of so many distresses, they
          gradually came to imagine that they were the favorite children of
          Providence, and that God could by no means ever cast them away. God,
          therefore, in order to humble their pride, tells them that they in
          themselves were nothing more than any other nation; and he asks them
          what there was about them to recommend them? |I have often called you
          a vine; I have planted you, and nurtured you in a very fruitful hill,
          but now you bring forth no fruit; what is there in you why I should
          continue you in my favor? If you imagine there is any thing about you
          more than about any other nation, you are mightily mistaken.| |What is
          the vine-tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the
          trees of the forest?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us remember that these things might be said without implying that
          God in the least degree alters his eternal purpose toward any chosen
          vessel of mercy; for the Israelitish nation was not chosen to eternal
          salvation, as a nation, but chosen to special privileges; a type and
          shadow of that eternal personal election which Christ has given to his
          church. From his own elect church God will never withdraw his love;
          but from the outward and visible church he sometimes may. From his own
          people he never will take away his affection, but from professors,
          from those who merely stand in his people's external condition, and
          are not his children, he may, yea and he will, withdraw every token of
          his favor. God humbles Israel, by reminding them that they had nothing
          which other nations had not; that, in fact, they were a contemptible
          nation, not worthy to be set side by side with the cedar of Babylon,
          or with the oak of Samaria; they were of no use, they were worthless,
          unless they brought forth fruit to him. He checks their pride and
          humbles them, with the parable we have here before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, we shall, by God's help, use this parable for ourselves, and
          learn two lessons from it. The first shall be a lesson of humility for
          saints; and the second, a lesson of searching for all who are
          professors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, here is A LESSON OF HUMILITY for all you who have |tasted
          that the Lord is gracious.| |What is the vine-tree more than any tree,
          or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?|
        </p>
        <p>
          In looking upon all the various trees, we observe that the vine is
          distinguished among them; so that, in the old parable of Jotham, the
          trees waited upon the vine-tree, and said unto it, |Come thou and
          reign over us.| But merely looking at the vine, without regard to its
          fruitfulness, we should not see any kingship in it over other trees.
          In size, form, beauty, or utility, it has not the slightest advantage.
          We can do nothing with the wood of the vine. Shall wood be taken
          thereof to do any work? or will men make a pin of it to hang any
          vessel thereon?| It is a useless plant apart from its fruitfulness. We
          sometimes see it in beauty, trained up by the side of our walls, and
          in the East it might be seen in all its luxuriance, and great care is
          bestowed in its training; but leave the vine to itself, and consider
          it apart from its fruitfulness, it is the most insignificant and
          despicable of all things that bear the name of trees. Now, beloved,
          this is for the humbling of God's people. They are called God's vine;
          but what are they by nature more than others? Others are as good as
          they; yea, some others are even greater and better than they. They, by
          God's goodness, have become fruitful, have been planted in a good
          soil; the Lord hath trained them upon the walls of the sanctuary, and
          they bring forth fruit to his glory. But what are they without their
          God? What are they without the continual influence of the Spirit,
          begetting fruitfulness in them? Are they not the least among the sons
          of men, and the most to be despised of those that have been brought
          forth of women? Look upon this, believer.
        </p>
        <p>|What was there in thee to merit esteem,</p>
        <p>Or give the Creator delight?|</p>
        <p>
          Yea, look upon thyself as thou art now. Doth not thy conscience
          reproach thee? Do not thy thousand wanderings stand before thee, and
          tell thee that thou art unworthy to be called his son? Does not the
          weakness of thy mental power, the frailty of thy moral power, thy
          continual unbelief, and thy perpetual backsliding from God, tell thee
          that thou art less than the least of all saints? And if he hath made
          thee any thing, art thou not thereby taught that it is grace, free,
          sovereign grace, which hath made thee to differ? Should any here,
          supposing themselves to be the children of God, imagine that there is
          some reason in them why they should have been chosen, let them know,
          that as yet they are in the dark concerning the first principles of
          grace, and have not yet learned the gospel. If ever they had known the
          gospel, they would, on the other hand, confess that they were less
          than the least -- the offscouring of all things -- unworthy,
          ill-deserving, undeserving, and hell-deserving, and ascribe it all to
          distinguishing grace, which has made them to differ; and to
          discriminating love, which has chosen them out from the rest of the
          world. Great Christian, thou wouldst have been a great sinner if God
          had not made thee to differ. O! thou who art valiant for truth, thou
          wouldst have been as valiant for the devil if grace had not laid hold
          of thee. A seat in heaven shall one day be thine; but a chain in hell
          would have been thine if grace had not changed thee. Thou canst now
          sing his love; but a licentious song might have been on thy lips, if
          grace had not washed thee in the blood of Jesus. Thou art now
          sanctified, thou art quickened, thou art justified; but what wouldst
          thou have been to-day if it had not been for the interposition of the
          divine hand? There is not a crime thou mightest not have committed;
          there is not a folly into which thou mightest not have run. Even
          murder itself thou mightest have committed if grace had not kept thee.
          Thou shalt be like the angels; but thou wouldst have been like the
          devil if thou hadst not been changed by grace. Therefore, never be
          proud; all thy garments thou hast from above; rags were thine only
          heritage. Be not proud, though thou hast a large estate, a wide domain
          of grace; thou hadst once not a single thing to call thine own, except
          thy sin and misery. Thou art now wrapped up in the golden
          righteousness of the Saviour, and accepted in the garments of the
          beloved; but thou wouldst have been buried under the black mountain of
          sin, and clothed with the filthy rags of unrighteousness, if he had
          not changed thee. And art thou proud? Dost thou exalt thyself? O!
          strange mystery, that thou, who hast borrowed every thing, should
          exalt thyself; that thou, who hast nothing of thine own, but hast
          still to draw upon grace, shouldst be proud; a poor dependent
          pensioner upon the bounty of thy Saviour, and yet proud; one who hath
          a life which can only live by fresh streams of life from Jesus, and
          yet proud! Go, hang thy pride upon the gallows, as high as Haman; hang
          it there to rot, and stand thou beneath, and execrate it to all
          eternity; for sure of all things most to be cursed and despised is the
          pride of a Christian. He, of all men, has ten thousand times more
          reason than any other to be humble, and walk lowly with his God, and
          kindly and humbly toward his fellow-creatures. Let this, then, humble
          thee, Christian, that the vine-tree is nothing more than any other
          tree, save only for the fruitfulness which God has given it.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now here comes A LESSON OF SEARCH. As the vine without its
          fruit is useless and worthless; so, too, the professor, without fruit,
          is useless and worthless; yea, he is the most useless thing in the
          wide world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us dwell upon this point. A fruitless profession. And while I
          am preaching on it, let the words go round to each one, and let the
          minister, and let his deacons, and let his hearers all try their
          hearts and search their reins, and see whether they have a fruitless
          profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, a fruitless professor. How do we know him? what is his
          character? Secondly, What is the reason he is fruitless? Thirdly, What
          is the estimation God holds him in? He is good for nothing at all.
          And, then, fourthly, What will be his end? He is to be burned with
          fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Where are we to find fruitless professors? Everywhere, dear
          friends, everywhere -- down here, up there, everywhere; in pulpits and
          in pews. False professors are to be found in every church. Let us
          leave other denominations alone, then. They are to be found in this
          church; they are to be found in this present assembly. to whatever
          denomination you belong, there are some false and fruitless professors
          in it. How know you that you may not belong to those who bring forth
          no fruit? There are fruitless professors to be found in every position
          of the church, and in every part of society. You may find the false
          professor among the rich; he hath much wealth, and he is hailed with
          gladness by the church. God hath given him much of this world's good;
          and therefore, the church, forgetful that God hath chosen the poor,
          giveth him honor, and what doth she get from him? She getteth but
          little to help her. Her poor are still neglected, and her means not in
          the least recruited by his riches. Or if she gain a portion of his
          riches, yet she getteth none of his prayers; nor is she in the least
          supported by his holy living, for he that hath riches often liveth in
          sin, and rolleth in uncleanness; and, then, weareth his profession as
          a uniform, wherewith to cover his guilt. Rich men have sometimes been
          false professors; and thy are to be found among poor men too. Full
          many a poor man has entered into the church, and been cordially
          received. He has been poor, and they have thought it a good thing that
          poverty and grace should go together -- that grace should cheer his
          hovel, and make his poverty-stricken home a glad one. But then, this
          poor man hath turned aside to follies, and hath degraded himself with
          drunkenness, hath sworn, and by unworthy conduct dishonored his God;
          or, if not, he hath been idle, and sat still, and been of little
          service to the church; and so he hath been false and fruitless in his
          profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          False professors are to be found in the men that lead the vanguard of
          God's army; the men who preach eloquently, whose opinion is law, who
          speak like prophets, and whose language seems to be inspired. They
          have brought forth the fruit of popularity, ay, and the fruit of
          philanthropy too, but their heart has not been right with God,
          therefore, the fruit, good in itself, was not fruit unto holiness; the
          moral benefit of their labors does not extend to everlasting life.
          They have not brought forth the fruits of the Spirit, seeing that they
          were not living branches of the living vine. Then there have been
          false professors in obscurity; modest people, who have said nothing,
          and seldom been heard of; they have glided into their pews on the
          Sunday morning, taken their seats, gone out, and satisfied themselves
          that by their presence they had fulfilled a religious duty. They have
          been so silent, quiet, and retired. Lazy fellows, doing nothing. You
          may think that all the fruitless trees grow in the hedge outside of
          the garden. No they don't. There are some fruitless trees in the
          inside of it in the very center of it. There are some fruitless trees
          in the inside of it in the very center of it. There are some false
          professors to be found in obscurity as well as in publicity; some
          among the poor as well as among the rich.
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are false professors to be found among men that doubt a
          great deal. They are always afraid they do not love Jesus, and always
          saying, |Ah, if I did but know I were his! --
        </p>
        <p>|Tis a point I long to know,</p>
        <p>Oft it causes anxious thought.|</p>
        <p>
          Yes, and it ought to cause them anxious thought, too, if they are
          bringing forth no fruit and giving no |diligence to make their calling
          and election sure.| Fruitless professors are to be found, on the other
          hand, among the confident men, who say, without a blush, |I know whom
          I have believed; I know I am a Christian, let who will doubt. I am
          sure and certain my sins can not destroy me, and my righteousness can
          not save me. I may do what I like; I know I am one of the Lord's.| Ah!
          fruitless professor again; just as fruitless as the other man, who had
          all doubts and no faith, and did nothing for his Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there is the fruitless professor, who, when he is asked to
          pray at the prayer meeting, never does so; and who neglects family
          prayer. We will not say any thing about private devotion; no doubt he
          neglects that too: he is a fruitless one. Ah! but there may be
          another, who stands up and prays such an eloquent prayer for a quarter
          of an hour, perhaps, just as fruitless a professor as the silent one;
          with plenty of words, but no realities; many leaves, but no fruits;
          great gifts of utterance, but no gifts of consistency; able to talk
          well, but not to walk well; to speak piously, but not to walk humbly
          with his God, and serve him with gladness. I do not know your
          individual characters; but I know enough of you to say that your
          position, however honorable in the church, and your character, however
          fair before men, is not enough to warrant any of you in concluding at
          once that you are not a fruitless professor. For fruitless professors
          are of every character and every rank, from the highest to the lowest,
          from the most talented to the most illiterate, from the richest to the
          poorest, from the most retiring to the most conspicuous. Fruitless
          professors there are in every part of the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, shall I tell you who is a fruitless professor? The man who
          neglects private prayer, and does not walk with his God in public;
          that man whose carriage and conversation before God are hypocritical;
          who cheats in trade and robs in business, yet wraps it up, and comes
          out with a fair face, like the hypocrite with a widow's house sticking
          in his throat, and says, |Lord, I thank thee I am not as other men
          are!| There is a man for you, who brings forth no fruit to perfection.
          Another one is he who lives right morally and excellently, and depends
          upon his works, and hopes to be saved by his righteousness; who comes
          before God, and asks for pardon, with a lie in his right hand, for he
          has brought his own self-righteousness with him. Such a man is a
          fruitless professor; he has brought forth no fruit. That man, again,
          is a fruitless professor who talks big words about high doctrine, and
          likes sound truth, but he does not like sound living; his pretensions
          are high, but not his practice. He can bear to hear it said,
        </p>
        <p>|Once in Christ, in Christ for ever.,|</p>
        <p>
          But as for himself, he never was in Christ at all, for he neither
          loves nor serves his Master, but lives in sin that grace may abound.
          There is another fruitless vine for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why need I stop to pick you out? May the Lord find you out
          to-night! There are many of you here, concerning whom the curse of
          Meroz might be uttered. |Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord,
          curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to
          the help of the Lord; to the help of the Lord against the mighty.|
          Many of you are content to eat the fat and drink the sweet, and bring
          forth no fruit to God; nor do you serve him -- lazy Issachars,
          crouching down like a strong ass between two burdens; neither speaking
          for Christ; nor praying for Christ, nor giving to Christ, nor living
          to Christ; but having a name to live, while you are dead; wrapping
          yourselves up in a profession, while you are not living to Christ, nor
          consecrating your being to him. Judge ye what I say; if ye were put
          into the sieve this night, how many of you would come out clean in
          this matter? Are there not many high-flying professors here, who fly
          high, but who do nothing; who can talk fast, but live as slowly as you
          like; who, perhaps, delight in hearing the truth, but who never
          practice the truth in serving their God, nor living to his honor? Such
          as you, sirs, are the most useless and worthless of all creatures in
          the world! For, like the vine, you would be honorable if you were
          fruitful; but without fruit, as the vine is despicable, so are you
          good for nothing but to be cast out and burned.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. And now I come to the second question -- Why is it that these men
          are fruitless, and must be cast away? The reason is, because they have
          no roots. Many, many professors have no roots; fine professors they
          are, beautiful to look at, but they have no roots whatever. Don't you
          remember your childish freak, when you had a little garden of your
          own; when you plucked some flowers, and put them in the ground, and
          said that was your garden; and when you went the next day, and found
          that all the flowers were withered and dead? Such are many professors
          -- pretty flowers, plucked off without roots; having no adherence to
          the soil, drawing no sap and no nourishment from it. And therefore it
          is they die, and bring forth no fruit. You come to us; and say, |I
          wish to join the church.| We question you as far as we are able; you
          solemnly tell us that your hearts are right with God. We baptize you,
          receive you into our number; but then there was no root in many of
          you, and after a while you die; when the sun has risen with a burning
          heat you perish; or if you maintain a tolerably fair profession, yet
          there is never any fruit upon you, because you did not get the root
          first; you got this notion first, and then thought you would get the
          root afterward. I do tremble for many young people in my church -- I
          will not exclude my own church. They get an idea into their heads that
          they are converted: the work was not true, not genuine, not real; it
          was an excitement; it was a stir in the conscience for a while, and it
          will not last. But the worst of it is, that though it does not last,
          they last as professors. When they have been received into the church,
          they say, |I am sure enough!| Preach about them as long as you please,
          you can not get at them. They are church members, they are baptized
          persons, they have passed the Rubicon; what do they want more? You can
          do little for them. I do tremble for these. For my most hard-hearted
          hearers I weep before God; but for these people I need to have four
          eyes to weep with. For who can make an impression upon them, when they
          are firmly persuaded that they are right, and have had the seal of the
          church that they are right, though they are deceiving themselves and
          others, and are still |in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of
          iniquity.| My young friends, I do not want to check any of you in
          joining a church; but I do say to you, make sure work before you make
          a profession. I would say to as many of you as love the Lord, come
          forward and unite with God's people; but, I beseech you, do be sure;
          do |search you hearts and try your reins.| Many have thought
          themselves converted when they were not; hundreds of thousands have
          had an impression, a kind of conversion, not real, which for a while
          endured, but afterward it passed away as summer's dream. It was but a
          little while ago that I had in my house a gentleman, an excellent man,
          and I believe a true child of God, who told me he had been brought
          seriously under impression, on account of sin, through hearing a
          sermon of late. |But,| said he, |I was baptized in my childhood. When
          I was but young, there was a revival in our village, in New England.
          Mine was the hardest heart in the village; but I was found out at
          last. There was scarcely a girl or boy that did not join the church,
          and I was at last brought under deep impression. I used to weep before
          God, and pray to him. I went to the minister and told him I was
          converted, deceived him, and was baptized.| And then he went on to
          tell me that he had dived into the blackest crimes, and gone far away,
          even from the profession of religion; that after going to college he
          had been struck off the church-roll on account of wickedness, and that
          up to this time he had been an infidel, and had not so much as thought
          of the things of the kingdom. Take heed, many of you, that you do not
          get a sham religion. Many jump out of it again, when they find the
          world pays them better. And many there are who will just come and say
          they are the Lord's, and they think they are, but there is no root in
          them, and therefore by-and-by their impressions pass away. O we have
          many fruitless professors in our midst, because they do not look well
          to their beginnings; they did not take heed at their starting point,
          they did not watch well the first dawn; they thought the little
          farthing rushlight of their own hopes was the dawning of the Sun of
          righteousness; they thought the bleeding of their own conscience was a
          killing by the hand of God, whereas it was a deeper, and better and
          surer, and more entire work that they needed, than that which they
          received. Let us take heed, my brethren, that we do not put too much
          trust in our experiences, and take too much for granted while it is
          not yet proved in our beginnings; let us often go back and begin
          again; let us often go to Christ with the old cry,
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling;|</p>
        <p>
          For remember that these bad beginnings have had a great effect in
          making a man fruitless.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And again, thirdly -- What is God's estimation of fruitless
          professors? I shall not ask you their own; for there are many men who
          are professors of religion, with whom you might make your fortune very
          speedily if you could buy them at your price and sell them at their
          own. There are many, too, that have a very good opinion of themselves,
          which they have gained from the church. The minister thinks well of
          them; the church thinks well of them; they are respectable people; it
          is so nice to have them come, it helps the cause so, to see such
          respectable people sitting in the pews! Really, I do think he would do
          for a deacon! Everybody thinks well of him. Now we have nothing to do
          with this kind of opinion to-night; our business is with God's opinion
          of such a man. And God's opinion of a man who makes a profession
          without being sincere, is this -- that he is the most useless thing in
          the world. And now let me try to prove it. Is there any one that will
          prove that this man is of any use at all? I will ask the church --
          Here is a man that brings forth no fruit, and has only a profession.
          Members of the church, what is the use of this man? Will he comfort
          any of you in your distress? Will he hold up the pastor's hands in
          prayer, when he is weary? Will he lead the troops to battle? Will he
          be of any service to you? I see you unanimously lift up your hands,
          and say, |The man is of no use to us whatever, if he brings forth no
          fruit; if his life be not consistent with his profession; strike his
          name off the church-roll; let him go; he is of no use.| Where has he
          gone to? He has gone to the world. Bring the worldling up. What do you
          think of this man? He makes a profession of religion. Is he of any use
          to you? |No,| they say, |we do not want such a fellow as that. The man
          is Jack-of-both-sides; he is sometimes a professor of religion, and
          sometimes a sinner in the world. We will have nothing to do with him;
          turn him out of our company.| Where shall we sell him then? How shall
          we dispose of him? He seems to be of no use either to the church or
          the world. Is he of any use to his family? Ask his eldest son. |John,
          is your father any good to you?| |No, sir; none at all. He used to
          pray the Lord to save us with seeming earnestness, and rise from his
          knees to give vent to his temper. Many a violent blow has he given me
          without any reasonable provocation. He was always a passionate man. He
          used to go to chapel on Sunday and take us with him and then we know
          what he used to do on Monday; he would get drunk, or swear. A deal of
          use he was ever to me! He made me an infidel, sir!| And his wife,
          |Well, what do you think of this good husband of yours? He has long
          made a profession of religion.| |Ah! sir, it is not for me to say a
          word about my husband; but he has made me a miserable woman. I think I
          should have joined your church long ago, if it had not been for his
          miserable inconsistencies. But really he has grieved my heart; he has
          always been a stumbling-block to me; and what to do with him I do not
          know.| Well, Jane, we will have you our of the kitchen. |What think
          you of your master; he makes a profession of religion, yet does not
          live a right life. What do you think of him?| |Well, I did think that
          Christians were a good sort of people, and that I should like to live
          with them; but if this be Christianity, sir, I will take five pounds a
          year less to live with a worldly man; that's all I can say.| Well,
          what is the use of him? I suppose he does something in business. He is
          a grand professor. He keeps a shop; everybody thinks him a most
          respectable man. Has he not given a hundred pounds just now to the
          building of a new church? Is he not always known to subscribe
          liberally to ragged schools? We will ask his men. |What do you think
          of your master?| |What do we think of him? Why, we would think a great
          deal more of him if he would give us a half-crown a week more wages;
          for he is the worst paymaster in the parish.| |That is nothing,
          perhaps. But what do you think of him?| |Why, that he is an
          unutterable cant! Some of us did go to a place of worship, but we are
          honest, and we would rather stay away than go with such a miserable
          hypocrite.| I am describing real cases and not fictions. I need not to
          go further than between this and London Bridge to knock at the door
          and wake them up, some of them. What is the good of such professors?
          If they would speak fairly out, and say, |I am no Christian,| there
          would be some sense in it. For if Baal be God, let Baal be served; and
          if the world be worth serving, let a man serve it out and out; and let
          him get the credit of candor -- not cheating the devil. But if God be
          God, and a man live in sin, and talk about grace, then of what use is
          he? God himself will disown him. Ask him if this man has been of any
          use, and he replies, |No, of no use whatever.| The vine is of no use
          unless it bring forth fruit; and this man, making a profession, is
          worse than worthless, because he does not live up to it. My dear
          friends, I would not say an extravagant thing, but I will say this
          very coolly -- if any of you, who make a profession of religion, are
          deceiving others, by not living up to it, I do request you -- and I
          say it advisedly -- I do request you to give up your profession,
          unless God give you grace to live up to it. Do not, I beseech you,
          halt between two opinions; if God be God, serve him, and do it
          thoroughly; do not tell lies about it. If Baal be God; if he be a nice
          master; if you would like to serve him, and win his wages, serve him;
          but do not mix the two together; be one thing, or else the other.
          Renounce your profession, and serve the devil thoroughly, or else keep
          your profession, and serve God with your heart -- one thing, or else
          the other. I solemnly exhort you to choose which you will have, but
          never think that you can keep both; for |no man can serve two
          masters.| |Ye can not serve God and mammon.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. And now let me close up by mentioning what is to become of this
          fruitless tree? We are told it is to be devoured in the fire. When an
          old vine is pulled off the wall, after having brought forth no fruit,
          what becomes of it? You know there is a lot of weeds raked up in the
          corner of the garden, and the gardener, without taking any notice of
          it, just throws the vine on the heap of weeds, and it is burned up. If
          it were any other kind of a tree he would at least reserve it for
          chopping up to make a fire within the master's house; but this is much
          an ignominious thing, he throws it away in the corner and burns it up
          with the weeds. If it were a stout old oak, it might have the funeral
          of the yule log, with honor in its burning, and brightness in its
          flame; but the fruitless vine is treated with contempt, and left to
          smoulder with the weeds, the refuse, and rubbish. It is a miserable
          thing. Just so with professors; all men that love not God must perish.
          But those who profess to love him, and do not, shall perish with
          singular ignominy. |They shall not come into the sepulchres of the
          kings.| Something like the ancient king, of whom it was said, |He
          shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond
          the gates of Jerusalem.| The damnation of a professor will be the most
          horrible and ignominious sight that ever hell itself has seen! When
          Satan fell from heaven, with his black Satanic malice against God,
          there was a kind of grandeur in his devilry; there was an awful,
          terrific sublimity in his damnation; and when a great blasphemer and a
          hard swearer shall be sent at last to perdition, there shall be
          something of sublimity in it, because he has been consistent with his
          profession. But when a professor of religion finds himself in hell, it
          shall be the most miserable, contemptible, and yet terrible mode of
          damnation wherewith men were ever damned. I think I see honest
          blasphemers lifting themselves from their chains of fire, and hissing
          between their teeth at the minister who comes there, after having been
          a deceiver -- |Aha! aha! aha! art thou here with us? Thou didst warn
          us of our drunkenness, and tell us of our curse; ah! art thou come
          into the drunkard's hell thyself?| |Pshaw!| says another, |that is
          your strict Pharisee. Ah! I remember how he told me one night that I
          should perish, unless I made a profession of religion. Take that,
          sir!| and he spits upon him. |Thou art a loathsome thing. I perished;
          but I served my master well. Thou -- thou didst pretend to serve God,
          and yet thou art a sneaking hypocrite!| Says another, yelling from the
          corner of the pit, |Let us have a Methodist hymn, sir; quote a promise
          from the Bible; tell us about election. Let us have a little of your
          fine preaching now.| And round hell there goes the hiss, and the |aha!
          aha! aha!| and the yell of spitefulness and scorn upon the man who
          professed to be a Christian, but became a castaway, because his heart
          was not right in the matter. I confess, I should dread above all
          things the unutterable hell of hells of hypocritical apostates, of men
          that stand in the ranks, profess to love God, prate godliness, that
          sit in the pews and uphold Christianity, that take the sacrament, and
          speak about communion, that stand up to pray, and talk about being
          heard for their faith, who are all the while committing abominations,
          and under cover of their professions are cheating the poor, robbing
          the fatherless, and doing all kinds of iniquity. I confess, I as much
          dread the excess of their damnation, above the damnation of others, as
          I dread to be damned at all. It is as if in hell another hell had been
          made, to damn those that sin above others, to damn them after being
          damned -- for hypocrites, for men who have been with us, and not of
          us; who professed to be Christ's, and yet have been mean deceivers
          after all. O! sirs, if ye would not make your chains more heavy, if ye
          would not stir the fire to a more furious heat, if ye would not make
          your yells more hideous, quit your professions this night, if ye are
          not worthy of them. Go out of this place, and send in your resignation
          to the church; or else, sirs, be honest, and bend your knee before
          God, and ask him to search you, and try you, and make you sincere and
          upright before him. Be one thing, or else the other; do not cloak
          yourself in the robes of sanctity to hide the corruptions that all the
          while fester beneath. Stand out, bold, brave sinners; and do not be
          mean, sneaking sinners, that wear the masks of saints. |What is the
          vine more than any other tree?| Without fruit it is worse than any
          other. It must perish more dolefully, more horribly than any other, if
          there be on it no fruit brought to perfection. Does not this shake us?
          Ah! it will shake you, very likely, that do not want the shaking; but
          the men that want arousing will keep just as they were. It will go
          into the hearts of some of you, like the cry, |Howl, Moab, howl,
          Moab!| but alas! Moab will not howl. You will weep for Kirhareseth but
          Kirhareseth will not weep for herself. You will weep for your
          hypocritical friends; but they will rub their eyes, and say, |A strong
          sermon; but it has nothing to do with me.| And they will go out with
          cool presumption; sin with one hand, and take the sacramental cup with
          the other; sing the lascivious song one night, and then sing,
        </p>
        <p>|Jesus, lover of my soul,|</p>
        <p>
          the day after. Meet Christ here, and take the devil yonder, and bid
          him God speed in all his freaks of devilry. Ah! sirs, sirs, sirs, take
          heed, take heed, I beseech you, of this matter. Let us each search our
          hearts, lest we should have been deceived. And may God bring us to a
          right understanding in this matter, that we may be clear before him.
          |Search me, O God, and know my ways; try me, and know my thoughts, and
          see if there be any wicked thing in me; and lead me in the way
          everlasting.|
        </p>
        <p>
          And, now, I must not send you away until I have had a word with my
          friend in the aisle there. He says, |I like that, I like that; I am no
          professor, I am not; I am all right. No one can call me a hypocrite.|
          Well, my dear friend, I am very glad you are not, because you say you
          are no Christian. But let me tell you, you must not expect to be a
          wonderful deal the better off for that. Suppose two men are brought up
          before the Lord Mayor, and one says, |Your worship, I am an honest man
          and not guilty;| and he blushes that an imputation should be cast on
          his character. Well, he is proved to be guilty, and gets committed to
          prison for three months. Up comes the other one, and says, |Your
          worship, I am a guilty man; I always was a rogue, and I always shall
          be; I don't make a profession at all.| |I think I must give you six
          months,| says his worship, |for really I think you must be the more
          determined rascal of the two.| So if any of you say, |I don't make a
          profession, I shall be all right,| let me tell you, that to make a
          lying profession is a very fearful thing; but for you to think of
          getting off because you make no profession at all, is equally bad.
          Take heed you do not deceive yourselves; it must be the new heart and
          the right spirit with God, or else, profession or no profession, we
          must perish. O! that God would give us grace to go to our houses, and
          cry to him for mercy, and would help us to repent of our sins, and
          bring us to put our trust simply and wholly upon the Lord Jesus
          Christ! So should we be saved now, and saved for ever.<br />
