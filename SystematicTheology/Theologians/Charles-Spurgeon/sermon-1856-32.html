        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.86)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, June 15, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
          sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
          clear when thou judgest." -- Psalm 51:4.
        </p>
        <p>
          YESTERDAY was to me a day of deep solemnity; a pressure rested on my
          mind throughout the whole of it, which I could not by any possibility
          remove, for at every hour I remembered that during that day one of the
          most fallen of my fellow-creatures was launched into an unknown world,
          and made to stand before his Maker. Some might have witnessed his
          execution without tears; I think I could not even have thought of it
          for long together without weeping, at the terrible idea of a man so
          guilty, about to commence that endless period of unmingled misery,
          which is the horrible doom of the impenitent, which God hath prepared
          for sinners. Yesterday morning the sun saw a sigh which sickened it --
          the sight of a man launched, by a judicial process, into eternity, for
          guilt which has rendered him infamous, and which will stamp his name
          with disgrace as long as it shall be remembered.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is now agitating the public mind something which I thought I
          might improve this day, and turn to very excellent purpose. There are
          only two things concerning which the public have any suspicion. The
          verdict of the jury was the verdict of the whole of England; we were
          unanimous as to the high probability, the well-nigh absolute certainty
          of his guilt; but there were two doubts in our minds -- one of them
          but small, we grant you, but if both could have been resolved we
          should have felt more easy than we do now. The one was concerning the
          criminal's guilt, and the other was concerning his punishment. At
          least some few of our fellow-countrymen have been afraid, lest we may
          not have been justified when we spoke against him, and quite clear
          when he was judged. Two things were wanted: we should have liked to
          have had his own confession, and certainly we should have preferred
          something more than circumstantial evidence; we desired to have had
          the testimony of an eye-witness, who could swear to the deed of murder
          done. But, moreover, there is also a strong feeling in the mind of
          many, that the severity of the punishment is questionable. There are
          some who pronounce authoritatively, that the murderer's blood must be
          shed for murder; but there are some who think the Christian
          dispensation has ameliorated the law, and that now it is no longer
          "eye for eye, tooth for tooth." Many persons in England have shuddered
          at the thought of executing a penalty so fearful, on any man, however
          great his crime, seeing that it puts him beyond the pale of hope. I
          shall not enter into the question of the rightness of capital
          punishment; I have my opinion upon it, but this is not exactly the
          place to state it: I only wish to use these facts as an illustration
          of the text. David says, "O Lord, hear my own confession: against
          thee, thee only, have I sinned,' and by my own confession thou wouldst
          be justified when thou speakest, and clear when thou judgest.' And,
          Lord, there is something else besides my own confession. Thou,
          thyself, wast eye-witness of my deed. Against thee, thee only, have I
          sinned, and done this evil in thy sight;' and now thou art, indeed,
          justified when thou speakest, and clear when thou judgest.' And as to
          the severity of my punishment, there can be no doubt of that." There
          may be doubt of the severity, when man executes punishment for a crime
          against man, but there can be no doubt when God himself executes
          vengeance for a crime that is committed against himself. "Thou art
          justified when thou speakest; thou art clear when thou judgest."
        </p>
        <p>
          Our subject this morning, then, will be, both in the condemnation and
          in the punishment of every sinner, God will be justified: and he will
          be made most openly clear, from the two facts of the sinner's own
          confession, and God himself having been an eye-witness of the deed.
          And as for the severity of it, there shall be no doubt upon the mind
          of any man who shall receive it, for God shall prove to him in his own
          soul, that damnation is nothing more nor less than the legitimate
          reward of sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two kinds of condemnation: the one is the condemnation of
          the elect, which takes place in their hearts and consciences, when
          they have the sentence of death in themselves, that they should not
          trust in themselves -- a condemnation which is invariably followed by
          peace with God, because after that there is no further condemnation,
          for they are then in Christ Jesus, and they walk not after the flesh,
          but after the Spirit. The second condemnation is that of the finally
          impenitent, who, when they die, are most righteously and justly
          condemned by God for the sins they have committed -- a condemnation
          not followed by pardon, as in the present case, but followed by
          inevitable damnation from the presence of God. On both these
          condemnations we will discourse this morning. God is clear when he
          speaks, and he is just when he condemns, whether it be the
          condemnation which he passes on Christian hearts, or the condemnation
          which he pronounces from his throne, when the wicked are dragged
          before him to receive their final doom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN, when he feels himself
          condemned by conscience and by God's Holy Spirit, and when he hears
          the thunders of God's law proclaiming against him a sentence which, if
          it had not been already executed on his Saviour, would have been
          fulfilled on him, the man has no grounds whatever at that time to
          plead any excuse; but he will say in the words of the Psalmist, "Thou
          art justified when thou speakest, and clear when thou judgest." Let me
          show you how.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the first place, there is a confession. With regard to the man
          who was executed yesterday, there was no confession; we could not have
          expected it; such crimes could not have been committed by a man
          capable of confessing them. The fact that he died hardened in his
          guilt is proof well-nigh conclusive that he was guilty; for had he
          betrayed any emotion, or had he bowed his knees and cried for mercy,
          we might then have suspected that he had not been guilty of so dark a
          deed of blood; but from the very fact that he hardened his heart, we
          infer that he was capable of committing crimes, the infamy of which
          point them out as the offspring of a seared and torpid conscience. The
          Christian, when he is condemned by the Holy Law, makes a confession, a
          full and free confession. He feels, when God records the sentence
          against him, that the execution of it would be just, for his now
          honest heart compels him to confess the whole story of his guilt.
          Allow me to make some remarks on the confession which is followed by
          pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, such a confession is a sincere one. It is not the prattling
          confession used by the mere formalist, when he bends his knee and
          exclaims that he is a sinner; but it is a confession which is
          undoubtedly sincere, because it is attended by awful agonies of mind,
          and usually by tears, and sighs, and groans. There is something about
          the penitent's demeanour which puts it beyond the possibility of a
          fear that he is a deceiver when he is confessing his sin. There is an
          outward emotion, manifesting the inward anguish of the spirit. He
          stands before God, and does not merely turn king's evidence against
          himself, as the means of saving himself, but with tears in his eyes he
          cries, "O God, I am guilty;" and then he begins to recount the
          circumstances of his crime, even as if God had never seen him. He
          tells to God what God already knows, and then the Gracious One proves
          the truth of the promise, "He that confesseth his sin shall find
          mercy."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, that confession is always abundantly sufficient for
          our own condemnation. The Christian feels that if he had only half the
          sin to confess that he is obliged to tell out to God, it would be
          enough to damn his soul for ever -- that if he had only one crime to
          acknowledge, it would be like a millstone round his neck, to sink him
          for ever in the bottomless pit. He feels that his confession is
          superabundantly enough to condemn him -- that is almost a work of
          supererogation to confess all, for there is enough in one tenth of it
          to send his soul to hell, and make it abide there for ever. Have you
          ever confessed your sins like this? If not, as God liveth, you have
          never known what it is to make a true confession of your sin; you have
          never had the sentence of condemnation passed on you, in that way
          which is succeeded by mercy; but you are yet awaiting that terrible
          sentence which shall be succeeded by no words of love, but by the
          execution of the sentence of infinite indignation and displeasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          This confession is attended with no apology on account of sin. We have
          heard of men who have confessed their guilt, and afterwards tried to
          extenuate their crime, and shew some reasons why they were not so
          guilty as apparently they would seem to be; but when the Christian
          confesses his guilt, you never hear a word of extenuation or apology
          from him. He says, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done
          this evil in thy sight:" and in saying this, he makes God just when he
          condemns him, and clear when he sentences him for ever. Have you ever
          made such a confession? Have you ever thus bowed yourselves before
          God? Or have you tried to palliate your guilt, and call your sins by
          little names, and speak of your crimes as if they were but light
          offences? If you have not, then you have not felt the sentence of
          death in yourselves, and you are still waiting till the solemn
          death-knell shall toll the hour of your doom, and you shall be dragged
          out, amidst the universal hiss of the execration of the world, to be
          condemned for ever to flames which shall never know abatement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: after the Christian confesses his sin, he offers no promise
          that he will of himself behave better. Some, when they make
          confessions to God, say, "Lord, if thou forgive me I will not sin
          again;" but God's penitents never say that. When they come before him
          they say, "Lord, once I promised, once I made resolves, but I dare not
          make them now, for they would be so soon broken, that they would but
          increase my guilt; and my promises would be so soon violated, that
          they would but sink my soul deeper in hell. I can only say, if thou
          wilt create in me a clean heart, I will be thankful for it, and will
          sing to thy praise for ever; but I cannot promise that I will live
          without sin, or work out a righteousness of my own. I dare not
          promise, my Father, that I will never go astray again;
        </p>
        <p>'Unless thou hold me fast,</p>
        <p>I feel I must, I shall decline,</p>
        <p>And prove like them at last.'</p>
        <p>
          Lord, if thou dost damn me, I cannot murmur; if thou dost cast me into
          perdition, I cannot complain; but have mercy upon me, a sinner, for
          Jesus Christ's sake." In that case, you see, God is justified when he
          condemns, and he is clear when he judges, even clearer than any
          earthly judge can be, because it is seldom that such a confession as
          that is ever made before the bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Again: when the Christian is condemned by the law in his
          conscience, there is something else which makes God just in condemning
          him beside his confession, and that is the fact, that God himself, the
          Judge, comes forward as a witness to the crime. The convinced sinner
          feels in his own soul that his sins were committed to the face of God,
          in the teeth of his mercy, and that God was an exact and minute
          observer of every part and particle of the crime for which he is now
          to be condemned, and the sin which has brought him to the bar.
          "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
          sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be
          clear when thou judgest."
        </p>
        <p>
          The convinced sinner who has just become a Christian feels at that
          time that God was a witness, and that he was a most veracious witness
          -- that he saw, and saw most clearly; and when God, by his law, says
          to him, "Sinner, you did such-and-such a thing, and such-and-such a
          thing," the awakened conscience says, "Lord, that is true; it is true
          in every circumstance." And when God goes on to say, "Your motives
          were vile, your objects were sinful," conscience says, "Ay, Lord, that
          is true; I know that thou didst see it, and that thou art a sure
          observer; thou art no false witness, but all that thou sayest in thy
          law about me is true." When God says, "The poison of asps is under thy
          lips, thy throat is an open sepulchre, thou dost flatter with thy
          tongue," conscience says, "It is all true;" and when he says, "The
          heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked,"
          conscience says, "It is all true;" and the sinner has this awful
          thought, that every sin he ever sinned is written in heaven, and God
          records it there; he feels, therefore, that God is just when he
          condemns, and clear when he judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, moreover, God is not simply a veracious witness, but the
          testimony God gives is an abundant one. You know that in some cases
          which are brought before our courts, the witness swears that he saw
          the man do so-and-so; but then he may be mistaken as to the identity
          of the person; perhaps he did not see the whole transaction; and then
          he has not pried into the man's heart to see what was the man's
          reasons, which may make the crime lighter or greater, as the case may
          be. But here we have a witness who can say, "I saw all the crime; I
          saw the lust when it was conceived; I saw the sin when it was brought
          forth; I saw the sin when it was finished, bringing forth death; I saw
          the motive; I beheld the first imagination; I saw the sin when, as a
          black rivulet, it started on its way, when it suddenly began to
          increase by contributions of evil, and I saw it when it became at last
          a broad ocean of unfathomable depth -- an ocean of guilt which human
          foot could not pass, and over which the ship of mercy could not have
          sailed, unless some mighty pilot had steered it by shedding his own
          blood." Then the Christian feels that God having seen it all, is
          justified when he speaks, and clear when he condemns. I should feel a
          solemn responsibility, if I were a judge, in putting on the black cap,
          to condemn a man to death; because, however carefully I may have
          weighed the evidence, and however clear the guilt of the prisoner may
          have seemed, there is possibility of mistake, and it seems a solemn
          thing to have consigned a fellow-creature's soul to a future world,
          even with a possibility of an error in that judgment; but if I had
          myself beheld the bloody act, with what ease of mind might I then put
          on the black cap, and condemn the man as being guilty, for I should
          know, and the world would know, that having been a witness I should be
          just when I spake, and clear when I condemned. Now, that is just what
          the Christian feels when God condemns him in his conscience, he puts
          his hand upon his mouth, and yields without a word to the justness of
          the sentence. Conscience tells him he was guilty, because God himself
          was a witness.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. The other question which I hinted at as being on the public mind,
          is the severity of the punishment. In the case of a believer, when he
          is condemned, there is no doubt about the justice of the punishment.
          When God the Holy Ghost in the soul passes sentence on the old man,
          and condemns it for its sins, there is felt most solemnly in the heart
          the great truth, that hell itself is but a rightful punishment for
          sin. I have heard some men dispute whether the torments of hell were
          not too great for the sins which men can commit. We have heard men say
          that hell was not a right place to send such sinners to as they were;
          but we have always found that such men found fault with hell because
          they knew right well they were going there. As every man finds fault
          with the gallows who is going to be hung, so do many men find fault
          with hell because they fear that they are in danger of it. The opinion
          of a man about to be executed must not be taken with regard to the
          propriety of capital punishment, nor must we take the opinion of a man
          who is himself marching to hell concerning the justice of hell, for he
          is not an impartial judge. But the convinced sinner is a fair witness;
          God has made him so, for he feels in his soul that there will be
          pardon given to him, and that God, by grace, will never condemn him
          there; but at the same time he feels that he deserves it, and he
          confesses that hell is not too great a punishment, and that the
          eternity of it is not too long a duration of punishment for the sin
          which he has committed. I appeal to you, my beloved brethren and
          sisters. You may have had doubts as to the propriety of your being
          sent to hell before you knew your sins; but I ask you, when you were
          convinced of God, whether you did not solemnly feel that he would be
          unjust if he did not damn your soul for ever. Did you not say in your
          prayer, "Lord, if thou shouldst now command the earth to open and
          swallow me up quick, I could not lift up my finger to murmur against
          thee; and if thou wert now to roll o'er my head the billows of eternal
          fire, I could not, in the midst of my howlings in misery, utter one
          single word of complaint about thy justice?" And did you not feel that
          if you were to be ten thousand, thousand years in perdition, you would
          not have been there long enough? You felt you deserved it all; and if
          you had been asked what was the right punishment for sin, you dare
          not, even if your own soul had been at stake, have written anything
          except that sentence, "everlasting fire." You would have been obliged
          to have written that, for you felt it was but deserved doom. Now, was
          not God just then when he condemned, and clear when he judged? and did
          he not come off clear from the judgment seat? because you, yourself,
          said the sentence would not have been one whit too severe if it had
          been fulfilled instead of being simply recorded, and then you,
          yourself, set at liberty. Ah! my dear friends, there may be some who
          rail at God's justice; but no convinced sinner ever will. He sees
          God's law in all its glorious holiness, and he smites his hand upon
          his breast, and he says, "O sinner that I am! that I ever could have
          sinned against such a reasonable law and such perfect commandments!"
          He sees God's love towards him, and that cuts him to the very quick.
          He says, "Oh! that I should ever have spit on the face of that Christ
          who died for me! Wretch that I am, that I could ever have crowned that
          bleeding head with the thorns of my sins, which gave itself to slumber
          in the grave for my redemption!" Nothing cuts the sinner to the quick
          more than the fact, that he has sinned against a great amount of
          mercy. This indeed, makes him weep; and he says, "O Lord, seeing I
          have been so ungrateful, the direst doom thou canst ever sentence me
          to, or the fiercest punishment thou canst ever execute upon my head,
          would not be too heavy for the sins I have committed against thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the Christian feels too, what a deal of mischief he has done
          in the world by sin. Ah! if he has been spared to middle age before he
          is converted, he looks back and says, "Ah! I cannot tell how many have
          been damned by my sins; I cannot tell how many have been sent down to
          perdition by words which I have used, or deeds which I have
          committed." I confess, before you all, that one of the greatest
          sorrows I had, when first I knew the Lord, was to think about certain
          persons with whom I knew right well that I had held ungodly
          conversations, and sundry others that I had tempted to sin; and one of
          the prayers that I always offered, when I prayed for myself, was that
          such an one might not be damned through sins to which I had tempted
          him. And I dare say this will be the case with some of you when you
          look back. Your dear child has been a sad reprobate; and you think,
          "Did not I teach him very much that was wrong?" and you hear your
          neighbours swear, and you think, "I cannot tell how many I taught to
          blaspheme." Then you will recollect your boon companions, those you
          used to play cards or dance with, and you will think, "Ah! poor souls,
          I have damned them." And then you will say, "Lord, thou art just, if
          thou damnest me." When you reflect what a deal of mischief you have
          done by your sin, you will then say, "Lord, thou art clear when thou
          judgest; thou art justified when thou condemnest." I warn you who are
          going on in your sins, that one of the most fearful things you have to
          expect is, to meet those in another world who perished through being
          led astray by you. Think of that, O man! thou who hast been an
          universal tempter! There is a man now in perdition, who was taught to
          drink his first glass through you. There lies a soul on his death-bed,
          and he says, "Ah! John, I had not been here, as I now am, if you had
          not led me into evil courses which have weakened my body, and brought
          me to death's door." Oh! what a horrible fate will yours be, when, as
          you walk into the mouth of hell, you will see eyes staring at you, and
          hear a voice saying, "Here he comes! here comes the man that helped to
          damn my soul!" And what must be your fate, when you must lie for ever
          tossed on the bed of pain with that man whom you were the means of
          damning? As those who are saved will make jewels in the crowns of
          glory to the righteous, sure those whom you helped to damn will forge
          fresh fetters for you and furnish fearful faggots, to increase the
          flames of torment which shall blaze around your spirits. Mark that,
          and be you warned. The Christian feels this terrible fact, when he is
          convinced of sin, and that makes him feel that God would be clear if
          he judged him, and would be justified if he condemned him. So much
          concerning this first condemnation.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. But now a little concerning THE SECOND CONDEMNATION, which is the
          more fearful of the two. Some of you have never been condemned by
          God's law in your conscience. Now, as I stated at first, that every
          man must be condemned once, so I beg to repeat it. You must either
          have the sentence of condemnation passed on you by the law in your
          conscience, and then find mercy in Christ Jesus, or else you must be
          condemned to another world, when you shall stand with all the human
          race before God's throne. The first condemnation to the Christian,
          though exceedingly merciful, is terrible to bear. It is a wounded
          spirit, which none can endure. But, as for the second condemnation, if
          I could preach with sighs and tears, I could not tell you how horrible
          that must be. Ah, my friends, could some sheeted ghost start from its
          tomb, and be re-united to the spirit which has been for years in
          perdition, possibly such a man might preach to you, and let you know
          what a fearful thing it will be to be condemned at last. But as for my
          poor words, they are but air; for I have not heard the miserere of the
          condemned, nor have I listened to the sighs, and groans, and moans of
          lost spirits. If I had ever been permitted to gaze within the sheet of
          fire which walls the Gulf of Despair -- if I had ever been allowed to
          walk for one moment o'er that burning marl whereon is built the
          dreadful dungeon of eternal vengeance, then I might tell you somewhat
          of its misery; but I cannot now, for I have not seen those doleful
          sights which might fright out eyes from their sockets, and make each
          individual hair stand upon your heads. I have not seen such things;
          yet, though I have not seen them, nor you either, we know sufficient
          of them to understand that God will be just when he condemns, and that
          he will be clear when he judges. And, now, I must go over the three
          points again; but I must be very brief about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. God will be clear when he condemns a sinner, from this fact, that
          the sinner when he stands before God's bar, will either have made a
          confession, or else such will be his terror, that he will scarce be
          able to brazen it out before the Almighty. Look at Judas. When he
          comes before God's bar, will not God be clear in condemning him? for
          he himself confessed, "I have sinned against innocent blood," and he
          cast down the money in the temple. And few men are so hardened as to
          restrain themselves from acknowledging their guilt. How many of you,
          when you thought you were dying, made a confession upon your
          death-beds to you God! And mark you, there will be many of you, who,
          when you come to die, though you have never confessed, yet will lie
          there, and confess before God in your moments of wakefulness during
          the night, the sins of your youth, and your former transgressions; and
          it may be, that when you are laying there, God's vengeance will be
          heavy on your conscience, that you will be obliged to tell those who
          stand about your bed, that you have been guilty of notorious sins. Ah!
          will not God be just when you shall go straight from your death-bed to
          his bar, and he shall say, "Sinner, thou art condemned on thine own
          confession; there is no need for me to open the book, no need for me
          to pronounce the sentence; thou hast thyself pronounced thine own
          guilt; ere thou didst die, thou didst stamp thyself with condemnation;
          depart ye cursed!'" And though there will be many die who never made a
          confession in this world, and perhaps there will be some professors so
          brazen-faced that they will even stand before God's throne, and say,
          "When saw we thee a hungered, and fed thee not? When saw we thee
          naked, and clothed thee not?" yet I cannot believe that most of them
          will be able to plead any excuse. I find Christ saying of one that he
          stood speechless when he was asked how he got in, not having on a
          wedding garment; and so it may be with you, sirs. You may brazen it
          out when here, you may scorn the law and despise the thunders of
          Sinai; but it will be different with you then. You may sit up in your
          bed, and rail against Christ, even when death is staring you in the
          face; but you will not do it then. Those bones of yours which you
          thought were of iron, will suddenly be melted; that heart of yours,
          which was like steel or the nether millstone, will be dissolved like
          wax in the midst of your bowels; you will begin to cry before God, and
          weep, and howl: you yourself will testify to your own guilt, when you
          say, "Rocks! hide me; mountains! on me fall;" for you would need no
          mountains and no rocks to fall upon you, if you were not guilty. You
          will be justly condemned, for you will make your own confession when
          you stand before God's bar. Ah! if you could see the criminal then,
          what a difference there is in him! Where now are those eyes that
          stared so impiously at the Bible? Where now are those lips which said,
          "I curse God and die!" Where now is that heart which once so stout,
          that spirit once so valiant, as to laugh at hell and talk familiarly
          with death? Ah! where is it? Is that the selfsame creature -- he whose
          knees are knocking together, whose hair is standing up on end, whose
          blanched cheek displays the terror of his soul? Is that the selfsame
          man who just now was burning with impudent rage against his Maker?
          Yes, it is he; hear what he has to say, "O God, I hate thee; I confess
          it; I was unjust in the world tat has gone by, and I am unjust now;
          wreck thy vengeance on me; I dare ask no mercy, and no pardon, for
          fixed is my heart still to rebel against thee; indissoluble are the
          bonds of my guilt: I am damned, I am damned, and I ought to be." Such
          will be the confession of every man, when he shall stand before his
          God at last, if he is out of Christ, and unwashed in the Saviour's
          blood. Sinners! can ye hear that and not tremble? Then I have a wonder
          before me this day -- a wonder of conscience, a wonder of hardness of
          heart, a wonder of impenitency.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But in the second place, God will be just, because there will be
          witnesses there to prove it. There will be none of you my dear
          friends, if you are ever condemned, who will be condemned on
          circumstantial evidence: there will be no necessity for the
          deliberation of a jury; there will be no conflicting evidence
          concerning your crimes; there will be no doubts to testify in your
          favour. In fact, if God himself should ask for witnesses in your case,
          all the witnesses would be against you. But there will be no need of
          witnesses; God himself will open his Book; and how astonished will you
          be, when all your crimes are announced, with every individual
          circumstance connected with them -- all the minuteness of your
          motives, and an exact description of your designs! Suppose I should be
          allowed to open one of the books of God, and read that description,
          how astonished you would be! But what will be your astonishment, when
          God shall open his great book and say, "Sinner, here is thy case," and
          begin to read! Ah! mark how the tears run down the sinner's cheek; the
          sweat of blood comes from every pore; and the loud thundering voice
          still reads on, while the righteous execrate the man who could commit
          such acts as are recorded in that book. There may be no murder
          staining the page, but there may be the filthy imagination, and God
          reads what a man imagines; for to imagine sin is vile, though to do it
          is viler still. I know I should not like to have my thoughts read over
          for a single day. Oh! when you stand before God's bar, and hear all
          this, wilt thou not say, "Lord, thou wilt condemn me, but I cannot
          help saying thou art just when thou condemnest, and clear when thou
          judgest." There will be eye-witnesses there.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. But lastly, in the sinner's heart there will be no doubt at last as
          to the righteousness of his punishment. The sinner may in this world
          think that he can never by his sins by any possibility deserve hell;
          but he will not indulge that thought when he gets there. One of the
          miseries of hell will be that the sinner will feel that he deserves it
          all. Tossed on a wave of fire he will see written in every spark that
          emanates therefrom, "Thou knewest thy duty, and thou didst it not."
          Tossed back again by another wave of flame, he hears a voice saying,
          "Remember, you were warned!" He is hurled upon a rock, and whilst he
          is being wrecked there, a voice says, "I told thee it would be better
          for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for thee." Again he
          plunged under another wave of brimstone, and a voice says, "He that
          believeth not shall be damned;' thou didst not believe, and thou art
          here." And when again he is hurled up and down on some wave of
          torture, each wave shall bear to him some dreadful sentence, which he
          read in God's Word, in a tract, or in a sermon. Yes, it may be, my
          friends, that I shall be one of your tormentors in hell, if you should
          be damned. I trust in God that I myself shall be in heaven; and
          perhaps, if ye are lost, one of the most powerful things that shall
          tend to increase your misery will be the fact that I have always tried
          to warn you, and warn you as earnestly as possible; and when you lift
          up your eyes to heaven, you will shriek, and say, "O God! there is my
          minister looking down reprovingly on me, and saying, Sinner, I warned
          thee.'" If thou art lost, it is not for want of preaching; if thou art
          damned, it is not because I did not tell thee how thou mightest be
          saved; if thou art in hell, it is not because I did not weep over
          thee, and urge thee to flee from the wrath to come, for I did warn
          thee, and that will be the terror of thy doom -- that thou hast
          despised warnings and invitations, and hast destroyed thyself. God is
          not accountable for thy damnation, and man is not accountable for it;
          but thou thyself hast done it. And thou wilt say, "O Lord, it is true
          I am now tossed in fire, but I myself lit the flame; it is true that I
          am tormented, but I forged the irons which now confine my limbs; I
          burned the brick that hath built my dungeon; I myself didst bring
          myself here; I walked to hell, even as a fool goeth to the stocks, or
          an ox to the slaughter; I sharpened the knife which is now cutting my
          vitals; I nursed the viper which is now devouring my heart; I sinned,
          which is the same as saying that I damned myself; for to sin is to
          damn myself -- the two words are synonymous." Sin is damnation's sire;
          it is the root, and damnation is the horrible flower which must
          inevitably spring from it. Ay, my dear friends, I tell you yet again,
          there will be nothing more patent before the throne of God than the
          fact, that God will be just when he sends you to hell. You will feel
          that then, even though you do not feel it now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought within myself just this minute, that I heard the whisper of
          some one saying, "Well, sir, I feel that such men as Palmer, a
          murderer, will feel that God is just in damning them; but I have not
          sinned as they have done." It is true; but if thy sins be less,
          remember that thy conscience is more tender, for according to the
          amount of guilt, men's consciences generally begin to get harder, and
          because thy conscience is more tender, thy little sin is a great sin,
          because it is committed against greater light and greater tenderness
          of heart; and I tell you -- that a little sin against great light may
          be greater than a great sin against little light. You must measure
          your sins not by their apparent heinousness, but by the light against
          which you sinned. No crime could be much worse than the crime of
          Sodom; but even Sodom, filthy Sodom, shall not have so hot a place as
          a moral young lady, one who has fed the poor and clothed the naked,
          and done all she could, except loving Christ. What say you to that? Is
          it unjust? No. If I be a less sinner than another, I all the more
          deserve to be damned, if I do not come to Christ for mercy. Oh! my
          dear hearers, my beloved hearers, I cannot bring you to Christ. Christ
          has brought some of you himself, but I cannot bring you to Christ. How
          often have I tried to do it! I have tried to preach my Saviour's love,
          and this day I have preached my Father's wrath; but I feel I cannot
          bring you to Christ. I may preach God's law; but that will not
          affright you, unless God sends it home to your heart; I may preach my
          Saviour's love, but that will not woo you, unless my Father draw you.
          I am sometimes tempted to wish that I could draw you myself -- that I
          could save you. Sure, if I could, ye should soon be saved! But ah!
          remember, your minister can do but little; he can do nothing else but
          preach to you. Do pray that God would bless that little, I beseech
          you, ye who can pray. If I could do more, I would do it; but it is
          very little I can do for a sinner's salvation. Do, I beseech you, my
          dear people, pray to God to bless the feeble means that I use. It is
          his work and his salvation; but he can do it. O poor trembling sinner,
          dost thou now weep? Then come to Christ! O poor haggard sinner,
          haggard in thy soul! come to Christ! O poor sin-bitten sinner! look to
          Christ! O poor worthless sinner! come to Christ! O poor trembling,
          fearing, hungering, thirsting sinner! come to Christ! "Ho! everyone
          that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money,
          come, buy wine and milk; yea, come buy wine and milk, without money
          and without price." Come! Come! Come! God help you to come! for Jesus
          Christ's sake. Amen.
