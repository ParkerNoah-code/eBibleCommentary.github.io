        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1910)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Lord's-day Morning, July 18th, 1886, by</p>

          "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
          by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he
          hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made
          the righteousness of God in him." -- 2 Corinthians v 20,21.

          THE heart of the gospel is redemption, and the essence of redemption
          is the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ. They who preach this truth
          preach the gospel in whatever else they may be mistaken; but they who
          preach not the atonement, whatever else they declare, have missed the
          soul and substance of the divine message. In these days I feel bound
          to go over again the elementary truths of the Gospel. In peaceful
          times we may feel free to make excursions into interesting districts
          of truth which lie far afield; but now we must stay at home, and guard
          the hearths and homes of the church by defending the first principles
          of the faith. In this age there have risen up in the church itself men
          who speak perverse things. There be many that trouble us with their
          philosophies and novel interpretations, whereby they deny the
          doctrines they profess to teach, and undermine the faith they are
          pledged to maintain. It is well that some of us, who know what we
          believe, and have no secret meanings for our words, should just put
          our foot down and maintain our standing, holding forth the word of
          life, and plainly declaring the foundation truths of the gospel of
          Jesus Christ.

          Let me give you a parable. In the days of Nero there was great
          shortness of food in the city of Rome, although there was abundance of
          corn to be purchased at Alexandria. A certain man who owned a vessel
          went down to the sea coast, and there he noticed many hungry people
          straining their eyes toward the sea, watching for the vessels that
          were to come from Egypt with corn. When these vessels came to the
          shore, one by one, the poor people wrung their hands in bitter
          disappointment, for on board the galleys there was nothing but sand
          which the tyrant emperor had compelled them to bring for use in the
          arena. It was infamous cruelty, when men were dying of hunger to
          command trading vessels to go to and fro, and bring nothing else but
          sand for gladiatorial shows, when wheat was so greatly needed. Then
          the merchant whose vessel was moored by the quay said to his
          shipmaster, "Take thou good heed that thou bring nothing back with
          thee from Alexandria but corn; and whereas, aforetime thou hast
          brought in the vessel a measure or two of sand, bring thou not so much
          as would lie upon a penny this time. Bring thou nothing else, I say,
          but wheat: for these people are dying, and now we must keep our
          vessels for this one business of bringing food for them." Alas! I have
          seen certain mighty galleys of late loaded with nothing but mere sand
          of philosophy and speculation, and I have said within myself, "Nay,
          but I will bear nothing in my ship but the revealed truth of God, the
          bread of life so greatly needed by the people." God grant us this day
          that our ship may have nothing on board it that may merely gratify the
          curiosity, or please the taste; but that there may be necessary truths
          for the salvation of souls. I would have each one of you say: "Well,
          it was just the old, old story of Jesus and his love, and nothing
          else." I have no desire to be famous for anything but preaching of the
          gospel. There are plenty who can fiddle to you the new music; it is
          for me to have no music at any time but that which is heard in heaven,
          -- "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own
          blood, to him be glory for ever and ever!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend, dear friends, to begin my discourse with the second part of
          my text, in which the doctrine of Substitution is set forth in these
          words -- "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
          might be made the righteousness of God in him." This is the basis and
          power of those appeals which it is our duty to make to the consciences
          of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have found, my brethen, by long experience, that nothing touches the
          heart like the cross of Christ; and when the heart is touched and
          wounded by the two-edged sword of the law, nothing heals its wounds
          like the balm which flows from the pierced heart of Jesus. The cross
          is life to the spiritually dead. There is an old legend which can have
          no literal truth in it, but if it be regarded as a parable it is then
          most instructive. They say that when the Empress Helena was searching
          for the true cross they digged deep at Jerusalem and found the three
          crosses of Calvary buried in the soil. Which out of the three crosses
          was the veritable cross upon which Jesus died they could not tell,
          except by certain tests. So they brought a corpse and laid it on one
          of the crosses, but there was neither life nor motion. When the same
          dead body touched another of the crosses it lived; and then they said,
          "This is the true cross." When we see men quickened, converted, and
          sanctified by the doctrine of the substitutionary sacrifice, we may
          justly conclude that it is the true doctrine of atonement. I have not
          known men made to live unto God and holiness except by the doctrine of
          the death of Christ on man's behalf. Hearts of stone that never beat
          with life before have been turned to flesh through the Holy Spirit
          causing them to know this truth. A sacred tenderness the obstinate
          when they have heard of Jesus crucified for them. Those who have lain
          at hell's dark door, wrapped about with a sevenfold death-shade, even
          upon them hath a great light shined. The story of the great Lover of
          the souls of men who gave himself for their salvation is still in the
          hand of the Holy Ghost the greatest of all forces in the realm of
          mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this morning I am going to handle, first, the great doctrine, and
          then afterwards, and secondly, as God shall help me, we shall come to
          the great argument which is contained in the 20th verse: "Now then we
          are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we
          pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First, then, with as much brevity as possible I will speak upon THE
          GREAT DOCTRINE. The great doctrine, the greatest of all, is this, that
          God, seeing men to be lost by reason of their sin, hath taken that sin
          of theirs and laid it upon his only begotten Son, making him to be sin
          for us, even him who knew no sin; and that in consequence of this
          transference of sin he that believeth in Christ Jesus is made just and
          righteous, ya, is made to be the righteousness of God in Christ.
          Christ was made sin that sinners might be made righteousness. That is
          the doctrine of the substitution of our Lord Jesus Christ on the
          behalf of guilty men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now consider, first, who was made sin for us? The description of our
          great Surety here given is upon one point only, and it may more than
          suffice us for our present meditation. Our substitute was spotless,
          innocent, and pure. "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
          sin." Christ Jesus, the Son of God, became incarnate, and was made
          flesh, and dwelt here among men; but though he was made in the
          likeness of sinful flesh, he knew no sin. Though upon him sin was
          laid, yet not so as to make him guilty. He was not, he could not be, a
          sinner: he had no personal knowledge of sin. Throughout the whole of
          his life he never committed an offence against the great law of truth
          and right. The law was in his heart; it was his nature to be holy. He
          could say to all the world, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?" Even
          his vacillating judge enquired, "Why, what evil hath he done?" When
          all Jerusalem was challenged and bribed to bear witness against him,
          no witnesses could be found. It was necessary to misquote and wrest
          his words before a charge could be trumped up against him by his
          bitterest enemies. His life brought him in contact with both the
          tables of the law, but no single command had he transgressed. As the
          Jews examined the Paschal lamb before they slew it, so did scribes and
          Pharisees, and doctors of the law, and rulers and princes, examine the
          Lord Jesus, without finding no offence in him. He was the Lamb of God,
          without blemish and without spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          As there was no sin of commission, so was there about our Lord no
          fault of omission. Probably, dear brethen, we that are believers have
          been enabled by divine grace to escape most sins of commission; but I
          for one have to mourn daily over sins of omission. If we have
          spiritual graces, yet they do not reach the point required of us. If
          we do that which is right in itself, yet we usually mar our work upon
          the wheel, either in the motive, or in the manner of doing it, or by
          the self-satisfaction with which we view it when it is done. We come
          short of the glory of God in some respect or other. We forget to do
          what we ought to do, or, doing it, we are guilty of lukewarmness,
          self-reliance, unbelief, or some other grievious error. It was not so
          with our divine Redeemer. You cannot say that there was any feature
          deficient in his perfect beauty. He was complete in heart, in purpose,
          in thought, in word, in deed, in spirit. You could not add anything to
          the life of Christ without its being manifestly an excrescence. He was
          emphatically an all-round man, as we say in these days. His life is a
          perfect circle, a complete epitome of virtue. No pearl has dropped
          from the silver string of his character. No one virtue has
          overshadowed and dwarfed the rest: all perfections combine in perfect
          harmony to make in him one surpassing perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither did our Lord know a sin of thought. His mind never produced an
          evil wish or desire. There never was in the heart of our blessed Lord
          a wish for an evil pleasure, nor a desire to escape any suffering or
          shame which was involved in his service. When he said, "Father, if it
          be possible, let this cup pass from me," he never desired to escape
          the bitter potion at the expense of his perfect lifework. The "if it
          be possible," meant, "if it be consistent with full obedience to the
          Father, and the accomplishment of the divine purpose." We see the
          weakness of his nature shrinking, and the holiness of his nature
          resolving and conquering, as he adds, "nevertheless, not as I will,
          but as thou wilt." He took upon him the likeness of sinful flesh, but
          though that flesh often caused him weariness of body, it never
          produced in him the weakness of sin. He took our infirmities, but he
          never exhibited an infirmity which had the least of blameworthiness
          attached to it. Never fell there an evil glance from those blessed
          eyes; never did his lips let drop a hasty word; never did those feet
          go on an ill errand, nor those hands move towards a sinful deed;
          because his heart was filled with holiness and love. Within as well as
          without our Lord was unblemished. His desires were as perfect as his
          actions. Searched by the eyes of Omniscience, no shadow of fault could
          be found in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yea, more, there were no tendencies about our Substitute towards evil
          in any form. In us there are always those tendencies; for the taint of
          original sin is upon us. We have to govern ourselves and hold
          ourselves under stern restraint, or we should rush headlong to
          destruction. Our carnal nature lusteth to evil, and needs to be held
          in as with bit and bridle. Happy is that man who can master himself.
          But with regard to our Lord, it was his nature to be pure, and right,
          and loving. All his sweet wills were towards goodness. His
          unconstrained life was holiness itself: he was "the holy child Jesus."
          The prince of this world found in him no fuel for the flame which he
          desired to kindle. Not only did no sin flow from him, but there was no
          sin in him, nor inclination, nor tendency in that direction. Watch him
          in secret, and you find him in prayer; look unto his soul, and you
          find him eager to do and suffer the Father's will. Oh, the blessed
          character of Christ! If I had the tongues of men and of angels I could
          not worthily set forth his absolute perfection Justly may the Father
          be well pleased with him! Well may heaven adore him!
        </p>
        <p>
          Beloved, it was absolutely necessary that any one who should be able
          to suffer in our stead should himself be spotless. A sinner obnoxious
          to punishment by reason of his own offences, what can he do but bear
          the wrath which is due to his own sin? Our Lord Jesus Christ as man
          was made under the law: but he owed nothing to that law, for he
          perfectly fulfilled it in all respects. He was capable of standing in
          the room, place, and stead of others, because he was under no
          obligations of his own. He was only under obligations towards God
          because he had voluntarily undertaken to be the surety and sacrifice
          for those whom the Father gave him. He was clear himself, or else he
          could not have entered into bonds for guilty men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, how I admire him, that being such as he was, spotless and thrice
          holy, so that even the heavens were not pure in his sight, and he
          charged his angels with folly, yet he condescended to be made sin for
          us! How could he endure to be numbered with the transgressors and bear
          the sin of many? It may be no misery for a sinful man to live with
          sinful men; but it would be a heavy sorrow for the pure-minded to
          dwell with a company of abandoned and licentious wretches. What an
          overwhelming sorrow it must have been to the pure and perfect Christ
          to tabernacle among the hypocritical, the selfish, and the profane!
          How much worse that he himself should have to take upon himself the
          sins of those guilty men. His sensitive and delicate nature must have
          shrunk from even the shadow of sin, and yet read the words and be
          astonished: "He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin." Our
          perfect Lord and Master bare our sins in his own body on the tree. He,
          before whom the sun itself is dim and the pure azure of heaven is
          defilement, was made sin. I need not put this in fine words: the fact
          is itself too grand to need any magnifying by human language. To gild
          refined gold, or paint the lily, were absurd; but much more absurd
          would it be to try to overlay with flowers of speech the matchless
          beauties of the cross. It suffices in simple rhyme to say --
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, hear that piercing cry!</p>
        <p>What can its meaning be?</p>
        <p>'My God! my God! oh! why hast thou</p>
        <p>In wrath forsaken me?'</p>
        <p>"Oh 'twas because our sins</p>
        <p>On him by God were laid;</p>
        <p>He who himself had never sinn'd,</p>
        <p>For sinners, sin was made."</p>
        <p>
          This leads me on to the second point of the text, which is, what was
          done with him who knew no sin? He was "made sin." It is a wonderful
          expression: the more you weigh it the more you will marvel at its
          singular strength. Only the Holy Ghost might originate such language.
          It was wise for the divine Teacher to use very strong expressions, for
          else the thought might not have entered human minds. Even now, despite
          the emphasis, clearness, and distinctness of the language used here
          and elsewhere in Scripture there are found men daring enough to deny
          that substitution is taught in Scripture. With such subtle wits it is
          useless to argue. It is clear that language has no meaning for them.
          To read the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, and to accept it as relating to
          the Messiah, and then to deny his substitutionary sacrifice is simply
          wickedness. It would be vain to reason with such beings; they are so
          blind that if they were transported to the sun they could not see. In
          the church and out of the church there is a deadly animosity to this
          truth. Modern thought labours to get away from what is obviously the
          meaning of the Holy Spirit, that sin was lifted from the guilty and
          laid upon the innocent. It is written, "The Lord hath laid on him the
          iniquity of us all." This is as plain language as can be used; but if
          any plainer was required, here it is, -- "He hath made him to be sin
          for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lord God laid upon Jesus, who voluntarily undertook it, all the
          weight of human sin. Instead of its resting on the sinner, who did
          commit it, it was made to rest upon Christ, who did not commit to it;
          while the righteousness which Jesus wrought out was placed to the
          account of the guilty, are treated as righteous. Those who by nature
          are guilty, are regarded as righteous, while he who by nature knew no
          sin whatever, was treated as guilty. I think I must have read in
          scores of books that such a transference is impossible; but the
          statement has had no effect upon my mind. I do not care whether it is
          impossible or not with learned unbelievers: it is evidently possible
          with God, for he has done it. But they say it is contrary to reason. I
          do not care for that, either: it may be contrary to the reason of
          those unbelievers, but it is not contrary to mine; and if I am to be
          guided by reason, I prefer to follow my own. The atonement is a
          miracle, and miracles are rather to be accepted by faith than measured
          by calculation. A fact is the best of arguments. It is a fact that the
          Lord hath laid on Jesus the iniquity of us all. God's revelation
          proves the fact, and our faith defies human questioning! God saith it,
          and I believe it; and believing it, I find life and comfort in it.
          Shall I not preach it? Assuredly I will.
        </p>
        <p>"E'er since by faith I saw the stream</p>
        <p>His flowing wounds supply,</p>
        <p>Redeeming love has been my theme,</p>
        <p>And shall be till I die."</p>
        <p>
          Christ was not guilty, and could not be made guilty; but he was
          treated as if he were guilty, because he willed to stand in the place
          of the guilty. Yea, he was not only treated as a sinner, but he was
          treated as if he had been sin itself in the abstract. This is an
          amazing utterance. The sinless one was made to sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sin pressed our great Substitute very sorely. He felt the weight of it
          in the Garden of Gethsemane, where he "sweat as it were great drops of
          blood falling to the ground." The full pressure of it came upon him
          when he was nailed to the accursed tree. There in the hours of
          darkness he bore infinitely more than we can tell. We know that he
          bore condemnation from the mouth of a man, so that is written, "He was
          numbered with the transgressors." We know that he bore shame for our
          sakes. Did not your hearts tremble last Sunday evening when our text
          was, "Then did they spit in his face?" It was a cruel scorn that
          exhausted itself upon his blessed person. This, I say, we know. We
          know that he bore pains innumerable of body and mind: he thirsted, he
          cried out in the agony of desertion, he bled, he died. We know that he
          poured out his soul unto death, and yielded up the ghost. But there
          was at the back, and beyond all this, an immeasurable abyss of
          sufferings": probably to us they are unknowable sufferings. He was God
          as well as man, and the Godhead lent an omnipotent power to the
          manhood, so that there was compressed within his soul, and endured by
          it, an amount of anguish of which we can form no conception. I will
          say no more: it is wise to veil what it is impossible to depict. This
          text both veils and discovers his sorrow, as it says, "He made him to
          be sin." Look into the words. Perceive their meaning if you can. The
          angels desire to look into it. Gaze into this terrible crystal. Let
          your eyes search deep into this opal, within whose jewelled depth
          there are flames of fire. The Lord made the perfectly innocent one to
          be sin for us: that means more humiliation, darkness, agony, and death
          than you can conceive. It brought a kind of distraction and well-nigh
          a destruction to the tender and gentle spirit of our Lord. I do not
          say that our substitute endured a hell, that were unwarrantable. I
          will not say that he endured either the exact punishment for sin, or
          an equivalent for it; but I do say that what he endured rendered to
          the justice of God a vindication of his law more clear and more
          effectual than would have been rendered to it by the damnation of the
          sinners for whom he died. The cross is under many aspects a more full
          revelation of the wrath of God against human sin than even Tophet, and
          the smoke of torment which goeth up for ever and ever. Who would know
          God's hate of sin must see the Only Begotten bleeding in body and
          bleeding in soul even unto death: he must, in fact, spell out each
          word of my text, and read its innermost meaning. There, my brethen, I
          am ashamed of the poverty of my explanation, and I will therefore only
          repeat the full and sublime language of the apostle -- "He hath made
          him to be sin for us." It is more than "He hath put him to grief"; it
          is more than "God hath forsaken him"; it is more than "The
          chastisement of our peace was upon him"; it is the most suggestive of
          all descriptions -- "He hath made him sin for us." Oh depth of terror,
          and yet height of love!
        </p>
        <p>
          So I pass on to notice in the third place, who did it? The text saith,
          "He hath made him to be sin for us"; that is, God himself it was who
          appointed his dear Son to be made sin for guilty men. The wise ones
          tell us that this substitution cannot be just. Who made them judges of
          what is right and just. I ask them whether they believe that Jesus
          suffered and died at all? if they believe that he did, how do they
          account for the fact? Do they say that he died as an example? Then I
          ask, is it just for God to allow a sinless being to die as an example?
          The fact of our Lord's death is sure, and it has to be accounted for.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the appointment of the Lord Jesus Christ to be made sin for us,
          there was first of all a display of the Divine Sovereignty. God here
          did what none but he could have done. It would not have been possible
          for all of us together to have laid sin upon Christ; but it was
          possible for the great Judge of all, who giveth no account of his
          matters, to determine that so it should be. He is the fountain of
          rectitude, and the exercise of his divine prerogative is always
          unquestionable righteousness. That the Lord Jesus, who offered himself
          as a willing surety and substitute, should be accepted as surety and
          substitute for guilty man was in the power of the great Supreme. In
          his Divine Sovereignty he accepted him, and before that sovereignty we
          bow. If any question it, our only answer is, "Nay but, O man, who art
          thou that repliest against God?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The death of our Lord also displayed divine justice. It pleased God as
          the judge of all, that sin should not be forgiven without the exaction
          of the punishment which had been so righteously threatened to it, or
          such other display of justice as might vindicate the law. They say
          that this is not God of love. I answer, it is God of love,
          pre-eminently so. If you had upon the bench to-day a judge whose
          nature was kindness itself, it would behove him as a judge to execute
          justice, and if he did not, he would make his kindness ridiculous;
          indeed, his kindness to the criminal would be unkindness to society at
          large. Whatever the judge may be personally, he is officially
          compelled to do justice. And "shall not the Judge of all the earth do
          right? " You speak of the Fatherhood of God. Enlarge as you please
          upon that theme, even till you make a heresy of it; but still God is
          the great moral Governor of the universe, and it behoves him to deal
          with sin in such a way that it is seen to be an evil and a bitter
          thing. God cannot wink at wickedness. I bless his holy name, and adore
          him that he is not unjust in order to be merciful, that he does not
          spare the guilty in order to indulge his gentleness. Every
          transgression and disobedience has its just recompense of reward. But
          through the sacrifice of Christ he is able justly to pardon. I bless
          his holy name that to vindicate his justice he determined that, while
          a free pardon should be provided for believers, it should be grounded
          upon an atonement which satisfied all requirements of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admire also in the substitutionary sacrifice the great grace of God.
          Never forget that he whom God made to be sin for us was his own Son;
          ay, I go further, it was in some sense his own self; for the Son is
          one with the Father. You may not confound the persons, but you cannot
          divide the Son of God from the Father as to forget that God was in him
          reconciling the world unto himself. It is the Father's other self who
          on the cross in human form doth bleed and die. "Light of light, very
          God of very God": it is this Light that was eclipsed, that Godhead
          which purchased the church with his own blood. Herein is infinite
          love! You tell me that God might have pardoned without atonement. I
          answer, that finite and fallible love might have done so, and thus
          have wounded itself by killing justice; but the love which both
          required and provided the atonement is indeed infinite. God himself
          provided the atonement by freely and fully giving up himself in the
          person of his Son to suffer in consequence of human sin.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I want you to notice here is this, if ever your mind should be
          troubled about the propriety or rightness of a substitutionary
          sacrifice, you may at once settle the matter by remembering that God
          himself "hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin." If God did
          it, it is well done. I am not careful to defend an act of God: let the
          man who dares accuse his Maker think what he is at. If God himself
          provided the sacrifice, be you sure that he has accepted it. There can
          be no question ever raised about it, since Jehovah made to meet on him
          our iniquities. He that made Christ to be sin for us, knew what he
          did, and it is not for us to begin to say, "Is this right, or is this
          not right? " The thrice holy God hath done this, and it must be right.
          That which satisfies God may well satisfy us. If God is pleased with
          the sacrifice of Christ, shall not we be much more pleased? Shall we
          not be delighted, entranced, emparadised, to be saved by such a
          sacrifice as God himself appoints, provides, and accepts? "He hath
          made him to be sin for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          The last point is, what happens to us in consequence? "That we might
          be made the righteousness of God in him." Oh this weighty text! No man
          living can exhaust it. No theologian lived, even in the palmiest day
          of theology, who could ever get to the bottom of this statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every man that believes in Jesus is through Christ having taken his
          sin made to be righteousness before God. We are righteous through
          faith in Christ Jesus, "justified by faith." More than this, we are
          made not only to have the character of "righteous," but to become the
          substance called "righteousness." I cannot explain this, but it is no
          small matter. It means no inconsiderable thing when we are said to be
          "made righteousness." What is more, we are not only made
          righteousness, but we are made "the righteousness of God. "Herein is a
          great mystery. The righteousness which Adam had in the garden was
          perfect, but it was the righteousness of man: ours is the
          righteousness of God. Human righteousness failed; but the believer has
          a divine righteousness which can never fail. He not only has it, but
          he is it: he is "made the righteousness of God in Christ." We can now
          sing,
        </p>
        <p>"With my Saviour's vesture on,</p>
        <p>Holy as the Holy One."</p>
        <p>
          How acceptable with God must those be who are made by God himself to
          be "the righteousness of God in him"! I cannot conceive of anything
          more complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Christ was made sin, and yet never sinned, so are we made
          righteousness, though we cannot claim to have been righteous in and of
          ourselves. Sinners though we be, and forced to confess it with grief,
          yet the Lord doth cover us so completely with the righteousness of
          Christ, that only his righteousness is seen, and we are made the
          righteousness of God in him. This is true of all the saints, even of
          as many as believe on his name. Oh, the splendor of this doctrine!
          Canst thou see it, my friend? Sinner though thou be, and in thyself
          defiled, deformed, and debased, yet if thou wilt accept the great
          Substitute which God provide for in the person of his dear Son, thy
          sins are gone from thee, and righteousness has come to thee. Thy sins
          were laid on Jesus, the scapegoat: they are thine no longer, he has
          put them away. I may say that his righteousness is imputed unto thee;
          but I go further, and say with the text, "Thou art made the
          righteousness of God in him." No doctrine can be more sweet than this
          to those who feel the weight of sin and the burden of its curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. So now, gathering all up, I have to close with the second part of
          the text, which is not teaching, but the application of teaching, -- A
          GREAT ARGUMENT. "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
          did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled
          to God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, that these lips had language, or that this heart could speak
          without them! Then would I plead with every unconverted, unbelieving
          soul within this place, and plead as for my life. Friend, you are at
          enmity with God, and God is angry with you; but on his part there is
          every readiness for reconciliation. He has made a way by which you can
          become his friend -- a very costly way to himself, but free to you. He
          could not give up his justice, and so destroy the honour of his own
          character; but he did give up his Son, his Only Begotten, and his
          Well-Beloved; and that Son of his had been made sin for us, though he
          knew no sin. See how God meets you ! See how willing, how anxious he
          is that there should be reconciliation between you and God to-day it
          is not from want of kindness on his part; it is from want of
          willingness on yours. The burden of your ruin must lie at your own
          door: your blood must be on your own skirts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now observe what we have to say to you to-day is this: we are anxious
          that you should be at peace with God, and therefore we act as
          ambassadors for Christ. I am not going to lay any stress upon the
          office of ambassador as honourable or authoritative, for I do not feel
          that this would have weight with you: but I lay all the stress upon
          the peace to which we would fain have you reconciled also. I once knew
          him not, neither did I care for him. I lived well enough without him,
          and sported with trifles of a day, so as to forget him. He brought me
          to seek his face, and seeking his face I found him. He has blotted out
          my sins and removed my enmity. I know that I am his servant, and that
          he is my friend, my Father, my All. And now I cannot help trying in my
          poor way to be an ambassador for him with you. I do not like that any
          of you should live at enmity with my Father who made you; and that you
          should be wantonly provoking him by preferring evil to good. Why
          should you not be at peace with one who so mush wants to be at peace
          with you? Why should you not love the God of love, and delight in him
          who is so kind to you? What he hath done for me he is quite willing to
          do for you: he is a God ready to pardon. I have preached his gospel
          now for many years, but I never met with a sinner yet that Christ
          refused to cleanse when he came to him. I never knew a single case of
          a man who trusted Jesus, and asked to be forgiven, confessing his sin
          and forsaking it, who was cast out. I say I never met with one man
          whom he has restored to purity, and drunkards whom he has delivered
          from their evil habit, and with men guilty of foul sins who have
          become pure and chaste through the Lord Jesus. They have always told
          me the same story -- "I sought the Lord, and he heard me; he hath
          washed me in his blood, and I am whiter than snow." Why should you not
          be saved as well as these?
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear friend, perhaps you have never thought of this matter, and this
          morning you did not some here with any idea of thinking of it; but why
          should you not begin? You came just to hear a well-known preacher; I
          pray you forget the preacher, and think only of yourself, your God and
          your Saviour. It must be wrong for you to live without a thought of
          your Maker. To forget him is to despise him. It must be wrong for you
          to refuse the great atonement: you so refuse it if you do not accept
          it at once. It must be wrong for you to stand out against your God;
          and you do stand out against him if you will not be reconciled to him.
          Therefore I humbly play the part of an ambassador for Christ, and I
          beseech you believe in him and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how the text puts it: "We are ambassadors for Christ, as though
          God did beseech you by us." This thought staggers me. As I came along
          this morning I felt as if I could bury my head in my hands and weep as
          I thought of God beseeching anybody. He speaks, and it is done;
          myriads of angels count themselves happy to fly at his command; and
          yet man has so become God's enemy that he will not be reconciled to
          him. God would make him his friend, and spends the blood of his dear
          Son to cement that friendship; but man will not have it. See the great
          God turns to beseeching his obstinate creature! his foolish creature!
          In this I feel a reverent compassion for God. Must he beseech a rebel
          to be forgiven? Do you hear it? Angels, do you hear it? He who is the
          King of kings veils his sovereignty, and stoops to beseeching his
          creature to be reconciled to him! I wonder not that some of my brethen
          start back from such an idea, and cannot believe that it could be so:
          it seems so derogatory to the glorious God. Yet my text saith it, and
          it must be true -- "As though God did beseech you by us." This makes
          it awful work to preach, does it not? I ought to beseech you as though
          God spoke to you through me, looking at you through these eyes, and
          stretching out his hands through these hands. He saith, "All day long
          I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying
          people." He speaks softly, and tenderly, and with paternal affection
          through these poor lips of mine, "as though God did beseech you by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore notice that next line, which if possible has even more
          force in it: "We pray you in Christ's stead." Since Jesus died in our
          stead we, his redeemed ones, are to pray others in his stead; and as
          he poured out his heart for sinners in their stead, we must in another
          way pour out our hearts for sinners in his stead. "We pray you in
          Christ's stead." Now if my Lord were here this morning how would he
          pray you to come to him? I wish, my Master, I were more fit to stand
          in thy place at this time. Forgive me that I am so incapable. Help me
          to break my heart, to think that it does not break as it ought to do,
          for these men and women who are determined to destroy themselves, and,
          therefore, pass thee by, my Lord, as though thou were but a common
          felon, hanging on a gibbet! O men, How can you think so little of the
          death of the Son of God? It is the wonder of time, the admiration of
          eternity. O souls, why will you refuse eternal life? Why will ye die?
          Why will ye despise him by whom alone you can live? There is one gate
          of life, that gate is the open side of Christ; why will ye not enter,
          and live? "Come unto me," saith he; "Come unto me." I think I hear him
          say it: "Come unto me all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
          give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek
          and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." I think I
          see him on that last day, the great day of the feast, standing and
          crying, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink." I hear
          him sweetly declare, "Him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out."
          I am not fit to pray you in Christ's stead, but I do pray you with all
          my heart. You that hear my voice from Sunday to Sunday, do come and
          accept the great sacrifice, and be reconciled to God. You that hear me
          but this once, I would like you to go away with this ringing in your
          ears, "Be ye reconciled to God." I have nothing pretty to say to you;
          I have only to declare that God has prepared a propitiation, and that
          now he entreats sinners to come to Jesus, that through him they may be
          reconciled to God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not exhort you to some impossible effort. We do not bid you do
          some great thing; we do not ask you for money or price; neither do we
          demand of you years of miserable feeling; but only this -- be ye
          reconciled. It is not so much reconcile yourselves as "be reconciled."
          Yield yourselves to him who round you now the bands of a man would
          cast, drawing you with cords of love because he was given for you. His
          spirit strives with you, yield to his striving. With Jacob you know
          there wrestled a man till the breaking of the day; let that man, that
          God-man, overcome you. Submit yourselves. Yield to grasp of those
          hands which were nailed to the cross for you. Will you not yield to
          your best friend? He that doth embrace you now presses you to a heart
          that was pierced with the spear on your behalf. Oh, yield thee! Yield
          thee, man! Dost thou not feel some softness stealing over thee? Steel
          not thine heart against it. He saith, with a Tone most still and
          sweet. "To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
          Believe and live! Quit the arch-enemy who has held thee in his grip.
          Escape for thy life, look not behind thee, stay not in all the plain,
          but flee where thou seest the open door of the great Father's house.
          At the gate the bleeding Saviour is waiting to receive thee, and to
          say, "I was made sin for thee, and thou art made the righteousness of
          God in me." Father, draw them! Father, draw them! Eternal Spirit, draw
          them, for Jesus Christ thy Son's sake! Amen.
