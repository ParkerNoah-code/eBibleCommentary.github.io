          The title to this psalm supplies the place of an argument; and, that
          others may be induced to engage in the praises of God, the Psalmist
          points out the manner of doing so by his own example. Then he gives a
          short account of the manifold benefits which, in olden times, he
          conferred upon the faithful, and is daily conferring upon them. The
          psalm is composed in alphabetical order, each verse containing two
          letters. The first verse begins with a, ' aleph, while the letter b, v
          beth, is placed at the commencement of the next half of the verse. The
          last two verses only are not divided into hemistiches; but each of
          these has three letters. If, however, any one will closely examine the
          contents, he will find that this has occurred through mistake or
          inadvertence; for if we make these two verses into three, the
          construction of the sentences corresponds very well one with another;
          and consequently, the transcribers have erred in not attending to the
          prophet's distinction.<br />
