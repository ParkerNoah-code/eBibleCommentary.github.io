          1. Praise Jehovah, because he is good: because his mercy endureth for
          ever.2. Let the redeemed of Jehovah say this, whom he hath redeemed
          out of the hand of the afflicted. 3. Whom he hath gathered out of the
          lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the
          south. 4. They wandered from the way in the solitary desert, they did
          not find a city of habitation.5. Both hungry and thirsty, so that
          their soul fainted within them.6. In their straits they called upon
          Jehovah, and he delivered them from all their afflictions.7. And he
          directed them by a right way, that they might come to a city of
          habitation.8. Let them praise the mercy of Jehovah in his prescience,
          and his marvelous works in the presence of the sons of men.9. Because
          he hath satisfied the longing soul, and hath filled the hungry soul
          with goodness.

          1 Praise Jehovah. We have already explained this verse, for it formed
          the commencement of the preceding psalm. And it appears that it was
          not only frequently used among the Jews, but also so incorporated with
          other psalms, that when one part of the chorus on the one side was
          singing a portion of the psalm, the other part of the chorus on the
          opposite side in its turn, after each succeeding verse, responded,
          Praise Jehovah, because he is good, etc The penman of this psalm,
          whoever he was, has, instead of the ordinary preface, inserted this
          beautiful sentiment, in which praise and thanksgiving to God were so
          frequently expressed by the Israelitish Church. Immediately he
          proceeds to speak more particularly. And first, he exhorts those to
          offer up a tribute of gratitude to God; who, after having been
          delivered from slavery and imprisonment, and after a long and painful
          journey, arrived in safety at their place of abode. These he calls the
          redeemed of God; because, in wandering through the trackless desert,
          and howling wilderness, they many a time would have been prevented
          from returning home, had not God, as it were, with his outstretched
          hand, appeared as their guard and their guide. He does not here refer
          to travelers indiscriminately, but to such as either by hostile power,
          or by any other kind of violence, or by stern necessity, having been
          banished to distant regions, felt themselves to be in the midst of
          imminent dangers; or it may be, that he refers to those who had been
          made prisoners by enemies, pirates, or other robbers. He reminds them
          that it was by no casual occurrence that they had been driven about in
          that manner, and had been brought back to their native country, but
          that all their wanderings had been under the superintending providence
          of God.

          But the second verse might be conjoined with the first, as if the
          prophet were commanding the persons whom he was addressing to sing
          this celebrated ode. It may with equal propriety be read by itself
          thus: Let the redeemed of Jehovah, who have returned from captivity to
          their own land, come forth now, and take part in the celebration of
          God's praises, and let them publish his loving-kindness which they
          have experienced in their deliverance. Among the Jews, who had
          occasion to undertake extensive journeys, such occurrences as these
          were very common; because they could hardly leave their own land,
          without from all quarters encountering ways rugged, and difficult, and
          perilous; and the same observation is equally applicable to mankind in
          general. He reminds them how often they wandered and turned aside from
          the right way, and found no place of shelter; a thing by no means rare
          in these lonely deserts. Were a person to enter a forest without any
          knowledge of the proper direction, he would, in the course of his
          wandering, be in danger of becoming the prey of lions and wolves. He
          has, however, particularly in his eye those who, finding themselves
          unexpectedly in desert places, are also in danger of perishing for
          hunger and thirst. For it is certain that such persons are hourly in
          hazard of death, unless the Lord come to their rescue.

          6 In their straits they called upon Jehovah The verbs are here in the
          past tense, and according to grammarians, represent a continued
          action. The meaning therefore is, that those who are wandering in
          desert places are often pinched with hunger and thirst in consequence
          of finding no place in which to lodge; and who, when all hope of
          deliverance fails them, then cry unto God. Doubtless, God grants
          deliverance to many when in straits, even though they do not present
          their supplications to Him for aid; and hence it was not so much the
          design of the prophet in this passage to extol the faith of the pious,
          who call upon God with all their heart, as to describe the common
          feelings of humanity. There may be not a few whose hope does not
          center on God, who, nevertheless, are constrained, by some invisible
          disposition of mind, to come to Him, when under the pressure of dire
          necessity. And this is the plan which God sometimes pursues, in order
          to extort from such persons the acknowledgement that deliverance is to
          be sought for from no other quarter than from Himself alone; and even
          the ungodly, who, while living voluptuously, scoff at Him, he
          constrains, in spite of themselves, to invoke his name. It has been
          customary in all ages for heathens, who look upon religion as a fable,
          when compelled by stern necessity, to call upon God for help. Did they
          do so in jest? By no means; it was by a secret natural instinct that
          they were led to reverence God's name, which formerly they held in
          derision. The Spirit of God, therefore, in my opinion, here narrates
          what frequently takes place, namely, that persons destitute of piety
          and faith, and who have no desire to have any thing to do with God, if
          placed in perilous circumstances, are constrained by natural instinct,
          and without any proper conception of what they are doing, to call on
          the name of God. Since it is only in dubious and desperate cases that
          they betake themselves to God, this acknowledgement which they make of
          their helplessness is a palpable proof of their stupidity, that in the
          season of peace and tranquillity they neglect him, so much are they
          then under the intoxicating influence of their own prosperity; and
          notwithstanding that the germ of piety is planted in their hearts,
          they nevertheless never dream of learning wisdom, unless when driven
          by the dint of adversity; I mean, to learn the wisdom of acknowledging
          that there is a God in heaven who directs every event. It is
          unnecessary to allude here to the sarcastic retort of the ancient
          buffoon, who, on entering a temple, and beholding a number of tablets
          which several merchants had suspended there as memorials of their
          having escaped shipwreck, through the kind interposition of the gods,
          smartly and facetiously remarked, "But the deaths of those who have
          been drowned are not enumerated, the number of which is innumerable."
          Perhaps he might have some just cause for scoffing in this manner at
          such idols. But even if a hundredfold more were drowned in the sea
          than safely reach the harbour, this does not in the least degree
          detract from the glory of the goodness of God, who, while he is
          merciful, is at the same time also just, so that the dispensing of the
          one does not interfere with the exercise of the other. The same
          observation applies to travelers that stray from the path, and wander
          up and down in the desert. If many of them perish for hunger and
          thirst, if many are devoured by wild animals, if many die from cold,
          these are nothing else than so many tokens of the judgments of God,
          which he designs for our consideration. From which we infer that the
          same thing would happen to all men, were it not the will of God to
          save a portion of them; and thus interposing as a judge between them,
          he preserves some for the sake of showing his mercy, and pours out his
          judgments upon others to declare his justice. The prophet, therefore,
          very properly adds, that by the hand of God they were led into the
          right way, where they may find a suitable place for lodging; and
          consequently he exhorts them to render thanks to God for this
          manifestation of his goodness. And with the view of enhancing the
          loving-kindness of God, he connects his wondrous works with his mercy;
          as if he should say, in this kind interposition, God's grace is too
          manifest, either to be unperceived or unacknowledged by all; and for
          those who have been the subjects of such a remarkable deliverance, to
          remain silent regarding it, would be nothing less than an impious
          attempt to suppress the wonderful doings of God, an attempt equally
          vain with that of endeavoring to trample under their feet the light of
          the sun. For what else can be said of us, seeing that our natural
          instinct drives us to God for help, when we are in perplexity and
          peril; and when, after being rescued, we forthwith forget him, who
          will deny that his glory is, as it were, obscured by our wickedness
          and ingratitude?<br />
