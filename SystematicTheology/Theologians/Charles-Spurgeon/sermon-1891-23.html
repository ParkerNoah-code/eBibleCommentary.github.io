          1. It happens that their tradition respecting redemption is invisible
          and incomprehensible, as being the mother of things which are
          incomprehensible and invisible; and on this account, since it is
          fluctuating, it is impossible simply and all at once to make known its
          nature, for every one of them hands it down just as his own
          inclination prompts. Thus there are as many schemes of "redemption" as
          there are teachers of these mystical opinions. And when we come to
          refute them, we shall show in its fitting-place, that this class of
          men have been instigated by Satan to a denial of that baptism which is
          regeneration to God, and thus to a renunciation of the whole
          [Christian] faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. They maintain that those who have attained to perfect knowledge
          must of necessity be regenerated into that power which is above all.
          For it is otherwise impossible to find admittance within the Pleroma,
          since this [regeneration] it is which leads them down into the depths
          of Bythus. For the baptism instituted by the visible Jesus was for the
          remission of sins, but the redemption brought in by that Christ who
          descended upon Him, was for perfection; and they allege that the
          former is animal, but the latter spiritual. And the baptism of John
          was proclaimed with a view to repentance, but the redemption by Jesus
          was brought in for the sake of perfection. And to this He refers when
          He says, "And I have another baptism to be baptized with, and I hasten
          eagerly towards it." Moreover, they affirm that the Lord added this
          redemption to the sons of Zebedee, when their mother asked that they
          might sit, the one on His right hand, and the other on His left, in
          His kingdom, saying, "Can ye be baptized with the baptism which I
          shall be baptized with?" Paul, too, they declare, has often set forth,
          in express terms, the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; and this
          was the same which is handed down by them in so varied and discordant
          forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For some of them prepare a nuptial couch, and perform a sort of
          mystic rite (pronouncing certain expressions) with those who are being
          initiated, and affirm that it is a spiritual marriage which is
          celebrated by them, after the likeness of the conjunctions above.
          Others, again, lead them to a place where water is, and baptize them,
          with the utterance of these words, "Into the name of the unknown
          Father of the universe -- into truth, the mother of all things -- into
          Him who descended on Jesus -- into union, and redemption, and
          communion with the powers." Others still repeat certain Hebrew words,
          in order the more thoroughly to bewilder those who are being
          initiated, as follows: "Basema, Chamosse, Baoenaora, Mistadia, Ruada,
          Kousta, Babaphor, Kalachthei." The interpretation of these terms runs
          thus: "I invoke that which is above every power of the Father, which
          is called light, and good Spirit, and life, because Thou hast reigned
          in the body." Others, again, set forth the redemption thus: The name
          which is hidden from every deity, and dominion, and truth which Jesus
          of Nazareth was clothed with in the lives of the light of Christ -- of
          Christ, who lives by the Holy Ghost, for the angelic redemption. The
          name of restitution stands thus: Messia, Uphareg, Namempsoeman,
          Chaldoeaur, Mosomedoea, Acphranoe, Psaua, Jesus Nazaria. The
          interpretation of these words is as follows: "I do not divide the
          Spirit of Christ, neither the heart nor the supercelestial power which
          is merciful; may I enjoy Thy name, O Saviour of truth!" Such are words
          of the initiators; but he who is initiated, replies, "I am
          established, and I am redeemed; I redeem my soul from this age
          (world), and from all things connected with it in the name of Iao, who
          redeemed his own soul into redemption in Christ who liveth." Then the
          bystanders add these words, "Peace be to all on whom this name rests."
          After this they anoint the initiated person with balsam; for they
          assert that this unguent is a type of that sweet odour which is above
          all things.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But there are some of them who assert that it is superfluous to
          bring persons to the water, but mixing oil and water together, they
          place this mixture on the heads of those who are to be initiated, with
          the use of some such expressions as we have already mentioned. And
          this they maintain to be the redemption. They, too, are accustomed to
          anoint with balsam. Others, however, reject all these practices, and
          maintain that the mystery of the unspeakable and invisible power ought
          not to be performed by visible and corruptible creatures, nor should
          that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and
          beyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects
          of sense, and possessed of a body. These hold that the knowledge of
          the unspeakable Greatness is itself perfect redemption. For since both
          defect and passion flowed from ignorance, the whole substance of what
          was thus formed is destroyed by knowledge; and therefore knowledge is
          the redemption of the inner man. This, however, is not of a corporeal
          nature, for the body is corruptible; nor is it animal, since the
          animal soul is the fruit of a defect, and is, as it were, the abode of
          the spirit. The redemption must therefore be of a spiritual nature;
          for they affirm that the inner and spiritual man is redeemed by means
          of knowledge, and that they, having acquired the knowledge of all
          things, stand thenceforth in need of nothing else. This, then, is the
          true redemption.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Others still there are who continue to redeem persons even up to
          the moment of death, by placing on their heads oil and water, or the
          pre-mentioned ointment with water, using at the same time the
          above-named invocations, that the persons referred to may become
          incapable of being seized or seen by the principalities and powers,
          and that their inner man may ascend on high in an invisible manner, as
          if their body were left among created things in this world, while
          their soul is sent forward to the Demiurge. And they instruct them, on
          their reaching the principalities and powers, to make use of these
          words: "I am a son from the Father -- the Father who had a
          pre-existence, and a son in Him who is pre-existent. I have come to
          behold all things, both those which belong to myself and others,
          although, strictly speaking, they do not belong to others, but to
          Achamoth, who is female in nature, and made these things for herself.
          For I derive being from Him who is pre-existent, and I come again to
          my own place whence I went forth." And they affirm that, by saying
          these things, he escapes from the powers. He then advances to the
          companions of the Demiurge, and thus addresses them: -- "I am a vessel
          more precious than the female who formed you. If your mother is
          ignorant of her own descent, I know myself, and am aware whence I am,
          and I call upon the incorruptible Sophia, who is in the Father, and is
          the mother of your mother, who has no father, nor any male consort;
          but a female springing from a female formed you, while ignorant of her
          own mother, and imagining that she alone existed; but I call upon her
          mother." And they declare, that when the companions of the Demiurge
          hear these words, they are greatly agitated, and upbraid their origin
          and the race of their mother. But he goes into his own place, having
          thrown [off] his chain, that is, his animal nature. These, then, are
          the particulars which have reached us respecting "redemption." But
          since they differ so widely among themselves both as respects doctrine
          and tradition, and since those of them who are recognised as being
          most modern make it their effort daily to invent some new opinion, and
          to bring out what no one ever before thought of, it is a difficult
          matter to describe all their opinions.
