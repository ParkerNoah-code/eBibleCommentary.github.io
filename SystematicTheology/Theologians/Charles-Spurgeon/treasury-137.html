<p align="justify">TITLE. A Song of Degrees of David. It is both <i>by </i>
    David and <i>of </i>David: he is the author and the subject of it, and many 
    incidents of his life may be employed to illustrate it. Comparing all the 
    Psalms to gems, we would liken this to a pearl—how beautifully it will adorn 
    the neck of patience. <i>It is one of the shortest Psalms to read, but one 
    of the longest to learn</i>. It speaks of a young child, but it contains the 
    experience of a man in Christ. Lowliness and humility are here seen in 
    connection with a sanctified heart, a will subdued to the mind of God, and a 
    hope looking to the Lord alone happy is the man who can without falsehood 
    use these words as his own; for he wears about him the likeness of his Lord, 
    who said, "I am meek and lowly in heart." </p>
<p align="justify">The Psalm is in advance of all the Songs of Degrees which 
    have preceded it; for loveliness is one of the highest attainments in the 
    divine life. There are also steps in this Song of Degrees: it is a short 
    ladder, if we count the words; but yet it rises to a great height, reaching 
    from deep humility to fixed confidence. LeBlanc thinks that this is a song 
    of the Israelites who returned from Babylon with, humble hearts, weaned from 
    their idols. At any rate, after any spiritual captivity let it be the 
    expression of our hearts.<br/>

<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. LORD, my heart is not haughty.</p></b> The Psalm 
    deals with the Lord, and is a solitary colloquy with him, not a discourse 
    before men. <i>We have a sufficient audience when we speak with the Lord, 
    and we may say to him many things which were not proper for the ears of men.
    </i>The holy man makes his appeal to Jehovah, who alone knows the heart: a 
    man should be slow to do this upon any matter, for the Lord is not to be 
    trifled with; and when anyone ventures on such an appeal he should be sure 
    of his case.
<p align="justify">He begins with <i>his heart, for that is the center of 
    our nature, and if pride be there it defiles everything</i>; just as mire in 
    the spring causes mud in all the streams. It is a grand thing for a man to 
    know his own heart so as to be able to speak before the Lord about it. <i>It 
    is beyond all things deceitful and desperately wicked, who can know it? </i>
    Who can know it unless taught by the Spirit of God? It is a still greater 
    thing if, upon searching himself thoroughly, a man can solemnly protest unto 
    the Omniscient One that his heart is not haughty: that is to say, neither 
    proud in his opinion of himself, contemptuous to others, nor self-righteous 
    before the Lord; neither boastful of the past, proud of the present, nor 
    ambitious for the future. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Nor my eyes lofty.</p></b> What the heart desires, the eyes 
    look for. Where the desires run, the glances usually follow. This holy man 
    felt that he did not seek after elevated places where he might gratify his 
    self-esteem, neither did he look down upon others as being his inferiors.
    
<p align="justify">A proud look the Lord hates; and in this all men are 
    agreed with him; yes, even the proud themselves hate haughtiness in the 
    gestures of others. Lofty eyes are so generally hateful that haughty men 
    have been known to avoid the manners natural to the proud in order to escape 
    the ill will of their fellows. </p>
<p align="justify">The pride which apes humility always takes care to cast 
    its eyes downward, since every man's consciousness tells him that 
    contemptuous glances are the sure ensigns of a boastful spirit. In Psalm 121 
    David lifted up his eyes to the hills; but here he declares that they were 
    not lifted up in any other sense. <i>When the heart is right, and the eyes 
    are right, the whole man is on the road to a holy and happy condition. </i>
    Let us take care that we do not use the language of this Psalm unless, 
    indeed, it be true as to ourselves; for <i>there is no worse pride than that 
    which claims humility when it does not possess it.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Neither do I exercise myself in great matters.</p></b> As a
    <i>private </i>man he did not usurp the power of the king or devise plots 
    against him: he minded his own business, and left others to mind theirs. As 
    a <i>thoughtful </i>man he did not pry into things unrevealed; he was not 
    speculative, self-conceited or opinionated. As a <i>secular </i>person he 
    did not thrust himself into the priesthood as Saul had done before him, and 
    as Uzziah did after him.
<p align="justify">It is well so to exercise ourselves unto godliness that 
    we <i>know our true sphere, and diligently keep to it. </i>Many through 
    wishing to be great, have failed to be good: they were not content to adorn 
    the lowly stations which the Lord appointed them, and so they have rushed at 
    grandeur and power, and found destruction where they looked for honor. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Or in things too high for me.</p></b> High things may suit 
    others who are of greater stature, and yet they may be quite unfit for us. A 
    man does well to know his own size. Ascertaining his own capacity, he will 
    be foolish if he aims at that which is beyond his reach, straining himself, 
    and thus injuring himself.
<p align="justify">Such is the vanity of many men that if a work be within 
    their range they despise it, and think it beneath them: the only service 
    which they are willing to undertake is that to which they have never been 
    called, and for which they are by no means qualified. </p>
<p align="justify">What a haughty heart must he have, who will not serve God 
    at all unless he may be trusted with five talents at the least! His looks 
    are indeed lofty who disdains to be a light among his poor friends and 
    neighbors here below, but demands to be created a star of the first 
    magnitude to shine among the upper ranks, and to be admired by gazing 
    crowds. </p>
<p align="justify">It is just on God's part, that those who wish to be 
    everything should end in being nothing. It is a righteous retribution from 
    God when every matter turns out to be too great for the man who would only 
    handle great matters, and everything proves to be too high for the man who 
    exercised himself in things too high for him. </p>
<p align="justify">Lord, make us lowly, keep us lowly, fix us forever in 
    lowliness. Help us to be in such a case that the confession of this verse 
    may come from our lips as a truthful utterance which we dare make before the 
    Judge of all the earth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and 
    for ever.</p></b> See how lovingly a man who is weaned from self thinks of 
    others! David thinks of his people, and loses himself in his care for 
    Israel. How he prizes the grace of hope! He has given up the things which 
    are seen, and therefore <i>he values the treasures which are not seen except 
    by the eyes of hope</i>. There is room for the largest hope when <i>self </i>
    is gone, ground for eternal hope when transient things no longer hold the 
    mastery of our spirits. 
<p align="justify">This verse is the lesson of experience: a man of God who 
    had been taught to renounce the world and live upon the Lord alone, here 
    exhorts all his friends and companions to do the same. He found it a blessed 
    thing to live by hope, and therefore he would have all his kinsmen do the 
    same. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Let all the nation hope, let all their hope be in Jehovah</p></b>, 
    let them at once begin hoping <b>"from henceforth"</b>, and let them 
    continue hoping<b> "forever."</b> Weaning takes the child out of a temporary 
    condition into a state in which he will continue for the rest of his life. 
    Just so, to rise above the world is to enter upon a heavenly existence which 
    can never end. When we cease to hanker for the world we begin hoping in the 
    Lord. O Lord, as a parent weans a child, so do you wean me, and then shall I 
    fix all my hope on you alone.
