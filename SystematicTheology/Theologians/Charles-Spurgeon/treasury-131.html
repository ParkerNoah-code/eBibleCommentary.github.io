<p align="justify">Title. A Song of Degrees. Another step is taken in the 
    ascent, another station in the pilgrimage is reached: certainly a rise in 
    the sense is here perceptible, since full assurance concerning years to come 
    is a higher form of faith than the ascription of former escapes to the Lord. 
    Faith has praised Jehovah for <i>past </i>deliverances, and here she rises 
    to a confident joy in the <i>present </i>and <i>future </i>safety of 
    believers. She asserts that they shall forever be secure who trust 
    themselves with the Lord. We can imagine the pilgrims chanting this song 
    when perambulating the city walls.</p>
<p align="justify">We do not assert that David wrote this Psalm, but we have 
    as much ground for doing so as others have for declaring that it was written 
    after the captivity. It would seem probable that all the Pilgrim Psalms were 
    composed, or, at least, compiled by the same writer, and as some of them are 
    certainly by David, there is no conclusive reason for taking away the rest 
    from him.</p>
<p align="justify">Division. <br/>
    First we have a song of holy confidence (Psalm 125:1, 19 125:2); <br/>
    then a promise, Psalm 125:3; <br/>
    followed by a prayer, Psalm 125:4; <br/>
    and a note of warning. </p>
<p align="justify">1 They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, 
    which cannot be removed, but abides forever.</p>
<p align="justify">2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord 
    is round about his people from henceforth even forever.</p>
<p align="justify">3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot 
    of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</p>
<p align="justify">4 Do good, O Lord, unto those that are good, and to those 
    who are upright in their hearts.</p>
<p align="justify">5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the

    EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 125:1<br/>
    "They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion."</p></b> The emphasis lies 
    upon the object of their trust, namely, Jehovah the Lord. <i>What a 
    privilege to be allowed to repose in God! </i>How condescending is Jehovah 
    to become the confidence of his people! To trust elsewhere is vanity; and 
    the more implicit such misplaced trust becomes the more bitter will be the 
    ensuing disappointment; but to trust in the living God is <i>sanctified 
    common sense </i>which needs no excuse, its result shall be its best 
    vindication. There is no conceivable reason why we should not trust in 
    Jehovah, and there is every possible argument for so doing; but, apart from 
    all argument, the end will prove the wisdom of the confidence. 
<p align="justify">The result of faith is not occasional and accidental; its 
    blessing comes, not to <i>some </i>who trust, but to <i>all </i>who trust in 
    the Lord. Trusters in Jehovah shall be as fixed, firm, and stable as the 
    mount where David dwelt; and where the ark abode. To move mount Zion was 
    impossible, the mere supposition was absurd.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Which cannot be removed, but abides forever." </p></b>Zion 
    was the image of eternal steadfastness—this hill which, according to the 
    Hebrew, "sits to eternity," neither bowing down nor moving to and fro. Thus 
    does the trusting worshiper of Jehovah enjoy a restfulness which is the 
    mirror of tranquility; and this not without cause, for his hope is sure, and 
    of his confidence he can never be ashamed. 
<p align="justify">As the Lord sits King forever, so do his people sit 
    enthroned in perfect peace when their trust in him is firm. This is, and is 
    to be our portion; we <i>are</i>, we <i>have </i>been, we <i>shall </i>be as 
    steadfast as the hill of God. Zion cannot be removed, and does not remove; 
    so the people of God can neither be moved passively nor actively, by force 
    from without or fickleness from within. Faith in God is a settling and 
    establishing virtue; he who by his strength sets fast the mountains, by that 
    same power stays the hearts of them that trust in him. This steadfastness 
    will endure "forever," and we may be assured therefore that <i>no true 
    believer shall perish either in life or in death, in time or in eternity. We 
    trust in an eternal God, and our safety shall be eternal.</i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 125:2<br/>
    "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his 
    people from hence forth even forever." </p></b>The hill of Zion is the type of 
    the believer's constancy, and the surrounding mountains are made emblems of 
    the all-surrounding presence of the Lord. The mountains around the holy 
    city, though they do not make a circular wall, are, nevertheless, set like 
    sentinels to guard her gates. God does not enclose his people within 
    ramparts and bulwarks, making their city to be a prison; but yet he so 
    orders the arrangements of his providence that his saints are as safe as if 
    they dwelt behind the strongest fortifications. 
<p align="justify">What a double security are verses 1-2! First, we are 
    established, and then entrenched: settled, and then sentineled: made like a 
    mount, and then protected as if by mountains. This is no matter of poetry, 
    it is so in fact; and it is no matter of temporary privilege, but it shall 
    be so forever. </p>
<p align="justify">Date when we please, "from henceforth" Jehovah encircles 
    his people: look on us as far as we please, the protection extends "even 
    forever." </p>
<p align="justify">Note, it is not said that Jehovah's power or wisdom 
    defends believers, but <i>he himself </i>is round about them: they have his 
    person for their protection, his Godhead for their guard. We are here taught 
    that the Lord's people are those who trust him, for they are thus described 
    in the first verses: the line of faith is the line of grace, those who trust 
    in the Lord are chosen of the Lord. Verses 1-2 together prove the eternal 
    safety of the saints: they must abide where God has placed them, and God 
    must forever protect them from all evil. It would be difficult to imagine 
    greater safety than is here set forth.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 125:3<br/>
    "For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous."
    </p></b>The people of God are not to expect immunity from trial because the Lord 
    surrounds them, for they may feel the power and persecution of the ungodly. 
    Isaac, even in Abraham's family, was mocked by Ishmael. Assyria laid its 
    scepter even upon Zion itself. 
<p align="justify">The graceless often bear rule and wield the rod; and when 
    they do so they are pretty sure to make it fall heavily upon the Lord's 
    believing people, so that the godly cry out by reason of their oppressors. 
    Egypt's rod was exceeding heavy upon Israel, but the time came for it to be 
    broken. <i>God has set a limit to the woes of his chosen people, the rod may 
    light on their portion, but it shall not rest upon it. </i>The righteous 
    have a lot which none can take from them, for God has appointed them heirs 
    of it by gracious entail: on that lot the rod of the wicked may fall, but 
    over that lot it cannot have lasting sway. The saints abide forever, but 
    their troubles will not. Here is a good argument in prayer for all righteous 
    ones who are in the hands of the wicked.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity."
    </p></b>The tendency of oppression is to drive the best of men into some hasty 
    deed for self-deliverance or vengeance. If the rack be too long used the 
    patient sufferer may at last give way; and therefore the Lord puts a limit 
    to the tyranny of the wicked. 
<p align="justify">He ordained that an Israelite who deserved punishment 
    should not be beaten without measure—forty stripes save one was the 
    appointed limit. We may therefore expect that <i>he will set a bound to the 
    suffering of the innocent, and will not allow them to be pushed to the 
    uttermost extreme. </i>Especially in point of time he will limit the 
    domination of the persecutor, for length adds strength to oppression, and 
    makes it intolerable. Hence the Lord himself said of a certain tribulation, 
    "except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved; but 
    for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened."</p>
<p align="justify">It seems that even righteous men are in peril of sinning 
    in evil days, and that it is not the will of the Lord that they should yield 
    to the stress of the times in order to escape from suffering. The power and 
    influence of wicked men when they are uppermost are used to lead or drive 
    the righteous astray; but the godly must not accept this as an excuse, and 
    yield to the evil pressure; far rather must they resist with all their might 
    until it shall please God to stay the violence of the persecutor, and give 
    his children rest. This the Lord here promises to do in due time.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 125:4<br/>
    "Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in 
    their hearts."</p></b> <i>Men to be good at all, must be good at heart. </i>
    Those who trust in the Lord are good; for faith is the root of 
    righteousness, and the evidence of uprightness. Faith in God is a good and 
    upright thing, and its influence makes the rest of the man good and upright. 
    To such God will do good: the prayer of the text is but another form of 
    promise, for that which the Lord prompts us to ask, he virtually promises to 
    give. Jehovah will take off evil from his people, and in the place thereof 
    will enrich them with all manner of good. When the rod of the wicked is gone 
    his own rod and staff shall comfort us. Meanwhile it is for us to pray that 
    it may be well with all the upright who are now among men. God bless them, 
    and do them good in every possible form. We wish well to those who do well. 
    We are so plagued by the crooked that we would pour blessings upon the 
    upright.
<b>
<p align="justify">Psalm 125:5<br/>
    "As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them 
    forth with the workers of iniquity."</p></b> Two kinds of men are always to be 
    found, the upright and the men of crooked ways. Alas, there are some who 
    pass from one class to another, not by a happy conversion, turning from the 
    twisting lanes of deceit into the highway of truth—but by an unhappy 
    declension leaving the main road of honesty and holiness for the bypaths of 
    wickedness. Such <i>apostates </i>have been seen in all ages, and David knew 
    enough of them; he could never forget Saul, and Ahithophel, and others. How 
    sad that men who once walked in the right way should turn aside from it! 
<p align="justify">Observe the course of the false-hearted: first, they <i>
    look </i>out for crooked ways; next, they <i>choose </i>them and make them 
    "their crooked ways"; and then they <i>turn aside </i>into them. They never 
    intend to go back unto perdition, but only to make a curve and drop into the 
    right road again. The straight way becomes a little difficult, and so they 
    make a circumnavigation, which all along aims at coming out right, though it 
    may a little deviate from precision. </p>
<p align="justify">These people are neither upright in heart, nor good, nor 
    trusters in Jehovah, and therefore the Lord will deal otherwise with them 
    than with his own people: when execution day comes these hypocrites and 
    time-servers shall be led out to the same gallows as the openly wicked. All 
    sin will one day be expelled from the universe, even as criminals condemned 
    to die are led out of the city; then shall secret traitors find themselves 
    rejected with open rebels. Divine truth will unveil their hidden pursuits, 
    and lead them forth, and to the surprise of many they shall be set in the 
    same rank with those who avowedly wrought iniquity.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"But peace shall be upon Israel."</p></b> In fact the 
    execution of the deceivers shall tend to give the true Israel peace. When 
    God is smiting the unfaithful, not a blow shall fall upon the faithful. The 
    chosen of the Lord shall not only be like Salem, but they shall have salem, 
    or peace. Like a prince, Israel has prevailed with God, and therefore he 
    need not fear the face of man; his wrestlings are over, the blessing of 
    peace has been pronounced upon him. He who has peace with God, may enjoy 
    peace concerning all things.
<p align="justify">Bind the first and last verses together: Israel <i>trusts
    </i>in the Lord (verse 1), and Israel has <i>peace </i>(verse 5). </p>
