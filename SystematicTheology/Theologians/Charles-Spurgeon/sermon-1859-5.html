        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.229)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, December 19th, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"We love him, because he first loved us." -- 1 John 4:19.</p>
        <p>
          DURING the last two Sabbath days I have been preaching the gospel to
          the unconverted. I have earnestly exhorted the very chief of sinners
          to look to Jesus Christ, and have assured them that as a preparation
          for coming to Christ, they need no good works, or good dispositions,
          but that they may come, just as they are, to the foot of the cross,
          and receive the pardoning blood and all-sufficient merits of the Lord
          Jesus Christ. The thought has since occurred to me, that some who were
          ignorant of the gospel might, perhaps, put this query: -- Is this
          likely to promote morality? If the gospel be a proclamation of pardon
          to the very chief of sinners, will not this be a license to sin? In
          what respects can the gospel be said to be a gospel according to
          holiness? How will such preaching operate? Will it make men better?
          Will they be more attentive to the laws which relate to man and man?
          Will they be more obedient to the statutes which relate to man and
          God? I thought, therefore, that we would advance a step further, and
          endeavour to show, this morning, how the proclamation of the gospel of
          God, though in the commencement it addresses itself to men who are
          utterly destitute of any good, is, nevertheless, designed to lead
          these very men to the noblest heights of virtue, yea, to ultimate
          perfection in holiness. The text tells us, that the effect of the
          gospel received in the heart is, that it compels and constrains such a
          heart to love God. "We love him, because he first loved us." When the
          gospel comes to us it does not find us loving God, it does not expect
          anything of us, but coming with the divine application of the Holy
          Ghost, it simply assures us that God loves us, be we never so deeply
          immersed in sin; and then, the after effect of this proclamation of
          love is, that "we love him because he first loved us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Can you imagine a being placed halfway between this world and heaven?
          Can you conceive of him as having such enlarged capacities that he
          could easily discern what was done in heaven, and what was done on
          earth? I can conceive that, before the Fall, if there had been such a
          being, he would have been struck with the singular harmony which
          existed between God's great world, called heaven, and the little
          world, the earth. Whenever the chimes of heaven rang, the great note
          of those massive bells was love; and when the little bells of earth
          were sounded, the harmonies of this narrow sphere, rang out their
          note, it was just the same -- love. When the bright spirits gathered
          around the great throne of God in heaven to magnify the Lord, at the
          same time, there was to be seen the world, clad in its priestly
          garments, offering its sacrifice of purest praise. When the cherubim
          and seraphim did continually cry, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
          armies," there was heard a note, feebler, perhaps, but yet as sweetly
          musical, coming up from paradise, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
          armies." There was no jar, no discord; the thunder peals of heaven's
          melodies were exactly in accord with the whispers of earth's
          harmonies. There was "glory to God in the highest," and on earth there
          was glory too; the heart of man was as the heart of God; God loved
          man, and man loved God. But imagine that same great Spirit to be still
          standing between the heavens and the earth, how sad must he be, when
          he hears the jarring discard, and feels it grate upon the ear! The
          Lord saith, "I am reconciled to thee, I have put away thy sin;" but
          what is the answer of this earth? The answer of the world is, "Man is
          at enmity with God: God may be reconciled, but man is not. The mass of
          men are still enemies to God by wicked works." When the angels praise
          God, if they list to the sounds that are to be heard on earth, they
          hear the trump of cruel war; they hear the bacchanalian shout and the
          song of the lascivious, and what a discord is this in the great
          harmony of the spheres? The fact is this, -- the world was originally
          one great string in the harp of the universe, and when the Almighty
          swept that harp with his gracious fingers there was nothing to be
          heard but praise; now that string is snapped, and where it has been
          reset by grace, still it is not wholly restored to its perfect tune,
          and the note that cometh from it hath but little of sweetness, and
          very much of discord. But, bright Spirit, retain thy place, and live
          on. The day is hastening with glowing wheels, and the axle thereof is
          hot with speed. The day is coming, when this world shall be a paradise
          again. Jesus Christ, who came the first time to bleed and suffer, that
          he might wash the world from its iniquity, is coming a second time to
          reign and conquer, that he may clothe the earth with glory; and the
          day shall arrive, when thou, O Spirit, shall hear again the
          everlasting harmony. Once more the bells of earth shall be attuned to
          the melodies of heaven; once more shall the eternal chorus find that
          no singer is absent, but that the music is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how is this to be? How is the world to be brought back? How is it
          to be restored? We answer, the reason why there was this original
          harmony between earth and heaven was, because there was love between
          them twain, and our great reason for hoping that there shall be at
          last re-established an undiscordant harmony between heaven and earth
          is simply this, that God hath already manifested his love towards us,
          and that in return, hearts touched by his grace do even now love him;
          and when they shall be multiplied, and love re-established, then shall
          the harmony be complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having thus introduced my text, I must now plunge into it. We shall
          notice the parentage, the nourishment, and the walk of love; and shall
          exhort all believers here present, to love God, because he hath first
          loved them.
        </p>
        <p>1. In the first place,</p>
        <p>THE PARENTAGE OF TRUE LOVE TO GOD</p>
        <p>"What though the spicy breezes blow soft o'er Java's isle;</p>
        <p>Where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile."</p>
        <p>
          Where God is most resplendent in his works, and most lavish in his
          gifts, there man has been the vilest and God is the most forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others have taught, if not exactly in doctrine, yet their doctrine
          necessarily leads to it, that human nature may of itself attain unto
          love to God. Our simple reply is, we have never met with such an
          instance. We have curiously questioned the people of God, and we
          believe that others have questioned them in every age, but we have
          never had but one answer to this question, "Why hast thou loved God?"
          The only answer has been, "Because he first loved me." I have heard
          men preach about free-will, but I never yet heard of a Christian who
          exalted free-will in his own experience. I have heard men say, that
          men of their own free-will may turn to God, believe, repent, and love,
          but I have heard the same persons, when talking of their own
          experience, say, that they did not so turn to God, but that Jesus
          sought them when they were strangers, wandering from the fold of God.
          The whole matter may look specious enough, when preached, but when
          felt it is found to be a phantom. It may seem right enough for a man
          to tell his fellow that his own free-will may save him; but when he
          comes to close dealing with his own conscience, he himself, however
          wild in his doctrine, is compelled to say, "Oh! yes, I do love Jesus,
          because he first loved me." I have wondered at a Wesleyan brother, who
          has sometimes railed against this doctrine in the pulpit, and then has
          given out this very hymn, and all the members of the church have
          joined in singing it most heartily, while at the same time they were
          tolling the death-knell of their own peculiar tenets; for if that hymn
          be true Arminianism must be false. If it be the certain fact, that the
          only reason for our loving God is that his love has been shed abroad
          in our hearts, then it cannot be true anyhow, that man ever did or
          ever will love God, until first of all God has manifested his love
          towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But without disputing any longer, do we not all admit that our love to
          God is the sweet offspring of God's love to us? Ah! beloved, cold
          admiration every man may have; but the warmth of love can only be
          kindled by the fires of God's Spirit. Let each Christian speak for
          himself, we shall all hold this great and cardinal truth, that the
          reason of our love to God is, the sweet influence of his grace.
          Sometimes I wonder that such as we should have been brought to love
          God at all. Is our love so precious that God should court our love,
          dressed in the crimson robes of a dying Redeemer? If we had loved God,
          it would have been no more than he deserved. But when we rebelled, and
          yet he sought our love, it was surprising indeed. It was a wonder when
          he disrobed himself of all his splendours, and came down and wrapt
          himself in a mantle of clay; but methinks the wonder is excelled yet,
          for after he had died for us, still we did not love him; we rebelled
          against him; we rejected the proclamation of the gospel; we resisted
          his Spirit; but he said, I will have their hearts; and he followed us
          day after day, hour after hour. Sometimes he laid us low, and he said,
          "Surely they will love me if I restore them!" At another time he
          filled us with corn and with wine, and he said "Surely they will love
          me now," but we still revolted, still rebelled. At last he said, "I
          will strive no longer, I am Almighty, and I will not have it that a
          human heart is stronger than I am. I turn the will of man as the
          rivers of water are turned," and lo! he put forth his strength, and in
          an instant the current changed, and we loved him, because we then
          could see the love of God, in that he sent his Son to be our Redeemer.
          But we must confess, beloved, going back to the truth with which we
          started, that never should we have had any love towards God, unless
          that love had been sown in us by the sweet seed of his love to us. If
          there be any one here that hath a love to Christ, let him differ from
          this doctrine here, but let him know that he shall not differ
          hereafter; for in heaven they all sing, praise to free grace. They all
          sing, "Salvation to our God and to the Lamb."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Love, then, has for its parent the love of God shed abroad in our
          hearts. But after it is divinely born in our heart it must be divinely
        </p>
        <p>NOURISHED</p>
        <p>
          The first thing, then, that our love feeds upon, when it is but an
          infant, is a sense of favours received. Ask a young Christian why he
          loves Christ, and he will tell you, I love Christ because he has
          bought me with his blood! Why do you love God the Father? I love God
          the Father because he gave his Son for me. And why do you love God the
          Spirit? I love him because he has renewed my heart. That is to say we
          love God for what he has given to us. Our first love feeds just on the
          simple food of a grateful recollection of mercies received. And mark,
          however much we grow in grace this will always constitute a great part
          of the food of our love.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when the Christian grows older and has more grace, he loves Christ
          for another reason. He loves Christ because he feels Christ deserves
          to be loved. I trust I can say, I have in my heart now a love to God,
          These men did not merely love Christ because of what he had done for
          them; but you will find in their sonnets and in their letters -- that
          their motive of love was, that he had communed with them, he had
          showed them his hands and his side; they had walked with him in the
          villages; they had lain with him on the beds of spices; they had
          entered into the mystic circle of communion; and they felt that they
          loved Christ, because he was all over glorious, and was so divinely
          fair, that if all nations could behold him, sure they must be
          constrained to love him too.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is the food of love; but when love grows rich -- and it
          does sometimes -- the most loving heart grows cold towards Christ. Do
          you know that the only food that ever suits sick love, is the food on
          which it fed at first. I have heard say by the physicians, that if a
          man be sick there is no place so well adapted for him as the place
          where he was born; and if love grow sick and cold, there is no place
          so fit for it to go to as the place where it was born, namely, the
          love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Where was love born? Was she
          born in the midst of romantic scenery, and was she nursed with
          wondrous contemplations upon the lap of beauty? Ah! no. Was she born
          on the steeps of Sinai, when God came from Sinai and the holy one from
          mount Paran, and melted the mountains with the touch of his foot, and
          made the rocks flow down like wax before his terrible presence? Ah!
          no. Was love born on Tabor, when the Saviour was transfigured, and his
          garment became whiter than wool, whiter than any fuller could make it?
          Ah! no; darkness rushed o'er the sight of those that looked upon him
          then, and they fell asleep, for the glory overpowered them. Let me
          tell you where love was born. Love was born in the garden of
          Gethsemane, where Jesus sweat great drops of blood, it was nurtured in
          Pilate's hall, where Jesus bared his back to the ploughing of the
          lash, and gave his body to be spit upon and scourged. Love was
          nurtured at the cross, amid the groans of an expiring God, beneath the
          droppings of his blood -- it was there that love was nurtured. Bear me
          witness, children of God. Where did your love spring from, but from
          the foot of the cross? Did you ever see that sweet flower growing
          anywhere but at the foot of Calvary? No; it was when ye saw "love
          divine, all loves excelling," outdoing its own self; it was when you
          saw love in bondage to itself, dying by its own stroke, laying down
          its life, though it had power to retain it and to take it up again; it
          was there your love was born; and if you wish your love, when it is
          sick, to be recovered, take it to some of those sweet places; make it
          sit in the shade of the olive trees, and make it stand on the pavement
          and gaze, while the blood is still gushing down. Take it to the cross,
          and bid it look and see afresh the bleeding lamb; and surely this
          shall make thy love spring from a dwarf into a giant, and this shall
          fan it from a spark into a flame.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, when thy love is thus recruited, let me bid thee give thy
          love full exercise; for it shall grow thereby. You say, "Where shall I
          exercise the contemplation of my love, to make it grow?" Oh! Sacred
          Dove of love, stretch thy wings, and play the eagle now. Come! open
          wide thine eyes, and look full in the Sun's face, and soar upward,
          upward, upward, far above the heights of this world's creation,
          upwards, till thou art lost in eternity. Remember, that God loved thee
          from before the foundation of the world. Does not this strengthen thy
          love? Ah! what a bracing air is that air of eternity? When I fly into
          it for a moment, and think of the great doctrine of election -- of
        </p>
        <p>"That vast unmeasured love,</p>
        <p>Which from the days of old,</p>
        <p>Did all the chosen seed embrace,</p>
        <p>like sheep within the fold."</p>
        <p>
          It makes the tears run down one's cheeks to think that we should have
          an interest in that decree and council of the Almighty Three, when
          every one that should be blood-bought had its name inscribed in God'a
          eternal book. Come, soul, I bid thee now exercise thy wings a little,
          and see if this does not make thee love God. He thought of thee before
          thou hadst a being. When as yet the sun and the moon were not, -- when
          the sun, the moon, and the stars slept in the mind of God, like unborn
          forests in an acorn cup, when the old sea was not yet born, long ere
          this infant world lay in its swaddling bands of mist, then God had
          inscribed thy name upon the heart and upon the hands of Christ
          indelibly, to remain for ever. And does not this make thee love God?
          Is not this sweet exercise for thy love? For here it is my text comes
          in, giving, as it were, the last charge in this sweet battle of love,
          a charge that sweeps everything before it. "We love God, because he
          first loved us," seeing that he loved us before time began, and when
          in eternity he dwelt alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when thou hast soared backward into the past eternity, I have yet
          another flight for thee. Soar back through all thine own experience,
          and think of the way whereby the Lord thy God has led thee in the
          wilderness, and how he hath fed and clothed thee every day -- how he
          hath borne with thine ill manners -- how he hath put up with all thy
          murmurings, and all thy longings after the flesh-pots of Egypt -- how
          he has opened the rock to supply thee, and fed thee with manna that
          came down from heaven. Think of how his grace has been sufficient for
          thee in all thy troubles -- how his blood has been a pardon to thee in
          all thy sins -- how his rod and his staff have comforted thee. And
          when thou hast flown over this sweet field of love, thou mayest fly
          further on, and remember that the oath, the covenant, the blood, have
          something more in them than the past, for though "he first loved us,"
          yet this doth not mean that he shall ever cease to, love, for he is
          Alpha and he shall be Omega, he is first, and he shall be last; and
          therefore bethink thee, when thou shalt pass through the valley of the
          shadow of death, thou needest fear no evil, for he is with thee. When
          thou shalt stand in the cold floods of Jordan, thou needest not fear,
          for death cannot separate thee from his love; and when thou shalt come
          into the mysteries of eternity thou needest not tremble, for "I am
          persuaded that neither principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
          nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature
          shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
          Jesus our Lord." And now, soul is not thy love refreshed? Does not
          this make thee love him? Doth not a flight over those illimitable
          plains of the ether of love, inflame they heart, and compel thee to
          delight thyself in the Lord thy God? Here is the food of love. "We
          love him, because he first loved us," and because in that first love
          there is the pledge and promise that he will love us even to the end.
        </p>
        <p>III. And now comes the third point, the</p>
        <p>WALK OF LOVE</p>
        <p>
          When we are on our knees in prayer, I fear that when we are praying
          for the church we do not mean all that we say. We are praying for our
          church, our section of it. Now, he that loves Christ, if he be a
          Baptist, he loves the doctrine of baptism, because he knows it to be
          Scriptural; but, at the same time wherever he sees the grace of God to
          be in any man's heart, he loves him because he is a part of the living
          church, and he does not withhold his heart, his hand, or his house
          from him, because he happens to differ on some one point. I pray that
          the church in these days may have a more loving spirit towards
          herself. We ought to delight in the advance of every denomination. Is
          the Church of England rousing from its sleep? Is she springing like a
          phoenix, from her ashes? God be with her, and God bless her! Is
          another denomination leading the van, and seeking by its ministers to
          entice the wanderer into the house of God? God be with it! Is the
          Primitive Methodist labouring in the hedge and ditch, toiling for his
          Master? God help Him! Is the Calvinist seeking to uphold Christ
          crucified in all his splendours? God be with him! And does another man
          with far less knowledge preach much error, but still hold that "by
          grace are ye saved through faith," then God bless him, and may success
          be with him evermore. If ye loved Christ better ye would love all
          Christ's church, and all Christ's people.

          Do you not know that Christ hath now a mouth on earth, and hath left a
          hand on earth and a foot on earth still, and that if ye would prove
          your love to him, ye would not think that ye cannot feed him -- ye
          need not imagine that ye cannot fill his hand, or that ye cannot wash
          his feet? Ye can do all this to-day. He has left his poor and
          afflicted people, and their mouths are hungry, for they need bread,
          and their tongue is parched for they need water. You meet them; they
          come to you; they are destitute and afflicted. Do ye refuse them? Do
          you know who it was ye denied at your door? "Inasmuch as ye did it not
          unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye did it not to me." In
          rejecting the petition of the poor when you might heve helped them,
          you rejected Christ. Christ was virtually the man to whom you
          parsimoniously refused the needed alms, and your Saviour was thus
          rejected at the door of one for whom he himself had died. Do you want
          to feed Christ? Open your eyes, then, and you shall see him
          everywhere; in our back streets, in our lanes, in our alleys, in all
          our churches, connected with every branch of Christ's people, ye shall
          find the poor and the afflicted. If ye want feed Christ, feed them.
          But ye say that ye are willing to wash Christ's feet Ah! well, and ye
          may do it. Has he no fallen children? Are there no brethren who have
          sinned, and who are thus defiled? If Christ's feet were foul, ye say
          ye would wash them; then if a Christian man has stepped aside, seek to
          restore him, and lead him once more in the way of righteousness. And
          do you want to fill Christ's hands with your liberality? His Church is
          the treasure-house of his alms, and the hand of his church is
          outstretched for help, for she always needs it. She has a work to do
          which must be accomplished. She is straitened because your help is
          withheld from her; pour your gifts into her treasury, for all that ye
          can give unto her is given to the Lord Jesus Christ.

          Finally, to stimulate your love, let me remind you that Christ Jesus
          had two trials of his love, which he endured with firmness, but which
          are often too much for us. When Christ was high, and glorious, I
          marvel that he loved us. I have known many a man who loved his friend
          when he was in the same low estate; but he has risen, and he has
          disdained to know the man at whose table he had fed. A lofty elevation
          tries the love which we bear to those who are inferior to us in rank.
          Now, Christ Jesus, the Lord of heaven and the King of angels,
          condescended to notice us before he came on earth, and always called
          us brethren: and since he has ascended up to heaven, and has
          re-assumed the diadem. and once more sits down at the right hand of
          God, he never has forgotten us. His high estate has never made him
          slight a disciple. When he rode into Jerusalem in triumph, we do not
          read that he disdained to confess that the humble fishermen were his
          followers. And "now, though he reigns exalted high, his love is still
          as great;" still he calls us brethren, friends; still he recognizes
          the kinship of the one blood. And yet, strange to say, we have known
          many Christians who have forgotten much of their love to Christ when
          they have risen in the world. "Ah!" said a woman, who had been wont to
          do much for Christ in poverty, and who had had a great sum left her,
          "I cannot do as much as I used to do." "But how is that?" said one.
          Said she, "When I had a shilling purse I had a guinea heart, and now I
          have a guinea purse I have only a shilling heart." It is a sad
          temptation to some men to get rich. They were content to go to the
          meeting-house and mix with the ignoble congregation, while they had
          but little; they have grown rich, there is a Turkey carpet in the
          drawing-room, they have arrangements now too splendid to permit them
          to invite the poor of the flock, as once they did, and Christ Jesus is
          not so fashionable as to allow them to introduce any religious topic
          when they meet with their new friends. Besides this, they say they are
          now obliged to pay this visit and that visit, and they must spend so
          much time upon attire, and in maintaining their station and
          respectability, they cannot find time to pray as they did. The houae
          of God has to be neglected for the party, and Christ has less of their
          heart than ever he had. "Is this thy kindness to thy friend?" And hast
          thou risen so high that thou art ashamed of Christ? and art thou grown
          so rich, that Christ in his poverty is despised? Alas! poor wealth!
          alas! base wealth! vile wealth! Twere well for thee if it should be
          all swept away, if a descent to poverty should be a restoration to the
          ardency of thine affection.
        </p>
        <p>
          But once again: what a trial of love was that, when Christ began to
          suffer for us! There are many men, I doubt not, who are true
          believers, and love their Saviour, who would tremble to come to the
          test of suffering. Imagine yourself my brother, taken to-day into some
          dark dungeon of the Inquistion; conceive that all the horrors of the
          dark ages are revived, you are taken down a long dark staircase, and
          hurried you know not whither, at last you come to a place, far deep in
          the bowels of the earth, and round about you see hanging on the walls
          the pincers, the instruments of torture of all kinds and shapes. There
          are two inquisitors there who say to you, "Are you prepared to
          renounce your heretical faith, and to return to the bosom of the
          church?" I conceive my brethren and sisters, that you would have
          strength of mind and grace enough to say, "I am not prepared to deny
          my Saviour." But when the pincers began to tear the flesh, when the
          hot coals began to scorch, when the rack began to dislocate the bones;
          when all the instruments of torture were wreaking their hellish
          vengeance, unless the supernatural hand of God should be mightily upon
          you, I am sure that in your weakness you would deny your Master, and
          in the hour of your peril would forsake the Lord that bought you.
          True, the love of Christ in the heart, when sustained by his grace, is
          strong enough to bear us through; but I am afraid that with many of us
          here present, if we had no more love than we have now, we should come
          out from the inquisition miserable apostates from the faith. But now,
          remember Christ. He was exposed to tortures, which were really more
          tremendous, far. There is no engine of Romish cruelty that can equal
          that dreadful torture which forced a sweat of blood from every pore.
          Christ was scourged and he was crucified; but there were other woes
          unseen by us, which were the soul of his agonies. Now, if Christ in
          the hour of sore trial had said, "I disown my disciples, I will not
          die," he might have come down from the cross; and who could accuse him
          of evil? He owed us nothing; we could do nothing for him. Poor worms
          would be all that he would disown. But our Master, even when the
          blood-sweat covered him as with a mantle of gore, never thought of
          disowning us -- NEVER. "My Father," said he once, "if it be possible,
          let this cup pass from me." But there was always the "If it be
          possible." If it be possible to save without it, let the cup pass; but
          if not thy will be done. You never hear him say in Pilate's hall one
          word that would let you imagine that he was sorry he had undertaken so
          costly a sacrifice for us; and when his hands are pierced, and when he
          is parched with fever, and his tongue is dried up like a potsherd, and
          his whole body is dissolved into the dust of death, you never hear a
          groan or a shriek that looks like going back. It is the cry of one
          determined to go on, though he knows he must die on his onward march.
          It was love that could not be stayed by death, but overcame all the
          horrors of the grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what say we to this? We who live in these gentler times, are we
          about to give up our Master, when we are tried and tempted for him?
          Young man in the workshop! it is your lot to be jeered at because you
          are a follower of the Saviour; and will you turn back from Christ
          because of a jeer? Young woman! you are laughed at because you profess
          the religion of Christ, shall a laugh dissolve the link of love that
          knits your heart to him, when all the roar of hell could not divert
          his love from you. And you who are suffering because you maintain a
          religious principle, are you cast out from men; will you not bear that
          the house should be stripped, and that you shall eat the bread of
          poverty, rather than dishonour such a Lord? Will you not go forth from
          this place, by the help of God's Spirit, vowing and declaring that in
          life, come poverty, come wealth -- in death, come pain, or come what
          may, you are and ever must be the Lord's; for this is written on your
          heart, "We love him, because he first loved us."<br />
