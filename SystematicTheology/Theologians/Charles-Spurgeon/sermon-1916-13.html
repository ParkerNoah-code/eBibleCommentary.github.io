          "So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and
          to do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord had destroyed before the
          children of Israel. And the Lord spake to Manasseh and to his people;
          but they would not hearken. Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the
          captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among
          the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
          And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord, his God, and
          humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto
          him and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and
          brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew
          that the Lord he was God." -- 2 Chron.33:9-13.
        </p>
        <p>
          MANASSEH was born three years after his father's memorable sickness.
          You will remember that Hezekiah was stricken with a mortal disease,
          and Isaiah, the prophet, come to him and said, "Thus saith the Lord,
          Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live." He
          appears to have been startled and appalled at the tidings, and gave
          vent to his feelings with bitter tears. Evidently he was afraid at the
          time to face death. He had probably been indulging a worldly spirit;
          and besides this, it lay as a heavy burden upon his heart that he had
          no son whom he should leave as his successor in the kingdom. In deep
          distress of soul, accordingly, he turned to the wall and prayed to the
          Lord. With piteous weeping and earnest pleading he besought that his
          life might be spared. His prayer was heard, his tears were seen, and
          his petition was granted by God. His days were prolonged by fifteen
          years. In the third year of those fifteen years his son Manasseh was
          born to hire. Had he knows, methinks, what sort of a son would have
          risen up in his stead, he might have been content to die, rather than
          to be the father of such a persecutor of God's people, and such a
          setter up of idolatry in the land. Alas! full often we know not what
          we, pray for. We may be covetous of an apparent boon which would prove
          to be a real curse both to ourselves and to thousands of others. You
          prayed, mother -- yea, prayed fervently -- for the life of that dear
          babe whom God was pleaded to take away from you. You cannot know what
          disposition the child would have shown, what temptations would have
          befallen it, or what consequences would have come of its life. Could
          some parents have read the history of their children from the day of
          their birth, they might rightly have wished that they had never been
          born. We had better leave such matters with God, and submit to his
          sovereign will. He knows better than we do, for ho is wonderful in
          counsel and excellent in working. Thank God, these affairs are not in
          our own hands. They are in far better and wiser keeping than ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manasseh's mother was named Hephzi-bah, a beautiful name. I wonder
          whether Hezekiah gave her the name because she was his delight, or
          because his gratitude inspired it, as he was then himself delighting
          in his God. I can scarcely think that at such a time he would have
          chosen one who had not also chosen God; therefore, let us think of her
          as a godly woman. But in that case she could have had little enough
          delight in her son; and sometimes, I should think, when she saw him
          pursuing the people of God with the sword, and sinning with a high
          hand, she must have been ready to say, "Call me no more Hephzi-bah,
          but call me Marah, for the Lord hath dealt bitterly with me." It is
          not always that the thing which makes us glad to-day will make us glad
          to-morrow likewise. Let children be accounted a heritage of the Lord.
          They are the joy of our hearts and the flowers of our homes. But what
          will they be to us when the gay, guileless, sportive days of their
          childhood have run out? Unless God sends his blessing with them, the
          increase of our families may be the sorrow of our lives. Evil passions
          and propensities develop themselves in our children with their growth,
          and if the grace of God does not subdue their sinful disposition, we
          may have to rue the day that they were born. Manasseh's name signified
          "forgetfulness." I hope his father did not forget his training, and
          leave him to those young courtiers who always hang about kings'
          palaces, and are pretty sure to instil into a young prince's mind more
          vanity than virtue, and bespeak his favour and patronage for the
          popular party. There was a superstitious section in those days,
          cultivating idolatry and pouring contempt on the Evangelical brethren,
          whose cause his father, Hezekiah, had espoused so earnestly and
          defended all his days. That new religion, imported from among the
          heathen, had its meretricious attractions. Was there not a great deal
          to please the eye in its pageant, and much to charm the ear in its
          worship? The beautiful artistic work in the statuary of its idols, and
          the fine display of pomp in all the ceremonies -- did not these appeal
          to a cultivated taste? The old-fashioned puritanical order of
          worshipping at one temple, where the service was bald, and where there
          was scarcely anything to be seen except by the priests themselves, was
          becoming effete. Would it not be better to go with the times, take up
          with Baalim and Ashtaroth, do homage to the sensuous proclivities of
          the common people, and make friendly alliances with nations holding
          other creeds? I should not wonder but they talked to the young man in
          that fashion, and he -- oblivious of what God bad done for his sire
          and forgetful that in the long history of the house of Judah the
          people had always been smitten when they turned aside to idols and
          that they only prospered when they clave to the living God fell into
          the snare, and sinned with a high hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall introduce him to you first as a loathsome monster of guilt;
          then, secondly, I shall show you how the hand of God followed him till
          he became a piteous spectacle of misery; after which -- blessed be
          God! -- we shall have to mount into a clearer atmosphere, when we
          point him out to you as he became afterwards, a miracle of grace; and
          in fine we shall have to admire him as a delightful picture of genuine
          repentance. We must begin by considering him as:
        </p>
        <p>I. A LOATHSOME MONSTER OF GUILT.</p>
        <p>
          I cannot imagine that any one of my hearers can have been so great a
          sinner as Manasseh. I shall not attempt to draw a parallel between him
          and anyone else. Still, I should not wonder if some of you may be led
          to draw some such parallel for yourselves. If you do so, I pray the
          Lord to give you such a sense of your own guilt as shall constrain you
          to seek pardon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep was the crime, and daring was the impiety of Manasseh, in size
          that he undid all the good work of his pious father. What Hezekiah had
          painfully wrought at the web he began to unravel as fast as he could.
          That which the father built up for God the son pulled. down; and that
          which the father had cast down because it was evil the son at once
          began to reconstruct. I must confess I have known sons do the like.
          Because, they have hated their father's piety, as it has been a
          restraint upon their sin, they have vowed that if it ever came into
          their power to do as they liked, there should be a change in the
          household. As I passed a certain house this week a friend said to me,
          "Many a prayer-meeting has been held in that farmhouse. People used to
          come for miles round there to meet and pray." "Is that a thing of the
          past?" said I; "are no prayer meetings held there now?" "Oh! no," he
          replied; "the father died, and his reprobate son came into the
          property. A prayer meeting, indeed! No. He defied his mother to
          attempt such a thing; and after having stripped her, and stripped the
          little estate of all there was that was worth the having, he has gone
          away, and has not been heard of for many a year. As far as he could,
          he tore down everything that belonged to his father that reminded him
          of his God." Mr. Whitefield used to tell of a wicked son who said be
          would not live in the same house that his father had inhabited, for he
          said that every room in the house stunk of his father's religion, and
          he could not bear it. There are men who after such manner devise
          mischief. But ah! young man, you cannot sin in that atrocious way
          without incurring extraordinary guilt. It will be remembered that you
          sin against the light; it will be recollected at the last great day
          that you were prayed for -- that you were instructed in the right way;
          nor will you sin so cheap as others -- others, did I say? I means such
          as, when they transgress, only follow an evil example, and run in the
          path which their parents taught them. Oh! how I grieve over ungodly
          young men who treat their father's God with dishonour and despite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manasseh's sin was aggravated by the fact that he chose to follow the
          very worst examples. Though he had in his father one of the best
          patterns of purity, that would not do, but he must cast about him to
          see whom he could imitate. Upon whom think ye, did he light? Why, upon
          Ahab -- the Ahab Of whom God had said that he would cut off every one
          of his house, and not leave one remaining; a threat which had been
          executed, for the blood of Ahab had been licked by dogs in the field
          of Naboth, and Jezebel, his wife, had been devoured of dogs. Yet this
          young man must needs choose Ahab to be his pattern, so he set up
          Baalim, even as Ahab had done of old. The like folly I have known to
          be committed by young men in these days. It may be there are those
          here who have not found anybody that they could imitate, until at last
          they sought out some licentious individual, perhaps, of years gone by,
          whom they have elected to be their leader. Why, half the youth of
          England used, at one time, to be infatuated with Lord Byron. The glare
          of his genius blinded them as to the terrible hue of his character and
          the atrocity of his conduct, so they followed headlong in his track,
          because, forsooth, he was a great man and a poet. Affecting wit, they
          bid defiance to pure morals. Alas! for the men whose sentiments, whose
          language, and whose actions betray the hardihood and the daring of
          vicious characters they are prone to emulate! Though they know better,
          they deliberately choose the worst models that they can copy from.
          What extravagance man will perpetrate in sin!
        </p>
        <p>
          But this Manasseh sought out for himself unusual and outlandish sins.
          Bad as Ahab was, he had not worshipped the host of heaven. That was an
          Assyrian worship, and this man must needs import from Assyria and
          Babylonia worship that was quite new. He set up the image Ashra, which
          you may, perhaps, have seen on the slabs that have been brought from
          Nineveh: a tree bearing souls, intended to represent all the host of
          heaven. He carved this in the house of God, and set it up for worship.
          We read in the prophets that the people used to stand in front of the
          temple and bow before the rising sun, worshipping the hosts of heaven.
          He was not satisfied with common sin. We have known sinners of this
          class; they are not content merely to sin as others do; they are
          ambitious to invent some fresh sin. Like Tiberius, who offered a prize
          if somebody would find him out a new pleasure, they want to discover a
          new species of impiety, which shall draw attention to themselves. They
          must be singular in whatever they attempt; even if it comes to being
          singularly wicked. Such was Manasseh. He could not be satisfied to run
          in the race with others, and mingle with the ill-fashion of his times;
          swiftly as they would fly, he must distance them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond this, he insulted God to his face. Here, perhaps, his sin
          culminates. It was not enough to build idol temples for idol worship,
          but he must needs set up the idols and their altars in the Temple of
          Jehovah. Such arrogance, as we think of it, makes our blood chill. And
          ah! one trembles to tell it, not a few men have thus invoked upon
          their bodies and their souls the curse of the Almighty. So desperately
          have they been set on transgression, that they have lifted their hand
          and defied their Maker. Had he not been God -- the God of all patience
          -- he would have resented their defiance, and have suddenly smitten
          them down to hell; but being God, and not man, he has borne with them.
          He is too great to be stirred by their insults. He has put it by, and
          let it lie still, winking alike at their ignorance and their
          assumption. for a while, until their iniquity shall be full; and then,
          in his justice, will he visit it upon their head. There are not a few
          in our great city who continually do all that they can to provoke God,
          and to show how little they reverence him how utterly they ignore his
          claims on their homage. They will go out of their way to introduce
          blasphemies into their common conversation, and to express their
          disgust and contempt for everything chaste and comely, sacred and
          godly. Such was Manasseh. He set up the altars of the false gods in
          the house of the living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is not his character black enough? Nay, we have not laid on the
          thickest touches yet. We are told he made his children to pass through
          the fire; that is to say, he passed them between the red-hot arms of
          Moloch, that they might belong for ever as long as they lived, to that
          fiendish deity. If we do not aver that men do this now-a-days, they
          fall little short of the same cruelty and crime. Many a man teaches
          his child to drink arduous spirits; trains him to habits which he
          knows will lead him to drunkenness; does his utmost to pass the child
          through the red-hot arms of the spirit-fiend, Else Moloch of the
          present time. Many a man has taught his child to blaspheme. If he has
          not deliberately purposed it, he has actually effected it, fully
          conscious that he was so doing. What was his example but a deliberate
          lesson? Ay; there are people who seem to take delight in the sins of
          their children, Laughing at the iniquities they have instructed their
          own sons to perpetrate. Do I address a father who, for many years, has
          never attended a place of worship on the Sabbath -- who has often gone
          home reeling drunk, and, though somewhat reformed himself, sees his
          own son plunging into every vice that he was himself once habituated
          to? Let me ask you, Do you wonder at it? Do you wonder at it? You have
          passed your children through the flames; what marvel that they were
          singed, and that the smell of fire is upon them? Oh! it is a crying
          sin that men will not only go to hell themselves, but they must needs
          drag their children with them. Many a man has not been satisfied to be
          ruined but he must ruin same young woman who, perhaps, once had
          religious convictions. He becomes her husband, and forbids her to
          attend the house of God. As for his children, they may, perhaps, be
          sent to the Sunday School to get them out of the way in the afternoon,
          yet any goad they might learn there is Soon dissipated by the scenes
          and sounds they witness and hear under the roof of their home. Why,
          multitudes in this city -- we know it, and they must know it
          themselves -- are ruining their children, deliberately compassing
          their perdition. Is this a small sin, an insignificant mistake in
          their training? I trow not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Manasseh proceeded further, for he made a league with
          devils. There were, in his day, certain persons who professed to talk
          with departed spirits, supposing that the devil had the means of
          communicating with them about things to come. Now, whether this
          fellowship with familiar spirits is a delusion and a lie, as I suspect
          it is, or whether there may be a mystery of Satan involved in it, I do
          not know; but certain it was that Manasseh tried to get as near the
          devil as he could. If he could get him to be his friend he was well
          content to make a covenant with hell, so that it might answer his
          purposes. Let him have good luck; little did he care for God. He would
          consult a wizard. Superstition led him to that, but the good Word of
          God he utterly despised. And there are same that have done this --
          some here, perhaps. I will not suppose they have lent themselves to
          those silly superstitions, or resorted lo those deceitful or deceived
          mediums who perform in the dark. I should think, in these modern times
          of popular education, anyone is fit to be confined in a lunatic asylum
          who is beguiled by that snare. Intelligence should protect you from
          imposture. But there be those who, if the devil would help them, would
          be glad enough to shake hands with him, and say, "Hail, fellow; well
          met!" If they do not entertain the devil, it is no fault of theirs.
          They have set the table for him, and furnished the house, and made
          themselves quite ready for any evil spirit that chooses to come to
          them. Oh! what iniquity this is! They will not have God; they will
          have Satan. They cast off the great Father in heaven, but the
          archenemy of souls -- with him they make a covenant, and contract a
          league. Could sin go much farther shall this? It could, and it did;
          for this man led the whole nation astray. Being a king, he had great
          power, and he used his authority and exerted his influence to induce
          his subjects to follow his pernicious course. I often wonder what will
          be the horror of a man that has lived in gross sin when, in the next
          world, he meets those that he betrayed and seduced into iniquity, when
          he begins to see, in the murky gloom of that intolerable pit, a pair
          of eyes which somehow or other seem to hold him fixed and fast. He
          recognises them; he has seen them somewhere before, and those eyes
          flash fire into the soul as though they would utterly consume him, and
          a voice says, "A thousand curses on thee! Thou art he that led me
          first into sin-enticed me from a virtuous home, and from godly
          associations, to become thy partner in iniquity. A blast be on thee
          evermore!" What company they have to keep in that place of torment!
          How they will gnash their teeth at one another in dreadful rage, each
          one charging the other with being his destroyer! Oh! there is remorse
          enough in store for a man who ruins himself, but who can tell the
          pangs that shall scourge his soul who betrays his fellow-creatures,
          and precipitates them into everlasting ruin? Verily, dear friends, we
          stand aghast at the picture of such a man as Manasseh, he set no
          bounds to his sin. He sinned with both hands greedily, and when the
          messengers came from God to tell him of it, he was angry with them.
          Tradition says that he sawed the prophet Isaiah in halves for daring
          to reprove him. But it is not from tradition, but from revelation, we
          learn that he made Jerusalem to swim with blood from one end to the
          other, putting to death all those that would not go in his ways and
          follow his devices. Persecution of the saints of God is a scarlet sin,
          that calls aloud to heaven for vengeance. Manasseh was guilty of this,
          among other crimes. I am sick at heart, and my tongue is weary of the
          story. Let me turn to another branch of the narrative. This terrible
          monster of iniquity presently became: --
        </p>
        <p>II. A SINGULAR SPECTACLE OF MISERY.</p>
        <p>
          A few words will suffice to describe it. The Assyrian king sent his
          captain, one Tartan, who besieged the city till it was devastated, and
          the king fled. It would appear that he hid himself in a thorn brake,
          and was dragged out from it, and fettered and manacled with heavy
          irons. There remains a representation at the present time of some
          Jewish king -- we cannot be sure it was Manasseh -- who was dragged
          before the King of Babylon. At any rate, it represents what was done
          to Manasseh, whether the like treatment befell any other Jewish king
          or not. He has two rings -- a ring on each ankle, and a heavy bolt
          between them, and his hands are fastened in the same manner. He is
          brought before the king at Babylon. There he seems to have been cast
          into prison, and kept in confinement. The cruelties of the Assyrian
          monarchs are attested by the memorials upon their own palace walls;
          therefore, I can fully credit the story told; by Jerome, that this
          Manasseh was himself put into a brazen vessel, and subjected to the
          most intense heat, the Assyrian king abusing him for having passed his
          own child through the fire in the same manner. That he was kept for
          many a long month in a dark and dreary dungeon, with only sufficient
          bread and vinegar given him to sustain his life, appears certain. He
          must have been wretched to the last degree: his crown gone, his
          kingdom devastated, his subjects put to unheard -- of miseries, We are
          told that the judgment which God executed upon the land was such that
          it made the both ears of him that heard of it to tingle. The king
          must, therefore, have experienced some indescribable afflictions from
          the hands of the tyrant of Assyria. Ah! sinner, though thou harden
          thyself in thy transgressions, thou wilt not go unpunished. A bitter
          end awaits thee. Reckless as thou art, young man, thy father's God
          will not always be mocked. You have persecuted your wife and your
          friend, but their unhappiness will return ere long to your own bosom.
          There will come an end to your arrogance, and a beginning to your
          recompenses. Oh! I wish your iniquity would come to an end soon, and
          that it might end with your conversion. If it does not come to that
          end, your outlook is gloomy indeed, for your total destruction will
          complete the course you are running.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps I am addressing somebody who has been living in heartless sin
          until he has become entangled in helpless misery. In this crowd you
          seem as if you were pointed out, for your heart is ready to break with
          anguish. Your property is lost, your health is broken up, your
          character is blasted; you are a mere wreck, a waif, a stray upon the
          dark sea. There is none to have compassion upon you. You are a
          castaway. Even your old companions have forsaken you. The devil
          himself seems to have cast you adrift. You are abandoned, and you
          might cry out and sound your own death knell. "Lost! lost! lost!"
          Well, now, I have a message from God to you. I am come to speak to
          you, in the name of the Lord, about this man Manasseh, in the hope
          that it may be also concerning yourself true -- that after having been
          a prodigy of sin, and a spectacle of misery, you may now become as, in
          the third place, Manasseh became: --
        </p>
        <p>III. A MONUMENT OF GRACE.</p>
        <p>
          Oh! I do not wonder at Manasseh's sin one half so much as I wonder at
          God's mercy. There was the man in the prison. He had never thought of
          his God except to despise his prerogative, and offend against his
          laws, till he was immured in that dungeon. Then his pride began to
          break; his haughty spirit had to yield at last. "Who is Jehovah, that
          I should serve him?" he had often said. But now he is in Jehovah's
          hand. Lying there half-starved in the prison, a crushed man, he begins
          to cry, "Jehovah, what a fool I have been! I have stood out against
          thee until at length thy sovereign power has arrested me. and thy
          infinite justice has begun to avenge my crimes. What shall I do? Where
          shall I hide from thy wrath? How can I escape? Is it possible to
          obtain thy pardon?" He began to humble himself; God's Spirit came and
          humbled him more and more; he saw how foolish he had been, how wicked
          his character, how cruel his conduct, how abominable. Thus he spent
          his days and nights, in weeping and in lamentation. It was not the
          prison he cared so much about. His soul had gone into iron bondage.
          Then it suddenly flashed across his mind that perhaps God might have
          mercy on him, so he began to pray. Oh! what a trembling prayer that
          first prayer was. Methinks Satan said to him, "It is no use your
          praying, Manasseh. Why, you have defied the living God to his face. He
          will tell you to go to the idol gods you have served, repair to the
          images you have set up, and bow before the hosts of heaven you have
          been wont to worship, and see what they can for you." Nay; but in this
          awful despair he felt he must pray; and surely the first prayer he
          breathed must have been, "God be merciful to me a sinner." And in his
          deep abasement, he continued still to pray and plead with God. And
          that dear Father of ours who is in heaven heard him. If ever you can
          bring him a praying heart, he will bring you a forgiving message. As
          soon as he saw his poor child broken down, and confessing his wrong,
          he took pity on him, heard, and answered him, and blotted out his sins
          like a cloud, and his transgressions like a thick cloud. I think I see
          Manasseh, with his morsel to eat, never enough to stay his hunger, and
          his little drops of vinegar, saying to himself, "Ah! I don't deserve
          this!" He would thank God even for that starving allowance in the
          depths of his cell, feeling that it was mercy that let him live. "Why
          should a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?"
          And so it came to pass that he was delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The King of Assyria, for State reasons which I need not mention,
          determined to put this king on his throne again. He thought that he
          had broken him down, and humbled him enough; that he would make a good
          viceroy and a faithful lieutenant, and that he would be afraid to
          rebel again, so one bright day he opened wide Manasseh's dungeon, and
          told him he was going to send him back to Jerusalem. And when he told
          him that, then Manasseh knew that Jehovah, he was God. This conclusion
          was forced upon him by the mercy he obtained. "Who," he would say,
          "but the Most High God could have brought me out of this horrible pit,
          have released me from the power of this tyrant king, or moved his
          heart to relent, and have compassion on me?" As he rode back to
          Jerusalem, how his heart would be breaking with gratitude! I think I
          see him when he first got within sight of the walls of that temple
          which he had so recklessly profaned. Surely he threw himself upon his
          face, and wept sore, and then arose and blessed the name of the Lord
          tl at had forgiven all his trespasses. And when he entered Jerusalem,
          and the people gathered round him, what must the greetings have been?
          Where are those courtiers that had been his companions, that led him
          into sin? Do they come whining round him? What a rebuff they will get!
          How will he exclaim, "Get you gone. I am another man. I do not want
          your company or your counsel." Are there any of those poor people
          standing in the background -- the people that used to meet to pray and
          worship Jehovah, faithful among the faithless found -- such as had
          been wont to hide away their Bibles because they were hunted and
          harried from one retreat to another -- a small remnant, that had
          escaped the fangs of the persecutors -- did they came forward? How he
          could look at them, and say, "Ah! you servants of Jehovah, you are my
          brethren. Give me your hands; for I, too, have found from heaven, and
          I am, like you, a child of God." I warrant you there was singing in
          Jerusalem that night amongst the feeble band of the steadfast
          believers; and there must have been music in heaven too, for the fiery
          angels must have rejoiced in a conversion that seemed so unlikely, so
          incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What, Manasseh saved? Manasseh -- that bloodhound -- is he
          transformed, by the renewing of his mind, into a lamb of God's flock?
          What he, the red-handed persecutor -- has he become a professor of the
          faith he once destroyed?" Ah! yes. Well might Bishop Hall say, "Who
          can complain that the way of heaven is blocked against him, when he
          sees such a sinner enter? Say the worst against thyself, O clamorous
          soul! Here is one that murdered men, defied God, and worshipped
          devils, yet he finds the way to repentance. If thou be vile as he,
          know that it is not thy sin, but thy impenitence, that bars heaven
          against thee. Who can now despair of thy mercy, O God, that sees the
          tears of a Manasseh accepted?" I remember an old lady who would not
          travel by railway because she thought that some of the bridges were in
          bad repair, especially the Saltash bridge, near her own house. Over
          that bridge she could not be persuaded to pass, for fear her weight
          should break it down, although hundreds of tons weight were carried
          over it every day. At such folly everybody can smile. But when I hear
          any man say, "I have committed so much sin, that God cannot pardon
          it," I think his folly is far greater. Look at this huge train that
          went over that bridge. Behold Manasseh laden with ponderous crimes!
          Mark what a train of sin there was behind him! Then look at the
          bridge, and see whether it starts by reason of the loaded teem of
          wills which is rolling over it. Ah! no, it bears up, and so would it
          bear the weight if all the, Sins that men have done should roll across
          its arches. Christ is "able to save to the uttermost them that come
          unto God by him." I do not know where to cast my eyes for the person
          to whom this message is directed. That he is somewhere in this
          assembly I entertain no doubt. So I speak to some sister who, in an
          unguarded hour, left the path of virtue, and since then has pursued a
          course of shame? I pray you accept the message. I deliver it to you.
          The greatest sin, the utmost guilt, the most incredible iniquity, the
          most abominable transgressions, can be forgiven, and shall be blotted
          out. The Redeemer lives; the sacrifice has been offered; the covenant
          is sealed. Turn now to the Lord with purpose of heart. Confess the
          sins. Abjure thyself. Trust in the infinite mercy of God, through
          Jesus Christ, his Son. "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
          unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord, for he
          will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly
          pardon." Our closing reflection is that Manasseh became: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. A PICTURE OF TRUE REPENTANCE.</p>
        <p>
          At once he ceased to do evil. He went straightway to the temple and
          pulled down the idols. How I would like to have been with him, and
          have had a hand in demolishing them. Down went the images; then over
          went the altars; every stone was dragged right out of the city, and
          flung away. God grant that every image in England may yet be pulled
          down, battered to pieces, and the small dust thereof flung into the
          common sewers. May that which is an utter abomination before heaven
          stir a righteous indignation on earth. Oh! that our land may be so
          godly that no respect for fine arts may suffer her to tolerate foul
          impieties! Manasseh made haste to undo the mischief he had done. This
          is what every converted man tries to do. All the evil he has ever
          caused he tries to stay; he takes vengeance on his former devices;
          against them he lifts both his hands, raises his voice, and exerts his
          influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor did this suffice; Manasseh began forthwith to do good. Right
          speedily he began to repair the altar of the Lord, and to restore the
          services of God and the ordinances of the Temple to their original
          purity, according to the divine statutes. So when a man is truly
          converted, he will be anxious to join himself to the Lord's people,
          and support the institutions of his house. Nor did Manasseh smother
          his gratitude, but he presented thank-offerings to God. He was not
          unmindful of the devout acknowledgments that were due for the great
          mercy he had received. Like that other great sinner, whose gratitude
          is recorded in the gospel -- the woman who brought an alabaster box of
          ointment, very precious, and brake it -- like her, methinks, he loved
          much because he had had much forgiven.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, then, being established in his kingdom, he proceeded to use his
          high influence for holy purposes. He ruled his subjects in the fear of
          the Lord; and made the law of his God to be the law of the land,
          renouncing all strange gods, and adhering rigidly to the book by
          inspiration given. Oh! that God would incline the heart of some
          penitent sinner here at once to bring forth this fruit of conversion!
          What a change there would be in his house! What a difference his
          family would see! What an altered man he would appear in his daily
          avocation, whether he be employer or employed! He would be seeking the
          conversion of those whom he formerly led astray. Those he once scoffed
          at, and called by evil names, would become his choicest companions.
          "Can God do this?", says one. Oh! my dear hearers, the God that can
          forgive great sin can also change hard hearts. Cry to him. If you are
          unsaved, may his Spirit lead you to seek salvation now. Stay not for
          to-morrow's sun. If you are saved yourself, may that blessed Spirit
          lead you to pray for others, and seek their present and eternal
          welfare. Watch unto prayer. Let your own faith in God stimulate you to
          believe that all things are possible. Never give them up, never give
          them up. Are you a mother -- you do not know how prevalent your
          intercessions may prove. I wonder whether poor Hephzi-bah was alive
          when Manasseh was converted? She had grieved over him, doubtless, in
          his young days. Well, if she did not live to see the fruit of her
          prayers, yet her prayers lived, and her tears were repaid with rich
          interest. There is many a mother's son whose heart will be turned to
          God long after his mother's bones have been laid in the churchyard.
          The vision is for an appointed time; though it tarry, wait for it. Thy
          son will yet be brought to glory through thy prayers. Pray on,
          brethren and sisters, pray on for those whose sins and sorrows lay
          heavily on your heart. Pray on, and God will hear you. O poor sinners,
          the mercy of God is the antidote for man's despair. Believe in his
          mercy. Look for his mercy. Cast yourselves upon his mercy, and you
          shall find his mercy unto everlasting life. God grant it for Christ's
          sake. Amen.<br />
