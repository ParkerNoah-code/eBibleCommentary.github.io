        <p>Of the right of bishops not to be accused or hurt by detraction.</p>
        <p>
          You desired also to consult us, as we find in the above-mentioned
          letter of yours, on the subject of the accusing of priest, -- a thing
          which, as we learn also from the same epistle, is exceedingly frequent
          among you. You have intimated, besides, that very many notice that not
          a few in places of ecclesiastical dignity do not live in a manner
          conformable to the discourses and sacraments with which the people are
          served by their means. O miserable men, who in looking at these forget
          Christ, who long since indeed told us how that the law of God should
          be obeyed, rather than that those should be looked to for imitation
          who do not the things which they say; and bearing with the traitor
          himself even to the end, He sent him also along with the rest to
          preach the Gospel. For the apostles had no such custom, neither did
          they teach that it was one fit to be had. And to like effect their
          successors also, foreseeing by the Spirit of God things to come, have
          determined largely on such subject. Besides, as you read in the Acts
          of the Apostles, "There was at that time among them that believed one
          heart and one soul; neither said any of them that ought of the things
          which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common." For
          there was no laying of accusations against each other among them,
          except what was friendly; neither ought there ever to be such among
          their followers or among believers: for the Lord says, "Do not that to
          another which thou wouldst not have done to thyself." And He says
          also, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;" and," Love worketh
          no ill to his neighbour." In accordance herewith, the apostles
          themselves and their successors decreed of old time that those persons
          should not be admitted to lay accusations who were under suspicion, or
          who but yesterday, or the day before, or a little time ago, were at
          enmity, as they come thus under suspicion, or who are not of good
          conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, or who are doubtful in
          the matter of the true faith. In like manner is it decided to be with
          those whose faith and life and liberty are unknown, or who are marked
          with the stains of infamy, or entangled in the snares of offences.
          Again, those have neither the right nor the power to accuse the
          priests or the clergy, who are incapable themselves of being made
          priests legitimately, and are not of their order; for just as the
          priests and the other members of the clerical order are debarred from
          laying accusations against the secular laity, so these latter, too,
          should be debarred and excluded from the right of bringing charges
          against the former. And as the former should not be admired by the
          latter, so the latter should not be admired by the former: for as the
          conversation of the priests of the Lord ought to be something separate
          from the conversation of these others, so should they be separate from
          them also in the matter of litigation; "for the servant of the Lord
          ought not to strive." To the utmost of your power, dearly beloved
          brethren, do ye prohibit such accusations, and all unrighteous and
          injurious emulations, because contention is to be avoided by all
          means. "For a just man will fall seven times in a day, and will rise
          again; but the wicked shall fall into mischief. Rejoice not when thine
          enemy falleth," saith Solomon, "and let not thine heart be glad when
          he stumbleth; lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, and He turn
          away His wrath from him. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers,
          neither be thou envious at the wicked: for the evil have not the hope
          of the future, and the candle of the wicked shall be put out. Envy not
          evil men, neither be thou desirous to be with them; for their mind
          meditates rapine, and their lips speak deceits." Dearly beloved,
          beware of these things. Ponder these things, and minister comfort to
          the brethren in all things; for, as the Truth says in His own person,
          "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love
          one to another." For if in things secular each man's right and his
          proper position are kept for him, how much more ought there to be no
          confusion induced in matters of ecclesiastical order! And this is a
          right which will be duly observed if no deference is paid to mere
          power, but all to equity. Whence it is an established duty, that the
          bishops of each several district should exercise a watchful care over
          all those who live under their rule, and in the fear of God should
          dispose of all cases in which they are concerned, and of all matters
          in which they are interested. It is therefore extremely inequitable
          that any bishops should neglect their own cases, and mix themselves up
          with those of others. But those whose part it is to ordain such
          persons to the priesthood, and by whom they have been already
          ordained, ought to order the life and judgment of such by the exercise
          of a competent and regular administration; for, as the law says,
          "Cursed is every one that removeth his neighbour's landmarks. And all
          the people said Amen." To this therefore, brethren, has God
          foreordained you, and all who hold the highest office of the
          priesthood, that ye should put all injustice out of the way, and cut
          off presumption, and help those who labour in the priesthood, and give
          no occasion for their reproach and trouble, but bring assistance to
          him who endures calumny and reproach, and cut off him who works
          calumny and reproach, and act for the help of the Lord in His priests.
          The Lord, moreover, has chosen the priests for Himself, that they
          should sacrifice to Him, and offer oblations to their Lord. He
          commanded the Levites also to be under them in their ministries.
          Whence He speaks to Moses in these terms: "And Eleazar the son of
          Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and
          have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary." For
          of these the Lord spake to Moses in this wise: "Take the Levites
          instead of the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle
          of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine:
          I am the Lord." If the Lord willed the Levites to be His own, how much
          more has He taken the priests for Himself! And of these He says: "If
          any stranger cometh nigh, he shall be put to death." All objects,
          moreover, that are the Lord's are to be handled carefully, and are not
          lightly to be injured; for even among men, those are reckoned faithful
          who attend to the interests of their masters rightly, and deal with
          them faithfully, and rightly observe the commands of their masters,
          and transgress them not. And those, on the other hand, are reputed
          unfaithful who deal with the interests of their masters carelessly and
          negligently, and despise their commands, and do not observe them as
          they ought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly we have set these matters before you, in order that those
          who now know it not may know this; viz., that the priests, too, whom
          the Lord has taken to Himself from among all men, and has willed to be
          His own, are not to be dealt with lightly, nor injured, nor rashly
          accused or reprehended, save by their masters, seeing that the Lord
          has chosen to reserve their causes to Himself, and ministers vengeance
          according to His own judgment. For in these and other precepts of the
          Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful at the same
          time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the
          faithful than made subjects of reproach (exprobrandi); just as there
          is chaff with the wheat even to the last winnowing, and as there are
          bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is yet to be on
          the shore, -- that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means,
          then, can that man be condemned by a human examination, whom God has
          reserved for His own judgment, that the purpose of God, according to
          which He has decreed to save what had perished, may be unalterable.
          And consequently, as His will suffers no change, let no man presume on
          matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of
          that word which the apostle speaks: "Now therefore there is utterly a
          fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not
          rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be
          defrauded?" To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: "And if any man
          will take away thy coat, and sue thee at the law, let him have thy
          cloak also." And in another place: "Of him that taketh away thy goods,
          ask them not again." Moreover, there are certain things which might be
          thought most trivial were they not shown in the Scriptures to be of
          more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his
          brother "Thou fool" worthy of hell-fire, were it not that the Truth
          Himself told us so? Those, furthermore, who commit those sins whereof
          the apostle says, "They who do such things shall not inherit the
          kingdom of God," are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be
          compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily,
          because they are marked with the stains of infamy, and go down into
          the pit, unless assistance is brought them by sacerdotal authority.
          Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, "With
          such persons, no, not to eat;" because such persons are branded with
          infamy until they are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated
          in the bosom of our holy mother the Church; since those who are
          outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest that these
          are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not
          lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all persons
          who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are
          rendered infamous; and all who arm themselves against fathers are
          rendered infamous. "Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to
          bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious." "He
          that wanteth understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and
          erring man imagineth follies." For their suspicion has overthrown
          many, and their opinion hath held them in vanity. "A stubborn heart
          shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish
          therein. A heart that entereth two ways shall not have rest; and the
          evil heart in them shall be made to stumble. A wicked heart shall be
          laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap sin upon sin." The holy
          apostles and their successors, having such things in mind, and
          foreseeing, as being filled with the Holy Spirit, the course of wicked
          men, and having regard to the simple, determined that the accusing of
          priests should be a matter undertaken with difficulty, or never
          undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by wicked men.
          For if this were made an easy matter to secular and wicked men, there
          would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has
          been and still is the case -- and (which is yet worse) that too in
          growing measure -- that the wicked persecute the good, and that the
          carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has
          been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at
          all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should
          be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has
          been stated above, by what persons that function should not be
          assumed; and they resolved further, that bishops should not be cast
          out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the
          matter of accusation should be taken in hand before their rightful
          seat and all their property are restored by those laws, they should by
          no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer
          any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own
          accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted,
          and have had all their effects restored to them by those laws, when
          their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a
          long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and
          thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come
          to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the
          propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so
          long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by
          their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that
          any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at
          liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether
          superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their
          churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and
          we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one
          among the clergy proves an enemy or traducer of his bishops, and seeks
          to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the
          consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the
          clerical order, and given over to the court (curiæ), to which he shall
          devote himself zealously all the days of his life, and shall remain
          infamous without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume
          to be at once accuser, and judge, or witness; for in every judicial
          investigation there must always be four persons present: that is, the
          judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the
          witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority,
          that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor,
          to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into error in
          the faith; for the deeds of superiors are not to be smitten with the
          sword of the mouth; neither can the disciple be above the master, as
          the voice of Truth saith, "The disciple is not above his master, nor
          the servant above his lord."
        </p>
        <p>
          And pride is hateful before God and men, and all iniquity is
          execrable. "The Lord hath destroyed the memory of the proud, and hath
          left the memory of the humble in mind. The seed of men shall be
          honoured, this seed that feareth God. But that seed shall be
          dishonoured that transgresseth the commandments of the Lord. Among
          brethren, he that is chief is honourable; and they that fear the Lord
          shall be in His eyes. My son, saith Solomon, preserve thy soul in
          meekness, and give honour to him whom honour beseemeth." "Blame not
          any one before thou examinest him; and when thou hast examined him,
          reprove him justly. Answer not a word before thou hearest the cause;
          neither interrupt with talk in the midst of thy seniors." After the
          example of Ham the son of Noah, they are condemned who bring the
          faults of their fathers into public view, or presume to accuse or
          calumniate them; even as was the case with Ham, who did not cover the
          shame of his father Noah, but exhibited it for mockery. And in like
          manner those are justified by the example of Shem and Japhet, who
          reverently cover and seek not to display those matters in which they
          find their fathers to have erred. For if a bishop should happen to err
          from the faith, he should in the first place be corrected privately by
          those placed under him (a subditis suis). And if he show himself
          incorrigible (which may God forbid), then an accusation should be laid
          against him before his primates, or before the seat of the apostles.
          For his other actings, however, he is rather to be borne with by his
          flock and those put under him, than accused or made the subject of
          public detraction; because when any offence is committed in these
          matters by those put under them, His ordinance is withstood who set
          them before him, as the apostle says, "Whosoever resisteth the power,
          resisteth the ordinance of God." But he who fears Almighty God, agrees
          in no way to do anything contrary to the Gospel, or contrary to the
          apostles, or contrary to the prophets or the institutions of the holy
          fathers. The priests therefore are to be honoured, and not to be
          injured or reproached. Thus read we in Ecclesiasticus: "Fear the Lord
          with all thy soul, and reverence His priests. Love Him that made thee
          with all thy strength, and forsake not His ministers. Honour God with
          thy whole soul, and honour the priest, and cleanse thyself beforehand
          with the shoulders (propurga te cum brachiis). Give him his portion,
          as it is commanded thee, of the first-fruits; and purge thyself
          concerning negligence with a few things. Thou shalt offer the gift of
          thy shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the
          first-fruits of the holy things to the Lord. And stretch thine hand
          unto the poor, that thine atonement and blessing may be perfected." We
          desire these things to become known not to you only, but through you
          to all the brethren, that we may abide in Christ of one accord and one
          mind, making no claim for ourselves through strife or vainglory, and
          being pleasers not of men, but of God our Saviour. To Him belongeth
          honour and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
