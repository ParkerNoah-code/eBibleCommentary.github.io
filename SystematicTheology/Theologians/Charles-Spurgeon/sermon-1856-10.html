        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.63)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 27, 1856, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          |Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
          windows?| -- Isaiah 60:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          TThe ancient church, in the foresight of her mighty increase in these
          latter days lifts up her hands in astonishment, and having been so
          used to see the Lord's grace confined to a small nation, she exclaims
          in amazement, |Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to
          their windows?| We, beloved, are in a somewhat similar position. It
          has pleased our Father to add to our numbers so greatly beyond all
          precedent in modern times, that I doubt not that many of our aged
          members, who remember days of yore, when God was pleased to bless them
          very greatly, and then think of days of sadness and weariness, when
          they were diminished and brought low, are this morning lifting up
          their hands, and saying, as they think of the present prosperity of
          our church, |Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to
          their windows?| I am sure whenever I appoint an evening for seeing the
          converts I am amazed; I can only stand up afterwards, clap my hands,
          and go home and weep for very joy, to think that the word of our God
          is so running and multiplying and abundantly increasing; and as post
          after post I receive letters from different parts of this country,
          from one person here, and another there, not in England only, but in
          Scotland, and even across the sea -- in Ireland, and you know, in the
          Crimea also -- I have been overwhelmed with amazement, and have been
          obliged to cry out, |Who hath begotten me these?| |Who are these that
          fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The church, when she uttered these words, appears to have been the
          subject of three kinds of feeling. First, wonder: secondly, pleasure:
          thirdly, anxiety. These three feelings you have felt; you are not
          strangers to them; and you will understand, while I speak to you as
          the children of God, how it is that we can feel at the same time,
          wonder, pleasure, and yet anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, the church of old, and our church now, appears to have been
          the subject of WONDER when she saw so many come to know the Lord. |Who
          are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?|
          Take the first sentence of the text first: |Who are these that fly as
          a cloud?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The church wondered, first of all, at the number of her converts. They
          did |fly as a cloud.| Not here and there a convert -- not now and then
          one -- not converts like solitary bitterns of the desert; but they
          |did fly as a cloud.| Not a convert now and then, like a meteor, a
          thing we see but seldom, which flashes across the sky, rejoices the
          darkness, and then is gone; not now and then a convert, as a rara
          avis, -- a spiritual prodigy. |But who are these?| saith she, |who fly
          as a cloud?| She wonders at their number. But, my brethren, why should
          we be astonished? Did not the apostle Peter become the instrument of
          converting three thousand under one sermon? And have we not heard of
          Whitfield, that while ten thousand listened to him, it has been known
          that two thousand at a time have felt the power of God manifested in
          their hearts? And why should we wonder if hundreds were brought to God
          now? |Is his arm shortened, that he cannot save? Is his ear heavy,
          that he cannot hear?| Have we not cried unto the God of Jacob; and is
          anything impossible to him? Remember how he |cut Rahab and wounded the
          dragon.| Think of his prodigies by the Red Sea, and the miracles he
          worked in the field of Zoan. |Is anything too hard for the Lord?| Oh!
          thou distrustful church, dost thou marvel because thy Lord giveth thee
          many children? Is it not written -- |More are the children of the
          desolate than the children of the married wife,| saith the Lord. I
          tell thee, the Lord will show thee greater things than these. The
          increase we have had shall yet be exceeded, if God wills it. Nothing
          is impossible with him. He who converts one, could as easily convert a
          hundred; and he who redeems a hundred, could save a thousand by the
          self-same power. Is not the blood of Jesus sufficient? Is not the Holy
          Ghost powerful enough? and is not the mighty Three-one God |able to do
          for us exceeding abundantly above what we can ask or think?| Yet, so
          it is; so little are our expectations, and so unprepared are we for
          God's mercies, that when he pours out a blessing upon us, so that we
          have not room enough to receive it, we begin shutting up the windows
          altogether, and think, |Surely it cannot come from God, because there
          is so much of it.| Why, that is the very reason why we should believe
          it to be. If there were few conversions, then we might tremble, and
          fear lest they might be man's; but when there are so many none but a
          God can accomplish it. When one or two are brought to join a church,
          we may shake for fear and examine them with caution; but when they fly
          like a cloud, we can only say, |Great art thou, O God, marvellous are
          thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.| Doubtless, brethren,
          until larger views of God's power and increased faith shall diminish
          the wonder, we shall always stand in amazement, and say, |Who are
          these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?|
        </p>
        <p>
          But, secondly, the Chaldee has the idea in it, not of numbers, but of
          swiftness. |Who are these that fly as a cloud,| for swiftness? Ye have
          seen clouds dashing along, like chariots drawn by mighty horses, or
          flying like a fugitive army, when the swift winds have pursued them,
          and ye have said, |See how swiftly the clouds career along the sky;|
          and it is notable, that in great revivals of religion, persons are
          generally more swift in their religious growth and experience than
          they are in dull and degenerate times. |Why,| says one, |how soon
          persons join the church here! how very soon they attain to assurance
          of faith! how very speedily they come to understand gospel doctrines.
          It was not so in my days; for I know I was months and months, and
          tried a long while, before I dared think of obeying my Master --
          before I could say, I know whom I have believed.'| Just so; but these
          are brighter days than your days, and you are wondering now because
          the converts fly so swiftly. But that is just the idea of the text:
          |Who are these that fly as swiftly as a cloud?| I know, brethren, it
          used to be the custom with our churches, when a convert came to keep
          him a summer and a winter -- to summer him and to winter him. Now,
          that is very prudent and very wise; but it is not at all scriptural:
          there is nothing in the word of God to support it. The example of
          Jesus and his apostles is altogether against it; and I take it that
          scripture is to go before prudence, and that his example is always to
          be above man's wisdom. Why should the people of God tarry in these
          days? Let them haste, and delay not to keep his commandments; and what
          if young people do grow in grace faster now than they did in your
          time? Perhaps God has now poured out a larger measure of his Spirit.
          He has placed us in brighter days; and plants in the warm sunshine
          must expect to grow faster than those that dwell in the frost. We know
          that in the short summers of Sweden, a harvest will ripen in two or
          three months, or less than that. Why should we complain of the corn of
          Sweden, because it ripens so swiftly, when it is just as good as ours
          that takes several months to ripen? The Lord does as he wills and as
          he pleases; and if some fly swiftly, whilst others travel slowly, let
          those who go slowly bless God that they go at all, but let them not
          murmur that others go a little faster. Nevertheless, it will always be
          to God's church a source of wonder: |Who are these that fly so swiftly
          like a cloud?|
        </p>
        <p>
          The Targum has another idea, that of publicity. |Who are these that
          fly as a cloud?| The cloud, you know, flies so that everybody can see
          it. So do these converts fly openly before the world. It is a matter
          of admiration with this church and with God's church whenever it is
          increased, that the converts become so bold and fly so publicly. In
          the first days of the church, Nicodemus, the ruler of the Jews, came
          to Jesus by night; he was somewhat ashamed, lest he should be put out
          of the synagogue. Joseph of Arimathea, the rich man, was afraid to
          profess his Lord, and therefore loved Jesus |secretly, for fear of the
          Jews.| But you do not read that any of them were afraid, when God
          poured out the Holy Ghost on the day that Peter preached; but |they
          broke their bread from house to house, and did eat it in singleness of
          heart, praising God.| They went up to the beautiful gate of the
          temple, and in the very teeth of all the people, Peter and John healed
          the lame man. They worked their miracles openly before all men. They
          were not ashamed. So, when there is a glorious ingathering of souls,
          you will always notice how bold the people become. Why, there never
          were such a brazen-faced set of people as those who assemble here.
          They are not ashamed of their religion. Why, I have seen persons come
          to the pool of baptism, fearing, shaking, and trembling: but I have
          not found it so with the majority of those who have been baptized in
          this place. They seem proud to own their Master. They can sing, --
        </p>
        <p>|Ashamed of Jesus? Sooner far</p>
        <p>Let evening blush to own a star!</p>
        <p>Ashamed of Jesus? Just as soon</p>
        <p>Let midnight be ashamed of noon!|</p>
        <p>
          You |are not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,| for it has been here
          the power of God unto salvation to many who have believed. I have
          rejoiced to see the boldness of the young converts; I have heard of
          them fighting with the antagonists of the truth. I have seen them
          boldly standing up for their Master, in the face of scorns and jeers,
          and slanders; and the church says, with regard to them, |Who are these
          that fly publicly as a cloud?|
        </p>
        <p>
          But methinks there is another idea here, which Dr. Gill gives us in
          his very valuable commentary. |Who are these that fly as a cloud,| for
          unanimity? You will mark, not as clouds, but |as a cloud;| not as two
          or three bodies, but as one united and compact mass! Here is the
          secret of strength. Split us into fractions, and we are conquered;
          unite us into a steady phalanx, and we become invincible; knit us
          together as one man, and Satan himself can never rend us asunder.
          Divide us into threads, let our warp and woof be disunited, and we
          become like rotten tow, that burneth before a single spark of the fire
          of the enemy. But, thanks be to God, we are |as the heart of one man.|
          I could not but wonder at our Church Meeting on Wednesday, how all
          seemed to fly as a cloud. No sooner was a thing proposed, than the
          whole church seemed without a dissentient opinion to be carried along
          irresistibly by one thought that possessed its bosom. It is very
          seldom you see a church really united; but God has united us; we have
          |one Lord, one faith, one baptism.| But yet the church wonders at it;
          she can scarcely understand it. |Who are these,| she says, |who fly as
          one compact and solid cloud?| God grant that we may always continue
          so! Whatever is said of one of us, let it be said of all of us. Do not
          let us be stragglers. Those who fall into the rear of an army are
          always in danger; and those who hang about its flanks are equally
          subject to insult and injury. Let us march breast to breast, shoulder
          to shoulder, each of us drawing the sword at one word; every one doing
          as the captain tells us; and as surely as truth prevaileth, unity
          shall conquer, and our king shall honor us and bless us still,
          treading our foes beneath our feet, and making us more than conquerors
          through him that hath loved us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: there is the idea of power. Who is he that shall bridle a
          cloud, or stop it in its march? What man is he who by a word can stay
          the careering clouds, and make them still? Who is he that can bid
          them, when they are driving northward, turn their course to the south?
          Who is he that can rein the coursers of the wind, and forbid them to
          drag the chariots of darkness along to the west? The clouds yield to
          none; no majesty can control them; they laugh to scorn the sceptre of
          the prince, and they move on, despite the rattling of the sabres of
          armies. None can stop the clouds; they are invincible, uncontrollable;
          and in their majesty they move themselves right royally, like the
          kings of heaven. And who is he that can stop the converts of Zion? Who
          is he that can keep back the children of Jerusalem; when the Lord
          shall |bring again the captivity of his people,| who is he that shall
          stop them? When his people of old were in Babylon, could |the
          two-leaved gates| bar them in? Could Cyrus, with all his armies, have
          kept them prisoners? Nay, the two-leaved gates open, the bars of brass
          give way; and Cyrus himself sends them back to their country, with
          gold and silver to build their temple. And when in latter days the
          Jews shall return to their own land again, to worship God, who shall
          stop them? Shall the might of Russia? Shall the power of Egypt? Shall
          the tyranny of Turkey? Shall aught keep them back? No; the city shall
          be builded again upon her own heap, and the tribes of the Lord shall
          yet go up again, to worship God where their forefathers bowed before
          them. O, people of God! it is so with you. |Who are these that fly as
          a cloud!| Try, try, O enemy, to stop one of the Lord's doves, when he
          is coming to the windows! You cannot do it. Did not the devil try to
          stop you, O brother, when you were coming to God? Ah! he did; but it
          was all in vain. And when you went to join the church, how many
          difficulties there were in the way! But when you are called to God you
          will not be afraid, you will fly like a cloud. Ah! the world says we
          shall stop by-and-by; that all our success is as nothing; that it will
          soon die away; that it is a mere excitement, and will soon end. Ah!
          let them talk so, if they please. We are flying like a cloud. We have
          God within us; we have good within us; we have the might of the Deity
          within our church; and who is he that shall stop us? We bid the mighty
          men of this earth come; we bid carnal reason array itself against us;
          we bid the wisdom of the critic try to stop us. But they cannot do it.
          The weakness of God is mightier than man; and he who took us from the
          sheep-folds to lead his people Israel will not desert his David; he
          who has put us before his people will not cast us away, nor will he
          leave his church, nor forsake his chosen ones. |Who are these that fly
          as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I tried to picture to you the amazement of Christ's Church.
          |Who are these that fly as a cloud?| And, now, Church of God, one word
          with thee, ere I leave thee. Your success is amazing one way; but it
          is not amazing if you look at it in another direction. It is amazing
          that any man should be saved, if you look at man; it is not amazing if
          you consider God. It is amazing that the wilderness should blossom as
          the rose, if you look at the wilderness; but it is not amazing, if you
          consider Jehovah. It is wonderful that a desert should have the
          excellency of Carmel and Sharon: but, wonder all dies away, when you
          recollect that God who doeth as he wills in the armies of heaven doeth
          as he pleases in this lower world. O, Church of God! give the honor
          and the glory to thy God, and to thy God only. Write his name upon thy
          banners; let thy sacrifice smoke before him, and before the shields of
          the mighty. |I am, and there is none else besides me.| Bow before him;
          lest, if you give praise to the creature, and if you think we have
          done anything, and say, |Behold this great Babylon that I have
          builded,| God would say, |Because thou hast exalted thyself like the
          cedars of Lebanon, therefore will I bring thee down to the earth, and
          thy glory shall be taken from thee.| May the Lord in his mercy keep us
          from pride, and also keep us living on him, believing in his might,
          and trusting in his power!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. This brings us to the second portion of our discourse, which is
          the PLEASURE OF THE CHURCH. |Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as
          the doves to their windows?|
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the church is exceedingly pleased at the character of those who
          come to her, |doves.| We should always thank God, when those who join
          the church are of the right sort; for alas! there is such a thing as
          having a large addition to the church of men that are of no use
          whatever. Many an army has swelled its ranks with recruits, who have
          in no way whatever contributed to its might; and it has been known in
          many great revivals, that large hosts have been gathered in, who have
          forsaken the truth in six months. I know a church which excommunicated
          eighty members in twelve months, for disorderly conduct and forsaking
          the truth; and they had taken on a hundred or so the year before, from
          some great spasm, which had been occasioned by one of those spurious
          revivalists, who came about making a great noise, and doing no good
          whatever, but scorching and burning up the ground, where other men
          might have sown the good seed of the kingdom. I wonder that any man
          should be so self-conceited as to call himself a revivalist, or
          profess to be a revival-maker: let this be known, as my opinion, he is
          a nuisance and nothing better. But where a church is cautious, where
          the minister exercises scrutiny, and all possible means are taken to
          see into character, it gives us great pleasure that they are of the
          right sort. Ah! beloved, you should be at our church meetings
          sometimes, and hear the sweet words of experience which are uttered
          there. I am sure you would say, that they, |fly as the doves to their
          windows.| Now and then there comes before me an old croaking raven,
          that wants to come in; but we are soon able to tell the raven from the
          dove. It may be, that now and then a raven gets into our church; but I
          do hope that the majority are doves. We have seen them so humble, so
          meek, trusting alone in Jesus, like timid doves, half afraid to speak
          and tell you, and yet so loving, that they seemed as if they had sat
          on the finger of Jesus, and picked their food from between his lips;
          we have marked their conduct afterwards, and seen it to be holy and
          consistent. We will glory before the world, that notwithstanding the
          numbers that have been added to us, we have had to cut off as few as
          any church in the world -- but one in a year, out of our vast body!
          and that one was received from another church, and therefore had never
          been examined thoroughly. O my brethren, always try to give the church
          pleasure by your dove-like conversation. |Be wise as serpents, but
          harmless as doves.| Such was your Master's teaching. Let your
          character be --
        </p>
        <p>|Humble, teachable, and mild,</p>
        <p>Changed into a little child;</p>
        <p>Pleased with all the Lord provides,</p>
        <p>Weaned from all the world besides.|</p>
        <p>
          |Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth.|
          Be not like the unclean bird, that will devour all kinds of filth; but
          be like the dove, that liveth on the |good corn of the kingdom.| And
          be ye sure that you are like them, loving and kind one to another;
          and, like them, always mourn when you lose your mate; weep when your
          Jesus is gone from you, and you lose his delightful presence. Be ye
          like the dove in all these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: the church feels pleasure, not only in their character, but in
          their condition. Like doves |that fly.| Lowth translates this portion
          of the verse |like doves on the wing.| The church feels pleasure in
          thinking that her converts are |like doves on the wing.| Do you never,
          beloved, get into such a condition, that you are not like a dove on
          the wing, but like a dove in a secret place, in the cleft of the rock,
          hiding yourself in darkness, because you are afraid to be seen? For my
          own part, I am often not like a dove on the wing, but like a dove
          hiding its head under its wing, afraid to fly. But |he reneweth our
          strength like the eagle's.| There is a moulting time for the Lord's
          doves; but their feathers grow again, and then they have the wings of
          the dove, covered with silver, and their feathers with yellow gold;
          and they can fly upwards towards Jesus. And will not our church
          rejoice, when her converts appear to be all on the wing, not doubting,
          fearful converts, not converts that stand timidly, afraid to come; but
          converts on the wing, flying upwards towards Jesus, prayerful,
          laborious, active; not sitting still, doing nothing, but labouring and
          flying upwards towards Jesus. These are the converts we want. And the
          church is pleased when she can say, |Who are these that are like doves
          on the wing?|
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore; the translation of the Septuagint gives us another idea.
          |Who are these that fly like doves with their young?| The church
          rejoices at the company that the converts bring with them. How
          charming is the sight when a father unites himself with the people of
          God, and then his children after him! We had an instance a little
          while ago here, of two sons followed by their mother, and we have had
          many instances of a mother following her daughters, and of daughters
          following their mothers, and sons following their fathers. Oh! how
          blessed it is, to see the doves come with their young! If there is
          anything more beautiful than a dove, it is the little dove that flieth
          by its side. Beloved, do you not rejoice, some of you, that you have
          your children in the church? that you can run your eye along the pew,
          where your offspring are sitting with you, and can say, |Ah! glory be
          to God, it is not only I that have received his mercy, but here are my
          sons, too; and there sits my daughter drinking from the same well as I
          draw from; living on the same spiritual manna, looking to the same
          cross for salvation, and hoping for the same heaven! But I notice some
          families here -- I could point them out if I would: I notice them with
          sadness; where there is a father and a mother, both of them heirs of
          heaven, but of whose sons we have no evidence and no hope that they
          are the children of God. And there are some of you, my friends, whose
          young ones have come before you. We have daughters here that have
          prayerless mothers; we have sons that have ungodly fathers. Oh! does
          it not seem hard that the children should be in the kingdom before the
          parents? For if it be hard that a parent should see his children
          perishing, surely there is tenfold horror in the thought of children
          saved, and parents going to hell; your offspring entering into the joy
          of their Lord, and ye yourselves cast |into outer darkness, where
          there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.| Daughter of
          Zion! plead for your children. Men of Jerusalem! plead for your
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          The church, again, feels pleasure at the direction in which these
          doves move. |Who are these that fly as the doves to their windows?|
          Where should the dove fly to else but to its dovecot? The word means
          the dovecot, where the doves live, the little pigeon holes, into which
          the doves enter and dwell. The joy of the church is, that the poor
          sinner does not fly to man, nor to the law, but flies to Christ, the
          dovecot! I can recollect when, like a poor dove, sent out by Noah from
          his hand, I flew over the wide expanse of waters, and hoped to find
          some place where I might rest my wearied wing. Up towards the north I
          flew; and my eye looked keenly through the mist and darkness, if
          perhaps it might find some floating substance, on which my soul might
          rest its foot, but it found nothing. Again it turned its wing, and
          flapped it, but not so rapidly as before, across that deep water that
          knew no shore; but still there was no rest. The raven had found his
          resting-place upon a floating body, and was feeding itself upon the
          carrion of some drowned man's carcass; but my poor soul found none. I
          went on: thought I saw a ship floating out at sea; it was the ship of
          the law; and I thought I would put my feet on its canvass, or rest
          myself on its cordage for a time, and find some refuge. But ah! it was
          an airy phantom, on which I could not rest; for my foot had no right
          to rest on the law, I had not kept it, and the soul that keepeth it
          not must die. At last I saw the barque Christ Jesus -- that happy ark;
          and I thought I would fly thither; but my poor wing was weary, and I
          could fly no further, and down I sank into the water, but as
          providence would have it, when my wings were flagging, and I dropped
          into the stream to be drowned, just below me was the roof of the ark,
          and I saw a hand put out from it, that took me, and said, |I have
          loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore I have not delivered
          the soul of my turtle dove into the company of the wicked; come in,
          come in!| and then I found I had an olive branch in my mouth of peace
          with God and peace with man, plucked off with Jesus' power. Poor soul!
          hast thou found a resting-place in the ark? hast thou fled to thy
          window? or art thou, O Ephraim, like the silly dove that hath no
          heart, that goeth down to Egypt, and resteth itself in Assyria? Oh,
          say thou, why is it that thou are looking for rest, where none can be
          found? There be many that say, |Who will show us any good? Lord, lift
          thou up the light of thy countenance upon me!| That is the dove's
          resting-place; that is his house. Have you found your home in Christ?
          If you have not, when the storm comes, O dove, with ruffled plumage
          thou shalt be driven before the swift tempest; thou shalt be blown
          along like a small feather before the stream, onward, onward, through
          the dark unknown until thou findest thyself with burned and singed
          wings, falling into flames that have no bottom. The Lord give you
          deliverance, and help you to fly to Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now we come to our third point -- the CHURCH's ANXIETY. |Ah!|
          says the church, |it is all very well their flying like a cloud; it is
          all right their going as doves to their windows; but who are they?|
          The church is anxious, and she anxiously desires to be sure that it is
          all gold that is put into her treasury; for she suspects that some of
          those lumps of bullion cannot be gold. She thinks, |surely that is not
          all genuine metal, or there would not be so much of it;| and she says,
          |Who are they?| That is the question! Now I address myself to an
          anxious church to answer it.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they are those that fly. Our text says, |Who are these that
          fly?| They are those who fly because they cannot stop where they were,
          and they are flying somewhere else for refuge. We trust that those who
          have joined our church are those who are persuaded that the land
          wherein they dwelt is to be consumed with fire, who feel a necessity
          to come out of the place where they once lived, and have a strong
          desire to seek |a city that has foundations, whose builder and maker
          is God.| We hope, beloved, that those who have joined with us here are
          those who are escaping from hell and flying to heaven; such as once
          had no sins that they cared for, but now come out because they needs
          must come, for their house has got too hot for them, and they cannot
          abide any longer in their sins. Here we have the idea of conviction.
          They are those that fly. They are not content now to make their nest
          of their own good works, with here and there a little bit of down
          picked off Morality-common, and here apiece of yarn that they have
          picked up in Legality palace, and here a piece of good work that they
          have found in the barn-yard of Ceremonialism. No; they are poor souls
          that have no rest anywhere, but a re flying, and flying with rapid
          wing, until they can get to their windows. Are you such, my beloved,
          that have joined the church? or are you not? If you are not, you have
          deceived me, and you have deceived the church, for we thought you
          were; we want to have none united with us but those who are flying to
          us. We want no self-righteous ones; no self-sufficient ones, no good
          moral people; we want those who feel that they are ragged sinners,
          clothed by Jesus; poor dead sinners, made alive by Jesus. I ask God,
          when I ask him to give me any, to give me those who are flying with
          haste for a Saviour; and if any of you that have come to us making a
          profession of flying are not such, I beseech you by everything that is
          solemn, by that hell of hypocrites, which is the hell of hells, and by
          the heaven you would lose, to bethink yourselves how sinfully you are
          acting, in continuing members of a Christian church when you are
          hypocrites and have never fled.
        </p>
        <p>
          But again: they are those who fly not on the ground, but like a cloud,
          up high. We know many a church, to which the people come, because
          there is so much charity connected with it. I know some country
          churches in the Establishment which are attended by some people,
          because there are regularly given away so many sixpences after the
          service. That is flying like a will-o'-the-wisp, dancing about in dark
          marshy places. If I could buy all London for my congregation by the
          turn of a threepenny piece, I would not give it. If people do not come
          from some better motives, we do not wish to have any. But we have none
          of that sort, we trust. They fly higher than these groundlings. Zion
          rejoiced that they did not fly on the ground, but flew like a cloud.
          They were persons that did not care about the world, but wanted
          heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were souls filled with rain, like the clouds; or if they were not
          big and black with rain, as the clouds sometimes are when they are
          about to burst, yet they had a little grace in them, a little
          moisture, a little dew.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they were persons driven by the wind, just as the clouds are --
          who do not move of themselves, but go because they must go -- who have
          no power of themselves to move, but have something driving them
          behind. Brethren, we hope that the converts of this church have been
          driven to us by the power of the Holy Ghost, and could not help
          coming, and they have been men filled with rain, which they will drop
          out upon us in copious showers, if God pleases. They have been like
          the clouds, which tarry not for man, neither wait for the sons of men.
          They are come with us now: and we hope to see the clouds go up higher
          and higher, into the air, until those clouds shall one by one, be
          swallowed up in Jesus, shall be lost in the one assembly of the
          First-born Church of the Holy Ghost. These are the persons who |fly as
          a cloud.|
        </p>
        <p>
          We give thee yet another answer, O thou timid church. Those who come
          to join themselves with thee are persons who have been regenerated;
          for they are doves. They were not doves by nature; they were ravens;
          but they are doves now. They are changed from ravens into doves, from
          lions into lambs. Beloved, it is very easy for you to pretend to be
          the children of God; but it is not easy for you to be so. The old
          fable of the jackdaw dressed up in peacock's feathers often takes
          place now. Many a time have we seen coming to our church, a fine
          strutting fellow, with long feathers of prayer behind him. He could
          pray gloriously; and he has come strutting in, with all his majesty
          and pride, and said, |Surely I must come; I have everything about me;
          am I not rich and polite? have I not learning and talent?| In a very
          little while we have found him to be nothing but an old prattling
          jackdaw, having none of the true feathers belonging to him; by some
          accident one of his borrowed feathers have dropped out, and we have
          found him to be a hypocrite. I beseech you, do not be hypocrites. The
          glory of the gospel is not that it paints ravens white, and
          whitewashes blackbirds, but that it turns them into doves. it is the
          glory of our religion not that it makes a man seem what he is not, but
          that it makes him something else. It takes the raven and turns him
          into a dove; his ravenish heart becomes a dove's heart. It is not the
          feathers that are changed, but the man himself. Glorious Gospel, which
          takes a lion, and doth not cut the lion's mane off, and then cover him
          with a sheep's skin, but makes him into a lamb! O church of God! these
          that have come like doves to their windows are trophies of
          regenerating grace, which has transformed them, and made them as new
          creatures in Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last answer I shall give respecting those who have come to join
          themselves with us is, that they are those, we hope, who have fled to
          their windows, and found a refuge in Christ my Lord. There is nothing
          we want to know of a person coming before the church, except this.
          Dost thou believe on the Lord Jesus Christ? Hast thou had pardon from
          his hands? Hast thou had union with his person? Dost thou hold
          communion with him day by day? Is he thy hope, thy stay, thy refuge,
          thy trust? If so, then thou mayest come in. If thou art one living in
          the dovecot we will not drive thee away; if thou hast fled like a dove
          to thy window, we are glad to have thee. But there is the anxious
          question -- Have you fled to Christ? Beloved, there are some who think
          they have fled to Christ that have not; and there are some who think
          they have not fled to Christ that have. There are some of you who
          think yourselves safe for heaven, that are nothing but whitewashed
          sepulchres, like the Pharisees of old. It is a horrible thought, that
          there are some, we fear, who lay their head upon their death pillow,
          as they think, in sure and certain hope of a glorious resurrection,
          but will in hell lift up their eyes, being in torment. A dove, you
          know, can find good shelter for itself in other places beside a
          dovecot; there may be some little hole in the barn, and in there the
          dove gets and builds its nest, and is very happy and comfortable. Ah!
          dove, but there is no place that will protect you that is not a
          dovecot; and there is only one dovecot. You have built a nice snug
          nest perhaps in some of your trees; you are building your hope in some
          one of your merits; you are putting your trust in some of your own
          works. It is all in vain. There is only one dovecot. |Other foundation
          can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ and him
          crucified.| There is only one hope for a poor sinner from the justice
          of Jehovah; and that is in the |Man of sorrows and acquainted with
          grief,| who |gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that
          plucked off the hair.| Do you know how that dovecot was made for you?
          Do you know how it is lined for you, and how large the door is? It was
          made by Jesus, the carpenter's son; it is lined with the blood of his
          own heart; and the door is so wide that the biggest sinner can get in,
          but he who has any righteousness will find that the door is not large
          enough to let him carry his righteousness with him. Poor soul! hast
          thou a dovecot? and art thou living in it? If so, we rejoice with
          thee, and glad enough should we be to have thee united with our
          church; for we love all those who love the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet,
          lest thou shouldst not understand our holy religion, one moment shall
          suffice, and thou shalt go. Dost thou not know that the law which God
          made on Sinai has been broken by us all, and that God, the |jealous
          God,| will |by no means spare the guilty?| And dost thou not know, O
          sinner, that thou must offer something to God, to make up a recompense
          for what thou hast done? Dost thou not know, that God is so angry with
          the man who sins, that he will damn that man, unless there is some one
          who will be damned for him, and suffer the punishment in his stead?
          And dost thou not know, that our religion is a religion of
          substitution -- that Jesus Christ the Son of God became man; that he
          might take the punishment we ought to have had; that he bore the wrath
          we ought to have borne; that he took the guilt we committed, just as
          the scape-goat of old did, and carried it right away into the
          wilderness of forgetfulness; so that now a sinner who is putting his
          trust in that substitution can escape punishment. God's justice cannot
          demand payment twice --
        </p>
        <p>|First at my bleeding Surety's hands,</p>
        <p>And then again at mine.|</p>
        <p>
          Precious Jesus! what a substitute thou wast for guilt? Sweet Lord
          Jesus! I kiss thy wounds this day; thou Man! thou God! thou who didst
          wrestle with Jacob! thou who didst walk with Abraham, the man of God,
          of Mamre! thou who stoodst in the fiery furnace with Shadrach,
          Meshach, and Abednego! Thou Son of God, thou Son of Man, who didst
          appear to Joshua with thy sword drawn! I worship thee, my substitute,
          my hope! Oh! that others might do so too, and that the whole of this
          vast multitude might, with one heart, accept him as their Saviour!
