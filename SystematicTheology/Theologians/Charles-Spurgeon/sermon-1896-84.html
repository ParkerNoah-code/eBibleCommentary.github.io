          23. They that go down to the sea in ships, trading in the great
          waters, 24. See the works of Jehovah, his wonders in the deep.25. He
          speaks, and raiseth the stormy wind, and causeth the billows thereof
          to mount on high.26. They mount up to the heavens, they descend into
          the deeps; their soul breaketh because of trouble.27. They are tossed
          and totter like a drunken man, and all their senses are overwhelmed.
          And they cry to Jehovah in their straits, and he rescues them from
          their troubles.29. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves
          thereof are still.30. And they rejoice because they are calmed; and he
          brings them to the coast which they desired.31. Let them celebrate the
          mercy of Jehovah in his presence, and his wonders among the sons of
          men; 32. And let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, and
          praise him in the assembly of the elders.

          23. They that go down to the sea in ships Here we have another
          instance of God's superintending care towards mankind pointed out to
          us by the prophet, exemplified in the bringing of those who are
          shipwrecked to the harbour, and this, too, as if he had raised them
          from the depth and darkness of the tomb, and brought them to live in
          the light of day. I do not understand what is here said about those
          who are accustomed to navigate the ocean seeing the wonders of God, as
          referring generally to the many wonderful things with which it
          abounds. Such persons are well fitted to bear testimony regarding the
          works of God, because they there behold more vast and various wonders
          than are to be seen upon earth. But it appears to me preferable to
          connect this with the subsequent context, where the prophet is his own
          interpreter, and where he shows how suddenly God raises and calms the
          tempest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sum of the matter is, that the scope of the passage is to point
          out that the lives of those who navigate the seas are often in great
          jeopardy by the storms which they encounter; because, as often as the
          ocean heaves and is agitated, and the billows rise and rage, so often
          does death stare them in the face. But he furnishes us with a still
          more vivid picture of the providence of God; for in telling us, that
          the sea does not of its own accord rise into a tempest, he makes use
          of the verb, he speaks, intimating that the word and providence of God
          make the winds blow, to agitate the sea. True, indeed, the mariners
          imagine from certain phenomena, that a storm is approaching, but
          sudden changes proceed only from the secret appointment of God.
          Therefore, he gives not merely a historical narrative of the manner in
          which squalls and storms arise, but, assuming the character of a
          teacher, begins with the cause itself, and then directs to the
          imminent danger with which the tempest is fraught; or rather,
          portrays, as in a picture, the image of death, in order that the
          goodness of God may appear the more conspicuous when the tempest
          happily ceases without any loss of life. They mount up, says he, to
          the heavens, they descend into the deeps; as if he should say, they
          mount up into the air, so that their life may be destroyed, and then
          they tumble down towards the caverns of the ocean, where they may be
          drowned. Next, he mentions the fears which torment them, or rather
          which may deprive them of understanding; intimating by these words,
          that however skilfully mariners may steer their vessels, they may
          happen to be deprived of their senses; and being thus paralysed, they
          could not avail themselves of aid, were it even at hand. For though
          they collect all their tackling, cast their sounding line into the
          deep, and unfurl their sails to all points, yet after making every
          attempt, and all human skill is baffled, they give themselves up to
          the mercy of wind and wave. All hope of safety being cut off, no
          farther means are employed by them. And now that all human aid fails,
          they cry unto God for deliverance, which is a convincing evidence that
          they had been as it were dead.

          29. He maketh the storm a calm A profane author, in narrating the
          history of such an event, would have said, that the winds were hushed,
          and the raging billows were calmed; but the Spirit of God, by this
          change of the storm into a calm, places the providence of God as
          presiding over all; thereby meaning, that it was not by human agency
          that this violent commotion of the sea and wind, which threatened to
          subvert the frame of the world, was so suddenly stilled. When,
          therefore, the sea is agitated, and boils up in terrific fury, as if
          wave were contending with wave, whence is it that instantly it is calm
          and peaceful, but that God restrains the raging of the billows, the
          contention of which was so awful, and makes the bosom of the deep as
          smooth as a mirror? Having spoken of their great terror, he proceeds
          next to mention their joy, so that their ingratitude may appear the
          more striking, if they forget their remarkable deliverance. For they
          are not in want of a monitor, having been abundantly instructed by the
          storm itself, and by the calm which ensued, that their lives were in
          the hand and under the protection of God. Moreover, he informs them
          that this is a species of gratitude which deserves not only to be
          acknowledged privately, or to be mentioned in the family, but that it
          should be praised and magnified in all places, even in the great
          assemblies. He makes specific mention of the elders, intimating that
          the more wisdom and experience a person has, the more capable is he of
          listening to, and being a witness of, these praises.
