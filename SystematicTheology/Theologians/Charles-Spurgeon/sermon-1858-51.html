        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.215)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 26, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>
          |For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
          government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
          Wonderful, Counsellor.| -- Isaiah 9:6.
        </p>
        <p>
          LAST SABBATH MORNING we considered the first title, |His name shall be
          called Wonderful:| this morning we take the second word, |Counsellor.|
          I need not repeat the remark, that of course these titles belong only
          to the Lord Jesus Christ, and that we cannot understand the passage
          except by referring it to Messiah -- the Prince. It was by a
          Counsellor that this world was ruined. Did not Satan mask himself in
          the serpent, and counsel the woman with exceeding craftiness, that she
          should take unto herself of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good
          and evil, in the hope that thereby she should be as God? Was it not
          that evil counsel which provoked our mother to rebel against her
          Maker, and did it not as the effect of sin, bring death into this
          world with all its train of woe? Ah! beloved, it was meet that the
          world should have a Counsellor to restore it, if it had a Counsellor
          to destroy it. It was by counsel that it fell and certainly, without
          counsel it never could have arisen. But mark the difficulties that
          surrounded such a Counsellor. Tis easy to counsel mischief; but how
          hard to counsel wisely! To cast down is easy, but to build up how
          hard! To confuse this world, and bring upon it all its train of ills
          was, an easy thing. A woman plucked the fruit and it was done; but to
          restore order to this confusion, to sweep away the evils which brooded
          over this fair earth, this was work indeed, and |Wonderful| was that
          Christ who came forward to attempt the work, and who in the plentitude
          of his wisdom hath certainly accomplished it, to his own honor and
          glory, and to our comfort and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall now enter upon the discussion of this title which is given to
          Christ, a title peculiar to our Redeemer; and you will see why it
          should be given to him and why there was a necessity for such a
          Counsellor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, our Lord Jesus Christ is a Counsellor in a three-fold sense.
          First, he is God's Counsellor; he sits in the cabinet council of the
          King of heaven; he has admittance into the privy chamber, and is the
          Counsellor with God. In the second place, Christ is a Counsellor in
          the sense which the Septuagint translation appends to this term.
          Christ is said to be the angel of the great council. He is a
          Counsellor in that he communicates to us in God's behalf, what has
          been done in the great council before the foundation of the world. And
          thirdly, Christ is a Counsellor to us and with us, because we can
          consult with him, and he doth counsel and advise us as to the right
          way and the path of peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Beginning then, with the first point, Christ may well be called
          Counsellor, for he is a COUNSELLOR WITH GOD. And here let us speak
          with reverence, for we are about to enter upon a very solemn subject.
          It hath been revealed to us that before the world was, when as yet God
          had not made the stars, long ere space sprang into being, the Almighty
          God did hold a solemn conclave with himself; Father, Son and Spirit
          held a mystic council with each other, as to what they were about to
          do. That council, although we read but little of it in Scripture, was
          nevertheless most certainly held; we have abundant traces of it, for
          though it is a doctrine obscure through the effulgence of that light
          to which no man can approach, and not simply and didactically
          explained, as some other doctrines are, yet we have continual tracings
          and incidental mentionings of that great, eternal and wonderful
          council, which was held between the three glorious persons of Trinity
          before the world began. Our first question with ourselves is, why did
          God hold a council at all? And here, we must answer, that God did not
          hold a council because of any deficiency in his knowledge, for God
          understandeth all things from the beginning; his knowledge is the sum
          total of everything that is noble, and infinite is that sum total,
          infinitely above everything that is counted noble. Thou, O God, hast
          thoughts that are unsearchable, and thou knowest what no mortal ken
          can ever attain unto. Nor, again, did God hold any consultation for
          the increase of his satisfaction. Sometimes men, when they have
          determined what to do, will nevertheless seek counsel of their
          friends, because they say, |If their advice agrees with mine it adds
          to my satisfaction. and confirms me in my resolution.| But God is
          everlastingly satisfied with himself, and Knoweth not the shadow of a
          doubt to cloud his purpose; therefore, the council was not held with
          any motive or intent of that sort. Nor, again, was it held with a view
          of deliberation; Men take weeks and months and sometimes years, to
          think out a thing that is surrounded with difficulties; they have to
          find the clue with much research; enveloped in folds of mystery, they
          have to take off first one garment and then another, before they find
          out the naked glorious truth. Not so God. God's deliberations are as
          flashes of lightning; they are as wise as if he had been eternally
          considering, but the thoughts of his heart, though swift as lightning,
          are as perfect as the whole system of the universe. The reason why God
          is represented as holding a council, if I think rightly, is this: that
          we might understand how wise God is. |In the multitude of counsellors
          there is wisdom.| It is for us to think that in the council of the
          Eternal Three, each Person in the undivided Trinity being omniscient
          and full of wisdom, there must have been the sum total of all wisdom.
          And again, it was to show the unanimity and co-operation of the sacred
          persons: God the Father hath done nothing alone in creation or
          salvation. Jesus Christ hath done nothing alone; for even the work of
          his redemption, albeit that he suffered in some sense alone, needed
          the sustaining hand of the Spirit, and the accepting smile of the
          Father, before it could be completed. God said not, |I will make man,|
          but |Let us make man in our own image.| God saith not merely, |I will
          save,| but the inference from the declarations of Scripture is, that
          the design of the three persons of the blessed Trinity was to save a
          people to themselves, who should show forth their praise. It was,
          then, for our sakes, not for God's sake, the council was held -- that
          we might know the unanimity of the glorious persons, and the deep
          wisdom of their devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet another remark concerning the council. It may be asked, |What were
          the topics deliberated upon at that first council, which was held
          before the day-star knew its place, and planets ran their round?| We
          reply, |The first topic was creation.| We are told in the passage we
          have read, (Proverbs viii,) that the Lord Jesus Christ, who represents
          himself as Wisdom, was with God before the world was created, and we
          have every reason to believe that we are to understand this as
          meaning, that he was not only with God in company, but with God in
          co-operation. Besides, we have other Scriptures to prove that |all
          things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that
          was made.| And to quote yet another passage that clinches this truth.
          God said, |Let us make man;| so that a part of the consultation was
          with reference to the making of worlds, and the creatures that should
          inhabit them. I believe that in the sovereign council of eternity, the
          mountains were weighed in scales, and the hills in balances; then was
          it fixed in sovereign council how far the sea should go, and where
          should be its bounds -- when the sun should arise and come forth, like
          a giant from the chambers of his darkness, and when he should return
          again to his couch of rest. Then did God decree the moment when he
          should say, |Let there be light,| and the moment when the sun should
          be turned into darkness, and the moon into a clot of blood. Then did
          he ordain the form and size of every angel, and the destinies of every
          creature; then did he sketch in his infinite thought, the eagle as he
          soared to heaven and the worm as he burrowed into the earth. Then the
          little as well as the great, the minute as well as the immense, came
          under the sovereign decree of God. There was that book written, of
          which Dr. Watts sings --
        </p>
        <p>|Chained to his throne a volume lies,</p>
        <p>With all the fates of men,</p>
        <p>With every angel's form and size,</p>
        <p>Drawn by th' eternal pen.|</p>
        <p>
          Christ was a Counsellor in the matter of creation; with none else took
          he counsel; none else instructed him. Christ was the Counsellor for
          all the wondrous works of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second topic that was discussed in this council was the work of
          Providence. God does not act towards this world like a man who makes a
          watch, and lets it have its own way till it runs down; he is the
          controller of every wheel in the machine of providence. He has left
          nothing to itself. We talk of general laws, and philosophers tell us
          that the world is governed by laws, and then they put the Almighty out
          of the question. Now, how can a nation be governed by laws apart from
          a sovereign, or apart from magistrates and rulers to carry out the
          laws? All the laws may be in the statute book, but put all the police
          away, take away every magistrate, remove the high court of parliament,
          what is the use of laws? Laws cannot govern without active agency to
          carry them out; nor could nature proceed in its everlasting cycles, by
          the mere force of law. God is the great motive-power of all things; he
          is in everything. Not only did he make all things, but by him all
          things consist. From all eternity, Christ was the Counsellor of his
          Father with regard to providence -- when the first man should be born,
          when he should wander, and when he should be restored -- when the
          first monarchy should rise, and when its sun should set -- where his
          people should be placed, how long they should be placed, and where
          they should be moved. Was it not the Most High who divided to the
          nations their inheritance? Hath he not appointed the bounds of our
          habitation? Oh! heir of heaven, in the day of the great council Christ
          counselled his Father as to the weight of thy trials, as to the number
          of thy mercies, if they be numerable, and as to the time, the way, and
          the means whereby thou shouldst be brought to himself. Remember, there
          is nothing that happens in your daily life, but what was first of all
          devised in eternity, and counselled by Jesus Christ for your good and
          in your behalf, that all things might work together for your lasting
          benefit and profit. But, my friends, what unfathomable depths of
          wisdom must have been involved, when God consulted with himself with
          regard to the great book of providence! Oh, how strange providence
          seems to you and to me! Does it not look like a zig-zag line, this way
          and that way, backward and forward, like the journeyings of the
          children of Israel in the wilderness? Ah! my brethren, but to God it
          is a straight line. Directly, God always goes to his object. and yet
          to us, he often seems to go round about. Ah! Jacob, the Lord is about
          to provide for thee in Egypt, when there is a famine in Canaan, and he
          is about to make thy son Joseph great and mighty. Joseph must be sold
          for a slave; he must be accused wrongfully, he must be put into the
          pit, and in the round-house prison he must suffer. But God was going
          straight to his purpose all the while: he was sending Joseph before
          them into Egypt that they might be provided for, and when the good old
          patriarch said, |All these things are against me,| he did not perceive
          the providence of God, for there was not a solitary thing in the whole
          list that was against him, but everything was ruled for his weal. Let
          us learn to leave providence in the hand of the Counsellor, let us
          rest assured that he is too wise to err in his predestination, and too
          good to be unkind, and that in the council of eternity, the best was
          ordained that could have been ordained -- that if you and I had been
          there, we could not have ordained half so well, but that we should
          have made ourselves eternal fools by meddling therewith. Rest certain,
          that in the end we shall see that all was well, and must be well for
          ever. He is |Wonderful, the Counsellor,| for he counselled in matters
          of providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now with regard to matters of grace. These were also discussed in
          the everlasting council. When the Three Divine Persons in the solemn
          seclusion of their own loneliness consulted together with reference to
          the works of grace, one of the first things they had to consider was,
          how God should be just and yet the justifier of the ungodly -- how the
          world should be reconciled unto God. Hence you read in the book of
          Zechariah, if you turn to the sixth chapter and the thirteenth verse,
          this passage -- |The council of peace shall be between them both.| The
          Son of God with his Father and the Spirit, ordained the council of
          peace. Thus was it arranged. The Son must suffer, he must be the
          substitute, must bear his people's sins and be punished in their
          stead; the Father must accept the Son's substitution and allow his
          people to go free, because Christ had paid their debts. The Spirit of
          the living God must then cleanse the people whom the blood had
          pardoned, and so they must be accepted before the presence of God,
          even the Father. That was the result of the great council. But O my
          brethren, if it had not been for that council, what a question would
          have been left unsolved? Neither you nor I could ever have thought how
          the two should meet together -- how mercy and justice should kiss each
          other over the mountain of our sins. I have always thought that one of
          the greatest proofs that the gospel is of God, is its revelation that
          Christ died to save sinners. That is a thought so original, so new so
          wonderful; you have not got it in any other religion in the world; so
          that it must have come from God. As I remember to have heard an
          un-schooled and illiterate man say, when I first told him the simple
          story of how Christ was punished in the stead of his people: he burst
          out with an air of surprise, |Faith! that's the gospel, I know; no man
          could have made that up; that must be of God.| That wonderful thought,
          that a God himself should die, that he himself should bear our sins,
          that so God the Father might be able to forgive and yet exact the
          utmost penalty, is super-human, super-angelic; not even the cherubim
          and seraphim could have been the inventors of it: but that thought was
          first struck out from the mind of God in the councils of eternity,
          when the |Wonderful, the Counsellor,| was present with his Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, another part of the great council was this -- who should be
          saved, Now my friends, you that like not old Calvinistic doctrine will
          perhaps be horrified but that I cannot help; I will never modify a
          doctrine I believe to please any man that walks upon earth; but I will
          prove from Scripture that I have the warrant of God in this matter,
          and that it is not my own invention. I say that one part of the
          council of eternity was the predestination of those whom God had
          determined to save, and I will read you the passage that proves it.
          |In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
          according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the
          counsel of his own will.| The predestination of everyone of God's
          people was arranged at the eternal council, where God's will sat as
          the sovereign umpire and undisputed president. There was it said of
          each redeemed one, |At such an hour I will call him by my grace, for I
          have loved him with an everlasting love, and by my lovingkindness will
          I draw him.| There was it originated when the peace-speaking blood
          shall be laid to that elect one's conscience, when the Spirit of the
          living God shall breathe joy and consolation into his heart. There was
          it settled how that chosen one should be |kept by the power of God
          through faith unto salvation; and there was it determined and settled
          by two immutable things, wherein it is impossible for God to lie, that
          everyone of these should be eternally saved, beyond the shadow of a
          risk of perishing. The apostle Paul was not like some preachers, who
          are afraid to say a word about the everlasting council, for he says in
          his epistle to the Hebrews -- |God willing more abundantly to show
          unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his council, confirmed
          it by an oath.| Now, you hear some talk about the immutability of the
          promise: that is good. But the immutability of God's counsel, -- that
          is to fathom to the very uttermost the doctrines of grace. The council
          of God from all eternity is immutable; not one purpose has he ever
          altered, not one decree has he ever changed, he has nailed his decrees
          against the pillars of eternity, and though the devils have sought to
          rend them down from the posts of his magnificent palace, yet, saith
          he, |have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion;| the decree shall
          stand; I will do all my pleasure. Thy counsels of old are faithfulness
          and truth, thou, Lord, in the beginning hast made the heavens and laid
          the foundations of the earth, thou hast determined thy plans and
          purposes, and they stand fast for ever and ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I have sufficiently declared how Christ was the Counsellor, in
          the transcendent affairs of nature, providence, and grace, in the
          everlasting council-chamber of eternity. But now I would have you
          notice what a mercy it was that there was such a Counsellor with God,
          and how fit Christ was to be the Counsellor. Christ himself is wisdom.
          He chargeth his angels with folly; but he is God only wise himself. If
          a fool undertake to be a counsellor, his counsel is folly, but when
          Christ counselled, his counsel was full of wisdom. But there is
          another qualification necessary for a counsellor. However wise a man
          be, he has no right to be a counsellor with a king, unless he has some
          dignity and standing. There may happen to be in my congregation some
          person of great talent, but if my friend should present himself at the
          cabinet council and give his advice, he would most probably be
          unceremoniously dismissed, for they would say, |Art thou of the king's
          council; if not, what right hast thou to stand here?| Now Christ was
          glorious; he was equal with his Father, therefore he had a right to
          counsel God -- to counsel with God. Had an angel offered his advice to
          God it would have been as insufferable impertinence; had the cherubim
          or seraphim volunteered to give so much as one word of counsel it
          would have been blasphemy. He would take no counsel from his
          creatures. Why should wisdom stoop from its throne, to counsel with
          created folly? But because Christ was far above all principalities and
          powers and every name that is named, therefore he had a right, not
          only from his wisdom, but from his rank, to be a Counsellor with God.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is one thing that is always necessary in a man, before we
          can rejoice in his being a counsellor. There are some counsellors
          concerning the legislation of our country in whom you or I could not
          rejoice much, because we feel that in their counsels the most of us
          would be forgotten. Our farming friends would probably rejoice in
          them; they will consult their interests, there is not much doubt; but
          whoever heard of a counsellor yet who counselled for the poor? or who
          has these many years heard as much as an inkling of the name of a man
          who really counselled for economy and for the good of his nation. We
          have plenty of men who promise us that they will counsel for us --
          abundance of men who, if we would but return them to parliament would
          most assuredly pour forth such wisdom in our behalf that without doubt
          we should be the most happy and enlightened people in the world
          according to their promise. but alas! when they get into office they
          have no hearty sympathy with us; they belong to a different rank from
          the most of us, they do not sympathize with the wants and the desires
          of the middle class and of the poor. But, with regard to Christ, we
          can put every confidence in him, for we know that in that council from
          eternity he symphathized with man. He says, |My delights were with the
          sons of men.| Happy men to have a counsellor who delights in them!
          Moreover, he then though he was not man, yet foresaw that he was to be
          |bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh,| and therefore in the
          counsels of eternity he pleaded his own cause when he pleaded our
          cause, for he well knew that he was to be tempted in all points like
          as we are, and was to suffer our sufferings and to be our covenant
          head in union with ourselves. Sweet Counsellor! I love to think thou
          wast in the everlasting council, my friend, my brother born for
          adversity!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Having thus discussed the first point, I shall proceed to consider
          briefly the second, according to the translation of the Septuagint.
          Christ is THE ANGEL OF THE GREAT COUNCIL. Do you and I want to know
          what was said and done in the great council of eternity? Yes, we do. I
          will defy any man, whoever he may be, not to want to know something
          about destiny. What means the ignorance of the common people, when
          they appeal to the witch, the pretender? when they enquire of the
          astrologer, and read the book of the pretended soothsayer? Why, it
          means that man wants to know something about the everlasting council.
          And what mean all the perplexing researches of certain persons into
          the prophecies? I consider very often that the inferences drawn from
          prophecy are very little better, after all, than the guesses of the
          Norwood gipsey, and that some people who have been so busy in
          foretelling the end of the world, would have been better employed if
          they had foretold the end of their own books, and had not imposed on
          the public by predictions, assaying to interpret the prophecies,
          without the shadow of a foundation. But, from their credulity we may
          learn, that among the higher class as well as among the more ignorant,
          there is a strong desire to know the councils of eternity. Beloved,
          there is only one glass through which you and I can look back to the
          dim darkness of the shrouded past, and read the counsels of God, and
          that glass is the person of Jesus Christ. Do I want to know what God
          ordained with regard to the salvation of man from before the
          foundation of the world? I look to Christ; I find that it was ordained
          in Christ that he should be the first elect, and that a people should
          be chosen in him. Do you ask the way in which God ordained to save? I
          answer, he ordained to save by the cross. Do you ask how God ordained
          to pardon? The answer comes, he ordained to pardon through the
          sufferings of Christ, and to justify through his resurrection from the
          dead. Everything that you want to know with regard to what God
          ordained, everything that you ought to know, you can find out in the
          person of Jesus Christ. And again, do I long to know the great secret
          of destiny? I must look to Christ. What mean these wars, this
          confusion, these garments rolled in blood? I see Christ born of a
          virgin, and then I read the world's history backwards, and I see that
          all this led to Christ's coming. I see that all these leaned one upon
          another, as I have sometimes seen clusters of rocks leaning on each
          other, and Christ the great leading rock bearing up the superincumbent
          mass of all past history. And if I want to read the future I look at
          Christ, and I learn that he who has gone up to heaven, is to come
          again from heaven in like manner as he went up to heaven. So all the
          future is clear enough to me. I do not know whether the Pope of Rome
          is to obtain universal empire or not; I do not mind whether the
          Russian empire is to swallow up all the nations of the continent;
          there is one thing I know, God will overturn, overturn, overturn, till
          he shall come whose right it is to reign; and I know that though the
          worms devour my body, yet when he shall stand in the latter day upon
          the earth, in my flesh shall I see God, and there is enough in that
          for me. All the rest of history is unimportant compared with its end,
          its issues, its purpose. The end of the first Testament is the first
          advent of Christ; the end of this second Testament of modern history
          is the second advent of the Saviour and then shall the book of time be
          closed. But none could open the Old Testament history and make it out,
          except through Christ. Abraham could understand it, for he knew that
          Christ was to come; Christ opened the book for him. And so modern
          history is never to be understood except through Christ. None but the
          Lamb can take the book and open every seal; but he who believeth in
          Christ and looks for his glorious advent, he may open the book and
          read therein, and have understanding, for in Christ there is a
          revelation of the eternal councils.
        </p>
        <p>
          |Now,| says one, |Sir, I want to know one thing, and if I knew that, I
          would not care what happened. I want to know whether God from all
          eternity ordained me to be saved.| Well, friend, I will tell you how
          to find that out, and you may find it out to a certainty. |Nay,| says
          one, |but how can I know that? You cannot read the book of fate; that
          is impossible.| I have heard of some divine, of a very hyper school
          indeed, who said, |Ah! blessed be the Lord, there are some of God's
          dear people here; I can tell them by the very look of their faces. I
          know that they are among God's elect.| He was not half so discreet as
          Rowland Hill, who when he was advised to preach to none but the elect,
          said, |He would certainly do so if some one would chalk them all on
          the back first.| That was never attempted by anybody, so Rowland Hill
          went on preaching the gospel to every creature, as I desire to do. But
          you may find out whether you are among his chosen ones. |How?| says
          one. Why, Christ is the angel of the covenant, and you can find it out
          by looking to him. Many people want to know their election before they
          look to Christ. Beloved you cannot know your election, except as you
          see it in Christ. If you want to know your election, thus shall you
          assure your hearts before God. -- Do you feel yourself this morning to
          be a lost, guilty sinner? go straightway to the cross of Christ, and
          tell Christ that, and tell him that you have read in the Bible, |That
          him that cometh unto him he will in no wise cast out.| Tell him that
          he has said, |This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation,
          that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners of whom you are
          chief.| Look to Christ and believe on him, and you shall make proof of
          your election directly, for so surely as thou believest thou art
          elect. If thou wilt give thyself wholly up to Christ and trust him,
          then thou art one of God's chosen ones; but if you stop and say, |I
          want to know first whether I am elect,| that is impossible. If there
          be something covered up, and I say, |Now, before you can see this you
          must lift the veil;| and you say, |Nay, but I want to see right
          through that veil,| you cannot. Lift the veil first and you shall see.
          Go to Christ guilty, just as you are. Leave all curious inquiry about
          thy election alone. Go straight away to Christ, just as you are,
          black, naked, penniless and poor, and say,
        </p>
        <p>|Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling,|</p>
        <p>
          and you shall know your election. The assurance of the Holy Spirit
          shall be given to you, so that you shall be able to say, |I know whom
          I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which
          I have committed to him.| Now do notice this. Christ was at the
          everlasting council: he can tell you whether you were chosen or not,
          but you cannot find that out anyhow else. You go and put your trust in
          him, and I know what the answer will be. His answer will be -- |I have
          loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore in lovingkindness have
          I drawn thee.| There will be no doubt about his having chosen you,
          when you shall feel no doubt about having chosen him.
        </p>
        <p>
          So much for the second point. Christ is the Counsellor. He is the
          angel of the council, because he tells out God's secrets to us. |The
          secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show them
          his covenant.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The last point was, Christ is A COUNSELLOR TO US. And here I
          shall want to give some practical hints to God's people. Some how or
          other, brethren, it is not good for man to be alone. A lonely man must
          be, I think, a miserable man, and a man without a Counsellor, I think,
          must of necessity go wrong. |Where there is no counsellor,| says
          Solomon, |the people fall.| I think most persons will find it so. A
          man says, |Well, I'll have my own way, and I will ask nobody.| Have
          it, sir, -- have it -- and you will find that in having your own way
          you have probably had the worst way you could. We all feel our need at
          times of a counsellor. David was a man after God's own heart and dealt
          much with his God; but he had his Ahithophel, with whom he took sweet
          council, and they walked to the house of God in company. Kings must
          have some advisers. Woe unto the man that hath got a bad counsellor.
          Rehoboam took counsel of the young men, and not of the old men, and
          they counselled him so that he lost ten-twelfths of his empire. Some
          take counsel of stocks and stones. We know many who counsel at the
          hands of foolish charms, instead of going to Christ. They shall have
          to learn that there is but one Christ, who is to be trusted; and that
          however necessary a Counsellor may be, yet none other shall be found
          to fulfill the necessity, but Jesus Christ the Counsellor. Let me make
          a remark or two with regard to this Counsellor, Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, first, Christ is a necessary Counsellor. So sure as we do
          anything without asking counsel of God we fall into trouble. Israel
          made a league with Gibeon, and it is said, they took of their
          victuals, and they asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord, and
          they found out that the Gibeonites had deceived them. If they had
          asked counsel first, no cunning deception could have imposed on them
          in the matter. Saul, the son of Kish, died before the Lord upon the
          mountains of Gilboa, and in the book of Chronicles it is written, he
          died because he asked not counsel of God, but sought unto the wizards.
          Joshua, the great commander, when he was appointed to succeed Moses,
          was not left to go alone, but it is written, |And Eliezer the priest
          shall be his counsellor, and he shall ask counsel of the Lord for
          him.| And all the great men of olden times, when they were about to do
          an action, paused, and they said to the priest, |Bring hither the
          ephod,| and he put on the Urim and the Thummim, and appealed to God,
          and the answer came, and sound advice was vouchsafed. You and I will
          have to learn how necessary it is always to take advice of God. Did
          you ever seek God's advice on your knees about a difficulty and then
          go amiss? Brethren, I can testify for my God that when I have
          submitted my will to his directing Spirit, I have always had reason to
          thank him for his wise counsel. But when I have asked at his hands,
          having already made up my own mind, I have had my own way, but like as
          he fed the Israelites with the quails of heaven, while the meat was
          yet in their mouth, the wrath of God came upon them. Let us take heed
          always that we never go before the cloud. He that goes before the
          cloud goes a fool's errand, and will be glad to get back again. An old
          puritan used to say, |He that carves for himself will cut his fingers.
          Leave God to carve for you in providence, and all shall be well. Seek
          God's guidance and nothing can go amiss.| It is necessary counsel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, Christ's counsel is faithful counsel. When
          Ahithophel left David, it proved that he was not faithful, and when
          Hushai went to Absalom and counselled him, he counselled him craftily,
          so that the good counsel of Ahithophel was brought to nought. Ah! how
          often do our friends counsel us craftily! We have known them do so.
          They have looked first to their own advantage, and then they have
          said, |If I can get him to do so-and-so it will be the best for me.|
          That was not the question we asked them. It was what would be best for
          ourselves. But we may trust Christ, that in his advice to us there
          never will be any self-interest. He will be quite certain to advise us
          with the most disinterested motives, so that the good shall be to us,
          and the profit to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Christ's counsel is hearty counsel. I hate to go to a lawyer
          above all people, to talk with him upon matters of business. The worst
          kind of conversation is, I think, conversation with a lawyer. There is
          your case! Dear me, what an interest you feel in it! You spread it out
          before him, and he says, |There is a word upon the second page not
          quite correct.| You look at it, and you say, |Ah! that is totally
          unimportant; that does not signify.| He turns to another clause and he
          says, |Ah! there is a good deal here!| |My dear fellow, you any, |I do
          not care about those petty clauses, whether it says lands, properties,
          or hereditaments: what I want you to do is to set this difficulty
          right in point of law.| |Be patient| he says; you must go through a
          great many consultations before he will come the point, and all the
          while your poor heart is boiling over because you feel such an
          interest in the main point. But he is as cool as possible; you think
          you are asking counsel of a block of marble. No doubt his advice will
          come out all right at last, and it is pretty certain it will be good
          for you; but it is not hearty. He does not enter into the sympathies
          of the matter with you. What is it to him whether you succeed or not
          -- whether the object of your heart shall be accomplished or not. It
          is but a professional interest he takes. Now, Solomon says, |As
          ointment for perfume, so is hearty counsel.| When a man throws his own
          soul into your ease, and says, |My dear friend, I'll do anything I can
          to help you. let me look at it,| and he takes as deep an interest in
          it as you do yourself. |If I were in your position,| he says, |I
          should do so-and-so, by-the-bye, there is a word wrong there.| Perhaps
          he tells you so, but he only tells you because he is anxious to have
          it all right; and you can see that his drift is always towards the
          same end you are seeking, and that he is only anxious for your good.
          Oh! for a Counsellor that could tie your heart into unison with his
          own! Now Christ is such a Counsellor as that. He is a hearty
          Counsellor. His interests and your interests are bound up together,
          and he is hearty with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another kind of counsel still. David says of one, who
          afterwards became his enemy, |We took sweet counsel together.|
          Christian, do you know what sweet counsel is? You have gone to your
          Master in the day of trouble, and in the secret of your chamber you
          have poured out your heart before him. You have laid your case before
          him, with all its difficulties, as Hezekiah did Rabshakeh's letter,
          and you have felt, that though Christ was not there in flesh and
          blood, yet he was there in spirit, and he counselled you. You felt
          that his was counsel that came from the very heart. But he was
          something better than that. There was such a sweetness coming with his
          counsel, such a radiance of love, such a fullness of fellowship, that
          you said, | Oh that I were in trouble every day, if I might have such
          sweet counsel as this!| Christ is the Counsellor whom I desire to
          consult every hour, and I would that I could sit in his secret chamber
          all day and all night long, because to counsel with him is to have
          sweet counsel, hearty counsel, and wise counsel, all at the same time.
          Why, you may have a friend that talks very sweetly with you, and you
          will say, |Well, he is a kind, good soul, but I really cannot trust
          his judgment.| You have another friend, who has a good deal of
          judgment, and yet you say of him, |Certainly, he is a man of prudence
          above a great many, but I cannot find out his sympathy; I never get at
          his heart, if he were ever so rough and untutored, I would sooner have
          his heart without his prudence, than his prudence without his heart,|
          But we go to Christ, and we get wisdom; we get love, we get sympathy,
          we get everything that can possibly be wanted in a Counsellor.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we must close by noticing that Christ has special councils for
          each of us this morning, and what are they? Tried child of God, your
          daughter is sick; your gold has melted in the fire; you are sick
          yourself, and your heart is sad. Christ counsels you, and he says,
          |Cast thy burden upon the Lord, he will sustain thee; he will never
          suffer the righteous to be moved.| Young man, you that are seeking to
          be great in this world, Christ counsels you this morning. |Seekest
          thou great things for thyself? seek them not.| I shall never forget
          Midsummer Common. I was ambitious; I was seeking to go to college, to
          leave my poor people in the wilderness that I might become something
          great; and as I was walking there that text came with power to my
          heart -- |Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.| I
          suppose about forty pounds a year was the sum total of my income, and
          I was thinking how I should make both ends meet, and whether it would
          not be a great deal better for me to resign my charge and seek
          something for the bettering of myself, and so forth. But this text ran
          in my ears |Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.|
          |Lord,| said I, |I will follow thy counsel and not my own devices;|
          and I have never had cause to regret it. Always take the Lord for thy
          guide, and thou shalt never go amiss. Backslider! thou that hast a
          name to live, and art dead, or nearly dead, Christ gives thee counsel.
          |I counsel thee to buy of me, gold tried in the fire and white
          raiment, that thou mayest be clothed.| And sinner! thou that art far
          from God, Christ gives thee counsel. |Come unto me, all ye that are
          weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest,| Depend on it, it is
          loving counsel. Take it. Go home and cast yourself upon your knees.
          Seek Christ, obey his counsel, and you shall have to rejoice that you
          ever listened to his voice, and heard it, and lived.<br />
