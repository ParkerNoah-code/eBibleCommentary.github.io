          "For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the
          Lord's death till he come." -- 1 Cor.11:26.
        </p>
        <p>
          I THINK we cannot too often explain the meaning of the two great
          Christian ordinances -- baptism and the Supper of the Lord; for it is
          essential to our profiting by them that we understand them. If we do
          not know what they mean, they certainly cannot convey to us any
          blessing whatever. They are not mere channels of grace in themselves,
          apart from our understanding being exercised, and our hearts being
          moved by them. Very soon the best ordinance in the world will become a
          mere form, and will even degenerate into superstitious practice,
          unless it be understood; and we must not always take it for granted
          that the meaning of the simplest emblem is understood. Line upon line,
          precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little, must still be
          the motto of the Christian minister. We must explain, explain, and
          explain again, or else men will satisfy themselves with the outward
          form, and not reach to the teaching which the forms were intended to
          convey. Our text deals with the supper of our Lord, and we will read
          it again. "As often as eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show
          the Lord's death till he come."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first point of the text is what we do -- we "show." Then, what do
          we show, and how? And then, who show it -- "ye do show the Lord's
          death." And then, when? -- "as often" -- "till he come." First, then,
          when we come to the Lord's table: --
        </p>
        <p>I. WHAT WE DO.</p>
        <p>
          We "show." That word has two or three meanings. They all melt into
          one, but we shall get at it better by dividing it. It is meant here by
          showing Christ's death that we declare it. When the emblems are placed
          upon the table -- bread and wine and we gather around it, we declare
          our firm belief that Jesus, the Son of God, descended into this world
          and died as a sacrifice for sin upon the arose. It has been found that
          if a great event is to be kept in mind in succeeding ages, there must
          be some memorial of it. Men by degrees forget it, and even come to be
          dubious as to whether such an event did occur. Sometimes a stone has
          been set up -- a monument -- but this has not always been most
          effective. God, when he would have the children of Israel remember
          that he brought them out of Egypt with a high hand and an outstretched
          arm, did not bid them set up a monument, but he ordained a ceremony
          which was to be practiced on a certain day. It was called "The
          Passover," and the slaughter of the lamb and the eating of it became a
          yearly declaration by the people of Israel that they believed that God
          brought their fathers up out of the house of bondage. So effective has
          this been that men have often used the same device. When the Jewish
          people escaped from the plot which was laid by Haman, through the
          wisdom of Mordecai and Esther, they ordained the keeping of the feast
          of Purim, that they might have in perpetual memory the goodness of God
          towards his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you know how, in our own English history and in the history of
          other countries, certain rites and ceremonies have been ordained in
          order that there might be a perpetual memorial, a declaration made
          that such and such a thing did occur. Now that more than eighteen
          hundred years ago Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, died upon
          Calvary by crucifixion, we do here protest and declare. We set forth
          again to a world that is skeptical and denies the fact which is its
          brightest hope -- we set forth our confident belief that so it was;
          and as long as this ordinance shall be celebrated, there shall be a
          standing proof in the world that that was the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to set forth means more than to declare. It signifies, in the next
          place to represent. There is in the Lord's Supper a representation of
          the death of Christ. Men, when they have found an event to be
          interesting and remarkable, have often devised ways of representing it
          to the people that they might understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to our Lord's death, there are some who hang up pictures
          on the wall; they think the use of the crucifix and so on to be
          proper. I find no teaching of that kind in the Word of God. I do find
          that too often such things lead to idolatry. And what shall we say of
          these miracle -- plays which, even in these modern times, have been
          carried out, in which the death of our Lord Jesus Christ is
          travestied? They seem to be shocking to the Christian mind. But here,
          in a very simple manner, you have God's own appointed way of
          representing to ourselves and to onlookers the death of our Lord. This
          is the Christian's "show" -- we show the death of Christ here by a
          divine appointment. I shall, farther on, show how it is so, and that
          the breaking of bread and the pouring forth of wine -- the use of
          those two emblems -- is a most telling, most suggestive, most
          instructive method of representing the death of Christ. There are two
          other ways of representing it -- the one the pencil of the evangelist
          which has drawn the death of Christ in the Word of God; the other is
          the preaching of the gospel. It is the preacher's business to set
          forth Christ crucified -- evidently crucified among you. The three
          ways that God has ordained of representing the death of Christ are the
          Word read, the Word preached, and this blessed ordinance of the Supper
          of the Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          To "show." This means to declare, to testify; and it means also to
          represent. But it has a third meaning: it means also to hold forth, to
          make manifest, to publish, to call attention to. Now it has been a
          matter of fact that when the Jesuit missionaries went to China and
          converted a great many to what they called the Christian faith, they
          never mentioned the fact that Christ died. For years they concealed
          it, lest the people should be shocked Now we, on the other hand, put
          that first and foremost. We have no other Christianity than this, that
          Christ died and rose again, and we cannot come to the Lord's table
          without showing it. The Jesuit could, because it would puzzle the
          wisest man to see the death of Christ in the Mass. He might sit and
          look at a hundred Masses before he knew what it meant. But the moment
          we gather around this table and break bread, and pour out wine,
          whoever asks us, "What mean ye by this ordinance? the answer is prompt
          -- the wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err in this -- "We set
          forth to you that Jesus died." "God forbid that we should glory, save
          in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." We are not ashamed of a
          crucified Saviour. We have heard of some in these days who are always
          preaching a glorified Christ. We wish them such success as their
          ministry is likely to bring; but for us we preach a crucified Christ
          -- "Christ and him crucified"; for it is here, after all, that the
          salvation of the sinner lies. Christ glorified is precious enough --
          oh! how unspeakably precious to a soul that is saved! -- but first and
          foremost to a dying world it is Christ upon the cross that we have to
          declare. And, therefore, when we come to the Communion table we do
          three things. We assert the fact that Jesus died; we represent that
          fact in emblem, and then we thus press it upon the attention of men.
          We desire them to observe it; we ask them to mark it; we tell them
          that this is the sum and substance of all the gospel that we were sent
          to preach, "God hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation for our
          sins."
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus I have opened up the meaning of the word to "show." This is what
          we do. Now the second point is, my brethren: --
        </p>
        <p>II. WHAT WE SHOW, AND HOW</p>
        <p>
          It is said in the text, "As often as ye eat this bread and drink this
          cup, ye do show the Lord's death." How do we show it? What do we show?
          Well, first of all, we show that God has set forth Christ for men. The
          table is spread; there is bread on it; there is the cup upon it. What
          for? Not for beasts. Here is the food of men. It is set there for men.
          It is intended that the bread should be eaten, that the wine should be
          drunk. Everybody who sees a table spread knows at once that there are
          preparations for a meal or a festival. Now God has set forth Christ
          for men. There is in Christ what man wants. As bread meets his hunger,
          as the cup meets his thirst, so Christ meets all the spiritual wants
          of mankind. And the soul that would live, and the soul that would
          rejoice, must come to God's provision for his living and his
          rejoicing, and that provision is to be found in Jesus Christ
          crucified. God set forth Christ of old. Even in the garden, he set him
          forth in the first promise. He continued to set him forth by all the
          prophets, and in this last day every veil has been taken away by an
          open Bible inviting all comers. God has set forth the bread of life to
          the sons of men. And you to-night will show that fact. When you see
          that table uncovered, you have a representation. God has made a feast
          of fat things for the sons of men in the person of Jesus Christ. The
          feast consists of bread and wine. Now in this we represent Christ's
          human person, Christ's humanity. That he is no myth, but real flesh,
          is taught by the bread being on the table -- that he was no phantom,
          but that real blood coursed through his veins as through ours -- that
          the Lord of life and glory was, like ourselves, a real man, in
          humanity in all respects like to ourselves, sin alone excepted. There
          shall be no phantom feast upon the table, and the materialism that is
          there is meant to show that he was a man, a real man
        </p>
        <p>"Who once on Calvary died,</p>
        <p>When streams of blood and water ran</p>
        <p>Down from his wounded side."</p>
        <p>
          But the next thing we show forth is his death. We have his person;
          then we have his death -- observe how. Recording to the Romish Church,
          the most of the people are only to participate in the bread -- the
          wafer. Now such persons never show Christ's death at all, for the text
          says, "As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye show
          Christ's death." It is only by the two that you show his death at all.
          The bread represents the body, but the cup must represent the blood,
          or else you have no token of his suffering -- no emblem of his death.
          Cannot the two be mixed together? No, for if the blood and flesh be
          together, you have the living man. It is when the blood flows -- when
          the lifeblood ebbs from the body, and the body is bloodless, that then
          you have the wine as a token of death; and the separation of the two
          -- the use of the two emblems -- is absolutely needful to set forth
          death. The more you think this the more you see in it. The emblem is
          the simplest in the world, but yet the most instructive. Take either
          one of the elements -- the bread, how it typifies Christ's suffering!
          Here was the corn bruised beneath the thresher's flail; then was it
          cast into the ground. It sprung up and ripened, and had to be cut down
          with the sickle; then it had to be threshed; then ground in the mill;
          then was it baked in the oven. A whole series of sufferings, if I may
          use the term, it had to pass through before it became proper food for
          us. And so must our Saviour pass through sufferings innumerable before
          he could become food for our souls, and redeemer of our spirits. As
          for that which is in the cup, it was trodden beneath the foot in the
          wine-press -- its juice was pressed forth. So in the wine-press of
          Jehovah's wrath was Christ pressed before he could become the wine
          that maketh glad both God and man. Both emblems represent suffering,
          each one separately, but put together they bring forth the idea of
          death, "and as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
          show the Lord's death."
        </p>
        <p>
          But more than this; we show that God set forth Christ; we show his
          person as a real man; we show his sufferings and his death; but next
          we show our participation in the same, for it is not "as often as ye
          look at this bread," or "as ye gaze upon this cup," but "as often as
          ye eat this bread and drink this cup." Christ saves us not until we do
          receive him by an act of faith. The bread satisfies no hunger while it
          rests upon the table, and a draught from the cup quenches no thirst
          until it really is drunk. So the precious blood of Jesus Christ our
          Saviour must be received by our faith. We must believe in him to the
          saving of our souls. Now how simple a matter is eating! It matters
          not, unless a man be dead -- he wants little teaching to know how to
          eat. It is as simple as a natural act -- he puts food into his mouth.
          It is just so here. There is the Saviour, and I take him -- that is
          all. It seems to me to be even a more complex act to eat than simply
          to trust in Jesus, yet is it a very simple thing. The idiot can eat.
          No matter how guilty a man, he can eat; no matter how dark and
          despairing his fears, he can eat; and O poor soul, whoever thou mayest
          be, there shall be no want of wit or merit that shall keep thee back
          from Christ. If thou art willing to have him, thou mayest have him.
          The act of trusting Christ makes Christ as much thy own as the eating
          of the bread. Suppose some difficulty were raised about whether a
          piece of bread was mine. Well, the legal question would take a long
          time to decide. I cannot produce the document, nor find the witnesses
          to prove it is mine. But there is one little fact, I think, which will
          settle it -- I have eaten it. So if the devil himself were to say that
          Christ is not mine, I have believed on him; and if I have believed on
          him, he is mine just as surely as when I have eaten a piece of bread
          there can be no question about its being mine. Now we set forth
          to-night, by eating bread and drinking of the cup, the fact that Jesus
          Christ is our Saviour, and we take him by simple faith to be our all
          in all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is more teaching still. The bread and wine, are being eaten
          and drunk, are assimilated into the system; they minister strength to
          bone, sinew, muscle; they build up the man. And herein is teaching.
          Christ believed in is one with us -- "Christ in us the hope of glory.
          "We have heard persons talk of believers falling from grace and losing
          Christ. No, sir, a man has eaten bread -- he ate it yesterday. Will
          you separate that bread from the man? Will you trace the drops that
          came from the cup, and fetch them out of the man's system? You shall
          more easily do that than you shall take Christ away from the soul that
          has once fed upon him. "Who shall separate us from the love of God,
          which is in Christ Jesus our Lord?" He is in us a well of water
          springing up into everlasting life. See then how large a letter Christ
          has written to us with these pens -- how in this bread and this wine,
          eaten and drunk, he has taught us wondrous mysteries -- in fact, the
          whole Christian faith is, in brief, summed up here upon this table.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now we must remark upon what it is we show forth, and how we do
          it. We do this very simply. Certain churches must go about this
          business in a very mysterious manner -- a great deal of machinery is
          wanted -- a plate becomes a paten, and a cup becomes a chalice, and a
          table, ah! that has vanished and turned into an altar. The whole thing
          is turned topsy-turvy until it is very questionable in the Church of
          Rome whether there is any supper at all; for if you introduce the
          altar, you have put away the table and done away with the whole thing.
          It is another ordinance, and not the ordinance which Christ
          established. One would suppose that when the Apostles first went out
          to preach, if the religion of the Romish Church be that of the
          Scripture, they would have needed, each of them, a wagon to carry with
          them the various paraphernalia necessary for the celebration of their
          services. But here, wherever there is a piece of bread, and wherever
          there is a cup, we have the plain, but instructive emblems which our
          Saviour bade us use. "He took bread and break it. "He did drink of the
          cup, and passed it to his disciples, and said, "Drink ye all of it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us keep this ordinance in its pure simplicity. Let us never add
          anything to it by our own devising by way of fancying that we are
          honouring God by garnishing his table. Let us plainly show Christ's
          death, and as we do it plainly we should also do it festively. Is it
          not delightful to reflect that our Lord has not ordained a mournful
          ceremony in which to celebrate his death: it is a feast. You would
          suppose by the way that some come that it is a funeral, but it is a
          feast, and joy becomes a feast; and when, according to the example of
          Christ, we recline at our ease in the nearest approach to the posture
          in which the Oriental lay along at the table, and when we come with
          joyful heart, blessing the Lord Jesus that though our sins put him to
          death, yet his death has put to death our sins, then it is that we
          celebrate his death as he would have us celebrate it -- not as an
          awful tragedy, in which we try to provoke our indignation against the
          Romans or the Jews, but as a hallowed festival, in which the King
          himself comes to the table, and his spikenard gives forth a sweet
          smell, and our spirit is refreshed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And once more, this way of showing Christ's death is one of communion.
          Now one person cannot do it; many must come together. Ye must eat and
          drink together to celebrate this, your Lord's death. And is not this
          delightful, for in this cup we have fellowship with him and with one
          another? We, being many, have one bread; we, being many, have one cup
          -- one family at one table with one common head, the Lord Jesus, who
          is all in all to us. Oh! I bless his name that whereas he might have
          ordained a way of our showing his death which would have been
          mournful, or a way which would have been solitary, he has selected
          that which is joyful, and that which is full of good fellowship, so
          that saints below and himself can meet together in the festival of
          love and show his death until he come, in the breaking of bread and
          the pouring forth of wine. Thus I have tried to show what it is we
          show, and how we show it. Now thirdly: --
        </p>
        <p>III. WHO ARE TO SHOW IT?</p>
        <p>
          Who show it? "As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
          show the Lord's death." The "ye," then includes all the saints of God
          -- all who come to the table, who eat this bread and drink this cup;
          and truly a very pleasing thought arises from this. Here is a way of
          showing Christ's death in which all who love Christ have a share. You
          cannot all show it from the pulpit; gifts are not equally distributed;
          but you all alike share in this showing of his death -- in this
          special way, which he himself celebrated for our example, and which he
          delivered to his servant Paul, expressly that it might stand on
          record. Now if Paul himself were here, he could not show Christ's
          death alone at the Lord's Supper. He must ask some of his poorer
          brethren to come with him. If the minister of a church should be full
          of the Holy Ghost, yet could he not show forth Christ's death here in
          this peculiar way. He must say to his brethren, "Come, brethren and
          sisters; it says ' ye,' as often as ye eat this bread and drink this
          cup." Here we are to-night, as we sit here, all brought into a blessed
          equality in the act of using the same outward sign, and of performing
          the Master's will in the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," says ones "doth every man who comes to the table, and eats and
          drinks, show Christ's death? Notice how the verse which follows my
          text puts a bar to that. "Let a man examine himself, and so let him
          eat of this bread." It must be taken for granted that the man has
          examined himself -- that he comes there as a true believer in Jesus --
          that he comes there with the full intent to show Christ's death; and
          if he does that, such a man is showing Christ's death. I am very
          earnest, dear brethren and sisters, as it has been a long time since I
          have met with you -- having been kept away so long by sickness, though
          I have been with my brethren below stairs -- I am anxious that we
          should indeed show Christ's death to-night. Let us do it to ourselves.
          I find that the text may either be read in the indicative or in the
          imperative mood. It is either "ye show Christ's death," as our version
          has it, or it may be "show ye Christ's death" -- it is an exhortation.
          Oh! let us take care that we show it to ourselves. "Show it to
          ourselves?" says one. Yes, it is meant for you. This is a primary
          meaning of the text. When you take that bread, don't think of the
          bread, and stay there, but say to your own soul, "My soul, think thou
          of Jesus. My heart, go away now to Gethsemane. Come, ye stray
          thoughts; Come, ye passing vanities, begone! I must away to where my
          Saviour bled and died.
        </p>
        <p>"Sweet the moments, rich in blessing</p>
        <p>Which, before his cross, I spend."</p>
        <p>
          I have come here to show his death; let me see him. I will ask him to
          permit me in spirit to put my finger into the print of the nails, and
          to put my hand into his side. Oh! go not from this table satisfied
          with the outward emblem; press into the inner court -- pray the Master
          to manifest himself to you as he does not unto the world. For here is
          the main business -- show his death to your own heart till your heart
          bleeds for sin; show it to your own faith till your faith feels it is
          all sufficient -- show it to others. You will be sure to show it to
          others if you show it to yourself for as others look on and mark your
          reverent behaviour; if they cannot enter into your joy, they will be
          reminded of what they have so long forgotten. Oh! brethren and
          sisters, let me urge each one of you that no one should be content
          without sharing this honour. I feel we all have an honour to
          participate in showing forth the death of Christ. Let us not, in
          sharing the honour, bring condemnation on ourselves. But I must hasten
          on. The fourth point is: --
        </p>
        <p>IV. WHEN ARE WE TO DO IT?</p>
        <p>
          The text says "often" -- "as often as ye eat this bread." The Holy
          Spirit might have used the words "when ye eat," but he did not. He
          teaches us by implication that we ought to do it often. I do not think
          there is any positive law about it, but it looks to me as if the first
          Christians broke bread almost every day -- "breaking bread from house
          to house." I am not sure that that refers to Communion, but in all
          probability it does. This much is certain, that in the early Church
          the custom was to break bread in memory of Christ's passion on the
          first day of every week, and it was always a part of the Sabbath's
          service when they came together to remember their Lord in this way.
          How it can be thought right to leave the celebrating of this ordinance
          to once a year or once a quarter I cannot understand, and it seems to
          me that if brethren knew the great joy there is in often setting forth
          Christ's death they would not be content with even once a month. But I
          leave that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other mark of time in the text is "till he come." Then this
          service is to end. There will be no more Lord's Suppers when Christ
          appears, because they will be needless. Put out the candle -- the sun
          has risen. Put away the emblem -- here comes Christ himself. But until
          he does come, this will always be a most fitting ordinance. I pleased
          myself with a thought I met with the other day. Our Lord Jesus Christ
          sat at the table and ate with his disciples, and he took the cup and
          he sipped it, and he passed it round. It is being passed round still.
          It has not got round the table yet, it is being passed on. For 1,800
          years it has been passed from hand to hand. They have not all drunk
          yet; and you remember he, said, "Drink ye all of it" -- all of you.
          Did he speak to all his elect that were to be born -- to all the
          countless companies yet to come? I think he did, and it is going
          round: and by-and-bye, when all the people of God have participated in
          Christ, it will cease. The cup will never be emptied till then.
        </p>
        <p>"Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood</p>
        <p>Shall never lose its power,</p>
        <p>Till all the ransomed Church of God</p>
        <p>Be saved, to sin no more."</p>
        <p>
          When the last has drunk of it, what then? It will come back into the
          Master's hands, and then will be fulfilled that word of his, "I say
          unto you I will not henceforth drink of the juice of the vine till I
          drink it new in my heavenly Father's kingdom." And it is going round,
          brethren -- that cup of glorious Christian fellowship of love to
          Christ, the cup that is filled with Jesus' blood -- it is passing
          round, and when it has reached his hand then we shall need no more the
          outward ordinance. But until then it is clear from the text that it is
          to be kept up. And I have a little dispute with some of you here
          present. You love the Lord, but you have never been baptized; you love
          Jesus, but you have never come to his table. Now let me say you are in
          opposition to Christ. He says, "Do this till I come", you don't do it.
          "Oh! but I am only one," say you. To your measure of ability you have
          helped to make the lord's Supper obsolete. Can you see that? If you
          have a right to neglect it, so have I -- if I, so have all my
          brethren. Then there is an end to it. My dear brother, you are doing
          the best you can to make Christ forgotten in the world. I pray you by
          his own dying example and his express command, "This do ye in
          remembrance of me" -- if ye have believed him, keep this, his
          commandment. If ye have not believed in him, then far hence! Ye have
          no right to take it. But if you have believed, I beseech you stand not
          back for shame or fear, but eat and drink at his table till he come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time has gone too fast for me, and I must close. There is one lesson,
          however, that I cannot leave out. Until Christ come. We are taught our
          interim employment -- what is to occupy us until Jesus comes. Beloved
          brethren, until Jesus comes we have nothing left but to think of him.
          Till Jesus comes the main thing we have to do is to think of and set
          him forth a crucified Saviour. There is no food for the Church but
          Jesus; there is no testimony to the world but Jesus crucified. They
          have sometimes told us that in this growing age we may expect to have
          developed a higher form of Christianity. Well, they shall have it that
          like it; but Christ himself has left us nothing but just this, "Show
          my death till I come." The preacher is to go on preaching a dying
          Saviour; the saint is to go on trusting that dying Saviour, feeding on
          him and letting his soul be satisfied as with marrow and fatness.
          There is nothing left us to occupy our thoughts, or to be the subject
          of our joy, as our dear dying Lord. Oh! let us feed on him. Each one,
          personally, as a believer -- let him feed on his Saviour. If he has
          come once, come again. Keep on coming till Christ himself shall
          appear. As long as the invitation stands let us not slight it, but
          constantly come to Christ himself and feed on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, let every ungodly person here know that he has no part
          nor lot in this matter. Thy first business, sinner, is with Christ
          himself. Go thou and put thy trust in him. Oh! go this night. Thou
          mayest never have another night to go in. And then when thou best
          believed, then obey his command in baptism, and then also come to his
          table and show his death until he come. The Lord bless you for
          Christ's sake. Amen.<br />
