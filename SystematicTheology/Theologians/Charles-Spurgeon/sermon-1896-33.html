          David was not as yet put in possession of the kingdom, but having been
          already created king by the appointment of God, he prepares himself
          for exercising the government in the best manner. And he not only
          stirs up himself to perform faithfully the duties of his kingly office
          by devoutly meditating on this subject, but also engages by a solemn
          vow to be God's faithful servant, in order to induce Him to put him
          speedily in possession of the kingdom.<br />
