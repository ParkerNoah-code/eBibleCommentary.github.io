          31. He spake, and there came a swarm of flies, and lice in all their
          borders.32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire upon their
          land.33. And he smote their vines and their fig trees; and destroyed
          the trees throughout their borders.34. He spake, and the grasshopper
          came, and the caterpillar without number, 35. And they devoured all
          the herbage in their land, and consumed the fruit of their ground.36.
          And he smote all the first-born in their country, even the beginning
          of all their strength. 37. And he brought them forth with silver and
          gold: nor was there a feeble person among his tribes.38. Egypt
          rejoiced at their departure: for their terror had fallen upon them.

          31. He spake, and there came a swarm of flies By the word spake the
          Psalmist intimates that the flies and lice came not forth by chance.
          The command, we know, was uttered by the mouth of Moses; for although
          God could have given the command himself, he interposed Moses as his
          herald. God, however, gave no less efficacy to his word, when he
          commanded it to be uttered by a man, than if he himself had thundered
          from heaven. When the minister executes his commission faithfully, by
          speaking only what God puts into his mouth, the inward power of the
          Holy Spirit is joined with his outward voice. Here again it is to be
          observed, that the Egyptians were afflicted with the plague of the
          flies and lice, that God, with the greater ignominy, might subdue
          their rebellion and obstinacy. When it is said, that he gave them hail
          for rain, it denotes a hail of such appalling violence, that it could
          not be attributed to natural causes. It is probable that Egypt is not
          so subject to this annoyance as other countries, and it is very seldom
          visited even with rain, being watered with the Nile. This made it
          appear to the Egyptians the more wonderful that their country was
          stricken with hail. To render this calamity the more dreadful, God
          also mingled with it fire. The hail, then, was accompanied with a
          tempestuous whirlwind, that the Egyptians who had hardened themselves
          against the other miracles, inspired with terror, might know that they
          had to deal with God.

          34. He spake, and the grasshopper came This calamity, which was
          brought upon the fields, could not be attributed to Fortune; for the
          grasshoppers made their appearance suddenly and in countless
          multitudes, so that they covered all the land of Egypt. The miracle
          was very evident from the word spoken, by which it was introduced. Its
          being announced as to happen, removed all doubt of its being the work
          of the Most High. Accordingly, it is expressly said, that grasshoppers
          and caterpillars rushed in at the commandment of God, as if soldiers
          should run to battle at the sound of the trumpet. Whenever these
          insects molest us and destroy the fruits of the earth, they are
          assuredly the scourges of God, but it is here intended to point out an
          extraordinary work of his hand. In fine, the prophet recites the last
          miracle, which was wrought by the angel on the night previous to the
          departure of the people, when he slew all the first-born throughout
          Egypt. I only take a hasty and passing glance at this history, as I
          have, in like manner, done of the other facts preceding, because they
          have been more copiously treated elsewhere, and at this time it is
          sufficient for us to know the design of the sacred writer. He,
          however, amplifies this display of the Divine power by a repetition,
          declaring that the first-born and the flower of their strength were
          destroyed Some translate, but unhappily, The beginning of their
          sorrow. As man's strength shows itself in generation, the Hebrews term
          the first-begotten the beginning of strength, as we have explained on
          Genesis 49:3, --
        </p>
        <p>
          "Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might,<br />and the beginning of
          my strength."
        </p>
        <p>
          37. And he brought them forth with silver and gold The prophet, on the
          other hand, celebrates the grace of God which preserved the chosen
          people untouched and safe from all these plagues. If both parties had
          been indiscriminately afflicted with them, the hand of God would not
          have been so signally manifest. But now when the Israelites, amidst so
          many calamities, experienced an entire exemption from harm, this
          difference exhibits to us, as in a picture, God's fatherly care about
          his own people. For this reason, it is stated, Nor was there a feeble
          person, or one who stumbled; for the verb ksl, kashal, has both these
          meanings. But I prefer taking it simply in this sense, That whilst
          Egypt was hastening to destruction, the people of God were vigorous,
          and free from every malady. When it is said, He brought them forth,
          and when it is afterwards added, in his tribes, there is a change of
          the number, which is quite common in the Hebrew language. Some refer
          the word his to God; but this I am afraid is too forced.

          38. Egypt rejoiced at their departure The Psalmist sets forth the
          power of God from the additional circumstance, that the Egyptians
          willingly allowed the chosen people to depart, when yet nothing was
          farther from their intention. Although they wished them destroyed a
          hundred times, yet they thought that they had the wolf by the ears, as
          we say; and thus the fear of revenge made them more determined to blot
          out the memory of that people. Whence it follows, that when they all
          at once laid aside their former purpose, it was a secret work of
          divine providence. To the same effect is the statement in the
          preceding verse, that they were brought forth with gold and silver The
          Egyptians could never have had the heart voluntarily to strip
          themselves, to enrich those whom they would have willingly deprived of
          life. This was then the bounty of God, in whose hand, and at whose
          disposal, are all the riches of the world. He might have taken by
          force from the Egyptians what he had given them; but he bowed their
          hearts, so that of their own accord they denuded themselves. The
          expression, for their terror had fallen upon them, is to be understood
          passively; for the Israelites were not afraid of the Egyptians, but,
          on the contrary, were terrible to them. Nor does the prophet speak of
          an ordinary fear. A little before fear had stirred them up to cruelty
          and tyranny; but as even to that day, they had endeavored, with
          indomitable audacity, to shake off all fear, God suddenly laid them
          prostrate by the extraordinary terror which fell upon them. It is,
          therefore, here justly reckoned among the displays of the wonderful
          power of God, that he subdued the impetuous fury with which the
          Egyptians boiled before, that they might allow those to depart free,
          whom they had determined to handle rudely, and to waste in servile
          employments; which was like rendering sheep terrible to wolves.<br />
