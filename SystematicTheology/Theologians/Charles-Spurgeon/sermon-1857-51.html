        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.159)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, October 18, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "We know that all things work together far good to them that love God,
          to them who are the called according to his purpose." -- Romans 8:28.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. WE have here the description of a true Christian, and a declaration
          of that Christian's blessedness. We have him first very succinctly,
          but very fully described in these words -- "Them that love God, them
          who are the called according to his purpose." These two expressions
          are the great distinguishing marks whereby we are able to separate the
          precious from the vile, by discovering to us who are the children of
          God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first contains an outward manifestation of the second -- "Them
          that love God." Now, there are many things in which the worldly and
          the godly do agree, but on this point there IS a vital difference. No
          ungodly man loves God -- at least not in the Bible sense of the term.
          An unconverted man may love a God, as, for instance, the God of
          nature, and the God of the imagination; but the God of revelation no
          man can love, unless grace has been poured into his heart, to turn him
          from that natural enmity of the heart towards God, in which all of us
          are born. And there may be many differences between godly men, as
          there undoubtedly are; they may belong to different sects, they may
          hold very opposite opinions, but all godly men agree in this, that
          they love God. Whosoever loveth God, without doubt, is a Christian;
          and whosoever loveth him not, however high may be his pretensions,
          however boastful his professions, hath not seen God, neither known him
          for "God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
          God in him." True believers love God as their Father; they have "the
          spirit of adoption, whereby they cry Abba, Father." They love him as
          their King, they are willing to obey him, to walk in his commands is
          their delight; no path is so soft to their feet as the path of God's
          precepts, the way of obedience thereunto. They love God also as their
          Portion, for in him they live and move and have their being; God is
          their all, without him they have nothing, but possessing him, however
          little they may have of outward good, they feel that they are rich to
          all the intents of bliss. They love God as their future Inheritance,
          they believe that when days and years are past they shall enter into
          the bosom of God; and their highest joy and delight is the full
          conviction and belief, that one day they shall dwell for ever near his
          throne, be hidden in the brightness of his glory, and enjoy his
          everlasting favor. Dost thou love God, not with lip-language, but with
          heart-service? Dost thou love to pay him homage? Dost thou love to
          hold communion with him? Dost thou frequent his mercy-seat? Dost thou
          abide in his commandments, and desire to be conformed unto his Image?
          If so, then the sweet things which we shall have to say this morning
          are thine. But if thou art no lover of God, but a stranger to him, I
          beseech thee do not pilfer to-day and steal a comfort that was not
          intended for thee. "All things work together for good," but not to all
          men; they only work together for the good of "them that love God, to
          them who are the called according to his purpose."
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the second phrase, which contains also a description of the
          Christian -- "the called according to his purpose." However much the
          Arminian may try to fritter away the meaning of this 8th chapter of
          the Romans we are obliged as long as we use terms and words to say,
          that the 8th chapter of the Romans and the 9th, are the very pillars
          of that Gospel which men now call Calvinism. No man after having read
          these chapters attentively, and having understood them, can deny that
          the doctrines of sovereign, distinguishing grace, are the sum and
          substance of the teaching of the Bible. I do not believe that the
          Bible is to be understood except by receiving these doctrines as true.
          The apostle says that those who love God are "the called according to
          his purpose" by which he means to say two things -- first, that all
          who love God love him because he called them to love him. He called
          them, mark you. All men are called by the ministry, by the Word, by
          daily providence, to love God, there is a common call always given to
          men to come to Christ, the great bell of the gospel rings a universal
          welcome to every living soul that breathes; but alas! though that bell
          hath the very sound of heaven, and though all men do in a measure hear
          it, for "their line is gone out into all the earth and their Word unto
          the end of the world" yet there was never an instance of any man
          having been brought to God simply by that sound. All these things are
          insufficient for the salvation of any man; there must be superadded
          the special call, the call which man cannot resist, the call of
          efficacious grace, working in us to will and to do of God's good
          pleasure. Now, all them that love God love him because they have had a
          special, irresistible, supernatural call. Ask them whether they would
          have loved God if left to themselves, and to a man, whatever their
          doctrines, they will confess --
        </p>
        <p>"Grace taught my soul to pray,</p>
        <p>Grace made my eyes o'erflow,</p>
        <p>'Tis grace that kept me to this day</p>
        <p>And will not let me go."</p>
        <p>
          I never heard a Christian yet who said that he came to God of himself,
          left to his own free-will. Free-will may look very pretty in theory,
          but I never yet met any one who found it work well in practice. We all
          confess that if we are brought to the marriage-banquet --
        </p>
        <p>"Twas the same love that spread the feast</p>
        <p>That gently forced us in</p>
        <p>Else we had still refused to taste,</p>
        <p>And perished in our sin."</p>
        <p>
          Many men cavil at election; the very word with some is a great bug
          ear; they no sooner hear it than they turn upon their heel
          indignantly. But this know, O man, whatever thou sayest of this
          doctrine, it is a stone upon which, if any man fall, he shall suffer
          loss, but if it fall upon him it shall grind him to powder. Not all
          the sophisms of the learned, nor all the legerdemain of the cunning,
          will ever be able to sweep the doctrine of election out of Holy
          Scripture. Let any man hear and judge. Hearken ye to this passage in
          the 9th of Romans! "For the children being not yet born, neither
          having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to
          election might stand not of works, but of him that calleth; It was
          said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written,
          Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is
          there unrighteousness with God? God forbid! For he saith to Moses, I
          will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
          on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth,
          nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy." "Thou wilt
          say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted
          his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
          Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made
          me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to
          make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor! What if God,
          willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with
          much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: And
          that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of
          mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory. Even us, whom he hath
          called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles." These are
          God's words; if any man doth cavil at them, let him cavil; he
          rejecteth the testimony of God against himself. If I promulgated the
          doctrine on my own authority, I could not blame you if you should turn
          against me, and reject it; but when, on the authority of Holy
          Scripture, I propound it, God forbid that any man should quarrel
          therewith.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have affirmed, and I am sure most Christians will bear witness, that
          what I said was the truth, that if any man loveth God he loves him
          because God gave him grace to love him. Now, suppose I should put the
          following question to any converted man in this hall. Side by side
          with you there sits an ungodly person; you two have been brought up
          together, you have lived in the same house, you have enjoyed the same
          means of grace, you are converted, he is not; will you please to tell
          me what has made the difference? Without a solitary exception the
          answer would be this -- "If I am a Christian and he is not, unto God
          be the honor." Do you suppose for a moment that there is any injustice
          in God in having given you grace which he did not give to another? I
          suppose you say, "Injustice, no; God has a right to do as he wills
          with his own; I could not claim grace, nor could my companions, God
          chose to give it to me, the other has rejected grace wilfully to his
          own fault, and I should have done the same, but that he gave more
          grace,' whereby my will was constrained." Now, sir, if it is not wrong
          for God to do the thing, how can it be wrong for God to purpose to do
          the thing? and what is election, but God's purpose to do what he does
          do? It is a fact which any man must be a fool who would dare to deny
          that God does give to one man more grace shall to another; we cannot
          account for the salvation of one and the non-salvation of another but
          by believing, that God has worked more effectually in one man's heart
          than another's -- unless you choose to give the honor to man, and say
          it consists in one man's being better than another, and if so I will
          have no argument with you, because you do not know the gospel at all,
          or you would know that salvation is not of works but of grace. If,
          then, you give the honor to God, you are bound to confess that God has
          done more for the man that is saved than for the man that is not
          saved. How, then, can election be unjust, if its effect is not unjust?
          However, just or unjust as man may choose to think it, God has done
          it, and the fact stands in man's face, let him reject it as he
          pleases. God's people are known by their outward mark: they love God,
          and the secret cause of their loving God is this -- God chose them
          from before the foundation of the world that they should love him, and
          he sent forth the call of his grace, so that they were called
          according to his purpose, and were led by grace to love and to fear
          him. If that is not the meaning of the text I do not understand the
          English language. "We know that all things work together for good to
          them that love God, to them who are the called according to his
          purpose."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my hearers, before I proceed to enter into the text, let the
          question go round. Do I love God? Have I any reason to believe that I
          have been called according to his purpose? Have I been born again from
          above? Has the Spirit operated in my heart in a manner to which flesh
          and blood never can attain? Have I passed from death unto life by the
          quickening agency of the Holy Ghost? If I have, then God purposed that
          I should do so, and the whole of this great promise is mine.
        </p>
        <p>II. We shall take the words one by one, and try to explain them.</p>
        <p>
          1. Let us begin with the word "work." "We know that all things work."
          Look around, above, beneath, and all things work. They work, in
          opposition to idleness. The idle man that folds his arms or lies upon
          the bed of sloth is an exception to God's rule; for except himself all
          things work. There is not a star though it seemeth to sleep in the
          deep blue firmament, which doth not travel its myriads of miles and
          work; there is not an ocean, or a river, which is not ever working,
          either clapping its thousand hands with storms, or bearing on its
          bosom the freight of nations. There is not a silent nook within the
          deepest forest glade where work is not going on. Nothing is idle. The
          world is a great machine, but it is never standing still: silently all
          through the watches of the night, and through the hours of day, the
          earth revolveth on its axis, and works out its predestinated course.
          Silently the forest groweth, anon it is felled; but all the while
          between its growing and felling it is at work. Everywhere the earth
          works; mountains work: nature in its inmost bowels is at work; even
          the center of the great heart of the world is ever beating; sometimes
          we discover its working in the volcano and the earthquake, but even
          when most still all things are ever working.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are ever working too, in opposition to the word play. Not only
          are they ceaselessly active, but they are active for a purpose. We are
          apt to think that the motion of the world and the different evolutions
          of the stars are but like the turning round of a child's windmill;
          they produce nothing. That old preacher Solomon once said as much as
          that. He said -- "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and
          hasteth to his place where he arose. The wind goeth toward the south,
          and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and
          the wind returneth again according to his circuits." But Solomon did
          not add, that things are not what they seem. The world is not at play;
          it hath an object in its wildest movement. Avalanche, hurricane,
          earthquake, are but order in an unusual form; destruction and death
          are but progress in veiled attire. Everything that is and is done,
          worketh out some great end and purpose. The great machine of this
          world is not only in motion, but there is something weaving in it,
          which as yet mortal eye hath not fully seen, which our text hinteth at
          when it says, It is working out good for God's people.
        </p>
        <p>
          And once again, all things work in opposition to Sabbath. We morally
          speak of work, especially on this day, as being the opposite of sacred
          rest and worship. Now, at the present moment all things work. Since
          the day when Adam fell all things have had to toil and labor. Before
          Adam's fall the world kept high and perpetual holiday; but now the
          world has come to its work-days, now it hath to toil. When Adam was in
          the garden the world had its Sabbath: and it shall never have another
          Sabbath till the Millennium shall dawn, and then when all things have
          ceased to work, and the kingdoms shall be given up to God, even the
          Father, then shall the world have her Sabbath, and shall rest; but at
          present all things do work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear brethren, let us not wonder if we have to work too. If we have to
          toil, let us remember, this is the world's week of toil. The 6,000
          years of continual labor, and toil, and travail, have happened not to
          us alone, but to the whole of God's great universe; the whole world is
          groaning, and travailing. Let us not be backward in doing our work. If
          all things are working, let us work too -- "work while it is called
          to-day, for the night cometh when no man can work." And let the idle
          and slothful remember that they are a great anomaly; they are blots in
          the great work-writing of God; they mean nothing; in all the book of
          letters with which God has written out the great word "work," they are
          nothing at all. But let the man that worketh, though it be with the
          sweat of his brow and with aching hands, remember that he, if he is
          seeking to bless the Lord's people, is in sympathy with all things --
          not only in sympathy with their work, but in sympathy with their aim.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Now, the next word, "All things work together." That is in
          opposition to their apparent confliction. Looking upon the world with
          the mere eye of sense and reason, we say, "Yes, all things work, but
          they work contrary to one another. There are opposite currents; the
          wind bloweth to the north and to the south. The world's barque, it is
          true, is always tossed with waves, but these waves toss her first to
          the right and then to the left; they do not steadily bear her onward
          to her desired haven. It is true the world is always active, but it is
          with the activity of the battle-field, wherein hosts encounter hosts
          and the weaker are overcome." Be not deceived; it is not so; things
          are not what they seem; "all things work together." There is no
          opposition in God's providence; the raven wing of war is co-worker
          with the dove of peace. The tempest strives not with the peaceful calm
          -- they are linked together and work together, although they seem to
          be in opposition. Look at our history. How many an event has seemed to
          be conflicting in its day, that has worked out good for us? The
          strifes of barons and kings for mastery might have been thought to be
          likely to tread out the last spark of British liberty; but they did
          rather kindle the pile. The various rebellions of nations, the
          heavings of society, the strife of anarchy, the tumults of war -- all,
          all these things, overruled by God, have but made the chariot of the
          church progress more mightily; they have not failed of their
          predestinated purpose -- "good for the people of God." I know my
          brethren, it is very hard for you to believe this. "What!" say you? "I
          have been sick for many a day, and wife and children, dependent on my
          daily labor, are crying for food: will this work together for my
          good?" So saith the word, my brother, and so shalt thou find it ere
          long. "I have been in trade," says another, "and this commercial
          pressure has brought me exceedingly low, and distressed me: is it for
          my good?" My brother, thou art a Christian. I know thou dost not
          seriously ask the question, for thou knowest the answer of it. He who
          said, "all things work together," will soon prove to you that there is
          a harmony in the most discordant parts of your life. You shall find,
          when your biography is written, that the black page did but harmonize
          with the bright one -- that the dark and cloudy day was but a glorious
          foil to set forth the brighter noon-tide of your joy. "All things work
          together." There is never a clash in the world: men think so, but it
          never is so. The charioteers of the Roman circus might with much
          cleverness and art, with glowing wheels, avoid each other; but God,
          with skill infinitely consummate, guides the fiery coursers of man's
          passion, yokes the storm, bits the tempest, and keeping each clear of
          the other from seeming evil still enduceth good, and better still; and
          better still in infinite progression.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must understand the word "together," also in another sense. "All
          things work together for good:" that is to say, none of them work
          separately. I remember an old divine using a very pithy and homely
          metaphor, which I shall borrow to-day. Said he, "All things work
          together for good; but perhaps, any one of those all things' might
          destroy us if taken alone. The physician," says he, "prescribes
          medicine; you go to the chemist, and he makes it up; there is
          something taken from this drawer, something from that phial, something
          from that shelf: any one of those ingredients, it is very possible,
          would be a deadly poison, and kill you outright, if you should take it
          separately, but he puts one into the mortar, and then another, and
          then another, and when he has worked them all up with his pestle, and
          has made a compound, he gives them all to you as a whole, and together
          they work for your good, but any one of the ingredients might either
          have operated fatally, or in a manner detrimental to your health."
          Learn, then, that it is wrong to ask, concerning any particular act of
          providence; is this for my good? Remember, it is not the one thing
          alone that is for your good; it is the one thing put with another
          thing, and that with a third, and that with a fourth, and all these
          mixed together, that work for your good. Your being sick very probably
          might not be for your good only God has something to follow your
          sickness, some blessed deliverance to follow your poverty, and he
          knows that when he has mixed the different experiences of your life
          together, they shall produce good for your soul and eternal good for
          your spirit. We know right well that there are many things that happen
          to us in our lives that would be the ruin of us if we were always to
          continue in the same condition. Too much joy would intoxicate us, too
          much misery would drive us to despair: but the joy and the misery, the
          battle and the victory, the storm and the calm, all these compounded
          make that sacred elixir whereby God maketh all his people perfect
          through suffering, and leadeth them to ultimate happiness. "All things
          work together for good."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Now we must take the next words. "All things work together for
          good." Upon these two words the meaning of my text will hinge. There
          are different senses to the word "good." There is the worldling's
          sense: "Who will show us any good?" -- by which he means transient
          good, the good of the moment. "Who wilt put honey into my mouth? Who
          will feed my belly with hid treasures? Who will garnish my back with
          purple and make my table groan with plenty?" That is "good," -- the
          vat bursting with wine, the barn full of corn! Now God has never
          promised that "all things shall work together" for such good as that
          to his people. Very likely all things will work together in a clean
          contrary way to that. Expect not, O Christian, that all things will
          work together to make thee rich; it is just possible they may all work
          to make thee poor. It may be that all the different providences that
          shall happen to thee will come wave upon wave, washing thy fortune
          upon the rocks, till it shall be wrecked, and then waves shall break
          o'er thee, till in that poor boat, the humble remnant of thy fortune
          thou shalt be out on the wide sea, with none to help thee but God the
          Omnipotent. Expect not, then, that all things shall work together as
          for thy good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian understands the word "good" in another sense. By "good,"
          he understands spiritual good. "Ah!" saith he, "I do not call gold
          good, but I call faith good! I do not think it always for my good to
          increase in treasure, but I know it is good to grow in grace. I do not
          know that it is for my good that I should be respectable and walk in
          good society; but I know that it is for my good that I should walk
          humbly with my God. I do not know that it is for my good that my
          children should be about me, like olive branches round my table, but I
          know that it is for my good that I should flourish in the courts of my
          God, and that I should be the means of winning souls from going down
          into the pit. I am not certain that it is altogether for my good to
          have kind and generous friends, with whom I may hold fellowship; but I
          know that it is for my good that I should hold fellowship with Christ,
          that I should have communion with him, even though it should be in his
          sufferings. I know it is good for me that my faith, my love, my every
          grace should grow and increase, and that I should be conformed to the
          image of Jesus Christ my blessed Lord and Master." Well, Christian,
          thou hast got upon the meaning of the text, then. "All things work
          together," for that kind of good to God's people. "Well!" says one, "I
          don't think anything of that, then." No, perhaps thou dost not; it is
          not very likely swine should ever lift their heads from their troughs
          to think aught of stars. I do not much wonder that thou shouldst
          despise spiritual good, for thou art yet "in the gall of bitterness
          and the bonds of iniquity;" a stranger to spiritual things, and let
          thy despising of spiritual things teach thee that thou art not
          spiritual, and therefore thou canst not understand the spiritual,
          because it must be spiritually discerned. To the Christian, however,
          the highest good he can receive on earth is to grow in grace. "There!"
          he says, "I had rather be a bankrupt in business than I would be a
          bankrupt in grace; let my fortune be decreased -- better that, than
          that I should backslide; there! let thy waves and thy billows roll
          over me -- better an ocean of trouble than a drop of sin, I would
          rather have thy rod a thousand times upon my shoulders, O my God, than
          I would once put out my hand to touch that which is forbidden, or
          allow my foot to run in the way of gainsayers." The highest good a
          Christian has here is good spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we may add, the text also means good eternal, lasting good. All
          things work together for a Christian's lasting good. They all work to
          bring him to Paradise -- all work to bring him to the Saviour's feet.
          "So he bringeth them to their desired haven," said the Psalmist -- by
          storm and tempest, flood and hurricane. All the troubles of a
          Christian do but wash him nearer heaven; the rough winds do but hurry
          his passage across the straits of this life to the port of eternal
          peace. All things work together for the Christian's eternal and
          spiritual good.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet I must say here, that sometimes all things work together for
          the Christian's temporal good. You know the story of old Jacob.
          "Joseph is not, Simeon is not, and now ye will take Benjamin away; all
          these things are against me," said the old Patriarch. But if he could
          have read God's secrets, he might have found that Simeon was not lost,
          for he was retained as a hostage -- that Joseph was not lost but gone
          before to smooth the passage of his grey hairs into the grave, and
          that even Benjamin was to be taken away by Joseph in love to his
          brother. So that what seemed to be against him, even in temporal
          matters, was for him. You may have heard also the story of that
          eminent martyr who was wont always to say, "All things work together
          for good." When he was seized by the officers of Queen Mary, to be
          taken to the stake to be burned, he was treated so roughly on the road
          that he broke his leg; and they jeeringly said, "All things work
          together for good, do they? How will your broken leg work for your
          good?" "I don't know," said he, "how it will, but for my good I know
          it will work, and you shall see it so." Strange to say, it proved true
          that it was for his good; for being delayed a day or so on the road
          through his lameness, he just arrived in London in time enough to hear
          that Elizabeth was proclaimed queen, and so he escaped the stake by
          his broken leg. He turned round upon the men who carried him, as they
          thought, to his death, and said to them, "Now will you believe that
          all things work together for God?" So that though I said the drift of
          the text was spiritual good, yet sometimes in the main current there
          may be carried some rich and rare temporal benefits for God's children
          as well as the richer spiritual blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. I am treating the text as you see, verbally. And now I must return
          to the word "work" -- to notice the tense of it. "All things work
          together for good." It does not say that they shall work, or that they
          have worked; both of these are implied, but it says that they do work
          now. All things at this present moment are working together for the
          believer's good. I find it extremely easy to believe that all things
          have worked together for my good. I can look back at the past, and
          wonder at all the way whereby the Lord hath led me. If ever there
          lived a man who has reason to be grateful to Almighty God, I think I
          am that man. I can see black storms that have lowered o'er my head,
          and torrents of opposition that have run across my path, but I can
          thank God for every incident that ever occurred to me from my cradle
          up to now, and do not desire a better pilot for the rest of my days,
          than he who has steered me from obscurity and scorn, to this place to
          preach his word and feed this great congregation. And I doubt not that
          each of you, in looking back upon your past experience as Christians,
          could say very much the same. Through many troubles you have passed,
          but you can say, they have all been for your good. And somehow or
          other you have an equal faith for the future. You believe that all
          things will in the end work for your good. The pinch of faith always
          lies in the present tense. I can always believe the past, and always
          believe the future, but the present, the present, the present, that is
          what staggers faith. Now, please to notice that my text is in the
          present tense. "All things work," at this very instant and second of
          time. However troubled, downcast, depressed, and despairing, the
          Christian may be, all things are working now for his good; and though
          like Jonah he is brought to the bottom of the mountains, and he thinks
          the earth with her bars is about him for ever, and the weeds of
          despair are wrapped about his head, even in the uttermost depths all
          things are now working for his good. Here, I say again, is the pinch
          of faith. As an old countryman once said to me, from whom I gained
          many a pithy saying -- "Ah! sir, I could always do wonders when there
          were no wonders to do. I feel, sir, that I could believe God; but then
          at the time I feel so there is not much to believe." And he just
          paraphrased it in his own dialect like this -- "My arm is always
          strong, and my sickle always sharp, when there is no harvest, and I
          think I could mow many an acre when there is no grass; but when the
          harvest is on I am weak, and when the grass groweth then my scythe is
          blunt." Have not you found it so too? You think you can do wondrous
          things; you say,
        </p>
        <p>"Should earth against my soul engage,</p>
        <p>And hellish darts be hurled,</p>
        <p>Now I can smile at Satan's rage,</p>
        <p>And face a frowning world."</p>
        <p>
          And now a little capful of wind blows on you and the tears run down
          your cheeks, and you say, "Lord, let me die; I am no better than my
          fathers." You, that were going to thrash mountains, find that
          molehills cast you down.
        </p>
        <p>
          It behoveth each of us, then, to comfort and establish our hearts upon
          this word "work." "All things work." Merchant; though you have been
          sore pressed this week, and it is highly probable that next week will
          be worse still for you, believe that all things even then are working
          for your good. It will cost you many a pang to keep that confidence;
          but oh! for thy Master's honor, and for thine own comfort, retain that
          consolation. Should thine house of business threaten to tumble about
          thine ears so long as thou hast acted honourably, still bear thy
          cross. It shall work, it is working for thy good. This week, mother,
          thou mayest see thy first-born carried to the tomb. That bereavement
          is working for thy good. O man, within a few days, he that hath eaten
          bread with thee may lift up his heel against thee. It shall work for
          thy good. O thou that art high in spirits to-day, thou with the
          flashing eye and joyous countenance, ere the sun doth set some evil
          shall befal thee, and thou shalt be sad. Believe then that all things
          work together for thy good; if thou lovest God, and art called
          according to his purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And now we close by noticing the confidence with which the apostle
          speaks. "A fiction!" says one; "a pleasant fiction, sir!"
          "Sentimentalism!" says another; "a mere poetic sentimentalism." "Ah!"
          cries a third; "a downright lie." "No," says another, "there is some
          truth in it, certainly; men do get bettered by their afflictions, but
          it is a truth that is not valuable to me, for I do not realize the
          good that these things bring." Gentlemen, the apostle Paul was well
          aware of your objections; and therefore mark how confidently he
          asserts the doctrine. He does not say, "I am persuaded;" he does not
          say, "I believe;" but with unblushing confidence he appears before you
          and says, "We" (I have many witnesses) we know that all things work
          together." What Paul are you at? So strange and startling a doctrine
          as this asserted with such dogmatic impudence? What can you be at?
          Hear his reply! "We know;' In the mouth of two or three witnesses it
          shall all be established; but I have tens of thousands of witnesses."
          "We know," and the apostle lifts his hand to where the white-robed
          hosts are praising God for ever. -- "These," says he, "passed through
          great tribulation, and washed their robes and made them white in the
          blood of the Lamb: ask them!" And with united breath they reply, "We
          know that all things work together for good to them that love God."
          Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Daniel, all the mighty ones that have
          gone before, tell out the tale of their history, write their
          autobiography, and they say, "We!" It is proven to a demonstration in
          our own lives; it is a fact which runs like a golden clue through all
          the labyrinth of our history -- "All things work together for good to
          them that love God." "We," says the apostle again -- and he puts his
          hand upon his poor distressed brethren -- he looks at his companions
          in the prisonhouse at Rome; he looks at that humble band of teachers
          in Rome, in Philippi, in all the different parts of Asia, and he says,
          "We!" "We know it. It is not with us a matter of doubt; we have tried
          it, we have proved it. Not only does faith believe it, but our own
          history convinces us of the truth of it." I might appeal to scores and
          hundreds here, and I might say, brethren, you with grey heads, rise up
          and speak. Is this true or not? I see the reverend man rise, leaning
          on his staff, and with the tears "uttering his old cheeks, he says,
          "Young man it is true, I have proved it; even down to grey hairs I
          have proved it; he made, and he will carry; he will not desert his
          own!" Veteran! you have had many troubles, have you not? He replies,
          "Youth! troubles? I have had many troubles that thou reckest not of, I
          have buried all my kindred, and I am like the last oak of the forest,
          all my friends have been felled by death long ago. Yet I have been
          upheld till now, who could hold me up but my God!" Ask him whether God
          has been once untrue to him and he will say, "No; not one good thing
          hath failed of all that the Lord God hath promised; all hath come to
          pass!" Brethren, we can confidently say, then, hearing such a
          testimony as that, "We know that all things work." Besides, there are
          you of middle age, and even those of us who are young: the winter has
          not spared our branches, nor the lightnings ceased to scathe our
          trunk; yet here we stand; preserved by conquering grace. Hallelujah to
          the grace that makes all things work together for good!
        </p>
        <p>
          O my hearer, art thou a believer in Christ? If not, I beseech thee,
          stop and consider! Pause and think of thy state; and if thou knowest
          thine own sinfulness this day, believe on Christ, who came to save
          sinners, and that done, all things shall work for thee, the tumbling
          avalanche, the rumbling earthquake the tottering pillars of heaven,
          all, when they fall or shake, shall not hurt thee, they shall still
          work out thy good. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and be baptized,
          and thou shalt be saved," for so runneth the gospel. The Lord bless
          you! Amen.<br />
