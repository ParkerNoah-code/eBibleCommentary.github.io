          33. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and springs of water into
          dryness; 34. A fruitful land into saltness, because of the wickedness
          of those who dwell in it.35. He turneth the desert into a pool of
          water, and the land of barrenness into springs of water.36. And there
          he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may build a city of
          habitation; 37. And sow fields, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit
          of the increase.38. And he blesses them, and they multiplied greatly;
          and he maketh not their cattle to decrease.39. Afterwards they are
          lessened and dejected, by reason of anguish, misery, and sorrow.40. He
          poureth contempt upon princes, and maketh them to wander in a
          wilderness, where there is no way; 41. And he raiseth the afflicted
          out of misery, and maketh him families like a flock.

          33. He turneth rivers into a wilderness Here then is an account of
          changes which it would be the height of folly to attribute to chance.
          Fruitful lands become unfruitful, and barren lands assume the new
          aspect of freshness and fruitfulness. And how happens it that one
          district becomes sterile, and another becomes fat and fertile,
          contrary to what they were wont to be, but because that God pours out
          his wrath upon the inhabitants of the one, by taking his blessing from
          them, and renders the other fruitful to feed the hungry? It may be
          ascribed to the thinness of the population, that many parts of Asia
          and Greece, once exceedingly fruitful, now lie uncultivated and
          unproductive; but we must ascribe to the providence of God, which the
          prophet praises, the well authenticated fact, that in some places the
          earth that was fruitful has now become barren and parched, while
          others are beginning to be fertile.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is, however, not sufficient merely to observe, that these wonderful
          revolutions of the surface of the earth are the result of God's
          overruling purpose, unless we also observe, in the second place, what
          the prophet does not omit, that the earth is cursed by him on account
          of the iniquity of its inhabitants, who prove themselves to be
          undeserving of being so amply sustained by his bountiful hand. He has
          put pools and springs of water for fields or countries where there is
          an abundance of water; because moisture is required to nourish the
          plants by which fruit is produced. The term saltness is employed
          metaphorically, inasmuch as there is nothing more sterile than salt;
          hence that saying of Christ's,
        </p>
        <p>
          "If the salt have lost its saltness, what further purpose will it
          serve?"<br />Mark 9:50
        </p>
        <p>
          not even indeed for barrenness. And, consequently, when men designed
          to doom any place to remain unproductive, they usually sowed it with
          salt. And probably it is in allusion to this ancient custom, that the
          prophet says that the land was covered with salt.

          35. He turneth the desert into a pool of water This change, in
          contrast with the former, places the miraculous power of God in a more
          luminous position. Because, were the fields ceasing to be so
          productive as in former times, men of the world, as was common of old,
          would attribute this to the frequent crops which exhausted their
          productive power. But whence is it that parched grounds become so
          fruitful, that one would almost say that the atmosphere, as well as
          the nature of the soil, had undergone a change, unless it be that God
          hath there put forth a wonderful display of his power and goodness?
          Wherefore, the prophet very justly says, that the deserts were turned
          into pools of water, so that populous cities may rise up in waste and
          uncultivated places, where once there was not a single cottage. For it
          is as improbable that the nature of the soil is changed, as that the
          course of the sun and stars is changed. The clause, the hungry are
          filled, may mean, either that they themselves, after considerable
          privations, have got what may supply their need, or that those poor
          persons, living in a country where they cannot longer find daily
          bread, being constrained to leave it, and to seek a new place of
          abode, are there bountifully supplied by God. I am rather disposed to
          think, that this clause refers to what frequently occurs, namely, that
          the famishing, whose wants the world refuses to supply, and who are
          expatriated, are comfortably accommodated in these desert places,
          where God blesses them with abundance. The passage which I have
          translated, fruit of the increase, is, by not a few Hebrew expositors,
          considered as a repetition of two synonymous terms, and are for
          supplying a copulative conjunction, making it, fruit and increase But
          it was rather the intention of the prophet to refer to fruit yielded
          annually; as if he said, the fertility of these regions is not
          temporary, or only for a few years, it is perennial. For tvv'vt,
          tebuaoth, is the term which, in the Hebrew, denotes full-grown fruit
          annually produced by the earth. And when he says, that the new
          settlers sow and plant, he gives us to understand, that, prior to
          their arrival, cultivation was unknown in these places, and,
          consequently, in becoming so unusually fertile, they assumed a totally
          different aspect. And, in fine, he adds, that it was entirely owing to
          the Divine blessing that those who were once oppressed with poverty
          and want are now daily increasing in the good things of this life.

          39. Afterwards they are lessened Ere I enter upon the consideration of
          the truths contained in this verse, I must make some brief verbal
          observations. Some make the word vtsr, otser, to signify tyranny, and
          certainly tsr, atsar, does signify to bear rule. But since it is used
          metaphorically for anguish, it appears to me that this is the meaning
          which is most accordant with the tenor of the passage. The last two
          words of the verse may be read as in the nominative case, as I have
          rendered them, or in the genitive, the anguish of misery and sorrow
          This lection appears to me preferable, through the anguish of misery,
          and through sorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          We come now to notice shortly the main things in the passage. And as
          we had formerly a description of the changes which these districts
          underwent in relation to the nature of the soil, so now we are
          informed that mankind do not for ever continue in the same condition;
          because they both decrease in number, and lose their place and
          property by being reduced by wars or by civil commotions, or by other
          casualties. Therefore, whether they are wasted by the pestilence, or
          are defeated in battle, or are cut off by intestine broils, it is
          manifest that both their rank and condition undergo alteration. And
          what is the occasion of this change, but that God withdraws his grace,
          which hitherto formed the hidden spring from which all their
          prosperity issued? And as there are a thousand casualties by which
          cities may be ruined, the prophet brings forward one species of change
          of all others the most palpable and remarkable. And since God's hand
          is not observed in that which relates to persons living in comparative
          obscurity, he brings into view princes themselves, whose name and fame
          will not permit any memorable event which befalls them to remain in
          obscurity. For it seems that the world is made on their account. When
          God, therefore, hurls them from their lofty estate, then men, aroused
          as it were from their slumber, are prepared to regard his judgments.
          Here, too, the mode of address which is employed must be attended to;
          in saying, that God poured contempt upon princes, it is as if it was
          his pleasure, so long as they retained their dignity, that honor and
          respect should be paid to them. The words of Daniel are well known,
        </p>
        <p>
          "O king, God hath put the fear of thee in the very fowls of the heaven
          and the beasts of the earth," (Daniel 2:8)
        </p>
        <p>
          And assuredly, though princes may clothe themselves with power, yet
          that inward honor and majesty which God has conferred upon them, is a
          greater safeguard than any human arm. Nor even would a single village
          hold out for the space of three days, did not God, by his invisible
          and invincible agency, put a restraint upon the hearts of men. Hence,
          whenever God renders princes contemptible, their magnificent power
          must of necessity be subverted. This is a fact corroborated by
          history, that mighty potentates, who have been the terror and dread of
          the whole world, when once denuded of their dignity and power, have
          become the sport even of their own dependants. And inasmuch as such a
          striking revolution as this should be regarded as a wonderful display
          of God's power, yet such is the obtuseness of our minds, that we will
          not acknowledge his overruling providence. As a contrast to these
          reverses, the prophet afterwards shows, that the poor and ignoble are
          exalted, and their houses increased, and that those who were held in
          no estimation, suddenly increase in wealth and power. In these things
          men would assuredly recognize the providence of God, were it not that
          the perversity of their minds rendered them insensate.<br />
