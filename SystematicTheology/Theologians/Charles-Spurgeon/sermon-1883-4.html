        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.1729)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Thursday Evening, June 14th, 1883, by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington</p>
        <p>
          "And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
          name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." -- Luke 24:47.
        </p>
        <p>
          The servants of God were not left to originate a gospel for
          themselves, as certain modern teachers appear to do, nor were they
          even left to map out their mode of procedure in the spreading of the
          glad tidings. They were told by their great Master what to preach, and
          where to preach it, and how to preach it, and even where to begin to
          preach it. There is ample room for the exercise of our thought in
          obeying Christ's commands; but the worldly wise in these days call no
          one a thoughtful person who is content to be a docile follower of
          Jesus. They call themselves "thoughtful and cultured" simply because
          they set up their own thoughts in opposition to the thoughts of God.
          It were well if they would remember the old proverb -- "Let another
          praise thee, and not thine own lips." As a rule those who call
          themselves "intellectual" are by no means persons of great intellect.
          Great minds seldom proclaim their own greatness. These boasters are
          not satisfied to be "followers of God, as dear children," but must
          strike out a path for themselves; this reveals their folly rather than
          their culture. We shall find use for every faculty which we possess,
          even if we are endowed with ten talents, in doing just as we are
          bidden by our Lord. Implicit obedience is not thoughtless: on the
          contrary, it is necessary to its completeness that heart and mind
          should be active in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Ye that would faithfully serve Christ note carefully how he taught
          his disciples WHAT THEY WERE TO PREACH. We find different descriptions
          of the subject of our preaching, but on this occasion it is comprised
          in two things -- repentance and remission of sins. I am glad to find
          in this verse that old- fashioned virtue called repentance. It used to
          be preached, but it has gone out of fashion now. Indeed, we are told
          that we always misunderstood the meaning of the word "repentance"; and
          that it simply means a "change of mind," and nothing more. I wish that
          those who are so wise in their Greek knew a little more of that
          language, for they would not be so ready with their infallible
          statements. True, the word does signify a change of mind, but in its
          Scriptural connection it indicates a change of mind of an unusual
          character. It is not such a fitful thing as men mean when they speak
          of changing their minds, as some people do fifty times a day; but it
          is a change of mind of a deeper kind. Gospel repentance is a change of
          mind of the most radical sort -- such a change as never was wrought in
          any man except by the Spirit of God. We mean to teach repentance, the
          old-fashioned repentance, too; and I do not know a better description
          of it that the child's verse: --
        </p>
        <p>"Repentance is to leave</p>
        <p>The things we loved before,</p>
        <p>And show that we in earnest grieve</p>
        <p>By doing so no more."</p>
        <p>
          Let every man understand that he will never have remission of sin
          while he is in love with sin; and that if he abides in sin he cannot
          obtain the pardon of sin. There must be a hatred of sin, a loathing of
          it, and a turning from it, or it is not blotted out. We are to preach
          repentance as a duty. "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but
          now commandeth all men everywhere to repent." "Repent, and be baptized
          every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
          sins." He that has sinned is bound to repent of having sinned: it is
          the least that he can do. How can any man ask God for mercy while he
          abides in his sin?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to preach the acceptableness of repentance. In itself
          considered there is nothing in repentance deserving of the favour of
          God; but, the Lord Jesus Christ having come, we read, "He that
          confesseth and forsaketh his sin shall find mercy." God accepts
          repentance for the sake of his dear Son. He smiles upon the penitent
          sinner, and puts away his iniquities. this we are to make known on all
          sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also to preach the motives of repentance -- that men may not
          repent from mere fear of hell, but they must repent of sin itself.
          Every thief is sorry when he has to go to prison: every murderer is
          sorry when the noose is about his neck: the sinner must repent, not
          because of the punishment of sin, but because his sin is sin against a
          pardoning God, sin against a bleeding Saviour, sin against a holy law,
          sin against a tender gospel. The true penitent repents of sin against
          God, and he would do so even if there were no punishment. When he is
          forgiven, he repents of sin more than ever; for he sees more clearly
          than ever the wickedness of offending so gracious a God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to preach repentance in its perpetuity. Repentance is not a
          grace which is only to be exercised by us for a week or so at the
          beginning of our Christian career: it is to attend us all the way to
          heaven. Faith and repentance are to be inseparable companions
          throughout our pilgrimage to glory. Repenting of our sin, and trusting
          in the great Sinbearer, is to be the tenor of our lives; and we are to
          preach to men that it must be so.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to tell them of the source of repentance, namely, that the Lord
          Jesus Christ is exalted on high to give repentance and remission of
          sins. Repentance is a plant that never grows on nature's dunghill: the
          nature must be changed, and repentance must be implanted by the Holy
          Spirit, or it will never flourish in our hearts. We preach repentance
          as a fruit of the Spirit, or else we greatly err.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our second theme is to be remission of sins. What a blessed subject is
          this! To preach the full pardon of sin -- that it is blotted out once
          for all; the free pardon of sin -- that God forgives voluntarily of
          his own grace; free forgiveness for the very chief of sinners for all
          their sins, however black they may be; is not this a grand subject? We
          are to preach a final and irreversible remission; not a pardon which
          is given and taken back again, so that a man may have his sins
          forgiven and yet be punished for them. I loathe such a gospel as that,
          and could not preach it. It would come with an ill grace from these
          lips. But the pardon of God once given stands for ever. If he has cast
          our sin into the depths of the sea it will never be washed up again.If
          he has removed our transgressions from us as far as the east is from
          the west, how can they return to condemn us? Once washed in the blood
          of the Lamb we are clean. The deed is done: the one offering has put
          away for ever all the guilt of believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this is what we are to preach -- free, full, irreversible pardon
          for all that repent of sin, and lay hold on Christ by faith. O
          servants of the Lord, be not ashamed to declare it, for this is your
          message!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Next to this, we are told WHERE IT IS TO BE PREACHED. The text
          says that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
          name among all nations. Here, then, we have the divine warrant for
          missions. They are no speculations, or enthusiastic dreams; they are
          matters of divine command. I daresay you have heard of what the Duke
          of Wellington said to a missionary in India who was questioning
          whether it was of any use to preach the gospel to the Hindus. "What
          are your marching orders?" said this man of discipline and obedience.
          "What are your marching orders?" that is the deciding question. Now
          the marching orders are, "Go ye into all the world and preach the
          gospel to every creature." What a wonder it is that the church did not
          see this long before. After her first days she seems to have fallen
          asleep, and it is scarcely a hundred years ago since in the providence
          and grace of God the church began to wake to her high enterprise. We
          are to preach the gospel everywhere: missions are to be universal. All
          nations need the preaching of the word. The gospel is a remedy for
          every human ill among all the races that live upon the face of the
          earth. Some out of all nations shall receive it; for there shall be
          gathered before the eternal throne men out of every kindred, and
          nation, and tongue. No nation will utterly refuse it: there will be
          found a remnant according to the election of grace even among the most
          perverse of the tribes of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ought to preach it to every creature, for it is written that it
          behoved to be so. Read the forty-sixth verse: "Thus it is written, and
          thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
          day: . . . and that repentance and remission of sins should be
          preached among all nations." Brethren, there was a divine necessity
          that Christ should die, and an equally imperative must that he should
          arise again from the dead; but there is an equally absolute necessity
          that Jesus should be preached to every creature under heaven. It
          behooves to be so. Who, then, will linger? Let us each one, according
          to his ability and opportunity, tell to all around us the story of the
          forgiveness of sin through the Mediator's sacrifice to as many as
          confess their sin and forsake it. We are bidden to preach repentance
          of sin and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, let us not be slow to do
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But this is not all . We are actually told HOW TO PREACH IT.
          Repentance and remission are to be preached in Christ's name. What
          does this mean? Ought we not to learn from this that we are to tell
          the gospel to others, because Christ orders us to do so? In Christ's
          name we must do it. Silence is sin when salvation is the theme. If
          these should hold their peace, the stones would cry out against them.
          My brethren, you must proclaim the gospel according to your ability:
          it is not a thing which you may do or may not do at your own
          discretion; but you must do it if you have any respect for your
          Saviour's name. If you dare pray in that name, if you dare hope in
          that name, if you hear the music of joy in that name, then in the name
          of Jesus Christ preach the gospel in every land.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it means more than that. Not only preach it under his orders, but
          preach it on his authority. The true servant of Christ has his Master
          to back him up. The Lord Jesus will seal by threatening or by grace
          the word of his faithful messengers. If we threaten the ungodly, the
          threatening shall be fulfilled. If we announce God's promise to the
          penitent, that promise shall be surely kept. The Lord Jesus will not
          let the words of his own ambassadors fall to the ground. "Lo, I am
          with you alway," says he, "even to the end of the world. Go ye
          therefore and teach all nations." You have Christ with you: teach the
          nations by his authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          But does it not mean, also, that the repentance and the remission
          which are so bound together come to men by virtue of his name? Oh,
          sinner, there would be no acceptance of your repentance if it were not
          for that dear name! Oh, guilty conscience, there would be no ease for
          you through the remission of sin if it were not that the blessed name
          of Jesus is sweet to the Lord God of hosts! We dare preach pardon to
          you in his name. The blood has been shed and sprinkled on the burning
          throne: the Christ has gone in within the veil, and stands there "able
          to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he
          ever liveth to make intercession for them." Salvation in his name
          there is assuredly, and this is our glory; but "there is none other
          name given under heaven among men whereby we must be saved." That name
          has a fullness of saving efficacy, and if you will but rest in it, you
          shall find salvation, and find it now. Thus you see we are not bidden
          to go forth and say -- We preach you the gospel in the name of our own
          reason; or we preach you the gospel in the name of the church to which
          we belong, or by the authority of a synod, or a bishop, or a creed, or
          a whole church. No, we declare the truth in the name of Christ. Christ
          has set his honour to pawn for the truth of the gospel. He will lose
          his glory if sinners that believe and repent are not saved. Dishonour
          will come to the Son of God if any man repenting of sin is not
          accepted before God. For his name's sake he will not cast away one
          that comes to him. O chief of sinners! he will receive you if you will
          come. He cannot reject you; that were to be false to his own promise,
          untrue to his own nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be sure then that you preach in Christ's name. If you preach in your
          own name it is poor work. A man says to me, "I cannot tell a dead
          sinner to live. I cannot tell a blind sinner to see. I cannot invite
          an insensible sinner; it is absurd; for the sinner is altogether
          without strength." No, dear sir, I do not suppose you can do so while
          you speak according to carnal reason. Does the good man say that God
          has not sent him to bid the dead arise? Then let him not do it. Pray
          let him not try to do what God never sent him to do. Let him go home
          and go to bed; he will probably do as much good asleep as awake. But
          as for me, I am sent to preach in Jesus' name, "Believe and live," and
          therefore I am not slow to do so. I am sent on purpose to say, Ye dry
          bones, live, and I dare do no otherwise. No faithful minister who
          knows what faith means looks to the sinner for power to believe, or
          looks to himself for power; but he looks to the Master that sent him
          for power; and in the name of Christ he says to the withered hand, "Be
          stretched out," and he says to the dead, "Come forth!" and he does not
          speak in vain. Oh, yes, it is in Christ's name that we fulfill our
          office! We are miracle-workers: he endows us with his power if in
          faith we tell out his gospel. All of you who try to speak the gospel
          may do it without fear of failure; for the power lies in the gospel
          and in the Spirit who goes with it, not in the preacher or in the
          sinner. Blessed be the name of God, we have this treasure in earthen
          vessels but the excellency of the power is of God, and not of us. So
          he tells us, then, what to preach, and where to preach it, and how to
          preach it.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. Now, I shall ask your attention to the principal topic of the
          present discourse, and that is, that he told his disciples WHERE TO
          BEGIN.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have heard of a Puritan who had in his sermon forty-five main
          divisions, and about ten subdivisions under every head. He might be
          said largely to divide the word of truth, even if he did not rightly
          divide it. Now,I have nine subheads to-night, and yet I hope I shall
          not detain you beyond the usual time. I cannot make fewer of them and
          give the full meaning of this sentence -- "Beginning at Jerusalem."
          The apostles were not to pick and choose where they should start, but
          they were to begin at Jerusalem. Why?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, because it was written in the Scriptures that they were to
          begin at Jerusalem: "Thus it is written,and thus it behooves, that
          repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among
          all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." It was so written: I will give
          you two or three proofs. Read in the second chapter of Isaiah, at the
          third verse: "Out of Zion shall come forth the law, and the word of
          the Lord from Jerusalem." Isaiah's word would have fallen to the
          ground if the preaching had not begun at Jerusalem; but now, to the
          very letter, this prediction of the evangelical prophet is kept. In
          Joel, that famous Joel who prophesied the descent of the Spirit and
          the speaking of the servants and the handmaidens, we read in the
          second chapter, at the thirty-second verse, "In mount Zion and in
          Jerusalem shall be deliverance;" and again in the sixteenth verse of
          the third chapter of the same prophet -- "The Lord shall roar out of
          Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem." As if the Lord were as a
          strong lion in the midst of Jerusalem, and as if the sounding forth of
          the gospel was like the roaring of his voice, that the nations might
          hear and tremble. How could those promises have been kept if the
          gospel had begun to be preached in the deserts of Arabia, or if the
          first church of Christ had been set up at Damascus? Note another
          passage. Obadiah in his twenty-first verse says, "Saviours shall come
          up on mount Zion." Who were these saviours but those who
          instrumentally became so by proclaiming the Saviour Jesus Christ. And
          Zechariah, who is full of visions, but not visionary, says in his
          fourteenth chapter at the eighth verse, "Living waters shall flow out
          of Jerusalem," and then he describes the course of those waters till
          they flowed even unto the Dead Sea, and made its waters sweet. Because
          the Bible said so, therefore they must begin at Jerusalem, and I call
          your attention to this, for our Lord Jesus was particular that every
          jot and tittle of the Old Testament should be fulfilled. Do you not
          think that this reads us a lesson that we should be very reverent
          towards every sentence of both the Old and the New Testaments; and if
          there be anything taught by our Lord ought not his people to consider
          well, and act according to the divine ordinance? I am afraid that many
          take their religion from their parents, or from the church that is
          nearest to them, without weighing it. "I counsel thee to keep the
          King's commandment." Oh, that we may be more faithful servants of the
          Lord; for if we are faithful we shall be careful upon what men call
          small points, such as the doctrine of baptism, the manner of the
          Lord's Supper, or this small point of where the gospel should be first
          preached. It must begin at Jerusalem and nowhere else; for the
          Scripture cannot be broken. See ye to it, then, that ye walk according
          to the word of God, and that ye test everything by it. "To the law and
          to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is
          because there is no light in them." So much on that first head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I suppose that our Lord bade his disciples begin to preach
          the gospel at Jerusalem, because it was at Jerusalem that the facts
          which make up the gospel had occurred. It was there that Jesus Christ
          died, that he was buried, that he rose again, and that he ascended
          into heaven. All these things happened at Jerusalem, or not far from
          it. Therefore the witness-bearing of the apostles must be upon the
          spot where if they lie they can be confuted, and where persons can
          come forward and say, "It was not so; you are deceivers." If our Lord
          had said, "Do not say anything in Jerusalem. Go away to Rome and begin
          preaching there," it would not have looked quite so straightforward as
          it now does when he says, "Preach this before the scribes and the
          priests. They know that it is so. They have bribed the soldiers to say
          otherwise, but they know that I have risen." The disciples were to
          preach the gospel in the streets of Jerusalem. There were people in
          that city who were once lame, and who leaped like a hart when Jesus
          healed them. There were men and women there who ate of the fish and
          that bread that Jesus multiplied. There were people in Jerusalem who
          had seen their children and their friends healed of dreadful diseases.
          Jesus bids his disciples beard the lion in his den, and declare the
          gospel on the spot where, if it had been untrue, it would have been
          contradicted with violence. Our Lord seemed to say, "Point to the very
          place where my death took place. Tell them that they crucified me; and
          see if they dare deny it. Bring it home to their consciences that they
          rejected the Christ of God." Hence it was that, coming to the very
          people who had seen these things, the preaching of Peter had unusual
          force about it: in addition to the power of the Holy Spirit there was
          also this -- that he was telling them of a crime which they had newly
          committed, and could not deny: and when they saw their error they
          turned to God with penitent hearts. I like this thought -- that they
          were to begin at Jerusalem, because there the events of the gospel
          occurred. This is a direction for you, dear friend: if you have been
          newly converted, do not be ashamed to tell those who know you. A
          religion which will not stand the test of the fireside is not worth
          much! "Oh," says one. "I have never told my husband. I get out on a
          Thursday night, but he does not know where I am going, and I steal in
          here. I have never even told my children that I am a believer. I do
          not like to let it be known. I am afraid that all my family would
          oppose me." Oh, yes; you are going to heaven, round by the back lanes.
          Going to sneak into glory as a rat crawls into a room through a hole
          in the floor! Do not attempt it. Never be ashamed of Christ. Come
          straight out and say to your friends, "You know what I was; but now I
          have become a disciple of Jesus Christ." Begin at Jerusalem: it was
          your Lord's command. He had nothing to be ashamed of. There was no
          falsehood in what he bade his disciples preach, and therefore he did
          as good as say, "Hang up my gospel to the light. It is nothing but
          truth, therefore display it before mine enemies' eyes." If yours is a
          true, genuine, thorough conversion, I do not say that you are to go up
          and down the street crying out that you are converted; but on due
          occasions you must not hide your convictions. Conceal not what the
          Lord has done for you, but hold up your candle in your own house.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third reason why the Lord Jesus told them to begin at Jerusalem
          may have been that he knew that there would come a time when some of
          his disciples would despise the Jews, and therefore he said -- When
          you preach my gospel, begin with them. This is a standing commandment,
          and everywhere we ought to preach the gospel to the Jew as well as to
          the Gentile; Paul even says, "to the Jew first." Some seem to think
          that there ought to be no mission to the Jews -- that there is no hope
          of converting them, that they are of no use when they are converted,
          and so on. I have even heard some who call themselves Christians speak
          slightingly of the Jewish people. What! and your Lord and Master a
          Jew! There is no race on earth so exalted as they are. They are the
          seed of Abraham, God's friend. We have nobles and dukes in England,
          but how far could they trace their pedigree? Why, up to a nobody. But
          the poorest Jew on earth is descended linearly from Jacob, and Isaac,
          and Abraham. Instead of treating them with anything like disrespect,
          the Saviour says, "Begin at Jerusalem." Just as we say, "Ladies
          first," so it is "the Jew first." They take precedence among races,
          and are to be first waited on at the gospel feast. Jesus would have us
          entertain a deep regard to that nation which God chose of old, and out
          of which Christ also came, for he is of the seed of Abraham according
          to the flesh. He puts those first who knew him first. Let us never
          sneer at a Jew again; for our Lord teaches us the rule of his house
          when he says, "Begin at Jerusalem." Let the seed of Israel first have
          the gospel presented to them, and if they reject it we shall be clear
          of their blood. But we shall not be faithful to our orders unless we
          have taken note of Jews as well as Gentiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth reason for beginning at Jerusalem is a practical lesson for
          you. Begin where you are tempted not to begin. Naturally these
          disciples would have said one to another when they met, "We cannot do
          much here in Jerusalem. The first night that we met together the doors
          were shut for fear of the Jews. It is of no use for us to go out into
          the street; these people are all in such an excited frame of mind that
          they will not receive us; we had better go up to Damascus, or take a
          long journey and then commence preaching; and when this excitement is
          cooled down, and they have forgotten about the crucifixion, we will
          come and introduce Christ gradually, and say as little as we can about
          putting him to death." That would have been the rule of policy -- that
          rule which often governs men who ought to be led by faith. But our
          Lord had said, "Beginning at Jerusalem," and so Peter must stand up in
          the midst of that motley throng, and he must tell them, "This Jesus
          whom ye have with wicked hands crucified and slain is now risen from
          the dead." Instead of tearing Peter to pieces they come crowding up,
          crying, "We believe in Jesus: let us be baptized into his sacred
          name." The same day there were added to the church three thousand
          souls, and a day or two afterwards five thousand were converted by the
          same kind of preaching. We ought always to try to do good where we
          think that it will not succeed. If we have a very strong aversion as a
          token that we are not called to it, we may regard it as a sign that we
          ought at least to try it. The devil knows you, dear friend, better
          than you know yourself. You see, he has been longer in the world than
          you have, and he knows a great deal more about human nature than you
          do; and so he comes to you, and he reckons you up pretty accurately,
          and says, "This brother would be very useful in a certain sphere of
          labour, and I must keep him from it." So he tells the brother that he
          is not called to it, and that it is not the sort of thing for him, and
          so on; and then he says to himself, "I have turned aside one foe from
          harming my cause." Yonder is a good sister. Oh, how much she might do
          for Christ, but Satan guides her into a work in which she will never
          shine; while the holy work which she could do right well is dreaded by
          her. I heard a beautiful story last Wednesday, when I was sitting to
          see inquirers, and I cannot help mentioning it here, for it may be a
          suggestion to some Christian who is present. A brother, who will be
          received into the church, was converted in the following way. He came
          up to London, and worked in a certain parish in the West- end. He was
          at work on a sewer, and a lady from one of the best houses in the
          West-end came to the men that were making the sewer and said, "You
          men, come into my servants' hall and eat your dinners. I will give you
          either tea or coffee with your meal, and then you will not have to go
          into the public-house." Some of them went in, but others did not. So
          the next day the lady came out, and said, "Now, I know that you think
          my place too fine for you. You do not like to come; so I have come out
          to fetch you in. While this sewer is being done I should like you to
          eat your dinners in my house." She got them all in; and when they had
          done their dinners and drank their tea or coffee she began to talk to
          them about Jesus Christ. The work was a month or so about, and it was
          every day the same. Our friend does not know the lady's name, but he
          knows the name of Jesus through her teaching. Friends, we lose hosts
          of opportunities; I am sure we do. Many ways of doing good have never
          occurred to our minds, but they ought to occur to us; and when they do
          occur we should use them. Let us crucify the flesh about this. Let us
          overcome natural timidity. Let us in some way or other begin at
          Jerusalem, which is just where we thought that we never could begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now fifthly. We are getting on, you see. "Beginning at Jerusalem,"
          must surely mean begin at home. Jerusalem was the capital city of
          their own country. You know the old proverb, "The cobbler's wife goes
          barefoot." I am afraid that this proverb is verified by some
          Christians. They do a deal of good five miles off home, but none at
          home. I knew a man who used to go out with preachers every night in
          the week, and try to preach himself, poor soul that he was; but his
          children were so neglected that they were the most wicked children in
          the street, and they grew up in all manner of vice. The father was
          prancing about and looking after other people, and did not care for
          his own family. Now, if you are going to serve Christ to the very ends
          of the earth, take care that you begin at home. Dear parents, need I
          urge you to look to your own children? It is a great joy to me to know
          that the members of the church for the most part do this. When a dear
          sister came to me on Wednesday night with three of her children,
          making four that had come within the last six weeks, I felt grateful
          to God that parents were looking after their offspring. But if any of
          you are in the Sabbath-school, and never have a Sabbath-school at
          home; if any of you talk to strangers in the aisles, but are
          neglecting your own sons and daughters -- oh, let it not be so! The
          power of a father's prayers with his arms about his boy's neck I know
          full well. The power of a mother's prayers with her children all
          kneeling round her is far greater with the young than any public
          ministry will be. Look well to your children: begin at Jerusalem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Begin with your servants. Do not let a servant live in your house in
          ignorance of the gospel. Do not have family prayer merely as a matter
          of form, but let it be a reality. Do not have one person working for
          you to whom you have never spoken about his or her soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Begin with your brothers. Oh, the influence of sisters over brothers!
          I have a friend -- a dear friend, too -- who has long been a man of
          God, but in his young days he was a very loose fellow, and often he
          was all the night away from home. His sister used to write letters to
          him, and frequently while half tipsy he has read them under the street
          lamp. One letter which he read cut him to the quick. His sister's
          grief about him was too much for him, and he was compelled to seek and
          find the Saviour. Well has the sister been rewarded for all her love
          to him. Oh, dear friends, begin at Jerusalem! Begin with your brothers
          and sisters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Begin with your neighbours. Oh, this London of ours! It is a horrible
          place for Christian people to live in! Round about this neighbourhood
          scarcely can a decent person remain by reason of the vice that
          abounds, and the language that is heard on every side. Many of you are
          as much vexed to-day as Lot was when he was in Sodom. Well, bear your
          witness. Do not be dumb dogs, but speak up for your Lord and Master
          whenever you are. Look at our dear brother Lazenby, who entered a
          workshop where none feared the Lord, and has been the means of
          bringing all in the shop to God. Another shop has felt his influence,
          and the first recruit has come to join the church: I should not wonder
          if the whole of the workmen in the second shop should come, too. The
          Lord grant it. It is marvelous how the gospel spreads when men are in
          earnest, and their lives are right. God make you so to live that you
          show piety at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, sixthly, begin where much has been already done. Begin at
          Jerusalem. It is hard work, dear friends, to preach to certain people:
          they have been preached to so long, like the people at Jerusalem. They
          know all about the gospel, it is hard to tell them anything fresh, and
          yet they have felt nothing, but remain wedded to their sins. The
          Jerusalem people had been taught for centuries in vain; and yet
          Christ's disciples were to speak to them first. We must not pass the
          gospel-hardened; we must labour for the conversion of those who have
          enjoyed privileges but have neglected them, those who have had
          impressions and have crushed them out, those who seem now as if they
          had sealed their own death-warrants and would never be saved. Do not
          hesitate to go to them. The Lord has done much already: it may be that
          he has laid the fire, and you are to strike the match and set it all
          alight. Many people have a love to the gospel, a love to the house of
          God, a love to God's people, and yet they have no saving faith. What a
          pity! Do not hesitate to address them. I think I hear you say, "I
          would rather go and preach to the outcasts." So would I; but you and I
          are not allowed to pick our work. Virgin soil yields the best harvest;
          and if a man might choose a congregation that is likely to be
          fruitful, he might well select those that have never heard the word
          before. But we have not our choice. The Saviour's disciples were to
          begin where the prophets had prophesied, and had been put to death;
          where sinners had rejected God's voice times out of mind. Therefore do
          not pass by your fellow-seatholders. Perhaps you say, "Sir, I have
          spoken to them a great many times, but I cannot make anything of
          them." No, you cannot; but God can. Try again. Suppose that for twenty
          years you were to sit in this Tabernacle side by side with an
          unconverted person, and you were to speak to that person twice every
          Sunday and twice in the week, and all the twenty years it should be in
          vain; yet if the individual was brought to Christ at last would not
          his conversion repay you? Is your time so very precious? Is your
          ability so very great? Oh, my dear friend, if you were an archangel it
          would be worth while for you to work a thousand years to bring one
          soul to Christ! A soul is such a precious jewel that you would be
          abundantly rewarded if a century of service only brought you one
          conversion. Wherefore, in working for Christ, do not hesitate to go to
          those who have refused the gospel hitherto, for you may yet prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seventhly, begin where the gospel day is short. If you ask me where I
          get that thought, it is from the fact that within a very short time
          Jerusalem was to be destroyed. The Romans were to come there to slay
          men, women, and children, and break down the walls and leave not one
          stone upon another. And Christ's disciples knew this; wherefore their
          Lord said, "Begin at Jerusalem." Now, then, if you have any choice as
          to the person you shall speak to, select an old man. He is near his
          journey's end, and if he is unsaved there is but a little bit of
          candle left by the light of which he may come to Christ. Choose the
          old man, and do not let him remain ignorant of the gospel. Fish him up
          at once, for with him it is now or never, since he is on the borders
          of the grave. Or when any of you notice a girl upon whose cheek you
          see that hectic flush which marks consumption -- if you notice during
          service the deep "churchyard" cough -- say to yourself, "I will not
          let you go without speaking to you, for you may soon be dead." How
          many a time have I seen a consumptive at Mentone apparently getting
          better; but I have noticed him rise from dinner with his handkerchief
          to his mouth and soon they have whispered, "He died of hemorrhage" --
          suddenly taken off. When you meet with a pining case, do not wait to
          be introduced, but introduce yourself; and tenderly, gently, quietly,
          lovingly say a word about coming to Christ at once. We ought speedily
          to look up those whose day of grace is short. Perhaps, also, there is
          a stranger near you who is going far away to a distant land, and may
          never hear the gospel again; therefore, if you have an opportunity,
          take care that you avail yourself of it, and reason with him for Jesus
          at once. Begin at Jerusalem: begin where the day of grace is short.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eighthly, begin, dear friend, where you may expect opposition. That is
          a singular thing to advise, but I recommend it because the Saviour
          advised it. It was as certain as that twice two are four that if they
          preached Christ in Jerusalem, there would be a noise, for there were
          persons living there who hated the very name of Jesus, for they had
          conspired to put him to death. If they began at Jerusalem they would
          arouse a ferocious opposition. But nothing is much better for the
          gospel than opposition. A man comes into the Tabernacle to-night, and
          as he goes away he says, "Yes, I was pleased and satisfied." In that
          man's case I have failed. But another man keeps biting his tongue, for
          he cannot endure the preaching. He is very angry; something in the
          doctrine dos not suit him, and he cries, "As long as I live I will
          never come here again." That man is hopeful. He begins to think. The
          hook has taken hold of him. Give us time, and we will have that fish.
          It is no ill omen when a man gets angry with the gospel. It is bad
          enough, but it is infinitely better than that horrible lethargy into
          which men fall when they do not think. Some are not good enough even
          to oppose the gospel of Jesus Christ. Be hopeful of the man who will
          not let you speak to him, he is one that you must approach again; and
          if, when he does let you speak to him, he seems as if he would spit on
          you, be grateful for it. He feels your words. You are touching him on
          a sore place. You will have him yet. When he swears that he does not
          believe a word of what you say, do not believe a word of what he says;
          for often the man who openly objects secretly believes. Just as boys
          whistle when they go through a churchyard in order to keep their
          courage up, so many a blasphemer is profane in order to silence his
          conscience. When he feels the hook, like the fish, the man will drag
          away from it. Give him line. Let him go. The hook will hold, and in
          due time you will have him. Do not despair. Do not think it a horrible
          thing that he should oppose you; you should rather be grateful for it,
          and go to God and cry that he will give you that soul for your hire.
          Begin courageously where you may expect opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, lastly, to come to the meaning which Mr John Bunyan has put upon
          the text in his famous book called "The Jerusalem Sinner Saved," I
          have no doubt that the Saviour bade them begin at Jerusalem, because
          the biggest sinners lived there. There they lived who had crucified
          him. The loving Jesus bids them preach repentance and remission to
          them. There he lived who had pierced the Saviour's side, and they that
          had plaited the crown of thorns, and put it on his head. There dwell
          those who had mocked him and spat upon him; therefore the loving
          Jesus, who so freely forgives, says, "Go and preach the gospel first
          to them." The greatest sinners are the objects of the greatest mercy.
          Preach first to them. Are there any such here? My dear friend, we must
          preach the gospel first to you because you want it most. You are
          dying; your wounds are bleeding; the heavenly surgeon bids us staunch
          your wounds first. Others who are not so badly hurt may wait awhile,
          but you must be first served lest you die of your injuries. Should not
          this encourage you great sinners to come to Jesus, when he bids us
          preach to you first?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are to preach to you first because, when you have received him, you
          will praise him most. If you are saved you will encourage others to
          come, and you will cheer up those who have come already. We shall be
          glad to get fresh blood poured into the veins of the church by the
          conversion of big sinners who love much because they have had much
          forgiven. Therefore, we are to come to you first. Will you not come to
          Christ at once? Oh, that you would believe in him! Oh that you would
          believe in him to-night! To you is the word of this salvation sent.
          You old sinners -- you that have added sin to sin, and done all you
          can do with both hands wickedly -- you that have cursed his name --
          you that have robbed others -- you that have told lies -- you that
          have blackened yourselves with every crime, come and welcome to Jesus.
          Come to Christ and live at once. Mercy's door is set wide open on
          purpose that the vilest of the vile may come; and they are called to
          come first. Just as you are, come along with you. Tarry not to cleanse
          or mend, but now "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
          saved." This night if you believe in Jesus you shall go out of these
          doors rejoicing that the Lord has put away your sin. To believe is to
          trust -- simply to trust in Christ. It seems a very simple thing, but
          that is why it is so hard. If it were a hard thing you would more
          readily attend to it; but being so easy you cannot believe that it is
          effectual. But it is so; faith does save. Christ wants nothing of you
          but that you accept what he freely presents to you. Put out an empty
          hand, a black hand, a trembling hand; accept what Jesus gives, and
          salvation is yours.

          Thus have I tried to expound "Beginning at Jerusalem," O that my Lord
          would begin with you. Amen.
