        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.173)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 24, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when
          thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed,
          he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
          in his hand." -- Isaiah 53:10.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHAT myriads of eyes are casting their glances at the sun! What
          multitudes of men lift up their eyes, and behold the starry orbs of
          heaven! They are continually watched by thousands -- but there is one
          great transaction in the world's history, which every day commands far
          more spectators than that sun which goeth forth like a bridegroom,
          strong to run his race. There is one great event, which every day
          attracts more admiration than do the sun, and moon, and stars, when
          they march in their courses. That event is, the death of our Lord
          Jesus Christ. To it, the eyes of all the saints who lived before the
          Christian era were always directed; and backwards, through the
          thousand years of history, the eyes of all modern saints are looking.
          Upon Christ, the angels in heaven perpetually gaze. "Which things the
          angels desire to look into," said the apostle. Upon Christ, the myriad
          eyes of the redeemed are perpetually fixed; and thousands of pilgrims,
          through this world of tears, have no higher object for their faith,
          and no better desire for their vision, than to see Christ as he is in
          heaven, and in communion to behold his person. Beloved, we shall have
          many with us, whilst this morning we turn our face to the Mount of
          Calvary. We shall not be solitary spectators of the fearful tragedy of
          our Saviour's death: we shall but dart our eyes to that place which is
          the focus of heaven's joy and delight, the cross of our Lord and
          Saviour Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking our text, then, as a guide, we propose to visit Calvary, hoping
          to have the help of the Holy Spirit whilst we look upon him who died
          upon the cross. I would have you notice this morning, first of all,
          the cause of Christ's death -- "It pleased the Lord to bruise him."
          "It pleased Jehovah to bruise him," saith the original; "he hath put
          him to grief." Secondly, the reason of Christ's death -- "When thou
          shalt make his soul an offering for sin." Christ died because he was
          an offering for sin. And then, thirdly, the effects and consequences
          of Christ's death. "He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days,
          and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand." Come, Sacred
          Spirit, now, whilst we attempt to speak on these matchless themes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, we have THE ORIGIN OF CHRIST'S DEATH. "It pleased Jehovah to
          bruise him; he hath put him to griefs." He who reads Christ's life, as
          a mere history, traces the death of Christ to the enmity of the Jews,
          and to the fickle character of the Roman governor. In this he acteth
          justly, for the crime and sin of the Saviour's death must lay at the
          door of manhood. This race of ours became a deicide and slew the Lord,
          and nailed its Saviour to a tree. But he who reads the Bible with the
          eye of faith, desiring to discover its hidden secrets, sees something
          more in the Saviour's death than Roman cruelty, or Jewish malice: he
          sees the solemn decree of God fulfilled by men, who were the ignorant,
          but guilty instruments of its accomplishment. He looks beyond the
          Roman spear and nail, beyond the Jewish taunt and jeer, up to the
          Sacred Fount, whence all things flow, and traces the crucifixion of
          Christ to the breast of Deity. He believes with Peter -- "Him, being
          delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have
          taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain." We dare not
          impute to God the sin, but at the same time the fact, with all its
          marvelous effects in the world's redemption, we must ever trace to the
          Sacred Fountain of divine love. So cloth our prophet. He says, "It
          pleased Jehovah to bruise him. He overlooks both Pilate and Herod, and
          traces it to the heavenly Father, the first Person in the Divine
          Trinity. "It pleased the Lord to bruise him, he hath put him to
          grief."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, beloved, there be many who think that God the Father is at best
          but an indifferent spectator of salvation. Others do belie him still
          more. They look upon Him as an unloving, severe Being, who had no love
          to the human race, and could only be made loving by the death and
          agonies of our Saviour. Now, this is a foul libel upon the fair and
          glorious grace of God the Father, to whom for ever be honor: for Jesus
          Christ did not die to make God loving, but he died because God was
          loving.
        </p>
        <p>"Twas not to make Jehovah's love</p>
        <p>Toward his people flame,</p>
        <p>That Jesus from the throne above,</p>
        <p>A suffering man became.</p>
        <p>"Twas not the death which he endured,</p>
        <p>Nor all the pangs he bore,</p>
        <p>That God's eternal love procured,</p>
        <p>For God was love before."</p>
        <p>
          Christ was sent into the world by his Father, as the consequence of
          the Father's affection for his people. Yea, he "so loved the world,
          that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
          should not perish, but have everlasting life. The fact is, that the
          Father as much decreed salvation, as much effected it, and as much
          delighted in it, as did either God the Son, or God the Holy Spirit.
          And when we speak of the Saviour of the world, we must always include
          in that word, if we speak in a large sense, God the Father, God the
          Son, and God the Holy Ghost, for all these three, as one God, do save
          us from our sins. The text puts away every hard thought concerning the
          Father, by telling us that it pleased Jehovah to bruise Jesus Christ.
          The death of Christ is traceable to God the Father. Let us try if we
          can see it is so.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. First it is traceable in decree. God, the one God of heaven and
          earth, hath the book of destiny entirely in his power. In that book
          there is nothing written by a stranger's hand. The penmanship of the
          solemn book of predestination is from beginning to end entirely
          divine.
        </p>
        <p>"Chained to his throne a volume lies,</p>
        <p>With all the fates of men,</p>
        <p>With every angel's form and size</p>
        <p>Drawn by th' eternal pen."</p>
        <p>
          No inferior hand hath sketched even so much as the least minute parts
          of providence. It was all, from its Alpha to its Omega, from its
          divine preface to its solemn finis, marked out, designed, sketched,
          and planned by the mind of the all-wise, all-knowing God. Hence, not
          even Christ's death was exempt from it. He that wings an angel and
          guides a sparrow, he that protects the hairs of our head from falling
          prematurely to the ground, was not likely, when he took notice of such
          little things, to omit in his solemn decrees the greatest wonder of
          earth's miracles, the death of Christ. No; the blood-stained page of
          that book, the page which makes both past and future glorious with
          golden words, -- that blood-stained page, I say, was as much written
          of Jehovah, as any other. He determined that Christ should be born of
          the Virgin Mary, that he should suffer under Pontius Pilate, that he
          should descend into Hades, that thence he should rise again, leading
          captivity captive, and then should reign for ever at the right hand of
          the Majesty on high. Nay, I know not but that I shall have Scripture
          for my warrant when I say, that this is the very core of
          predestination, and that the death of Christ is the very center and
          main-spring by which God did fashion all his other decrees, making
          this the bottom and foundation-stone upon which the sacred
          architecture should be builded. Christ was put to death by the
          absolute foreknowledge and solemn decree of God the Father, and in
          this sense "it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to
          grief."
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But a little further, Christ's coming into the world to die was the
          effect of the Father's will and pleasure. Christ came not into this
          world unsent. He had laid in Jehovah's bosom from before all worlds,
          eternally delighting himself in his Father, and being himself his
          Father's eternal joy. "In the fullness of time" God did rend his Son
          from his bosom, his only-begotten Son, and freely delivered him up for
          us all. Herein was matchless, peerless love, that the offended judge
          should permit his co-equal Son to suffer the pains of death for the
          redemption of a rebellious people. I want your imaginations for one
          minute to picture a scene of olden times. There is a bearded
          patriarch, who rises early in the morning and awakes his son, a young
          man full of strength, and bids him arise and follow him. They hurry
          from the house silently and noiselessly, before the mother is awake.
          They go three days, journey with their men; until they come to the
          Mount, of which the Lord hath spoken. You know the patriarch. The name
          of Abraham is always fresh in our memories. On the way, that patriarch
          speaks not one solitary word to his son. His heart is too full for
          utterance. He is overwhelmed with grief. God has commanded him to take
          his son, his only son, and slay him upon the mountain as a sacrifice.
          They go together; and who shall paint the unutterable anguish of the
          father's soul, whilst he walks side by side with that beloved son, of
          whom he is to be the executioner? The third day has arrived; the
          servants are bidden to stay at the foot of the hill, whilst they go to
          worship God yonder. Now, can any mind imagine how the father's grief
          must overflow all the banks of his soul, when, as he walked up that
          hill-side, his son said to him, "Father, behold the fire and the wood;
          but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" Can you conceive how he
          stifled his emotions, and, with sobs, exclaimed, "My son, God will
          provide himself a lamb." See! the father has communicated to his son
          the fact that God has demanded his life. Isaac, who might have
          struggled and escaped from his father, declares that he is willing to
          die, if God hath decreed it. The father takes his son, binds his hands
          behind his back, piles up the stones, makes an altar, lays the wood,
          and has his fire ready. And now where is the artist that can depict
          the anguish of the fathers countenance, when the knife is unsheathed,
          and he holds it up, ready to slay his son? But here the curtain falls.
          Now the black scene vanishes at the sound of a voice from heaven. The
          ram caught in the thicket supplies the substitute, and faith's
          obedience need go no further. Ah! my brethren, I want to take you from
          this scene to a far greater one. What faith and obedience made man do,
          that love constrained God himself to do. He had but one son, that son
          his own heart's delight: he covenanted to yield him up for our
          redemption, nor did he violate his promise; for, when the fullness of
          time was come, he sent his Son to be born of the Virgin Mary, that he
          might suffer for the sins of man. O! can ye tell the greatness of that
          love, which made the everlasting God not only put his Son upon the
          altar, but actually do the deed, and thrust the sacrificial knife into
          his Son's heart? Can you think how overwhelming must have been the
          love of God toward the human race, when he completed in act what
          Abraham only did in intention? Look ye there, and see the place where
          his only Son hung dead upon the cross, the bleeding victim of awakened
          justice! Here is love indeed; and here we see how it was, that it
          pleased the Father to bruise him.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. This allows me to push my text just one point further. Beloved, it
          is not only true that God did design and did permit with willingness
          the death of Christ; it is moreover, true that the unutterable agonies
          that clothed the death of the Saviour with superhuman terror, were the
          effect of the Father's bruising of Christ in very act and deed. There
          is a martyr in prison: the chains are on his wrists, and yet he sings.
          It has been announced to him that to-morrow is his burning day. He
          claps his hands right merrily, and smiles while he says, "It will be
          sharp work to-morrow, I shall breakfast below on fiery tribulations,
          but afterward I will sup with Christ. Tomorrow is my wedding-day, the
          day for which I have long panted, when I shall sign the testimony of
          my life by a glorious deaths." The time is come; the men with the
          halberts precede him through the streets. Mark the serenity of the
          martyrs countenance. He turns to some who look upon him, and exclaims,
          "I value these iron chains far more than if they had been of gold; it
          is a sweet thing to die for Christ. There are a few of the boldest of
          the saints gathered round the stake, and as he unrobes himself, ere he
          stands upon the fagots to receive his doom, he tells them that it is a
          joyous thing to be a soldier of Christ, to be allowed to give his body
          to be burned; and he shakes hands with them, and bids them "Good by"
          with merry cheer. One would think he were going to a bridal, rather
          than to be burned. He steps upon the fagots; the chain is put about
          his middle; and after a brief word of prayer, as soon as the fire
          begins to ascend, he speaks to the people with manful boldness. But
          hark! he sings whilst the fagots are crackling and the smoke is
          blowing upward. He sings, and when his nether parts are burned, he
          still goes on chanting sweetly some psalm of old. "God is our refuge
          and strength, a very present help in trouble; therefore will we not
          fear, though the earth be removed and the mountains be carried into
          the midst of the sea."
        </p>
        <p>
          Picture another scene. There is the Saviour going to his cross, all
          weak and wan with suffering; his soul is sick and sad within him.
          There is no divine composure there. So sad is his heart, that he
          faints in the streets. The Son of God faints beneath a cross that many
          a criminal might have carried. They nail him to the tree. There is no
          song of praise. He is lifted up in the air, and there he hangs
          preparatory to his death. You hear no shout of exultation. There is a
          stern compression of his face, as if unutterable agony were tearing
          his heart -- as if over again Gethsemane were being acted on the cross
          -- as if his soul were still saying, "If it be possible let this cross
          pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt." Hark! he
          speaks. Will he not sing sweeter songs than ever came from martyr's
          lips? Ah! no; it is an awful wail of woe that can never be imitated.
          "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" The martyrs said not
          that: God was with them. Confessors of old cried not so, when they
          came to die. They shouted in their fires, and praised God on their
          racks. Why this? Why doth the Saviour suffer so? Why, beloved, it was
          because the Father bruised him. That sunshine of God's countenance
          that has cheered many a dying saint, was withdrawn from Christ; the
          consciousness of acceptance with God, which has made many a holy man
          espouse the cross with joy, was not afforded to our Redeemer, and
          therefore he suffered in thick darkness of mental agony. Read the 22nd
          Psalm, and learn how Jesus suffered. Pause over the solemn words in
          the 1st, 2nd, 6th, and following verses. Underneath the church are the
          ever lasting arms; but underneath Christ there were no arms at all,
          but his Father's hand pressed heavily against him; the upper and the
          nether mill-stones of divine wrath pressed and bruised him; and not
          one drop of joy or consolation was afforded to him. "It pleased
          Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief." This, my brethren,
          was the climax of the Saviour's woe, that his Father turned away from
          him, and put him to grief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus have I expounded the first part of the subject -- the origin of
          our Saviour's worst sufferings, the Father's pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Our second head must explain the first, or otherwise it is an
          insolvable mystery how God should bruise his Son, who was perfect
          innocence, while poor fallible confessors and martyrs have had no such
          bruising from him in the time of their trial. WHAT WAS THE REASON OF
          THE SAVIOUR'S SUFFERING? We are told here, "Thou shalt make his soul
          an offering for sin." Christ was thus troubled, because his soul was
          an offering for sin. Now, I am going to be as plain as I can, while I
          preach over again the precious doctrine of the atonement of Christ
          Jesus our Lord. Christ was an offering for sin, in the sense of a
          substitute. God longed to save; but, if such a word may be allowed,
          Justice tied his hands. "I must be just," said God; "that is a
          necessity of my nature. Stern as fate, and fast as immutability, is
          the truth that I must be just. But then my heart desires to forgive --
          to pass by man's transgressions and pardon them. How can it be done?
          Wisdom stepped in, and said, "It shall be done thus;" and Love agreed
          with Wisdom. "Christ Jesus, the Son of God, shall stand in man's
          place, and he shall be offered upon Mount Calvary instead of man. Now,
          mark: when you see Christ going up the Mount of Doom, you see man
          going there: when you see Christ hurled upon his back, upon the wooden
          cross, you see the whole company of his elect there; and when you see
          the nails driven through his blessed hands and feet, it is the whole
          body of his Church who there, in their substitute, are nailed to the
          tree. And now the soldiers lift the cross, and dash it into the socket
          prepared for it. His bones are every one of them dislocated, and his
          body is thus torn with agonies which can not be described. Tis manhood
          suffering there; tis the Church suffering there, in the substitute.
          And when Christ dies, you are to look upon the death of Christ, not as
          his own dying merely, but as the dying of all those for whom he stood
          as the scape-goat and the substitute. It is true, Christ died really
          himself; it is equally true that he did not die for himself, but died
          as the substitute, in the room, place, and stead of all believers.
          When you die you will die for yourselves; when Christ died, he died
          for you, if you be a believer in him. When you pass through the gates
          of the grave, you go there solitary and alone; you are not the
          representative of a body of men, but you pass through the gates of
          death as an individual; but, remember, when Christ went through the
          sufferings of death, he was the representative Head of all his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understand, then, the sense in which Christ was made a sacrifice for
          sin. But here lies the glory of this matter. It was as a substitute
          for sin that he did actually and literally suffer punishment for the
          sin of all his elect. When I say this, I am not to be understood as
          using any figure whatever, but as saying actually what I mean. Man for
          his sin was condemned to eternal fire; when God took Christ to be the
          substitute, it is true, he did not send Christ into eternal fire, but
          he poured upon him grief so desperate, that it was a valid payment for
          even an eternity of fire. Man was condemned to live forever in hell.
          God did not send Christ forever into hell; but he put on Christ,
          punishment that was equivalent for that. Although he did not give
          Christ to drink the actual hells of believers, yet he gave him a quid
          pro quo -- something that was equivalent thereunto. He took the cup of
          Christ's agony, and he put in there, suffering, misery, and anguish
          such as only God can imagine or dream of, that was the exact
          equivalent for all the suffering, all the woe, and all the eternal
          tortures of every one that shall at last stand in heaven, bought with
          the blood of Christ. And you say, "Did Christ drink it all to its
          dregs?" Did he suffer it all? Yes, my brethren, he took the cup, and
        </p>
        <p>"At one triumphant draught of love,</p>
        <p>He drank damnation dry."</p>
        <p>
          He suffered all the horror of hell: in one pelting shower of iron
          wrath it fell upon him, with hail-stones bigger than a talent; and he
          stood until the black cloud had emptied itself completely. There was
          our debt; huge and immense; he paid the utmost farthing of whatever
          his people owed; and now there is not so much as a doit or a farthing
          due to the justice of God in the way of punishment from any believer;
          and though we owe God gratitude, though we owe much to his love, we
          owe nothing to his justice; for Christ in that hour took all our sins,
          past, present, and to come, and was punished for them all there and
          then, that we might never be punished, because he suffered in our
          stead. Do you see, then, how it was that God the Father bruised him?
          Unless he had so done the agonies of Christ could not have been an
          equivalent for our sufferings; for hell consists in the hiding of
          God's face from sinners, and if God had not hidden his face from
          Christ, Christ could not -- I see not how he could -- have endured any
          suffering that could have been accepted as an equivalent for the woes
          and agonies of his people.

        <p>
          Methinks I heard some one say, "Do you mean us to understand this
          atonement that you have now preached as being a literal fact?" I say,
          most solemnly, I do. There are in the world many theories of
          atonement; but I can not see any atonement in any one, except in this
          doctrine of substitution. Many divines say that Christ did something
          when he died that enabled God to be just, and yet the Justifier of the
          ungodly. What that something is they do not tell us. They believe in
          an atonement made for every body; but then, their atonement is just
          this. They believe that Judas was atoned for just as much as Peter;
          they believe that the damned in hell were as much an object of Jesus
          Christ's satisfaction as the saved in heaven; and though they do not
          say it in proper words, yet they must mean it, for it is a fair
          inference, that in the case of multitudes, Christ died in vain, for he
          died for them all, they say; and yet so ineffectual was his dying for
          them, that though he died for them they are damned afterward. Now,
          such an atonement I despise -- I reject it. I may be called Antinomian
          or Calvinist for preaching a limited atonement; but I had rather
          believe a limited atonement that is efficacious for all men for whom
          it was intended, than an universal atonement that is not efficacious
          for anybody, except the will of man be joined with it. Why, my
          brethren, if we were only so far atoned for by the death of Christ
          that any one of us might afterward save himself, Christ's atonement
          were not worth a farthing, for there is no man of us can save himself
          -- no, not under the gospel; for if I am to be saved by faith, if that
          faith is to be my own act, unassisted by the Holy Spirit, I am as
          unable to save myself by faith as to save myself by good works. And
          after all, though men call this a limited atonement, it is as
          effectual as their own fallacious and rotten redemptions can pretend
          to be. But do you know the limit of it? Christ hath bought a
          "multitude that no man can number." The limit of it is just this: He
          hath died for sinners; whoever in this congregation inwardly and
          sorrowfully knows himself to be a sinner, Christ died for him; whoever
          seeks Christ, shall know Christ died for him; for our sense of need of
          Christ, and our seeking after Christ, are infallible proofs that
          Christ died for us. And, mark, here is something substantial. The
          Arminian says Christ died for him; and then, poor man, he has but
          small consolation therefrom, for he says, "Ah! Christ died for me;
          that does not prove much. It only proves I may be saved if I mind what
          I am after. I may perhaps forget myself; I may run into sin and I may
          perish. Christ has done a good deal for me, but not quite enough,
          unless I do something." But the man who receives the Bible as it is,
          he says, "Christ died for me, then my eternal life is sure. I know,"
          says he, "that Christ can not be punished in a man's stead, and the
          man be punished afterwards. No," says he, "I believe in a just God,
          and if God be just, he will not punish Christ first, and then punish
          men afterwards. No; my Saviour died, and now I am free from every
          demand of God's vengeance, and I can walk through this world secure;
          no thunderbolt can smite me, and I can die absolutely certain that for
          me there is no flame of hell, and no pit digged; for Christ, my
          ransom, suffered in my stead, and, therefore, am I clean delivered.
          Oh! glorious doctrine! I would wish to die preaching it! What better
          testimony can we bear to the love and faithfulness of God than the
          testimony of a substitution eminently satisfactory for all them that
          believe on Christ? I will here quote the testimony of that
          pre-eminently profound divine, Dr. John Owen: -- "Redemption is the
          freeing of a man from misery by the intervention of a ransom. Now,
          when a ransom is paid for the liberty of a prisoner, does not justice
          demand that he should have and enjoy the liberty so purchased for him
          by a valuable consideration? If I should pay a thousand pounds for a
          man's deliverance from bondage to him that retains him, who hath power
          to set him free, and is contented with the price I give, were it not
          injurious to me and the poor prisoner that his deliverance be not
          accomplished? Can it possibly be conceived that there should be a
          redemption of men, and those men not redeemed? That a price should be
          paid and the ransom not consummated? Yet all this must be made true,
          and innumerable other absurdities, if universal redemption be
          asserted. A price is paid for all, yet few delivered; the redemption
          of all consummated, yet, few of them redeemed; the judge satisfied,
          the jailer conquered, and yet the prisoners inthralled! Doubtless
          'universal,' and 'redemption,' where the greatest part of men perish,
          are as irreconcilable as 'Roman, and 'Catholic.' If there be a
          universal redemption of all, then all men are redeemed. If they are
          redeemed, then are they delivered from all misery, virtually or
          actually, whereunto they were inthralled, and that by the intervention
          of a ransom. Why, then, are not all saved? In a word, the redemption
          wrought by Christ being the full deliverance of the persons redeemed
          from all misery, wherein they were inwrapped, by the price of his
          blood, it can not possibly be conceived to be universal unless all be
          saved: so that the opinion of the Universalists is unsuitable to
          redemption."
        </p>
        <p>
          I pause once more; for I hear some timid soul say -- "But, sir, I am
          afraid I am not elect, and if so, Christ did not die for me." Stop
          sir! Are you a sinner? Do you feel it? Has God, the Holy Spirit, made
          you feel that you are a lost sinner? Do you want salvation? If you do
          not want it it is no hardship that it is not provided for you; but if
          you really feel that you want it, you are God's elect. If you have a
          desire to be saved, a desire given you by the Holy Spirit, that desire
          is a token for good. If you have begun believingly to pray for
          salvation, you have therein a sure evidence that you are saved. Christ
          was punished for you. And if now you can say,
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to the cross I cling."</p>
        <p>
          you may be as sure you are God's elect as you are sure of your own
          existence; for this is the infallible proof of election -- a sense of
          need and a thirst after Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I have just to conclude by noticing the BLESSED EFFECTS
          of the Saviour's death. On this I shall be very brief.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first effect of the Saviour's death is, "He shall see his seed."
          Men shall be saved by Christ. Men have offspring by life; Christ had
          an offspring by death. Men die and leave their children, and they see
          not their seed; Christ lives, and every day sees his seed brought into
          the unity of the faith. One effect of Christ's death is the salvation
          of multitudes. Mark, not a chance salvation. When Christ died the
          angel did not say, as some have represented him, "Now by his death
          many may be saved;" the word of prophecy had quenched all "buts" and
          "peradventures;" "By his righteousness he shall justify many. There
          was not so much as an atom of chance work in the Saviour's death.
          Christ knew what he bought when he died; and what he bought he will
          have -- that, and no more, and no less. There is no effect of Christ's
          death that is left to peradventure. "Shalls" and "wills" made the
          covenant fast: Christ's bloody death shall effect its solemn purpose.
          Every heir of grace shall meet around the throne,
        </p>
        <p>"Shall bless the wonders of his grace,</p>
        <p>And make his glories known."</p>
        <p>
          The second effect of Christ's death is, "He shall prolong his days."
          Yes, bless his name, when he died he did not end his life. He could
          not long be held a prisoner in the tomb. The third morning came, and
          the conqueror, rising from his sleep burst the iron bonds of death,
          and came forth from his prison house, no more to die. He waited his
          forty days, and then, with shouts of sacred song, he "led captivity
          captive, and ascended up on high." "In that he died he died unto sin
          once; but in that he liveth he liveth unto God," no more to die.
        </p>
        <p>"Now by his Father's side he Sits,</p>
        <p>And there triumphant reigns,"</p>
        <p>the conqueror over death and hell.</p>
        <p>
          And, last of all, by Christ's death the Father's good pleasure was
          effected and prospered. God's good pleasure is, that that this world
          shall one day be totally redeemed from sin; God's good pleasure is,
          that this poor planet, so long swathed in darkness, shall soon shine
          out in brightness, like a new-born sun. Christ's death hath done it.
          The stream that flowed from his side on Calvary shall cleanse the
          world from all its blackness. That hour of mid-day darkness was the
          rising of a new sun of righteousness, which shall never cease to shine
          upon the earth. Yes, the hour is coming when swords and spears shall
          be forgotten things -- when the harness of war and the pageantry of
          pomp shall all be laid aside for the food of the worm or the
          contemplation of the curious. The hour approacheth when old Rome shall
          shake upon her seven hills, when Mohammed's crescent shall wane to wax
          no more, when all the gods of the heathens shall lose their thrones
          and be cast out to the moles and the bats; and then, when from the
          equator to the poles Christ shall be honored, the Lord paramount of
          earth, when from land to land, from the river even to the ends of the
          earth, one King shall reign, one shout shall be raised, "Hallelujah,
          hallelujah, the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth." Then, my brethren,
          shall it be seen what Christ's death has accomplished, for "the
          pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand."<br />
