          "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever." --
          Hebrews 13:8.
        </p>
        <p>
          IT IS WELL that there is one person who is the same. It is well that
          there is one stable rock amidst the changing billows of this sea of
          life; for how many and how grievous have been the changes of this
          year? How many of you who commenced in affluence, have by the panic,
          which has shaken nations, been reduced almost to poverty? How many of
          you, who in strong health marched into this place on the first Sabbath
          of last year, have had to come tottering here, feeling that the breath
          of man is in his nostrils, and wherein is he to be accounted of? Many
          of you came to this hall with a numerous family, leaning upon the arm
          of a choice and much loved friend. Alas! for love, if thou wert all
          and naught beside, O earth! For ye have buried those ye loved the
          best. Some of you have come here childless, or widows, or fatherless,
          still weeping your recent affliction. Changes have taken place in your
          estate that have made your heart full of misery. Your cups of
          sweetness have been dashed with draughts of gall; your golden harvests
          have had tares cast into the midst of them, and you have had to reap
          the noxious weed along with the precious grain. Your much fine gold
          has become dim, and your glory has departed; the sweet frames at the
          commencement of last year became bitter ones at the end. Your raptures
          and your ecstacies were turned into depression and forebodings. Alas!
          for our changes, and hallelujah to him that hath no change.
        </p>
        <p>
          But greater things have changed than we; for kingdoms have trembled in
          the balances. We have seen a peninsula deluged with blood, and mutiny
          raising its bloody war whoop. Nay, the whole world hath changed; earth
          hath doffed its green, and put on its somber garment of Autumn, and
          soon expects to wear its ermine robe of snow. All things have changed.
          We believe that not only in appearance but in reality, the world is
          growing old. The sun itself must soon grow dim with age; the folding
          up of the worn-out vesture has commenced; the changing of the heavens
          and the earth has certainly begun. They shall perish; they all shall
          wax old as doth a garment; but for ever blessed be him who is the
          same, and of whose years there is no end. The satisfaction that the
          mariner feels, when, after having been tossed about for many a day, he
          puts his foot upon the solid shore, is just the satisfaction of a
          Christian when, amidst all the changes of this troublous life, he
          plants the foot of his faith upon such a text as this -- "the same
          yesterday, and to-day, and for ever." The same stability that the
          anchor gives the ship, when it hath at last got the grip of some
          immovable rock, that same stability doth our hope give to our spirits,
          when, like an anchor, it fixes itself in a truth so glorious as this
          -- "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall first try this morning to open the text by a little
          explanation; then I shall try to answer a few objections, which our
          wicked unbelief will be quite sure to raise against it; and afterward
          I shall try to draw a few useful, consoling, and practical lessons
          from the great truth of the immutability of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we open the text by a little EXPLANATION -- "Jesus
          Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever." He is the same
          in his person. We change perpetually; the bloom of youth gives place
          to the strength of manhood, and the maturity of manhood fades away
          into the weakness of old age. But "Thou hast the dew of thy youth."
          Christ Jesus, whom we adore, thou art as young as ever! We came into
          this world with the ignorance of infancy; we grow up searching,
          studying, and learning with the diligence of youth; we attain to some
          little knowledge in our riper years; and then in our old age we totter
          back to the imbecility of our childhood. But O, our Master! thou didst
          perfectly foreknow all mortal or eternal things from before the
          foundations of the world, and thou knowest all things now, and for
          ever thou shalt be the same in thine omniscience. We are one day
          strong, and the next day weak -- one day resolved, and the next day
          wavering -- one hour constant, and the next hour unstable as water. We
          are one moment holy, kept by the power of God; we are the next moment
          sinning, led astray by our own lusts; but our Master is for ever the
          same; pure and never spotted; firm, and never changing --
          everlastingly Omnipotent, unchangeably Omniscient. From him no
          attribute doth pass away; to him no parallax, no tropic, ever comes;
          without variableness or shadow of a turning, he abideth fast and firm.
          Did Solomon sing concerning his best beloved, "His head is as the most
          fine gold: his locks are bushy and black as a raven. His eyes are as
          the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly
          set. His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
          like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. His hands are as gold
          rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with
          sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine
          gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedar ?" Surely
          we can even now conclude the description from our own experience of
          him; and while we endorse every word which went before, we can end the
          description by saying, "His mouth is most sweet, yea he is altogether
          lovely. His matchless beauty is unimpaired; he is still the chief
          among ten thousand' -- fairest of the sons of men." Did the divine
          John talk of him when he said -- "His head and his hairs were white
          like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and
          his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his
          voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven
          stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his
          countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." He is the same;
          upon his brow there is ne'er a furrow; his locks are gray with
          reverence, but not with age; his feet stand as firm as when they trod
          the everlasting mountains in the years before the world was made --
          his eyes as piercing when, for the first time he looked upon a
          new-born world. Christ's person never changes. Should he come on earth
          to visit us again, as sure he will, we should find him the same Jesus;
          as loving, as approachable, as generous, as kind, and though arrayed
          in nobler garments than he wore when first he visited earth, though no
          more the Man of Sorrows and griefs acquaintance, yet he would be the
          same person, unchanged by all his glories, his triumphs, and his joys.
          We bless Christ that amid his heavenly splendors his person is just
          the same, and his nature unaffected.. "Jesus Christ the same
          yesterday, to-day, and for ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: Jesus Christ is the same with regard to his Father as ever. He
          was his Father's well-beloved Son before all worlds; he was his
          well-beloved in the stream of baptism; he was his well-beloved on the
          cross; he was his well-beloved when he led captivity captive, and he
          is not less the object of his Father's infinite affection now than he
          was then. Yesterday he lay in Jehovah's bosom, God, having all power
          with his Father -- to-day he stands on earth, man, with us, but still
          the same, for ever -- he ascends on high, and still he is his Father's
          son -- still by inheritance, having a more excellent name than angels
          -- still sitting far above all principalities and powers, and every
          name that is named. O Christian, give him thy cause to plead; the
          Father will answer him as well now as he did aforetime. Doubt not the
          Father's grace. Go to thine Advocate. He is as near to Jehovah's heart
          as ever -- as prevalent in his intercession. Trust him, then, and in
          trusting him thou mayest be sure of the Father's love to thee.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now there is a yet sweeter thought. Jesus Christ is the same to
          his people as ever. We have delighted, in our happier moments, in days
          that have rolled away, to think of him that loved us when we had no
          being; we have often sung with rapture of him that loved us when we
          loved not him.
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus sought me when a stranger,</p>
        <p>Wandering from the fold of God;</p>
        <p>He to save my soul from danger</p>
        <p>Interposed his precious blood."</p>
        <p>
          We have looked back, too, upon the years of our troubles and our
          trials; and we can bear our solemn though humble witness that he has
          been true to us in all our exigencies, and has never failed us once.
          Come, then, let us comfort ourselves with this thought -- that though
          to-day he may distress us with a sense of sin, yet his heart is just
          the same to us as ever. Christ may wear masks that look black to his
          people, but his face is always the same; Christ may sometimes take a
          rod in his hand instead of a golden scepter, but the name of his saint
          is as much engraved upon the hand that grasps the rod as upon the palm
          that clasps the scepter. And oh, sweet thought that now bursts upon
          our mind! Beloved, can you concede how much Christ will love you when
          you are in heaven? Have you ever tried to fathom that bottomless sea
          of affection in which you shall swim, when you shall bathe yourself in
          seas of heavenly rest? Did you ever think of the love which Christ
          will manifest to you, when he shall present you without spot, or
          blemish, or any such thing before his Father's throne? Well, pause and
          remember that he loves you at this hour a. much as he will love you
          then; for he will be the same for ever as he is to-day, and he is the
          same to-day as he will be for ever. This one thing I know: if Jesus'
          heart is set on me he will not love me one atom better when this head
          wears a crown, and when this hand shall, with joyous fingers, touch
          the strings of golden harps, than he does now, amid all my sin and
          care and woe. I believe that saying which is written -- "As the Father
          hath loved me, even so have I loved you;" and a higher degree of love
          we can not imagine. The Father loves his Son infinitely, and even so
          to-day, believer, doth the Son of God love thee. All his heart flows
          out to thee. All his life is thine; all his person is thine. He can
          not love thee more; he will not love thee less. The same yesterday,
          to-day, and for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let us here recollect that Jesus Christ is the same to sinners
          to-day as he was yesterday. It is now eight years ago since I first
          went to Jesus Christ. Come the sixth of this month, I shall then be
          eight years old in the gospel of the grace of Jesus; a child, a little
          child therein as yet. I recall that hour when I heard that exhortation
          -- "Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am
          God, and beside me there is none else." And I remember, how with much
          trembling and with a little faith I ventured to approach the Saviour's
          feet. I thought he would spurn me from him. "Sure," said my heart, "if
          thou shouldst presume to put thy trust in him as thy Saviour, it would
          be a presumption more damnable than all thy sins put together. Go not
          to him; he will spurn thee." However, I put the rope about my neck,
          feeling that if God destroyed me for ever, he would be just. I cast
          the ashes on my head, and with many a sigh I did confess my sin; and
          then, when I ventured to draw nigh to him, when I expected that he
          would frown, he stretched out his hand and said, "I, even I, am he
          that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not
          remember thy sins." I came like the prodigal, because I was forced to
          come. I was starved out of that foreign country where, in riotous
          living I had spent my substance, and I saw my Father's house a great
          way off; little did I know that my Father's heart was beating high
          with love to me. O rapturous hour, when Jesus whispered I was his, and
          when my soul could say, "Jesus Christ is my salvation." And now I
          would refresh my own memory by reminding myself that what my Master
          was to me yesterday that he is to-day; and if I know that as a sinner
          I went to him then and he received me, if I have never so many doubts
          about my saintship I can not doubt but what I am a sinner; so to thy
          cross, O Jesus, I go again, and if thou didst receive me then, thou
          wilt receive me now; and believing that to be true, I turn round to my
          fellow-immortals, and I say, "He that received me, he that received
          Manasseh, he that received the thief upon the cross, is the same
          to-day as he was then. Oh! come and try him! Come and try him! Oh! ye
          that know your need of him, come ye to him; ye that have sold for
          nought your heritage above may have it back unbought, the gift of
          Jesus' love. Ye that are empty, Christ is as full today as ever. Come!
          fill yourselves here. Ye that are thirsty, the stream is flowing; ye
          that are black, the fountain still can purify; ye that are naked, the
          wardrobe is not empty.
        </p>
        <p>"Come, guilty souls, and flee away,</p>
        <p>To Christ, and heal your wounds;</p>
        <p>Still tis the gospel's gracious day,</p>
        <p>And now free grace abounds"</p>
        <p>
          I can not pretend to enter into the fullness of my text as I could
          desire, but one more thought. Jesus Christ is the same to-day as he
          was yesterday in the teachings of his Word. They tell us in these
          times that the improvements of the age require improvements in
          theology. Why, I have heard it said that the way Luther preached would
          not suit this age. We are too polite! The style of preaching, they
          say, that did in John Bunyan's day, is not the style now. True, they
          honor these men; they are like the Pharisees; they build the
          sepulchers of the prophets that their fathers slew, and so they do
          confess that they are their father's own sons, and like their parents.
          And men that stand up to preach as those men did, with honest tongues,
          and know not how to use polished courtly phrases, are as much
          condemned now as those men were in their time; because, say they, the
          world is marching on, and the gospel must march on too. No, sirs, the
          old gospel is the same; not one of her stakes must be removed, not one
          of her cords must be loosened. "Hold fast the form of sound words,
          which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ
          Jesus." Theology hath nothing new in it except that which is false.
          The preaching of Paul must be the preaching of the minister to-day.
          There is no advancement here. We may advance in our knowledge of it;
          but it stands the same, for this good reason, that it is perfect, and
          perfection can not be any better. The old truth that Calvin preached,
          that Chrysostom preached, that Paul preached, is the truth that I must
          preach to-day, or else be a liar to my conscience and my God. I can
          not shape the truth. I know of no such thing as the paring off the
          rough edges of a doctrine. John Knox's gospel is my gospel. That which
          thundered through Scotland must thunder through England again. The
          great mass of our ministers are sound enough in the faith, but not
          sound enough in the way they preach it. Election is not mentioned once
          in the year in many a pulpit; final perseverance is kept back; the
          great things of God's law are forgotten, and a kind of mongrel mixture
          of Arminianism and Calvinism is the delight of the present age. And
          hence the Lord hath forsaken many of his tabernacles and left the
          house of his covenant; and he will leave it till again the trumpet
          gives a certain sound. For wherever there is not the old gospel we
          shall find "Ichabod" written upon the church walls ere long. The old
          truth of the Covenanters, the old truth of the Puritans, the old truth
          of the Apostles, is the only truth that will stand the test of time,
          and never need to be altered to suit a wicked and ungodly generation.
          Christ Jesus preaches to-day the same as when he preached upon the
          mount; he hath not changed his doctrines; men may ridicule and laugh,
          but still they stand the same -- semper idem written upon every one of
          them. They shall not be removed or altered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the Christian remember that this is equally true of the promises.
          Let the sinner remember this is just as true of the threatenings. Let
          us each recollect that not one word can be added to this Sacred Book,
          nor one letter taken away from it; for as Christ Jesus is yet the
          same, so is his Gospel, the same yesterday, to-day and for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus briefly opened the text, not in its fullest meanings, but
          still enough to enable the Christian at his own leisure to see into
          that depth without a bottom -- the immutability of Christ Jesus the
          Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. And now comes in one of crooked gait, with hideous aspect -- one
          that hath as many lives as a cat, and that can not be killed any how,
          though many a great gun hath been shot against him. His name is old
          Mr. Incredulity -- unbelief; and he begins his miserable oration by
          declaring, "How can that be true? Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and
          to-day, and for ever.' Why, yesterday Christ was all sunshine to me --
          to-day I am in distress!" Stop, Mr. Unbelief, I beg you to remember
          that Christ is not changed. You have changed yourself; for you have
          said in your very accusation that yesterday you rejoiced, but to-day
          you are in distress. All that may happen, and yet there may be no
          change in Christ. The sun may be the same always, though one hour may
          be cloudy and the next bright with golden light; yet there is no proof
          that the sun has changed. Tis even so with Christ.
        </p>
        <p>"If today he deigns to bless us</p>
        <p>With a sense of pardoned sin,</p>
        <p>He to-morrow may distress us,</p>
        <p>Make us feel the plague within.</p>
        <p>All to make us,</p>
        <p>Sick of self and fond of him."</p>
        <p>There is no change in him.</p>
        <p>"Immutable his will,</p>
        <p>Though dark may be my frame,</p>
        <p>His loving heart is still</p>
        <p>Unchangeably the same.</p>
        <p>My soul through many changes goes,</p>
        <p>His love no variation knows"</p>
        <p>
          Your frames are no proof that Christ changes: they are only proof that
          you change.
        </p>
        <p>
          But saith old Unbelief again -- "Surely God has changed if you look at
          the old saints of ancient times. What happy men they were! How highly
          favored of their God! How well God provided for them! But now, sir,
          when I am hungry, no ravens come and bring me bread and meat in the
          morning, and bread and meat in the evening. When I am thirsty, no
          water leaps out of the rock to supply my thirst. It is said of the
          children of Israel that their clothes waxed not old; but I have a hole
          in my coat today, and where I shall get another garment I know not.
          When they marched through the desert he suffered no man to hurt them;
          but, sir, I am continually beset by enemies. It is true of me as it
          says in the Scriptures, And the Ammonites distressed Israel at the
          coming in of the year;' for they are distressing me. Why, sir, I see
          my friends die in clouds; there are no fiery chariots to carry God's
          Elijahs to heaven now. I lost my son; no prophet lay upon him and gave
          him life again; no Jesus met me at the city gates, to give me back my
          son from the gloomy grave. No sir, these are evil times; the light of
          Jesus Christ has become dim; if he walks among the golden
          candlesticks, yet, still it is not as he used to do. And worse than
          that, sir, I have heard my father talk of the great men that were in
          the age gone by: I have heard the names of Romaine, and Toplady, and
          Scott; I have heard of Whitfields and of Bunyans; and even but a few
          years ago I heard talk of such men as Joseph Irons -- solemn and
          earnest preachers of a full gospel. But where are those men now? Sir,
          we have fallen upon an age of drivellings; men have died out, and we
          have only a few dwarfs left us; there are none that walk with the
          giant tramp and the colossal tread of the mighty fathers, like Owen,
          and Howe, and Baxter, and Charnock. We are all little men. Jesus
          Christ is not dealing with us as he did with our fathers. Stop,
          Unbelief, a minute: let me remind thee that the ancient people of God
          had their trials too. Know ye not what the apostle Paul says? "For thy
          sake we are killed all the day long." Now, if there be any change it
          is a change for the better; for you have not yet "resisted unto blood,
          striving against sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          But remember that does not affect Christ; for neither nakedness, nor
          famine, nor sword, has separated us from the love of God, which is in
          Christ Jesus our Lord. It is true that you have no fiery chariot; but
          then the angels carry you to Jesus' bosom, and that is as well. It is
          true no ravens bring you food; it is quite as true you get your food
          somehow or other. It is quite certain that no rock gushes out with
          water; but still your water has been sure. It is true your child has
          not been raised from the dead; but you remember that David had a child
          that was not raised any more than yours. You have the same consolation
          that he had: "I shall go to him; he shall not return to me." You say
          that you have more heart-rendings than the saints had of old. It is
          your ignorance that makes you say so. Holy men of old said, "Why art
          thou cast down, O my soul? Why art thou disquieted within me?" Even
          prophets had to say -- "Thou hast made me drunken with wormwood, and
          broken my teeth with gravel stones." O, you are mistaken: your days
          are not more full of trouble than the days of Job; you are not more
          vexed by the wicked than was Lot of old, you have not more temptations
          to make you angry than had Moses; and certainly your way is not half
          so rough as the way of your blessed Lord. The very fact that you have
          troubles is a proof of his faith fulness; for you have got one half of
          his legacy, and you will have the other half. You know that Christ's
          last will and testament has two portions in it. "In the world ye shall
          have tribulation:" you have got that. The next clause is -- "In me ye
          shall have peace." You have that too. "Be of good cheer; I have
          overcome the world." That is yours also.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then you say that you have fallen upon a bad age with regard to
          ministers. It may be so; but remember, the promise is true still.
          "Though I take away from thee bread and water, yet will I never take
          away thy pastors." You have still such as you have -- still some that
          are faithful to God and to his covenant, and who do not forsake the
          truth, and though the day may be dark, yet it is not so dark as days
          have been; and besides remember, what you say to-day is just what your
          forefathers said. Men in the days of Toplady looked back to the days
          of Whitfield; men in the days of Whitfield looked back to the days of
          Bunyan; men in the days of Bunyan wept because of the days of
          Wycliffe, and Calvin, and Luther; and men then wept for the days of
          Augustine and Chrysostom. Men in those days wept for the days of the
          Apostles; and doubtless men in the days of the Apostles wept for the
          days of Jesus Christ; and no doubt some in the days of Jesus Christ
          were so blind as to wish to return to the days of prophesy, and
          thought more of the days of Elijah than they did of the most glorious
          day of Christ. Some men look more to the past than the present. Rest
          assured, that Jesus Christ is the same to-day as he was yesterday, and
          he will be the same for ever.

          Mourner, be glad! I have heard of a little girl who, when her father
          died, saw her mother weeping immoderately. Day after day, and week
          after week, her mother refused to be comforted; and the little girl
          stepped up to her mother, and putting her little hand inside her
          mothers hand, looked up in her face, and said. "Mamma is God dead? Is
          God dead, mamma?" And her mother thought, "Surely, no." The child
          seemed to say, "Thy maker is thy husband; the Lord of hosts is his
          name. So you may dry your tears, I have a father in heaven, and you
          have a husband still." O! ye saints that have lost your gold and your
          silver; ye have got treasure in heaven, where no moth nor rust doth
          corrupt, where no thieves break through and steal! Ye that are sick
          to-day, ye that have lost health, remember the day is coming when all
          that shall be made up to you, and when ye shall find that the flame
          has not hurt you, it has but consumed your dross and refined your
          gold. Remember, Jesus Christ is "the same today, yesterday, and for
          ever."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now I must be brief in drawing one or two sweet conclusions
          from that part of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, if he be the same to-day as yesterday, my soul, set not
          thine affections upon these changing things, but set thine heart upon
          him. O my heart, build not thine house upon the sandy pillars of a
          world that soon must pass away, but build thy hopes upon this rock,
          which, when the rain descends, and floods shall come, shall stand
          immovably secure. O my soul, I charge thee, lay up thy treasure in
          this secure granary. O my heart, I bid thee now put thy treasure where
          thou canst never lose it. Put it in Christ; put all thine affections
          in his person, all thy hope in his glory, all thy trust in his
          efficacious blood, all thy joy in his presence, and then thou wilt
          have put thyself and put thine all where thou canst never lose
          anything, because it is secure. Remember, O my heart, that the time is
          coming when all things must fade, and when thou must part with all.
          Death's gloomy night must soon put out thy sunshine; the dark flood
          must soon roll between thee and all thou hast. Then put thine heart
          with him who will never leave thee; trust thyself with him who will go
          with thee through the black and surging current of death's stream, and
          who will walk with thee up the steep hills of heaven and make thee sit
          together with him in heavenly places for ever. Go, tell thy secrets to
          that friend that sticketh closer than a brother. My heart, I charge
          thee, trust all thy concerns with him who never can be taken from
          thee, who will never leave thee, and who will never let thee leave
          him, even "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for
          ever." That is one lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, then, the next. If Jesus Christ be always the same, then, my
          soul, endeavor to imitate him. Be thou the same, too. Remember that if
          thou hadst more faith, thou wouldst be as happy in the furnace, as on
          the mountain of enjoyment. Thou wouldst be as glad in famine, as in
          plenty; thou wouldst rejoice in the Lord when the olive yielded no
          oil, as well as when the vat was bursting and overflowing its brim. If
          thou hadst more confidence in thy God, thou wouldst have far less of
          tossings up and down; and if thou hadst greater nearness to Christ
          thou wouldst have less vacillation. Yesterday thou couldst pray with
          all the power of prayer; perhaps if thou didst always live near thy
          Master, thou mightest always have the same power on thy knees. One
          time thou canst bid defiance to the rage of Satan, and thou canst face
          a frowning world; to-morrow thou wilt run away like a craven. But if
          thou didst always remember him who endured such contradiction of
          sinners against himself, thou mightest always be firm and stedfast in
          thy mind. Beware of being like a weathercock. Seek of God, that his
          law may be written on your hearts as if it were written on stone, and
          not as if it were written in sand. Seek, that his grace may come to
          you like a river, and not like a brook that fails. Seek, that you may
          keep your conversation always holy; that your course may be like the
          shining light that tarries not, but that burneth brighter and
          brighter, until the fullness of the day. Be ye like Christ -- ever the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again: if Christ be always the same, Christian, rejoice! Come what
          may, thou art secure.
        </p>
        <p>"Let mountains from their seats be hurled</p>
        <p>Down to the deeps, and buried there;</p>
        <p>Convulsions shake the solid world;</p>
        <p>Our faith shall never need to fear."</p>
        <p>
          If kingdoms should go to rack, the Christian need not tremble! Just
          for a minute imagine a scene like this. Suppose for the next three
          days the sun should not rise; suppose the moon should be turned into a
          clot of blood, and shine no more upon the world; imagine that a
          darkness that might be felt, brooded over all men; imagine, next, that
          all the world did tremble in an earthquake, till every tower, and
          house, and hut fell down: imagine, next, that the sea forgot its
          place, and leaped upon the earth; and that the mountains ceased to
          stand, and began to tremble from their pedestals; conceive after that,
          that a blazing comet streamed across the sky -- that the thunder
          bellowed incessantly -- that the lightnings, without a moment's pause,
          followed one the other; conceive, then, that thou didst behold divers
          terrible sights, fiendish ghosts, and grim spirits; imagine, next,
          that a trumpet, waxing exceeding loud, did blow; that there were heard
          the shrieks of men dying and perishing; imagine, that in the midst of
          all this confusion, there wee to be a found a saint. My friend, "Jesus
          Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for every, would keep him as
          secure amidst all these horrors, as we are to-day. Oh! rejoice! I have
          pictured the worst that can come. Then you would be secure. Come what
          may then, you are safe, while Jesus Christ is the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, last of all, if Jesus Christ be "the same yesterday, to-day,
          and for ever," what sad work this is for the ungodly! Ah! sinner, when
          he was on earth, he said, "Their worm dieth not, and their fire is not
          quenched." When he stood upon the mount, he said, "It were better to
          enter life halt or maimed, than having two hands, and two eyes to be
          cast into hell-fire." As a man on earth, he said that the goats should
          be on the left, and that he would say to them, "Depart, ye cursed."
          Sinner, he will be as good as his word. He has said, "He that
          believeth not shall be damned." He will damn you if you believe not,
          depend upon it. He has never broken a promise yet; he will never break
          a threatening. That same truth which makes us confident to-day that
          the righteous shall go away into everlasting life, should make you
          quite as confident that unbelievers shall go into eternal misery. If
          he had broken his promise, he might break his threatening; but as he
          has kept one, he will keep the other. Do not hope that he will change,
          for change he will not. Think not that the fire which he said was
          unquenchable, will, after all, be extinguished. No, within a few more
          years, my hearer, if thou dost not repent, thou wilt find that every
          jot and every letter of the threatenings of Jesus will be fulfilled;
          and, mark thee, fulfilled in thee. Liar, he said, "All liars shall
          have their portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone." He
          will not deceive you. Drunkard, he has said, "Ye know that no drunkard
          hath eternal life." He will not belie his word. You shall not have
          eternal life. He has said, "The nations that forget God shall be cast
          into hell." All ye that forget religion, moral people you may be, he
          will keep his word to you; he will cast you into hell. O "kiss the Son
          lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is
          kindled but a little; blessed are an they that put their trust in him.
          Come, sinner, bow thy knee; confess thy sin and leave it; and then
          come to him; ask him to have mercy upon thee. He will not forget his
          promise -- "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out." Come
          and try him. With all your sins about you, come to him now. "Believe
          on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved;" for this is my Master's
          gospel, and I now declare it -- "He that believeth and is immersed
          shall be saved; he that believeth not shall be damned. God grant you
          grace to believe, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br />
