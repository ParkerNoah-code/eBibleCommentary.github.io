<p align="justify">SUBJECT. <i>Charles Simeon </i>gives an excellent 
        summary of this Psalm in the following sentences: "The Psalms are a rich 
        repository of experimental knowledge. David, at the different periods of 
        his life, was placed in almost every situation in which a believer, 
        whether rich or poor, can be placed; in these heavenly compositions he 
        delineates all the workings of the heart. He introduces, too, the 
        sentiments and conduct of the various people who were accessory either 
        to his troubles or his joys; and thus sets before us <i>a compendium of 
        all that is passing in the hearts of men throughout the world</i>. When 
        he penned this Psalm he was under persecution from Saul, who sought his 
        life, and hunted him 'as a partridge upon the mountains.' His timid 
        friends were alarmed for his safety, and recommended him to flee to some 
        mountain where he had a hiding-place, and thus to conceal himself from 
        the rage of Saul. But David, being strong in faith, spurned the idea of 
        resorting to any such pusillanimous expedients, and determined 
        confidently to repose his trust in God."</p>
<p align="justify">To assist us to remember this short, but sweet Psalm, 
        we will give it the name of "THE SONG OF THE STEADFAST."</p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">From 1 to 3, David describes the temptation with 
        which he was assailed. </p>
<p align="justify">From 4 to 7, the arguments by which his courage was 
        sustained.</p>

<font color="#800000">
<p align="justify"></p>
</font><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. "In the Lord put I my trust. How say you to 
        my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?" </p></b>These verses contain an 
        account of a temptation to distrust God, with which David was, upon some 
        unmentioned occasion, greatly exercised. It may be, that in the days 
        when he was in Saul's court, he was advised to flee at a time when this 
        flight would have been charged against him as a breach of duty to the 
        king, or a proof of personal cowardice. His case was like that of 
        Nehemiah, when his enemies, under the garb of friendship, hoped to 
        entrap him by advising him to escape for his life. Had he done so, they 
        could then have found a ground of accusation. Nehemiah bravely replied, 
        "Shall such a man as I flee?" and David, in a like spirit, refuses to 
        retreat, exclaiming, "In the Lord put I my trust. How say you to my 
        soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?" 
<p align="justify">When Satan cannot overthrow us by <i>presumption</i>, 
        how craftily will he seek to ruin us by <i>distrust! </i>He will employ 
        our dearest friends to argue us out of our confidence, and he will use 
        such plausible logic, that unless we once for all assert our immovable 
        trust in Jehovah, he will make us like the timid bird which flies to the 
        mountain whenever danger presents itself.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b> <b>For look! The wicked bend their bow, 
        they make ready their arrow on the string, that they may shoot secretly 
        at the upright in heart.</b> How forcibly the case is put! The bow is 
        bent, the arrow is fitted to the string: "Flee, flee, you defenseless 
        bird, your safety lies in flight; begone, for your enemies will send 
        their shafts into your heart; hasten, haste, for soon will you be 
        destroyed!"
<p align="justify">David seems to have felt the force of the advice, for 
        it came home to his soul; but yet he would not yield, but would rather 
        dare the danger than exhibit a distrust in the Lord his God. Doubtless 
        the perils which encompassed David were great and imminent; it was quite 
        true that his enemies were ready to shoot privily at him.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. If the foundations are destroyed, what can 
        the righteous do? </p></b>It was equally correct that the very foundations 
        of law and justice were destroyed under Saul's unrighteous government: 
        but what were all these things to the man whose trust was in God alone? 
        He could brave the dangers, could escape the enemies, and defy the 
        injustice which surrounded him. 
<p align="justify">His answer to the question, "What can the righteous 
        do?" would be the counter-question, "What cannot they do?" When prayer 
        engages God on our side, and when faith secures the fulfillment of the 
        promise, what cause can there be for flight, however cruel and mighty 
        our enemies?</p>
<p align="justify">With a sling and a stone, David had smitten a giant 
        before whom the whole hosts of Israel were trembling, and the Lord, who 
        delivered him from the uncircumcised Philistine, could surely deliver 
        him from King Saul and his myrmidons.<i> There is no such word as 
        "impossibility" in the language of faith</i>; that martial grace knows 
        how to fight and conquer, but she knows not how to flee.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. </p></b>David here declares the great source of 
        his unflinching courage. He borrows his light from heaven—from the great 
        central orb of deity. The God of the believer is never far from him; he 
        is not merely the God of the mountain fastnesses, but of the dangerous 
        valleys and battle plains.
<b>
<p align="justify">"Jehovah is in his holy temple." </p></b>The heavens are 
        above our heads in all regions of the earth, and so is the Lord ever 
        near to us in every state and condition. This is a very strong reason 
        why we should not adopt the vile suggestions of distrust. There is one 
        who pleads his precious blood in our behalf in the temple above, and 
        there is one upon the throne who is never deaf to the intercession of 
        his Son. Why, then, should we fear? What plots can men devise which 
        Jesus will not discover?
<p align="justify">Satan has doubtless desired to have us, that he may 
        sift us as wheat, but Jesus is in the temple praying for us, and how can 
        our faith fail? What attempts can the wicked make which Jehovah shall 
        not behold? And since he is in his holy temple, delighting in the 
        sacrifice of his Son, will he not defeat every device, and send us a 
        sure deliverance?</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"Jehovah's throne is in the heavens." </p></b>He reigns 
        supreme! Nothing can be done in Heaven, or earth, or Hell, which he does 
        not ordain and over-rule. He is the world's great Emperor. Why, then, 
        should we flee? If we trust this King of kings, is not this enough? 
        Cannot he deliver us without our cowardly retreat? Yes, blessed be the 
        Lord our God, we can salute him as <i>Jehovah-nissi</i>—in his name we 
        set up our <i>banners</i>, and instead of flight, we once more raise the 
        shout of war.
<b>
<p align="justify">"His eyes behold."</p></b> The eternal Watcher never 
        slumbers; his eyes never know a sleep. 
<b>
<p align="justify">"His eyes examine the children of men."</p></b> He 
        narrowly inspects their actions, words, and thoughts. As men, when 
        intently and narrowly inspecting some very minute object, almost close 
        their eyelids to exclude every other object, so will the Lord look all 
        men through and through. God sees each man as much and as perfectly as 
        if there were no other creature in the universe! He sees us always—he 
        never removes his eye from us. He sees us entirely, reading the recesses 
        of the soul as readily as the glancings of the eye. Is not this a 
        sufficient ground of confidence, and an abundant answer to the 
        solicitations of despondency? My danger is not hid from him; he knows my 
        extremity, and I may rest assured that he will not allow me to perish 
        while I rely alone on him. Why, then, should I take wings of a timid 
        bird, and flee from the dangers which beset me?
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5. "The Lord tries the righteous."</p></b> He does 
        not hate them, but only tries them. They are precious to him, and 
        therefore he refines them with afflictions. None of the Lord's children 
        may hope to escape from trial, nor, indeed, in our right minds, would 
        any of us desire to do so, for trial is the channel of many blessings.
<p align="justify">"Tis my happiness below<br/>
        Not to live without the cross;<br/>
        But the Savior's power to know,<br/>
        Sanctifying every loss.</p>
<p align="justify">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p align="justify">Trials make the promise sweet;<br/>
        Trials give new life to prayer;<br/>
        Trials bring me to his feet,<br/>
        Lay me low, and keep me there.</p>
<p align="justify">Did I meet no trials here,<br/>
        No chastisement by the way;<br/>
        Might I not, with reason, fear<br/>
        I should prove a cast-away?</p>
<p align="justify">Bastards may escape the rod,<br/>
        Sunk in earthly vain delight;<br/>
        But the true-born child of God<br/>
        Must not—would not, if he might."<i><br/>
        William Cowper.</i></p>

<p align="justify">Is not this a very cogent reason why we should not 
        distrustfully endeavor to shun a trial?—for in so doing we are seeking 
        to avoid a blessing.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"But the wicked and him that loves violence his soul 
        hates!"</p></b> Why, then, shall I flee from these wicked men? If God hates 
        them, I will not fear them. Haman was very great in the palace until he 
        lost favor; but when the king abhorred him, how bold were the meanest 
        attendants to suggest the gallows for the man at whom they had often 
        trembled! Look at the black mark upon the faces of our persecutors, and 
        we shall not run away from them. If God is in the quarrel as well as 
        ourselves, it would be foolish to question the result, or avoid the 
        conflict.
<p align="justify">Sodom and Gomorrah perished by a fiery hail, and by a 
        brimstone shower from Heaven; so shall all the ungodly. They may gather 
        together like Gog and Magog to battle, but the Lord will rain upon them 
        "an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone!" 
        Ezekiel 38:22. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire 
        and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of 
        their cup. </p></b>Some expositors think that in the term "horrible 
        tempest," there is in the Hebrew an allusion to that burning, 
        suffocating wind, which blows across the Arabian deserts, and is known 
        by the name of Simoom. "A burning storm," one calls it, while another 
        great commentator reads it "wrath-wind;" in either version the language 
        is full of terrors. 
<p align="justify">What a tempest will that be which shall overwhelm the 
        despisers of God! Oh! what a shower will that be which shall pour out 
        itself forever upon the defenseless heads of impenitent sinners in Hell! 
        Repent, you rebels, or this fiery deluge shall soon surround you. Hell's 
        horrors shall be your inheritance, your entailed estate!</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">"The portion of your cup." </p></b>The dregs of that cup 
        you shall wring out, and drink forever. A drop of Hell is terrible, but 
        what must a full cup of torment be? Think of it! A cup of misery—but 
        not a drop of mercy!
<p align="justify">O people of God, how foolish is it to fear the faces 
        of men who shall soon be faggots in the fire of Hell! Think of their 
        end, their fearful end, and all fear of them must be changed into 
        contempt of their threatenings, and pity for their miserable estate.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. </p></b>The delightful contrast of the last 
        verse is well worthy of our observation, and it affords another 
        overwhelming reason why we should be steadfast, unmoveable, not carried 
        away with fear, or led to adopt carnal expedients in order to avoid 
        trial. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For the righteous Lord loves righteousness."</p></b> It 
        is not only his office to defend it, but his nature to love it. He would 
        deny himself if he did not defend the just. It is essential to the very 
        being of God that he should be just. Fear not, then, the end of all your 
        trials, but "be just, and fear not." God approves, and, if men oppose, 
        what matters it? 
<b>
<p align="justify">"His countenance does behold the upright."</p></b> We 
        need never be out of countenance, for God countenances us. He observes, 
        he approves, he delights in the upright. <i>He sees his own image in 
        them, an image of his own fashioning, and therefore with delight he 
        regards them. 
</i>
<p align="justify">Shall we dare to put forth our hand unto iniquity in 
        order to escape affliction? Let us have done with by-ways and short 
        turnings, and let us keep to that fair path of right along which 
        Jehovah's smile shall light us.</p>
<p align="justify">Are we tempted to put our light under a bushel, to 
        conceal our religion from our neighbors? Is it suggested to us that 
        there are ways of avoiding the cross, and shunning the reproach of 
        Christ? Let us not hearken to the voice of the charmer, but seek an 
        increase of faith, that we may wrestle with principalities and powers, 
        and follow the Lord, fully going outside the camp, bearing his reproach. 
        Mammon, the flesh, the devil, will all whisper in our ear, "Flee as a 
        bird to your mountain!" But let us come forth and defy them all. "Resist 
        the devil, and he will flee from you." There is no room or reason for 
        retreat. Advance! Let the vanguard push on! To the front! all you powers 
        and passions of our soul. On! on! in God's name, on! for "the Lord 
        Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge."</p>
