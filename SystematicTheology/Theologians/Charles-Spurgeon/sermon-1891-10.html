          1. Such, then, is their system, which neither the prophets announced,
          nor the Lord taught, nor the apostles delivered, but of which they
          boast that beyond all others they have a perfect knowledge. They
          gather their views from other sources than the Scriptures; and, to use
          a common proverb, they strive to weave ropes of sand, while they
          endeavour to adapt with an air of probability to their own peculiar
          assertions the parables of the Lord, the sayings of the prophets, and
          the words of the apostles, in order that their scheme may not seem
          altogether without support. In doing so, however, they disregard the
          order and the connection of the Scriptures, and so far as in them
          lies, dismember and destroy the truth. By transferring passages, and
          dressing them up anew, and making one thing out of another, they
          succeed in deluding many through their wicked art in adapting the
          oracles of the Lord to their opinions. Their manner of acting is just
          as if one, when a beautiful image of a king has been constructed by
          some skilful artist out of precious jewels, should then take this
          likeness of the man all to pieces, should rearrange the gems, and so
          fit them together as to make them into the form of a dog or of a fox,
          and even that but poorly executed; and should then maintain and
          declare that this was the beautiful image of the king which the
          skilful artist constructed, pointing to the jewels which had been
          admirably fitted together by the first artist to form the image of the
          king, but have been with bad effect transferred by the latter one to
          the shape of a dog, and by thus exhibiting the jewels, should deceive
          the ignorant who had no conception what a king's form was like, and
          persuade them that that miserable likeness of the fox was, in fact,
          the beautiful image of the king. In like manner do these persons patch
          together old wives' fables, and then endeavour, by violently drawing
          away from their proper connection, words, expressions, and parables
          whenever found, to adapt the oracles of God to their baseless
          fictions. We have already stated how far they proceed in this way with
          respect to the interior of the Pleroma.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Then, again, as to those things outside of their Pleroma, the
          following are some specimens of what they attempt to accommodate out
          of the Scriptures to their opinions. They affirm that the Lord came in
          the last times of the world to endure suffering, for this end, that He
          might indicate the passion which occurred to the last of the Æons, and
          might by His own end announce the cessation of that disturbance which
          had risen among the Æons. They maintain, further, that that girl of
          twelve years old, the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, to whom
          the Lord approached and raised her from the dead, was a type of
          Achamoth, to whom their Christ, by extending himself, imparted shape,
          and whom he led anew to the perception of that light which had
          forsaken her. And that the Saviour appeared to her when she lay
          outside of the Pleroma as a kind of abortion, they affirm Paul to have
          declared in his Epistle to the Corinthians [in these words], |And last
          of all, He appeared to me also, as to one born out of due time.|
          Again, the coming of the Saviour with His attendants to Achamoth is
          declared in like manner by him in the same Epistle, when he says, |A
          woman ought to have a veil upon her head, because of the angels.| Now,
          that Achamoth, when the Saviour came to her, drew a veil over herself
          through modesty, Moses rendered manifest when he put a veil upon his
          face. Then, also, they say that the passions which she endured were
          indicated by the Lord upon the cross. Thus, when He said, |My God, my
          God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?| He simply showed that Sophia was
          deserted by the light, and was restrained by Horos from making any
          advance forward. Her anguish, again, was indicated when He said, |My
          soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;| her fear by the words,
          |Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me;| and her
          perplexity, too, when He said, |And what I shall say, I know not.|
        </p>
        <p>
          3. And they teach that He pointed out the three kinds of men as
          follows: the material, when He said to him that asked Him, |Shall I
          follow Thee?| |The Son of man hath not where to lay His head;| -- the
          animal, when He said to him that declared, |I will follow Thee, but
          suffer me first to bid them farewell that are in my house,| |No man,
          putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the
          kingdom of heaven| (for this man they declare to be of the
          intermediate class, even as they do that other who, though he
          professed to have wrought a large amount of righteousness, yet refused
          to follow Him, and was so overcome by [the love of] riches, as never
          to reach perfection) -- this one it pleases them to place in the
          animal class; -- the spiritual, again, when He said, |Let the dead
          bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God,| and when
          He said to Zaccheus the publican, |Make haste, and come down, for
          to-day I must abide in thine house| -- for these they declared to have
          belonged to the spiritual class. Also the parable of the leaven which
          the woman is described as having hid in three measures of meal, they
          declare to make manifest the three classes. For, according to their
          teaching, the woman represented Sophia; the three measures of meal,
          the three kinds of men -- spiritual, animal, and material; while the
          leaven denoted the Saviour Himself. Paul, too, very plainly set forth
          the material, animal, and spiritual, saying in one place, |As is the
          earthy, such are they also that are earthy;| and in another place,
          |But the animal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit;| and
          again: |He that is spiritual judgeth all things.| And this, |The
          animal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit,| they affirm to
          have been spoken concerning the Demiurge, who, as being animal, knew
          neither his mother who was spiritual, nor her seed, nor the Æons in
          the Pleroma. And that the Saviour received first-fruits of those whom
          He was to save, Paul declared when he said, |And if the first-fruits
          be holy, the lump is also holy,| teaching that the expression
          |first-fruits| denoted that which is spiritual, but that |the lump|
          meant us, that is, the animal Church, the lump of which they say He
          assumed, and blended it with Himself, inasmuch as He is |the leaven.|
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Moreover, that Achamoth wandered beyond the Pleroma, and received
          form from Christ, and was sought after by the Saviour, they declare
          that He indicated when He said, that He had come after that sheep
          which was gone astray. For they explain the wandering sheep to mean
          their mother, by whom they represent the Church as having been sown.
          The wandering itself denotes her stay outside of the Pleroma in a
          state of varied passion, from which they maintain that matter derived
          its origin. The woman, again, who sweeps the house and finds the piece
          of money, they declare to denote the Sophia above, who, having lost
          her enthymesis, afterwards recovered it, on all things being purified
          by the advent of the Saviour. Wherefore this substance also, according
          to them, was reinstated in Pleroma. They say, too, that Simeon, |who
          took Christ into his arms, and gave thanks to God, and said, Lord, now
          lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word,| was
          a type of the Demiurge, who, on the arrival of the Saviour, learned
          his own change of place, and gave thanks to Bythus. They also assert
          that by Anna, who is spoken of in the gospel as a prophetess, and who,
          after living seven years with her husband, passed all the rest of her
          life in widowhood until she saw the Saviour, and recognised Him, and
          spoke of Him to all, was most plainly indicated Achamoth, who, having
          for a little while looked upon the Saviour with His associates, and
          dwelling all the rest of the time in the intermediate place, waited
          for Him till He should come again, and restore her to her proper
          consort. Her name, too, was indicated by the Saviour, when He said,
          |Yet wisdom is justified by her children.| This, too, was done by Paul
          in these words, |But we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.|
          They declare also that Paul has referred to the conjunctions within
          the Pleroma, showing them forth by means of one; for, when writing of
          the conjugal union in this life, he expressed himself thus: |This is a
          great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.|
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Further, they teach that John, the disciple of the Lord, indicated
          the first Ogdoad, expressing themselves in these words: John, the
          disciple of the Lord, wishing to set forth the origin of all things,
          so as to explain how the Father produced the whole, lays down a
          certain principle, -- that, namely, which was first-begotten by God,
          which Being he has termed both the only-begotten Son and God, in whom
          the Father, after a seminal manner, brought forth all things. By him
          the Word was produced, and in him the whole substance of the Æons, to
          which the Word himself afterwards imparted form. Since, therefore, he
          treats of the first origin of things, he rightly proceeds in his
          teaching from the beginning, that is, from God and the Word. And he
          expresses himself thus: |In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
          was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with
          God.| Having first of all distinguished these three -- God, the
          Beginning, and the Word -- he again unites them, that he may exhibit
          the production of each of them, that is, of the Son and of the Word,
          and may at the same time show their union with one another, and with
          the Father. For |the beginning| is in the Father, and of the Father,
          while |the Word| is in the beginning, and of the beginning. Very
          properly, then, did he say, |In the beginning was the Word,| for He
          was in the Son; |and the Word was with God,| for He was the beginning;
          |and the Word was God,| of course, for that which is begotten of God
          is God. |The same was in the beginning with God| -- this clause
          discloses the order of production. |All things were made by Him, and
          without Him was nothing made;| for the Word was the author of form and
          beginning to all the Æons that came into existence after Him. But
          |what was made in Him,| says John, |is life.| Here again he indicated
          conjunction; for all things, he said, were made by Him, but in Him was
          life. This, then, which is in Him, is more closely connected with Him
          than those things which were simply made by Him, for it exists along
          with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds, |And the life
          was the light of men,| while thus mentioning Anthropos, he indicated
          also Ecclesia by that one expression, in order that, by using only one
          name, he might disclose their fellowship with one another, in virtue
          of their conjunction. For Anthropos and Ecclesia spring from Logos and
          Zoe. Moreover, he styled life (Zoe) the light of men, because they are
          enlightened by her, that is, formed and made manifest. This also Paul
          declares in these words: |For whatsoever doth make manifest is light.|
          Since, therefore, Zoe manifested and begat both Anthropos and
          Ecclesia, she is termed their light. Thus, then, did John by these
          words reveal both other things and the second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe,
          Anthropos and Ecclesia. And still further, he also indicated the first
          Tetrad. For, in discoursing of the Saviour and declaring that all
          things beyond the Pleroma received form from Him, he says that He is
          the fruit of the entire Pleroma. For he styles Him a |light which
          shineth in darkness, and which was not comprehended| by it, inasmuch
          as, when He imparted form to all those things which had their origin
          from passion, He was not known by it. He also styles Him Son, and
          Aletheia, and Zoe, and the |Word made flesh, whose glory,| he says,
          |we beheld; and His glory was as that of the Only-begotten (given to
          Him by the Father), full of grace and truth.| (But what John really
          does say is this: |And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;
          and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the
          Father, full of grace and truth.| ) Thus, then, does he [according to
          them] distinctly set forth the first Tetrad, when he speaks of the
          Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia. In this way, too,
          does John tell of the first Ogdoad, and that which is the mother of
          all the Æons. For he mentions the Father, and Charis, and Monogenes,
          and Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia. Such
          are the views of Ptolemæus. <br />
