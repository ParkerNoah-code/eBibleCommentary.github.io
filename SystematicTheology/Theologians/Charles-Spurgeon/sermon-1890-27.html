        <p>To All Bishops.</p>
        <p>On brotherly love, and on avoiding the evil.</p>
        <p>
          Pontianus, bishop of the holy and universal Church, to all who worship
          the Lord aright, and love the divine worship, greeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.
          These words, most beloved, are not the words of men, but of angels;
          and they were not devised by human sense, but were uttered by angels
          at the birth of the Saviour. And from these words it can be understood
          without doubt by all that peace is given by the Lord, not to men of
          evil will, but to men of good will. Whence the Lord, speaking by the
          prophet, says: "How good is God to Israel, even to such as are of a
          clean heart! But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had
          well-nigh slipped: for I was envious at the unrighteous, when I saw
          the prosperity of the wicked." Of the good, however, the Truth says in
          His own person, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
          God." And they are not the pure in heart who think evil things, or
          things hurtful to their brethren; for he who is the faithful man
          devises nothing evil. The faithful man, accordingly, loves rather to
          hear things which are becoming, than to speak things which are not
          becoming. And if any one is faithful, let him see to it that he speak
          no evil, and lay no snares in the way of any one. In this, then, are
          the children of God distinguished from the children of the devil. For
          the children of God always think and strive to do things which are of
          God, and give help unceasingly to their brethren, and wish to injure
          no one. But, on the other hand, the children of the devil are always
          meditating things evil and hurtful, because their deeds are evil. And
          of them the Lord, speaking by the prophet Jeremiah, says: "I will
          utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness."
          "Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord; and with your
          children's children will I plead." "Behold, I frame evil against you,
          and devise a device against you." These things, brethren, are greatly
          to be feared, and to be guarded against by all; for the man on whom
          the judgment of God may fall will not depart unhurt. And therefore let
          every one see to it carefully that he neither contrive nor do against
          a brother what he would not wish to have to endure himself. And let
          not the man of faith come under the suspicion even of saying or doing
          what he would not wish to have to endure himself. Wherefore persons
          suspected, or hostile or litigious, and those who are not of good
          conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, and those who do not
          hold and teach the right faith, have been debarred from being either
          accusers or witnesses by our predecessors with apostolic authority;
          and we too remove them from that function, and exclude them from it in
          times to come, lest those lapse wilfully whom we ought to keep in and
          save; lest not only (which may God forbid!) the predicted judgment of
          God should fall upon both, but we also should perish (which may God
          forbid!) through their fault. For it is written, "Have they made thee
          the master of a feast? Take care for them, that thou mayst be merry on
          their account, and receive as thy crown the ornament of esteem, and
          find approbation of thine election." For the evil word affects the
          heart, out of which proceed these four objects, good and evil, life
          and death; and the tongue in its assiduous action is what determines
          these. Wherefore the before-named parties are altogether to be
          avoided; and until the before-noted matters are investigated, and the
          parties are found to be clear of such, they are not to be received:
          for the right sacrifice is to give heed to the commandments, and to
          depart from all iniquity. "To depart from wickedness is a thing
          pleasing to the Lord, and to forsake unrighteousness is a sacrifice of
          praise." For it is written, "Love thy friend, and be faithful unto
          him. But if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him. For
          as a man who destroyeth his friend, so is he who destroys (loseth) the
          friendship of his neighbour. And as one that letteth a bird go out of
          his hand, so art thou that has let thy neighbour go and shalt not get
          him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he has
          escaped like a roe out of the snare, because his soul is wounded. Thou
          wilt not be able to bind him any more, and there is reconciliation for
          the reviled. But to betray the secrets of a friend is the desperation
          of a wretched soul. He that winketh with the eye worketh evil, and no
          one will cast him off. When thou art present, he will despise his own
          mouth, and express his wonder at thy discourse; but at the last he
          will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many
          things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will hate him. Whoso
          casteth a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head, and a
          deceitful stroke of the deceitful will make wounds. Whoso diggeth a
          pit shall fall therein; and he that setteth a stone in his neighbour's
          way will fall thereon; and he that placeth a snare for another will
          perish therein. He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and
          he shall not know whence it cometh on him. Mockery and reproach are
          from the proud; and vengeance, as a lion, shall be in wait for them.
          They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall perish in the
          snare, and anguish shall consume them before they die. Anger and wrath
          are both abominations, and the sinful man shall have them both." "He
          that will be avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will
          surely keep his sins. Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done
          unto thee, and then shall thy sins be forgiven thee when thou prayest.
          One man beareth hatred against another; and doth he ask redress of
          God? He showeth no mercy to a man which is like himself; and doth he
          ask forgiveness of the Most High for his own sins? He, though he is
          flesh, nourisheth hatred; and doth he ask pardon of God? Who will
          entreat for his sins? Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; for
          corruption and death impend on commandments. Remember the fear of God,
          and bear no malice to thy neighbour. Remember the covenant of the
          Highest, and look down upon (despice) the ignorance of thy neighbour.
          Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a furious man kindleth strife; and a sinful man will disquiet
          friends, and make enmity among them that be at peace. For even as the
          trees of the wood are, so will the fire burn; and as a man's strength
          is, so will his anger be; and as his riches are, so will he make his
          anger rise. An hastened contention will kindle a fire, and an
          hastening quarrel will shed blood, and a testifying (testificans)
          tongue will bring death. If thou blow upon the spark, it will burn
          like a fire; and if thou spit upon it, it will be extinguished: and
          both these come out of the mouth. Cursed be the whisperer and
          doubled-tongued, for such have troubled many that were at peace. A
          third (tertia) tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from
          nation to nation: the fortified cities of the rich it hath pulled
          down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has subverted the
          virtues of peoples, and has destroyed strong nations. A third tongue
          hath cast out truthful women, and deprived them of their labours.
          Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell
          quietly. The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh, but the
          stroke of the tongue will break bones. Many have fallen by the edge of
          the sword, but not in such manner as those who have perished by their
          tongue. Well is he that is defended from the evil tongue, who hath not
          passed into the anger thereof, and who hath not drawn the yoke
          thereof, nor hath been bound with the bands of it; for the yoke
          thereof is a yoke of iron, and the band thereof is a band of brass.
          The death thereof is the vilest death, and the grave were better than
          it. The perseverance thereof shall not abide; but it shall hold the
          ways of the unrighteous, and its flame shall not burn the righteous.
          Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it, and it shall burn in
          them, and not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion,
          and hurt them as a leopard. Hedge thine ears about with thorns, and
          listen not to the evil tongue; and make a door for thy mouth, and bars
          for thine ears. Smelt (confla) thy gold and silver, and make a balance
          for thy words, and right curbs for thy mouth. And beware that thou
          slide not perchance in thy tongue, and fall before thine enemies that
          lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be irremediable even to death."
          "Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to
          day. For suddenly shall His wrath come, and in the time of vengeance
          He will destroy thee. Set not thine heart upon goods unjustly gotten,
          for they shall not profit thee in the day of veiling (for execution,
          obductionis) and vengeance. Move not with every wind, and go not into
          every way; for so is the sinner proved with the double-tongue. Be
          stedfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thine
          understanding, and in knowledge; and let the word of peace and
          righteousness attend thee. Be courteous in hearing the word, that thou
          mayest understand it, and with wisdom give a true answer. If thou hast
          understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy
          mouth, lest thou be caught in a word of folly, and be confounded.
          Honour and glory are in the talk of the intelligent man; the tongue of
          the unwise is his fall. Be not called a whisperer, and be not caught
          in thy tongue, and confounded. For confusion and penitence are upon
          the thief, and the worst condemnation upon the double-tongued.
          Moreover, for the whisperer there is hatred, and enmity, and shame.
          Justify the small and the great alike." Instead of a friend, become
          not an enemy to thy neighbour. For the evil man shall inherit reproach
          and shame, and every sinner in like manner that is envious and
          double-tongued. Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart as
          a bull, lest perchance thy virtue be shattered in folly, and it
          consume thy leaves, and destroy thy fruits, and thou be left as a dry
          tree in the desert. For a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it,
          and makes him to be laughed to scorn by his enemies, and shall bring
          him down to the lot of the impious." Most dearly beloved, study to
          lift up the oppressed, and always help the necessitous; for if a man
          relieves an afflicted brother, delivers a captive, or consoles a
          mourner, let him have no doubt that that will be recompensed to him by
          Him on whom he bestows it all, and who says: "Inasmuch as ye have done
          it unto one of the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
          Strive, then, unceasingly to do what is good in such wise that ye may
          both obtain the fruit of good works here, and enjoy the favour of God
          in the future, to the intent that hereafter ye may be worthy to enter
          the court of the heavenly kingdom. -- Given on the fourth day before
          the kalends of May (the 28th of April), in the consulship of the most
          illustrious Severus and Quintianus.
