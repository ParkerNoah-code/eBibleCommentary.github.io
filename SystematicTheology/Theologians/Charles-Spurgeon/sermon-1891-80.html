          1. Luke also, the follower and disciple of the apostles, referring to
          Zacharias and Elisabeth, from whom, according to promise, John was
          born, says: "And they were both righteous before God, walking in all
          the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless." And again,
          speaking of Zacharias: "And it came to pass, that while he executed
          the priest's office before God in the order of his course, according
          to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense;"
          and he came to sacrifice, "entering into the temple of the Lord."
          Whose angel Gabriel, also, who stands prominently in the presence of
          the Lord, simply, absolutely, and decidedly confessed in his own
          person as God and Lord, Him who had chosen Jerusalem, and had
          instituted the sacerdotal office. For he knew of none other above Him;
          since, if he had been in possession of the knowledge of any other more
          perfect God and Lord besides Him, he surely would never -- as I have
          already shown -- have confessed Him, whom he knew to be the fruit of a
          defect, as absolutely and altogether God and Lord. And then, speaking
          of John, he thus says: "For he shall be great in the sight of the
          Lord, and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
          their God. And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of
          Elias, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." For whom, then,
          did he prepare the people, and in the sight of what Lord was he made
          great? Truly of Him who said that John had something even "more than a
          prophet," and that "among those born of women none is greater than
          John the Baptist;" who did also make the people ready for the Lord's
          advent, warning his fellow-servants, and preaching to them repentance,
          that they might receive remission from the Lord when He should be
          present, having been converted to Him, from whom they had been
          alienated because of sins and transgressions. As also David says, "The
          alienated are sinners from the womb: they go astray as soon as they
          are born." And it was on account of this that he, turning them to
          their Lord, prepared, in the spirit and power of Elias, a perfect
          people for the Lord.

          2. And again, speaking in reference to the angel, he says: "But at
          that time the angel Gabriel was sent from God, who did also say to the
          virgin, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God." And he
          says concerning the Lord: "He shall be great, and shall be called the
          Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of
          His father David: and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever;
          and of His kingdom there shall be no end." For who else is there who
          can reign uninterruptedly over the house of Jacob for ever, except
          Jesus Christ our Lord, the Son of the Most High God, who promised by
          the law and the prophets that He would make His salvation visible to
          all flesh; so that He would become the Son of man for this purpose,
          that man also might become the son of God? And Mary, exulting because
          of this, cried out, prophesying on behalf of the Church, "My soul doth
          magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For
          He hath taken up His child Israel, in remembrance of His mercy, as He
          spake to our fathers, Abraham, and his seed for ever." By these and
          such like [passages] the Gospel points out that it was God who spake
          to the fathers; that it was He who, by Moses, instituted the legal
          dispensation, by which giving of the law we know that He spake to the
          fathers. This same God, after His great goodness, poured His
          compassion upon us, through which compassion "the Day-spring from on
          high hath looked upon us, and appeared to those who sat in darkness
          and the shadow of death, and has guided our feet into the way of
          peace;" as Zacharias also, recovering from the state of dumbness which
          he had suffered on account of unbelief, having been filled with a new
          spirit, did bless God in a new manner. For all things had entered upon
          a new phase, the Word arranging after a new manner the advent in the
          flesh, that He might win back to God that human nature (hominem) which
          had departed from God; and therefore men were taught to worship God
          after a new fashion, but not another god, because in truth there is
          but "one God, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the
          uncircumcision through faith." But Zacharias prophesying, exclaimed,
          "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for He hath visited and redeemed
          His people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the
          house of His servant David; as He spake by the mouth of His holy
          prophets, which have been since the world begun; salvation from our
          enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; to perform the mercy
          [promised] to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant, the oath
          which He swore to our father Abraham, that He would grant unto us,
          that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve
          Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him, all our
          days." Then he says to John: "And thou, child, shalt be called the
          prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord
          to prepare His ways; to give knowledge of salvation to His people, for
          the remission of their sins." For this is the knowledge of salvation
          which was wanting to them, that of the Son of God, which John made
          known, saying, "Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the
          world. This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man who was made
          before me; because He was prior to me: and of His fulness have all we
          received." This, therefore, was the knowledge of salvation; but [it
          did not consist in] another God, nor another Father, nor Bythus, nor
          the Pleroma of thirty Ã†ons, nor the Mother of the (lower) Ogdoad: but
          the knowledge of salvation was the knowledge of the Son of God, who is
          both called and actually is, salvation, and Saviour, and salutary.
          Salvation, indeed, as follows: "I have waited for Thy salvation, O
          Lord." And then again, Saviour: "Behold my God, my Saviour, I will put
          my trust in Him." But as bringing salvation, thus: "God hath made
          known His salvation (salutare) in the sight of the heathen." For He is
          indeed Saviour, as being the Son and Word of God; but salutary, since
          [He is] Spirit; for he says: "The Spirit of our countenance, Christ
          the Lord." But salvation, as being flesh: for "the Word was made
          flesh, and dwelt among us." This knowledge of salvation, therefore,
          John did impart to those repenting, and believing in the Lamb of God,
          who taketh away the sin of the world.

        <p>
          3. And the angel of the Lord, he says, appeared to the shepherds,
          proclaiming joy to them: "For there is born in the house of David, a
          Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. Then [appeared] a multitude of the
          heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory in the highest to God,
          and on earth peace, to men of good will." The falsely-called Gnostics
          say that these angels came from the Ogdoad, and made manifest the
          descent of the superior Christ. But they are again in error, when
          saying that the Christ and Saviour from above was not born, but that
          also, after the baptism of the dispensational Jesus, he, [the Christ
          of the Pleroma,] descended upon him as a dove. Therefore, according to
          these men, the angels of the Ogdoad lied, when they said, "For unto
          you is born this day a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of
          David." For neither was Christ nor the Saviour born at that time, by
          their account; but it was he, the dispensational Jesus, who is of the
          framer of the world, the [Demiurge], and upon whom, after his baptism,
          that is, after [the lapse of] thirty years, they maintain the Saviour
          from above descended. But why did [the angels] add, "in the city of
          David," if they did not proclaim the glad tidings of the fulfilment of
          God's promise made to David, that from the fruit of his body there
          should be an eternal King? For the Framer [Demiurge] of the entire
          universe made promise to David, as David himself declares: "My help is
          from God, who made heaven and earth;" and again: "In His hand are the
          ends of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. For the
          sea is His, and He did Himself make it; and His hands founded the dry
          land. Come ye, let us worship and fall down before Him, and weep in
          the presence of the Lord who made us; for He is the Lord our God." The
          Holy Spirit evidently thus declares by David to those hearing him,
          that there shall be those who despise Him who formed us, and who is
          God alone. Wherefore he also uttered the foregoing words, meaning to
          say: See that ye do not err; besides or above Him there is no other
          God, to whom ye should rather stretch out [your hands], thus rendering
          us pious and grateful towards Him who made, established, and [still]
          nourishes us. What, then, shall happen to those who have been the
          authors of so much blasphemy against their Creator? This identical
          truth was also what the angels [proclaimed]. For when they exclaim,
          "Glory to God in the highest, and in earth peace," they have glorified
          with these words Him who is the Creator of the highest, that is, of
          super-celestial things, and the Founder of everything on earth: who
          has sent to His own handiwork, that is, to men, the blessing of His
          salvation from heaven. Wherefore he adds: "The shepherds returned,
          glorifying God for all which they had heard and seen, as it was told
          unto them." For the Israelitish shepherds did not glorify another god,
          but Him who had been announced by the law and the prophets, the Maker
          of all things, whom also the angels glorified. But if the angels who
          were from the Ogdoad were accustomed to glorify any other, different
          from Him whom the shepherds [adored], these angels from the Ogdoad
          brought to them error and not truth.

        <p>
          4. And still further does Luke say in reference to the Lord: "When the
          days of purification were accomplished, they brought Him up to
          Jerusalem, to present Him before the Lord, as it is written in the law
          of the Lord, That every male opening the womb shall be called holy to
          the Lord; and that they should offer a sacrifice, as it is said in the
          law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons:" in his
          own person most clearly calling Him Lord, who appointed the legal
          dispensation. But "Simeon," he also says, "blessed God, and said,
          Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have
          seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all
          people; a light for the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of
          Thy people Israel." And "Anna" also, "the prophetess," he says, in
          like manner glorified God when she saw Christ, "and spake of Him to
          all them who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem." Now by all
          these one God is shown forth, revealing to men the new dispensation of
          liberty, the covenant, through the new advent of His Son.

          5. Wherefore also Mark, the interpreter and follower of Peter, does
          thus commence his Gospel narrative: "The beginning of the Gospel of
          Jesus Christ, the Son of God; as it is written in the prophets,
          Behold, I send My messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy
          way. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
          the Lord, make the paths straight before our God." Plainly does the
          commencement of the Gospel quote the words of the holy prophets, and
          point out Him at once, whom they confessed as God and Lord; Him, the
          Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had also made promise to Him,
          that He would send His messenger before His face, who was John, crying
          in the wilderness, in "the spirit and power of Elias," "Prepare ye the
          way of the Lord, make straight paths before our God." For the prophets
          did not announce one and another God, but one and the same; under
          various aspects, however, and many titles. For varied and rich in
          attribute is the Father, as I have already shown in the book preceding
          this; and I shall show [the same truth] from the prophets themselves
          in the further course of this work. Also, towards the conclusion of
          his Gospel, Mark says: "So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken to
          them, He was received up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of
          God;" confirming what had been spoken by the prophet: "The Lord said
          to my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thy foes Thy
          footstool." Thus God and the Father are truly one and the same; He who
          was announced by the prophets, and handed down by the true Gospel;
          whom we Christians worship and love with the whole heart, as the Maker
          of heaven and earth, and of all things therein.
