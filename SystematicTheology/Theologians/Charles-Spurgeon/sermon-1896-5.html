          1. O Jehovah! God of vengeances; God of vengeances, shine forth. 2.
          Lift up thyself, thou Judge of the earth! render a reward to the
          proud.3. O Jehovah! how long shall the wicked -- how long shall the
          wicked triumph? 4. They pour forth, they speak hard things, all the
          workers of iniquity lift up themselves.5. They break in pieces thy
          people, O Jehovah! and afflict thy inheritance.6. They slay the widow,
          and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.

          1 O Jehovah! God of vengeances We know that the Jews were surrounded
          by many neighbors who were not well affected towards them, and were
          thus incessantly subject to the assaults and oppression of bitter
          enemies. As this intestine persecution was even more afflictive than
          the rampant and unrestrained violence of the wicked, we need not
          wonder that the Psalmist should earnestly beseech God for deliverance
          from it. The expressions which he uses, calling upon God to shine
          forth conspicuously, and lift himself up on high, amount in common
          language to this, that God would give some actual manifestation of his
          character as judge or avenger; for in that case he is seen ascending
          his tribunal to exact the punishment due to sin, and demonstrate his
          power in preserving order and government in the world. The phraseology
          is used only in reference to ourselves, disposed as we are to feel as
          if he overlooked us, unless he stretched out his hand to help us in
          some visible and open manner. In calling him twice successively the
          God of vengeances, and then, judge of the earth, the Psalmist uses
          these titles as applicable to the present situation in which he stood,
          reminding Him in a manner of the office which belonged to him, and
          saying -- O Lord! it is thine to take vengeance upon sinners, and
          judge the earth -- see how they take advantage of the impunity which
          is extended to their guilt, and triumph audaciously in their
          wickedness! Not that God needs to be admonished of his duty, for he
          never resigns himself to indifference, and even when he seems to delay
          his judgments, is only adjusting them according to what he knows to be
          the best season; but his people conceive of him in this way to
          themselves, and take occasion from this to embolden and stimulate
          themselves to greater vehemency in prayer. The same may be said of the
          repetition which the Psalmist uses. When the wicked then indulge in
          unrestrained excesses, we are to remember that God can never cease to
          assert his character as the judge of the earth who takes vengeance
          upon iniquity. Does he seem in our carnal apprehension to have at any
          time withdrawn and hidden himself? let us put up without hesitation
          the prayer which is here taught us by the Holy Spirit, that he would
          shine forth
        </p>
        <p>
          3 O Jehovah! how long shall the wicked? The Psalmist justifies himself
          in this verse for the fervent importunity which he showed in prayer.
          There was need of immediate help, when the wicked had proceeded to
          such an extent of audacity. The necessity of our case may justly
          embolden us in our requests, which must be all the more readily heard
          as they are reasonable; and here the Psalmist insists that his
          complaints were not without cause, nor originated in trifling reasons,
          but were extorted by injuries of the most flagrant description. Notice
          is taken of the length of time during which their persecutions had
          lasted, as an aggravating circumstance. They had become hardened under
          the long-continued forbearance of God, and had in consequence
          contracted a shamelessness, as well as obstinacy of spirit, imagining
          that he looked upon their wickedness with an eye of favor. The term
          how long twice repeated, implies the extent of impunity which had been
          granted, that it was not as if they had newly started upon their
          career, but that they had been tolerated for a length of time, and had
          become outrageously flagitious. It was thus that in former times
          wicked men tyrannized to such a degree over the Church, while yet God
          did not interfere to apply a remedy; and we need not be surprised that
          he should subject her now to protracted persecutions, nor should we
          conclude that, because he does not immediately proceed to cure
          existing evils, he has utterly forsaken her. The term triumph denotes
          that fullness of audacious and boasting exultation which the wicked
          feel when they are intoxicated with continued prosperity, and conceive
          that they may indulge in every excess without restraint.

          4 They pour forth, they speak hard things He shows in still clearer
          terms, how their fierceness in persecution was such that they did not
          scruple to glory in their guilt. The Hebrew verb nv, nabang, means
          more than to speak. Literally it signifies to rush or boil forth, and
          comes to denote figuratively the uttering of reckless or rash words.
          We see how wicked men are instigated by pride and vain-glory, to
          demean and disgrace themselves so far as to boast vain-gloriously of
          their power, breathing forth threatenings of bloodshed, violence, and
          monstrous cruelty. It is to such ebullitions that the Psalmist refers,
          when men who are lost to all sense of shame and modesty boast of the
          wickedness which they can perpetrate at will. This is what he means by
          their speaking hard things, uttering discourse which is under no
          restraint of fear, or prudential consideration, but which launches
          into the most unbridled license. As the Lord's people had formerly to
          endure the heavy trial of seeing the Church subjected to this wild
          tyranny and misrule, we should account it no strange thing to see the
          Church suffering still under miserable misgovernment, or positive
          oppression, but should pray for help from God, who, though he connives
          at wickedness for a time, eventually comes to the deliverance of his
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          5 They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah! Having spoken of their
          discourse or language as vain-glorious and shameless, he proceeds to
          speak of their deeds, in cruelly persecuting the Church. It is hard
          that even the subjects of heathen princes should be subjected to
          unjust persecution, but a more intolerable thing still, that those who
          are God's own people, his peculiar inheritance, should be trampled
          under the foot of tyranny. The prayer before us is one which, as I
          have already remarked, is given with the intention that we should
          prefer it ourselves, when we or others may be persecuted by wicked
          men, and especially intestine enemies. Our safety is dear to the Lord,
          not only as we are men, the workmanship of his hand, but as we are his
          peculiar heritage; and this should lead us, when wronged at any time,
          to betake ourselves to God with the more confidence. It is farther
          added -- that they spare not the widow, and the orphan, and murder the
          stranger God, while he has commanded us in general to cultivate equity
          and justice in our common intercourse, has commended the orphan,
          widow, and stranger, to our peculiar care, as being more exposed to
          injury, and therefore more entitled to humanity and compassion. To
          treat such objects with cruelty argues a singular degree of impiety,
          and contempt of divine authority, and is not only an outrage of common
          justice, but the infraction of a privilege of special protection which
          God has condescended to cast around them. They who are chargeable with
          such conduct, particularly provoke the divine anger. As to little
          children especially, their helplessness and tender age will even
          protect them from being attacked by dogs and wild beasts. And what
          shall we think of the monstrous inhumanity of men, who would make them
          the objects of their assault? We have here a specimen of the dreadful
          state of matters which must then have prevailed in the Church of God.
          The law was there, and the ordinances of divine appointment, yet we
          see to what an awful extent every species of wickedness abounded. Let
          us beware lest we fall into a similar state of corruption, and should
          it so happen under our own observation that men persecute the
          stranger, seize the widow, and rob the fatherless, let us, in
          imitation of the Psalmist, who would have us alleviate their
          misfortunes, pray God to undertake their defense.<br />
