          6. The heavens have declared his righteousness, and all the people
          have seen his glory.7. Confounded be all those who serve graven
          images, who glory in their inventions; let all the gods worship before
          him.8. Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
          because of thy judgments, O Jehovah!
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          6 The heavens have declared his righteousness Here he states that
          there would be such an illustrious display of the righteousness of
          God, that the heavens themselves would herald it. The meaning is not
          the same as in the beginning of the nineteenth psalm, "The heavens
          declare the glory of God," etc. In that psalm David means no more than
          that the wisdom and power of God are as conspicuous in the fabric of
          the heavens, as if God should assert them with an audible voice. The
          meaning of the passage before us is, that the spiritual righteousness
          of God should be so signally manifested under the reign of Christ as
          to fill both heaven and earth. There is much force in this
          personification, in which the heavens, as if even they were penetrated
          with a sense of the righteousness of God, are represented as speaking
          of it. It is equally probable, however, that the heavens signify here
          the angels, who are contained in heaven, by the figure of metonomy or
          synecdoche, while, in the corresponding clause, instead of the earth
          being mentioned, he speaks of the peoples who dwell upon it. The
          angels may very properly be said to announce and celebrate the Divine
          glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          7 Confounded be all those who serve graven images. The Psalmist draws
          a broad distinction here, as in the psalm next to this, between the
          true God and the false gods which men form for themselves. This he
          does that the praise which he had ascribed might not be applied to any
          but the true God. Men are all ready to admit that they ought to
          celebrate the praises of God, but, naturally prone as they are to
          superstition, few indeed will be bound down to worship God in the
          manner which is right. No sooner have they to do with God than they
          deviate into the most baseless delusions. Each fashions a god for
          himself, and all choose what suits them best in the medley of
          inventions. This is the reason why the sacred writers, under the
          apprehension that men may turn to false gods, are careful in giving
          exhortations to the worship of God, to state at the same time who the
          true God is. The order observed by the Psalmist suggests the remark,
          that corrupt superstitions will never be removed until the true
          religion obtains. Prevented from coming to the true God by the
          slowness of their spiritual apprehension, men cannot fail to wander in
          vanities of their own; and it is the knowledge of the true God which
          dispels these, as the sun disperses the darkness. All have naturally a
          something of religion born with them, but owing to the blindness and
          stupidity, as well as the weakness of our minds, the apprehension
          which we conceive of God is immediately depraved. Religion is thus the
          beginning of all superstitions, not in its own nature, but through the
          darkness which has settled down upon the minds of men, and which
          prevents them from distinguishing between idols and the true God. The
          truth of God is effectual when revealed in dispelling and dissipating
          superstitions. Does the sun absorb the vapors which intervene in the
          air, and shall not the presence of God himself be effectual much more?
          We need not wonder then that the Psalmist, in predicting the Kingdom
          of God, triumphs over the ungodly nations, which boasted in graven
          images, as when Isaiah, speaking of the rise of the Gospel, adds,
        </p>
        <p>"Then all the idols of Egypt shall fall," (Isaiah 19:1)</p>
        <p>
          Since the knowledge of God has been hid from the view of men, we are
          taught also that there is no reason to be surprised at the host of
          superstitions which have overspread the world. We have an
          exemplification of the same truth in our own day. The knowledge of the
          true doctrine is extinguished amongst the Turks, the Jews, and
          Papists, and, as a necessary consequence, they lie immersed in error;
          for they cannot possibly return to a sound mind, or repent of their
          errors, when they are ignorant of the true God. When the Psalmist
          speaks of their being confounded, he means that the time was come when
          those who were given to idolatry should repent, and return to the
          worship of the true God. Not that all without exception would be
          brought to genuine repentance, -- for experience has taught us in
          these our own times how atheistical men will cast off superstition,
          and yet assume the most shameless effrontery, but that this is one of
          those consequences which the knowledge of God should effect, the
          turning of men from their errors unto God. Some there are who
          obstinately resist God, of which we have many examples in the Papacy;
          but we have every reason to believe that they are secretly prostrated
          by that which they affect to despise, and confounded notwithstanding
          their opposition. What the Psalmist says a little after, Let all the
          gods worship before him, properly applies to the angels, in whom there
          shines forth some small portion of divinity, yet it may, though less
          appropriately, be extended to fictitious gods; as if he had said,
          Whatever is accounted or held as a god must quit its place and
          renounce its claims, that God alone may be exalted. Hence it may be
          gathered that the true definition of piety is, when the true God is
          perfectly served, and when he alone is so exalted, that no creature
          obscures his divinity; and, accordingly, if we would not have true
          piety entirely destroyed amongst us, we must hold by this principle,
          That no creature whatever be exalted by us beyond measure,

          8 Zion heard, and was glad In the former part of the psalm he had
          spoken of that joy which should be common to all the world. Now he
          makes special mention of God's chosen nation; and this partly, because
          they were to enjoy the first-fruits of this joy, and partly, because
          he would remove all occasion for rivalry or envy. Accordingly, having
          said that the Gentile nations should be brought to equal privileges
          with the posterity of Abraham, he adds, that the Jews would not suffer
          any diminution of honor by this co-partnership of privilege, but might
          rather reasonably rejoice in being chosen of God to be the fountain
          out of which the world was to be watered and refreshed. Those of whom
          the Psalmist speaks were the true children of Abraham and them only.
          They had a double reason for rejoicing, when God extended his
          government and glory from the rising to the setting sun; for, while he
          exhibited to them in Christ the complete fulfillment of that
          redemption which was promised, they, at the same time, saw the glory
          of God diffused from the narrow limits of Judea to all parts of the
          world. When the nations were blessed in the seed of Abraham, agreeably
          to the prediction which had gone before, this was no inconsiderable
          confirmation of their faith, as also, when they saw a religion which
          had been hated and despised universally embraced. But why, it may be
          asked, does he speak of those things being heard, rather than seen?
          Two reasons may be given for this. First, he would have God's
          believing people anticipate the blessing by hope, ere the consummation
          of it arrived; and, again, the language intimates, that the glory of
          the Gospel would be spread to such distant quarters, that the Jews
          would rather hear of it by report, than witness it with their own
          eyes.<br />
