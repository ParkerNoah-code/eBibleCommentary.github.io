          "And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory." -- Exodus 33:18.
        </p>
        <p>
          THAT WAS A large request to make. He could not have asked for more: "I
          beseech thee, show me thy glory." Why, it is the greatest petition
          that man ever asked of God. It seems to me the greatest stretch of
          faith that I have either heard or read of. It was great faith which
          made Abraham go into the plain to offer up intercession for a guilty
          city like Sodom. It was vast faith which enabled Jacob to grasp the
          angel; it was mighty faith which enabled Elijah to rend the heavens
          and fetch down rain from skies which had been like brass before; but
          it appears to me that this prayer contains a greater amount of faith
          than all the others put together. It is the greatest request that man
          could make to God: "I beseech thee, show me thy glory." Had he
          requested a fiery chariot to whirl him up to heaven; had he asked to
          cleave the water-floods and drown the chivalry of a nation; had he
          prayed the Almighty to send fire from heaven to consume whole armies,
          I could have found a parallel to his prayer; but when he offers this
          petition, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory," he stands alone, a
          giant among giants; a Colossus even in those days of mighty men. His
          request surpasses that of any other man: "I beseech thee, show me thy
          glory." Among the lofty peaks and summits of man's prayers that rise
          like mountains to the skies, this is the culminating point; this is
          the highest elevation that faith ever gained: it is the loftiest place
          to which the great ambition of faith could climb; it is the topmost
          pillar of all the towering structures that confidence ever piled. I am
          astonished that Moses himself should have been bold enough to
          supplicate so wondrous a favor. Surely after he had uttered the
          desire, his bones must have trembled, his blood curdled in his veins,
          and his hair must have stood on end. Did he not wonder at himself? Did
          he not tremble at his own hardihood? We believe that such would have
          been the case had not the faith which prompted the prayer sustained
          him in the review of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whence, then, came faith like this? How did Moses obtain so eminent a
          degree of this virtue? Ah, beloved, it was by communion with God. Had
          he not been for forty days in the council-chamber with his God? Had he
          not tarried in the secret pavilion of burning fire? Had not Jehovah
          spoken to him as a man speaketh with his friend, he would not have had
          courage enough to ask so large a boon. Yea, more, I doubt whether all
          this communion would have been sufficient if he had not also received
          a fresh testimony to the grace of God, in sparing a nation through his
          intercession. Moses had argued with God, he had pleaded the covenant,
          and although God had said, "Let me alone that I may destroy them," he
          had still maintained his hold; he had even ventured to say, "If not,
          blot my name out of the book of life," let me die as well as the rest;
          he had wrestled hard with justice, and had prevailed. The strength
          gained by this victory, joined with his former communion with the
          Lord, made him mighty in prayer; but had he not received grace by
          these means, I think the petition was too large even for Moses to
          venture to carry to the throne. Would you, my brethren, have like
          faith, then walk in the same path. Be much in secret prayer. Hold
          constant fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ; so
          shall you soar aloft on wings of confidence, so shall you also open
          your mouth wide and have it filled with divine favors, and if you do
          not offer the same request, yet you may have equal faith to that which
          bade Moses say, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          Allow me to refer you to the 13th verse of this chapter, where Moses
          speaks unto his God -- "Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found
          grace in thy sight, show me now thy way." Moses asked a less favor
          before he requested the greater. He asked to see God's way before he
          prayed to see his glory. Mark you, my friends, this is the true mode
          of prayer. Rest not content with past answers, but double your request
          and go again. Look upon your past petitions as the small end of the
          wedge opening the way for larger ones. The best way to repay God, and
          the way he loves best, is to take and ask him ten times as much each
          time. Nothing pleases God so much as when a sinner comes again very
          soon with twice as large a petition -- "Lord thou didst hear me last
          time, and now I am come again." Faith is a mighty grace, and always
          grows upon that which it feeds. When God has heard prayer for one
          thing, faith comes and asks for two things, and when God has given
          those two things, faith asks for six. Faith can scale the walls of
          heaven. She is a giant grace. She takes mountains by their roots, and
          puts them on other mountains, and so climbs to the throne in
          confidence with large petitions, knowing that she shall not be
          refused. We are most of us too slow to go to God. We are not like the
          beggars who come to the door twenty times if you do not give them
          anything. But if we have been heard once, we go away, instead of
          coming time after time, and each time with a larger prayer. Make your
          petitions longer and longer. Ask for ten, and if God gives them, then
          for a thousand, and keep going on until at last you will positively
          get faith enough to ask, if it were proper, as great a favor as Moses
          did -- "I beseech thee, show me thy glory."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my friends, we have just spoken a word or two on the prayer
          itself; we shall have to see how it was received at the throne. It was
          answered, first, by a gracious manifestation; secondly, by a gracious
          concealment; and, thirdly, by a gracious shielding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First of all this prayer which Moses offered was heard by God, and
          he gave him A GRACIOUS MANIFESTATION: "And he said, I will make all my
          goodness pass before thee; and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
          before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and
          will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that, when Moses put up this prayer to God, he was very much
          like Peter, when, on the mountain top, he wist not what he said. I do
          think that Moses himself hardly understood the petition that he
          offered to God. With all the clearness of his ideas; however pure his
          conception of the divinity might be, I do think that even Moses
          himself had not adequate views of the Godhead. He did not then know so
          much of God as he now has learned where he stands before the throne of
          the Most High. I believe that Moses knew that God is a Spirit. I think
          he must have been sensible that the mind of man can never conceive an
          idea of the incomprehensible Jehovah. He must have learned that the
          God of Mount Sinai, the King whose feet glowed like a furnace, and
          made the mountain smoke, could never be grasped by the senses of a
          mortal. Yet it is likely with all this knowledge, the great lawgiver
          had a vague and indistinct idea that it might be possible for divinity
          to be seen. My friends, it is hard for creatures encumbered with flesh
          and blood to gain a just conception of a spirit. We are so linked with
          the material, that the spiritual is above our reach. Surely then, if a
          mere spirit is above our comprehension, much more "the Father of
          Spirits, the Eternal, Immortal, Invisible."
        </p>
        <p>The poet sings most truly --</p>
        <p>"The more of wonderful</p>
        <p>Is heard in him, the more we should assent.</p>
        <p>Could we conceive him, God he could not be;</p>
        <p>Or he not God, or we could not be men.</p>
        <p>A God alone can comprehend a God."</p>
        <p>
          These eyes are but organs to convey to me the knowledge of material
          substances; they can not discern spirits; it is not their duty; it is
          beyond their province. Purer than celestial ether of the most refined
          nature; subtler than the secret power of electricity; infinitely above
          the most rarified forms of matter is the existence we call a spirit.
          As well might we expect to bind the winds with cords, or smite them
          with a sword, as to behold spirits with eyes which were only made to
          see gross solid materialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We find that Moses saw no similitude; no form passed before him. He
          had an audience; he had a vision; but it was an audience from behind a
          covering, and a vision, not of a person, but an attribute. Behold then
          the scene. There stands Moses about to be honored with visions of God.
          The Lord is about to answer thee. O Moses, God is come. Dost thou not
          tremble; do not thy knees knock together; are not thy bones loosened;
          are not thy sinews broken? Canst thou bear the thought of God coming
          to thee? O, I can picture Moses as he stood in that cleft of the rock
          with the hand of God before his eyes, and I can see him look as man
          never looked before, confident in faith, yet more than confounded at
          himself that he could have asked such a petition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what attribute is God about to show to Moses? His petition is,
          "Show me thy glory." Will he show him his justice? Will he show him
          his holiness? Will he show his wrath? Will he show him his power? Will
          he break yon cedar and show him he is almighty? Will he rend yonder
          mountain and show him that he can be angry? Will he bring his sins to
          remembrance, and show that he is omniscient? No; hear the still small
          voice -- "I will make all my goodness pass before thee." Ah! the
          goodness of God is God's glory. God's greatest glory is that he is
          good. The brightest gem in the crown of God is his goodness. "I will
          make all my goodness pass before thee." There is a panorama such as
          time would not be long enough for you to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the goodness of God in creation. Who could ever tell all
          God's goodness there? Why, every creek that runs up into the shore is
          full of it where the fry dance in the water. Why, every tree and every
          forest rings with it; where the feathered songsters sit and make their
          wings quiver with delight and ecstasy. Why, every atom of this air,
          which is dense with animalculae, is full of God's goodness. The cattle
          on a thousand hills he feeds; the ravens come and peck their food from
          his liberal hands. The fishes leap out of their element, and he
          supplies them; every insect is nourished by him. The lion roars in the
          forest for his prey, and he sendeth it to him. Ten thousand thousand
          creatures are all fed by him. Can you tell, then, what God's goodness
          is? If you knew all the myriad works of God, would your life be long
          enough to make all God's creative goodness pass before you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then think of his goodness to the children of men. Think how many of
          our race have come into this world and died. We are of yesterday, and
          we know nothing. Man is as a flower; he lives, he dies; he is the
          infant of a day, and he is gone to-morrow, but yet the Lord doth not
          forget him. O, my God! if thou shouldst make all thy goodness pass
          before me -- all thy goodness to the children of men -- I must sit me
          down on an adamantine rock forever and look throughout eternity; I
          should wear these eyes out, and must have eyes of fire, or else I
          should never be able to see all thy goodness toward the sons of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then rise higher still, and think of his sovereign goodness toward
          his chosen people. O, my soul, go thou back into eternity and see thy
          name in God's book of predestinating, unchanging grace! And then come
          down to the time of redemption, and see there thy Saviour bleeding and
          agonizing. O my soul, there were drops of goodness before, but O,
          rivers of goodness roll before thee now! When thou sawest the Son of
          God groaning, agonizing, shrieking, dying, buried in his grave, and
          then rising again, thou sawest the goodness of God. "I will make all
          my goodness pass before thee." I say again, what a panorama! What a
          series of dissolving views! What sight upon sight, each one melting
          into the other! Could I stand here this morning, and borrow the
          eloquence of an angel; could I speak to you as I might wish -- but,
          alas! I cannot break these bonds that hold my stammering tongue --
          could I loose these lips and speak as angels speak, then could I tell
          you something, but not much, of the goodness of God; for it is "past
          finding out." Since I cannot utter it myself, I would invoke all
          creation to be vocal in his praise. Ye hills, lift up your voices; let
          the shaggy woods upon your summits wave with adoration. Ye valleys,
          fill the air with the bleatings of your sheep and the lowing of your
          cattle. Ye that have life, if ye have voices, tune his praise; and if
          ye walk in silence, let your joyful motions show the thanks ye cannot
          speak. O, ye trees of the field, clap your hands; ye winds, in solemn
          harmony chant to his glory. Thou ocean, with thy myriad waves, in all
          thy solemn pomp, thy motion to and fro, forget not him who bids a
          thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain, and write no furrow on thy
          ever youthful brow. And you, ye storms, howl out his greatness; let
          your thunders roll like drums in the march of the God of armies; let
          your lightnings write his name in fire upon the midnight darkness; let
          the illimitable void of space become one mouth for song; and let the
          unnavigated ether, through its shoreless depths, bear through the
          infinite remote the name of him who is ever good and doeth good.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can say no more concerning God's goodness. But this is not all that
          Moses saw. If you look to the words which follow my text, you will see
          that God said, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee;" but
          there was something more. No one attribute of God sets God out to
          perfection; there must always be another. He said, "I will be gracious
          to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will snow
          mercy," there is another attribute of God. There is his sovereignty.
          God's goodness without his sovereignty does not completely set forth
          his nature. I think of the man who, when he was dying, called me to
          see him. He said, "I am going to heaven." "Well," I replied. "what
          makes you think you are going there, for you never thought of it
          before?" Said he, "God is good." "Yes." I answered. "but God is just."
          "No," said he, "God is merciful and good." Now that poor creature was
          dying, and being lost forever; for he had not a right conception of
          God. He had only one idea of God, that God is good; but that is not
          enough. If you only see one attribute you only have half a God. God is
          good, and he is a sovereign, and doeth what he pleases; and though
          good to all in the sense of benevolence, he is not obliged to be good
          to any. "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and show mercy
          on whom I will show mercy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not you be alarmed, my friends, because I am going to preach about
          sovereignty. I know some people, when they hear about sovereignty,
          say, "O, we are going to have some terrible high doctrine." Well, if
          it is in the Bible, that is enough for you. Is not that all you want
          to know? If God says, "I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
          and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy," it is not for you to
          say it is high doctrine. Who told you it was high doctrine? It is good
          doctrine. What right have you to call one doctrine high and one low?
          Would you like me to have a Bible with "H" against high, and "L"
          against low, so that I could leave the high doctrine out and please
          you? My Bible has no mark of that kind; it says, "I will be gracious
          to whom I will be gracious." There is divine sovereignty. I believe
          some are afraid to say any thing about this great doctrine lest they
          should offend some of their people; but. my friends, it is true, and
          you shall hear it. God is a sovereign. He was a sovereign ere he made
          this world. He lived alone, and this was in his mind: Shall I make any
          thing or shall I not? I have a right to make creatures or not to make
          any. He resolved that he would fashion a world. When he made it, he
          had a right to form the world in what shape and size he pleased; and
          he had a right, if he chose, to leave the globe untenanted by a single
          creature. When he had resolved to make man, he had a right to make him
          whatever kind of creature he liked. If he wished to make him a worm or
          a serpent, he had a right to do it. When he made him. he had a right
          to put any command on him that he pleased; and God had a right to say
          to Adam. Thou shalt not touch that forbidden tree. And when Adam
          offended, God had a right to punish him and all the race forever in
          the bottomless pit.
        </p>
        <p>
          God is so far sovereign, that he has a right, if he likes, to save any
          one in this chapel, or to crush all who are here. He has a right to
          take us all to heaven if he pleases, or to destroy us. He has a right
          to do just as he pleases with us. We are as much in his hands as
          prisoners in the hands of her majesty when they are condemned for a
          capital offense against the law of the land; yea, as much as clay in
          the hands of the potter. This is what he asserted, when he said, "I
          will be gracious to whom I will be gracious. and I will show mercy on
          whom I will show mercy." This stirs up your carnal pride, does it not?
          Men want to be somebody. They do not like to lie down before God, and
          have it preached to them that God can do just as he wills with them.
          Ah! you may hate it, but it is what the Scripture tells us. Surely it
          is self-evident that God may do as he will with his own. We all like
          to do what we will with our own property. God has said, that if you go
          to his throne he will hear you; but he has a right not to do it if he
          likes. He has a right to do just as he pleases. If he chooses to let
          you go on in the error of your ways, that is his right; and if he
          says, as he does, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
          and I will give you rest," it is his right to do so. That is the high
          and awful doctrine of DIVINE SOVEREIGNTY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the two together, goodness and sovereignty, and you see God's
          glory. If you take sovereignty alone, you will not understand God.
          Some people only have an idea of God's sovereignty, and not of his
          goodness; such are usually gloomy, harsh, and ill-humored. You must
          put the two together; that God is good, and that God is a sovereign.
          You must speak of sovereign grace. God is not grace alone, he is
          sovereign grace. He is not sovereign alone, but he is graciously
          sovereign. That is the best idea of God. When Moses said, "I beseech
          thee, show me thy glory," God made him see that he was glorious, and
          that his glory was his sovereign goodness. Surely, beloved, we cannot
          be wrong in loving the doctrine of free, unmerited, distinguishing
          grace, when we see it thus mentioned as the brightest jewel in the
          crown of our covenant God. Do not be afraid of election and
          sovereignty. The time is come when our ministers must tell us more
          about them; or, if not, our souls will be so lean and starved that we
          shall mutiny for the bread of life. O, may God send us more thorough
          gospel men who will preach sovereign grace as the glory of the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>II. The second point is -- there was A GRACIOUS CONCEALMENT.</p>
        <p>
          Read the next verse. "He said, thou canst not see my face; for there
          shall no man see me and live." There was a gracious concealment. There
          was as much grace in that concealment as there was in the
          manifestation. Mark you, beloved, when God does not tell us any thing,
          there is as much grace in his withholding it as there is in any of his
          revelations. Did you ever hear or read the sentiment, that there is as
          much to be learned from what is not in the Bible, as from what there
          is in the Bible? Some people read the Scriptures, and they say, "I
          wish I knew so-and-so." Now you ought not to wish such a thing; for if
          it was good for you, it would be there; and there is as much grace in
          what God has not put in the Bible, as in what he has put there. If he
          had put more in it, it would have been our destruction. There is just
          enough and no more. Do you know how Robert of Normandy lost his sight?
          His brother passed a red-hot copper bowl before his face, and burned
          the eyes out of their sockets; and there are some doctrines that men
          want to know, which, if they could understand them, it would be like
          passing a red-hot bowl before their eyes. They would scorch men's eyes
          out, and their understandings would be completely crushed. We have
          seen this in some ministers, who have studied so much that they have
          gone out of their minds. They have gone further than they ought to
          have ventured. There is a point to which we may go, and no further;
          and happy is the man who goes as near to it as possible without
          overstepping it. God said to Moses -- "Thou canst not see my face and
          live." There are two senses in which this is true. No man can see
          God's face as a sinner; and no man can see God's face even as a saint.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, no man can see God's face as a sinner. There comes a wretch
          before the throne of God. God has spread his books, and set his seat
          of judgment. There comes a man before the throne of God. Look at him!
          He is wearing a robe of his own righteousness. "Wretch, how comest
          thou in hither?" And the creature tries to look at God; he cries that
          he may live! But, no! God saith, "he cannot see my face and live."
          Thus saith the Judge. "Executioners of my vengeance, come forth!"
          Angels come with crowns on their brows; they grasp their swords and
          stand ready -- "Bind him hand and foot; cast him into the lake that
          burneth." The wretch is cast away into the fire of hell. He sees
          written in letters of fire -- "No man can see my face and live."
          Clothed in his own righteousness, he must perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, again, it is true that no man, even as a saint, can see God's
          face and live; not because of moral disability, but because of
          physical inability. The body is not strong enough to bear the sight or
          vision of God. I cannot tell whether even the saints in heaven see
          God. God dwells among them; but I do not know whether they ever behold
          him. That is a speculation. We can leave that till we get there. We
          will decide it when we get to heaven. I hardly know whether finite
          beings when immortalized would be capable of seeing God. This much is
          certain -- that on earth, no man, however holy, can ever see God's
          face, and yet live. Why, Manoah, when he saw an angel, thought he
          should die. He said -- "I have seen an angel of the Lord; I shall
          die." If you and I were to meet an angel, or a troop of angels, as
          Jacob did at Mahanaim, we should say -- "We shall die." The blaze of
          splendor would overwhelm us. We could not endure it. We "cannot see
          God and live." All that we can ever see of God, is what Moses called
          his "back parts." The words, I think, signify "regal train." You have
          seen kings have trains hanging behind them; and all that we can ever
          see of God is his train that floats behind. Yon sun that burns in the
          heavens with all his effulgence, you think he is bright; you look upon
          him, and he dazzles you; but all his splendor is but a single thread
          in the regal skirts of the robe of Deity. You have seen night wrapped
          in her sable mantle woven with gems and stars -- there they shine as
          ornaments worked by the needle of God in that brilliant piece of
          tapestry which is spread over our heads, like a tent for the
          inhabitants of the earth to dwell in: you have said, "O! how majestic!
          That star, that comet, that silver moon, How splendid!" They are
          nothing, but just a tiny portion of the skirts of God that drag in the
          dust. But what are the shoulders -- what the girdle of divinity --
          what the bracelets of Godhead -- what the crown that girdles his lofty
          brow, man cannot conceive; I could imagine that all the stars and
          constellations of stars might be put together and threaded into a
          string -- made into a bracelet for the arm, or a ring for the finger
          of Jehovah -- but I cannot conceive what God is himself. All I can
          ever learn -- all that the thunder ever spake -- all that the
          boistrous ocean ever could teach me -- all that the heaven above, or
          the earth beneath can ever open to my mind, is nothing but the "back
          parts" of God. I can never see; nor can I understand what he is.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now, beloved, we go to the third point; and that is THE GRACIOUS
          SHIELDING.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moses had to be put in the cleft of a rock before he could see God.
          There was a rock in the wilderness once; Moses smote it, and water
          gushed out. The apostle tells us "that Rock was Christ." Very well,
          Paul, I believe it was. There is another thing I believe -- I believe
          this rock was Christ. I know it was not Christ literally; but Moses
          stood on a literal rock. Moses stood on the top of a high mountain,
          hidden in the cleft of a real rock. But, O, my soul, what is the cleft
          of the rock where thou must stand; if thou wouldst ever see God's face
          and live. O, it is the "Rock of ages cleft for me," where I must hide
          my head! O, what a cleaving that was when Jesus died! O, my soul,
          enter into the hole in Jesus' side. That is the cleft of the rock
          where thou must abide and see God.
        </p>
        <p>"Till God in human flesh I see,</p>
        <p>My thoughts no comfort find;</p>
        <p>The holy, just, and sacred Three,</p>
        <p>Are terrors to my mind."</p>
        <p>
          But when I get into the cleft of that rock, O, my soul, when I get
          into that cleft whose massive roof is the well ordered everlasting
          covenant, whose solid golden floor is made of the solemn decrees of
          the predestination of the Most High; and whose sides are called Jachin
          and Boaz, that is establishment and strength, a cleft in a rock which
          is so enduring that time can never dissolve it. Precious Christ! may I
          be found in thee amid the concussion of the elements when the world
          shall melt away, and the heavens shall be dissolved! O, may I stand in
          thee, thou precious cleft of the Rock; thou art all-in-all to my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of you, I know, are in that cleft of the Rock. But let me ask
          others, where are you? Let it be a personal question. I have preached
          a long while about God; I have tried to mount the height of this great
          argument and speak of the wondrous things of God. I may have failed,
          but let me say to each of you -- Are you in that cleft of the rock?
          Can you sing this --
        </p>
        <p>"Jesus, thy blood and righteousness</p>
        <p>My beauty are, my glorious dress;</p>
        <p>'Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,</p>
        <p>With joy shall I lift up my head."</p>
        <p>
          In closing, I want one practical inference, and what shall it be? Draw
          it yourselves. Let it be this -- there is an hour coming, when we must
          all, in a certain sense, see God. We must see him as a Judge. It
          becomes us, then, to think seriously whether we shall stand in the
          cleft of the Rock when he comes. There is a passage we would mention
          before closing -- "I saw death on a pale horse, and hell followed
          him." There was death on the pale horse; and the original says --
          "hades followed him." You know the word hades comprises both heaven
          and hell. It means the state of spirits. Yes, death is after me and
          thee. Ah, run! run! run! but run as thou wilt, the rider on the white
          horse shall overtake thee. If thou canst escape him seventy years, he
          will overtake thee at last. Death is riding! Here his horse comes -- I
          hear his snortings, I feel his hot breath; he comes! he comes! and
          thou must die! BUT, WICKED MAN, WHAT COMES AFTERWARDS? Will it be
          heaven or hell? O, if it be hell that is after thee, where art thou
          when thou art cast away from God? Ah, I pray God deliver you from
          hell; he is coming after you, sure enough; and if you have no
          hiding-place. woe unto you. See you that cleft in the rock, see that
          cross, see that blood. There is security, and only there. Thy works
          are but a useless incumbrance; cast them away, and with all thy might
          flee to the mountain with
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing in my hands I bring,</p>
        <p>Simply to thy cross I cling."</p>
        <p>
          Yea, more than this, you will need divine aid, even in coming to
          Christ --
        </p>
        <p>"O, for this no strength have I,</p>
        <p>My strength is at thy feet to lie."</p>
        <p>
          But, poor helpless one, if thou art but hidden in Christ. all is
          secure. Storms may arise, but you cannot be overwhelmed; old Boreas
          may blow until his cheeks do burst, but not a breath of wind can
          injure you; for in the cleft of the Rock you shall be hidden until the
          vengeance is overpast.
