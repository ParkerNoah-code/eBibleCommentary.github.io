          1. And vain likewise are those who say that God came to those things
          which did not belong to Him, as if covetous of another's property; in
          order that He might deliver up that man who had been created by
          another, to that God who had neither made nor formed anything, but who
          also was deprived from the beginning of His own proper formation of
          men. The advent, therefore, of Him whom these men represent as coming
          to the things of others, was not righteous; nor did He truly redeem us
          by His own blood, if He did not really become man, restoring to His
          own handiwork what was said [of it] in the beginning, that man was
          made after the image and likeness of God; not snatching away by
          stratagem the property of another, but taking possession of His own in
          a righteous and gracious manner. As far as concerned the apostasy,
          indeed, He redeems us righteously from it by His own blood; but as
          regards us who have been redeemed, [He does this] graciously. For we
          have given nothing to Him previously, nor does He desire anything from
          us, as if He stood in need of it; but we do stand in need of
          fellowship with Him. And for this reason it was that He graciously
          poured Himself out, that He might gather us into the bosom of the
          Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. But vain in every respect are they who despise the entire
          dispensation of God, and disallow the salvation of the flesh, and
          treat with contempt its regeneration, maintaining that it is not
          capable of incorruption. But if this indeed do not attain salvation,
          then neither did the Lord redeem us with His blood, nor is the cup of
          the Eucharist the communion of His blood, nor the bread which we break
          the communion of His body. For blood can only come from veins and
          flesh, and whatsoever else makes up the substance of man, such as the
          Word of God was actually made. By His own blood he redeemed us, as
          also His apostle declares, "In whom we have redemption through His
          blood, even the remission of sins." And as we are His members, we are
          also nourished by means of the creation (and He Himself grants the
          creation to us, for He causes His sun to rise, and sends rain when He
          wills ). He has acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation)
          as His own blood, from which He bedews our blood; and the bread (also
          a part of the creation) He has established as His own body, from which
          He gives increase to our bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. When, therefore, the mingled cup and the manufactured bread
          receives the Word of God, and the Eucharist of the blood and the body
          of Christ is made, from which things the substance of our flesh is
          increased and supported, how can they affirm that the flesh is
          incapable of receiving the gift of God, which is life eternal, which
          [flesh] is nourished from the body and blood of the Lord, and is a
          member of Him? -- even as the blessed Paul declares in his Epistle to
          the Ephesians, that "we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of
          His bones." He does not speak these words of some spiritual and
          invisible man, for a spirit has not bones nor flesh; but [he refers
          to] that dispensation [by which the Lord became] an actual man,
          consisting of flesh, and nerves, and bones, -- that [flesh] which is
          nourished by the cup which is His blood, and receives increase from
          the bread which is His body. And just as a cutting from the vine
          planted in the ground fructifies in its season, or as a corn of wheat
          falling into the earth and becoming decomposed, rises with manifold
          increase by the Spirit of God, who contains all things, and then,
          through the wisdom of God, serves for the use of men, and having
          received the Word of God, becomes the Eucharist, which is the body and
          blood of Christ; so also our bodies, being nourished by it, and
          deposited in the earth, and suffering decomposition there, shall rise
          at their appointed time, the Word of God granting them resurrection to
          the glory of God, even the Father, who freely gives to this mortal
          immortality, and to this corruptible incorruption, because the
          strength of God is made perfect in weakness, in order that we may
          never become puffed up, as if we had life from ourselves, and exalted
          against God, our minds becoming ungrateful; but learning by experience
          that we possess eternal duration from the excelling power of this
          Being, not from our own nature, we may neither undervalue that glory
          which surrounds God as He is, nor be ignorant of our own nature, but
          that we may know what God can effect, and what benefits man receives,
          and thus never wander from the true comprehension of things as they
          are, that is, both with regard to God and with regard to man. And
          might it not be the case, perhaps, as I have already observed, that
          for this purpose God permitted our resolution into the common dust of
          mortality, that we, being instructed by every mode, may be accurate in
          all things for the future, being ignorant neither of God nor of
          ourselves?<br />
