          Sanadroug, being on the throne, raises troops with the help of the
          brave Pacradouni and Ardzrouni, who had exalted him, and goes to wage
          war upon the children of Abgar, to make him self master of the whole
          kingdom. Whilst Sanadroug was occupied with these affairs, as if by an
          effect of divine providence vengeance was taken for the death of
          Att√¶us; for a marble column which the son of Abgar was having erected
          at Edessa, on the summit of his palace, while he was underneath to
          direct the work, escaped from the hands of the workmen, fell upon him
          and crushed his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immediately there came a message from the inhabitants of the town,
          asking Sanadroug for a treaty by which he should engage not to disturb
          them in the exercise of the Christian religion, in consideration of
          which, they would give up the town and the king's treasures. Sanadroug
          promised, but in the end violated his oath. Sanadroug put all the
          children of the house of Abgar to the edge of the sword, with the
          exception of the daughters, whom he withdrew from the town to place
          them in the canton of Hachdiank. As to the first of Abgar's wives,
          named Helena, he sent her to his town at Kharan, and left to her the
          sovereignty of the whole of Mesopotamia, in remembrance of the
          benefits he had received from Abgar by Helena's means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helena, pious like her husband Abgar, did not wish to live in the
          midst of idolaters; she went away to Jerusalem in the time of
          Claudius, during the famine which Agabus had predicted; with all her
          treasures she bought in Egypt an immense quantity of corn, which she
          distributed amongst the poor, a fact to which Josephus testifies.
          Helena's tomb, a truly remarkable one, is still to be seen before the
          gate of Jerusalem.
