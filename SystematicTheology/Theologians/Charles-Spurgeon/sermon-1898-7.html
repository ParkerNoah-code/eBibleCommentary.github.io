          THE thirty years of peace which succeeded the Peace of Utrecht (1714),
          was the most prosperous season that England had ever experienced; and
          the progression, though slow, being uniform, the reign of George II.
          might not disadvantageously be compared for the real happiness of the
          community with that more brilliant, but uncertain and oscillatory
          condition which has ensued. A labourer's wages have never for many
          ages commanded so large a portion of subsistence as in this part of
          the 18th century.' (Hallam, Const. Hist. ii.464.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the aspect which that period of history wears to the political
          philosopher. The historian of moral and religious progress, on the
          other hand, is under the necessity of depicting the same period as one
          of decay of religion, licentiousness of morals, public corruption,
          profaneness of language -- a day of rebuke and blasphemy.' Even those
          who look with suspicion on the contemporary complaints from the
          Jacobite clergy of decay of religion' will not hesitate to say that it
          was an age destitute of depth or earnestness; an age whose poetry was
          without romance, whose philosophy was without insight, and whose
          public men were without character; an age of light without love,'
          whose very merits were of the earth, earthy.' In this estimate the
          followers of Mill and Carlyle will agree with those of Dr. Newman.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Stoical moralists of the second century who witnessed a similar
          coincidence of moral degradation and material welfare, had no
          difficulty in connecting them together as effect with cause. Bona
          rerum secundarum optabilia, adversarum mirabilia.' (Seneca, ad
          Lucil.66.) But the famous theory which satisfied the political
          philosophers of antiquity, viz., that the degeneracy of nations is due
          to the inroads of luxury, is laughed to scorn by modern economists. It
          is at any rate a theory which can hardly be adopted by those who pour
          unmeasured contempt on the 18th, by way of contrast with the revival
          of higher principles by the l9th century. It is especially since the
          High Church movement commenced that the theology of the 18th century
          has become a byeword. The genuine Anglican omits that period from the
          history of the Church altogether. In constructing his Catenæ Patrum he
          closes his list with Waterland or Brett, and leaps at once to 1833,
          when the Tracts for the Times commenced -- as Charles II. dated his
          reign from his father's death. Such a legal fiction may be harmless or
          useful for purposes of mere form, but the facts of history cannot be
          disposed of by forgetting them. Both the Church and the world of
          to-day are what they are as the result of the whole of their
          antecedents. The history of a party may be written on the theory of
          periodical occultation; but he who wishes to trace the descent of
          religious thought, and the practical working of the religious ideas,
          must follow these through all the phases they have actually assumed.
          We have not yet learnt, in this country, to write our ecclesiastical
          history on any better footing than that of praising up the party, in
          or out of the Church, to which we happen to belong. Still further are
          we from any attempt to apply the laws of thought, and of the
          succession of opinion, to the course of English theology. The
          recognition of the fact, that the view of the eternal verities of
          religion which prevails in any given age is in part determined by the
          view taken in the age which preceded it, is incompatible with the
          hypothesis generally prevalent among us as to the mode in which we
          form our notions of religious truth. Upon none of the prevailing
          theories as to this mode is a deductive history of theology
          possible.1. The Catholic theory, which is really that of
          Roman-Catholics, and professedly that of some Anglo-Catholics,
          withdraws Christianity altogether from human experience and the
          operation of the ordinary laws of thought.2. The Protestant theory of
          free inquiry, which supposes that each mind takes a survey of the
          evidence, and strikes the balance of probability according to the best
          of its judgment -- this theory, defers indeed to the abstract laws of
          logic, but overlooks the influences of education. If, without
          hypothesis, we are content to observe facts, we shall find that we
          cannot decline to study the opinions of any age only because they are
          not our own opinions. There is a law of continuity in the progress of
          theology which, whatever we may wish, is never broken off. In tracing
          the filiation of consecutive systems, we cannot afford to overlook any
          link in the chain, any age, except one in which religious opinion did
          not exist. Certainly we, in this our time, if we would understand our
          own position in the Church, and that of the Church in the age, if we
          would hold any clue through the maze of religious pretension which
          surrounds us, cannot neglect those immediate agencies in the
          production of the present, which had their origin towards the
          beginning of the 18th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of these agencies there are three, the present influence of which
          cannot escape the most inattentive.1. The formation and gradual growth
          of that compromise between Church and State, which is culled
          Toleration, and which, believed by many to be a principle, is a mere
          arrangement between two principles. But such as it is, it is part of
          our heritage from the last age, and is the foundation, if foundation
          it can be called, upon which we still continue to build, as in the
          late Act for the admission of the Jews to Parliament.2. The great
          rekindling of the religious consciousness of the people which, without
          the Established Church, became Methodism, and within its pale has
          obtained the name of the Evangelical movement. However decayed may be
          the Evangelical party as a party, it cannot be denied that its
          influence, both on our religious ideas, and on our church life, has
          penetrated far beyond those party limits.3. The growth and gradual
          illusion through all religious thinking of the supremacy of reason.
          This, which is rather a principle, or a mode of thinking, than a
          doctrine, may be properly enough called Rationalism. This term is used
          in this country with so much laxity that it is impossible to define
          the sense in which it is generally intended. But it is often taken to
          mean a system opposed to revealed religion imported into this country
          from Germany at the beginning of the present century. A person,
          however, who surveys the course of English theology during the
          eighteenth century will have no difficulty in recognising that
          throughout all discussions, underneath all controversies, and common
          to all parties, lies the assumption of the supremacy of reason in
          matters of religion. The Kantian Philosophy did but bring forward into
          light, and give scientific form and a recognised position to, a
          principle which had long unconsciously guided all treatment of
          religious topics both in Germany and in England. Rationalism was not
          an anti-Christian sect outside the Church making war against religion.
          It was a habit of thought ruling all minds, under the conditions of
          which all alike tried to make good the peculiar opinions they might
          happen to cherish. The Church-man differed from the Socinian, and the
          Socinian from the Deist, as to the number of articles in his creed;
          but all alike consented to test their belief by the rational evidence
          for it. Whether given doctrines or miracles were conformable to reason
          or not was disputed between the defence and the assault; but that all
          doctrines were to stand or fall by that criterion was not questioned.
          The principles and the priority of natural religion formed the common
          hypothesis on the ground of which the disputants argued whether
          anything, and what, had been subsequently communicated to man in a
          supernatural way. The line between those who believed much and those
          who believed little cannot be sharply drawn. Some of the so-called
          Deists were, in fact, Socinians; as Toland, who expressly admits all
          those parts of the New Testament revelation which are, or seem to him,
          comprehensible by reason. (Christianity not Mysterious.) Nor is there
          any ground for thinking that Toland was insincere in his profession of
          rational Christianity, as was insinuated by his opponents -- e.g.
          Leland. (View of the Deistical Writers, vol. i. p.49.) A more candid
          adversary, Leibnitz, who knew Toland personally, is glad to believe
          that the design of this author, a man of no common ability, and as I
          think, a well-disposed person, was to withdraw men from speculative
          theology to the practice of its precepts. (Annotatiunculæ subitaneæ.)
          Hardly one here and there, as Hume, professed Rationalism in the
          extent of Atheism; the great majority of writers were employed in
          constructing a via media between Atheism and Athanasianism, while the
          most orthodox were diligently hewing and chiselling Christianity into
          an intelligible human system, which they then represented, as thus
          mutilated, as affording a remarkable evidence of the truth of the
          Bible.' (Tracts for the Times, vol. ii. No.73.) The title of Locke's
          treatise, The Reasonableness of Christianity, may be said to have been
          the solitary thesis of Christian theology in England for great part of
          a century.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are to put chronological limits to this system of religious
          opinion in England, we might, for the sake of a convenient landmark,
          say that it came in with the Revolution of 1688 and began to decline
          in vigour with the reaction against the Reform movement about 1830.
          Locke's Reasonableness of Christianity would thus open, and the
          commencement of the Tracts for the Times mark the fall of Rationalism.
          Not that chronology can ever exactly applied to the mutations of
          opinion. For there were Rationalists before Locke, e.g. Hales of Eton,
          and other Arminians, nor has the Church of England unanimously adopted
          the principles of the Tracts for the Times. But if we were to follow
          up Cave's nomenclature, the appellation Seculum rationalisticum might
          be affixed to the eighteenth century with greater precision than many
          of his names apply to the previous centuries. For it was not merely
          that Rationalism then obtruded itself as a heresy, or obtained a
          footing of toleration within the Church, but the rationalizing method
          possessed itself absolutely of the whole field of theology. With some
          trifling exceptions, the whole of religious literature was drawn in to
          the endeavour to prove the truth' of Christianity. The essay and the
          sermon, the learned treatise and the philosophical disquisition,
          Addison the polite writer, and Bentley the classical philologian
          (Addison: Evidences of the Christian Religion, a posthumous
          publication. Bentley: Eight Sermons at Boyle's Lecture, 1692), the
          astronomer Newton (Four letters, &amp;c., Lond.1756), no less than the
          theologians by profession, were all engaged upon the same task. To one
          book of A. Collins, A Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the
          Christian Religion, Lond.1724, are counted no less than thirty-five
          answers. Dogmatic theology had ceased to exist; the exhibition of
          religious truth for practical purposes was confined to a few obscure
          writers. Every one who had anything to say on sacred subjects drilled
          it into an array of argument against a supposed objector. Christianity
          appeared made for nothing else but to be proved;' what use to make of
          it when it was proved was not much thought about. Reason was at first
          offered as the basis of faith, but gradually became its substitute.
          The mind never advanced as far as the stage of belief, for it was
          unceasingly engaged in reasoning up to it. The only quality in
          Scripture which was dwelt upon was its credibility.' Even the
          Evangelical' school, which had its origin in a reaction against the
          dominant Rationalism, and began in endeavours to kindle religious
          feeling, was obliged to succumb at last. It, too, drew out its
          rational scheme of Christianity,' in which the atonement was made the
          central point of a system, and the death of Christ was accounted for
          as necessary to satisfy the Divine Justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This whole rationalist age must again be subdivided into two periods,
          the theology of which, though belonging to the common type, has
          distinct specific characters. These periods are of nearly equal
          length, and we may conveniently take the middle year of the century,
          1750, as our terminus of division. Though both periods were engaged
          upon the proof of Christianity, the distinction between them is that
          the first period was chiefly devoted to the internal, the second to
          the external, attestations. In the first period the main endeavour was
          to show that there was nothing in the contents of the revelation which
          was not agreeable to reason. In the second, from 1750 onwards, the
          controversy was narrowed to what are usually called the Evidences,' or
          the historical proof of the genuineness and authenticity of the
          Christian records. From this distinction of topic arises an important
          difference of value between the theological produce of the two
          periods. A great injustice is done to the 18th century, when its whole
          speculative product is set down under the description of that Old
          Bailey theology in which, to use Johnson's illustration, the Apostles
          are being tried once a week for the capital crime of forgery. This
          evidential school -- the school of Lardner, Paley, and Whately --
          belongs strictly to the latter half only of the period now under
          consideration. This school, which treated the exterior evidence was
          the natural sequel and supplement of that which had preceded it, which
          dealt with the intrinsic credibility of the Christian revelation. This
          historical succession of the schools is the logical order of the
          argument. For when we have first shown that the facts of Christianity
          are not incredible, the whole burden of proof is shifted to the
          evidence that the facts did really occur. Neither branch of the
          argument can claim to be religious instruction at all, but the former
          does incidentally enter upon the substance of the Gospel. It may be
          philosophy rather than theology, but it raises in its course some of
          the most momentous problems which can engage the human mind. On the
          other hand, a mind which occupies itself with the external evidences'
          knows nothing of the spiritual intuition, of which it renounces at
          once the difficulties and the consolations. The supply of evidences in
          what for the sake of a name may be called the Georgian period
          (1750-1830), was not occasioned by any demands of controversy. The
          attacks through the press were nearly at an end, the Deists bad ceased
          to be. The clergy continued to manufacture evidence as an ingenious
          exercise, a literature which was avowedly professional, a study which
          might seem theology without being it, which could awaken none of the
          scepticism then dormant beneath the surface of society. Evidences are
          not edged tools; they stir no feeling; they were the proper theology
          of an age, whose literature consisted in writing Latin hexameters. The
          orthodox school no longer dared to scrutinize the contents of
          revelation. The preceding period had eliminated the religious
          experience, the Georgian had lost besides, the power of using the
          speculative reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The historical investigation, indeed, of the Origenes of Christianity
          is a study scarcely second in importance to a philosophical
          arrangement of its doctrines. But for a genuine inquiry of this nature
          the English writers of the period had neither the taste nor the
          knowledge. Gibbon alone approached the true difficulties, but met only
          with opponents victory over whom was a sufficient humiliation.'
          (Autobiography.) No Englishman will refuse to join with Coleridge in
          the admiration' he expresses for the head and heart' of Paley, the
          incomparable grace, propriety, and persuasive facility of his
          writings.' (Aids to Reflection, p.401.) But Paley had unfortunately
          dedicated his powers to a factitious thesis; his demonstration,
          however perfect, is in unreal matter. The case, as the apologists of
          that day stated it, is wholly conventional. The breadth of their
          assumptions is out of all proportion to the narrow dimensions of the
          point they succeed in proving. Of an honest critical enquiry into the
          origin and composition of the canonical writings there is but one
          trace, Herbert Marsh's Lectures at Cambridge, and that was suggested
          from a foreign source, and died away without exciting imitators. That
          investigation, introduced by a bishop and a professor of divinity, has
          scarcely yet obtained a footing in the English Church. But it is
          excluded, not from a conviction of its barrenness, but from a fear
          that it might prove too fertile in results. This unwholesome state of
          theological feeling among us, is perhaps traceable in part to the
          falsetto of the evidential method of the last generation. We cannot
          justify, but we may perhaps make our predecessors bear part of the
          blame of, that inconsistency, which while it professes that its
          religious belief rests on historical evidence, refuses to allow that
          evidence to be freely examined in open court.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems, indeed, a singular infelicity that the construction of the
          historical proof should have been the task which the course of events
          allotted to the latter half of the 18th century. The critical
          knowledge of antiquity had disappeared from the Universities. The
          past, discredited by a false conservatism, was regarded with aversion,
          and the minds of men directed habitually to future, some with fear,
          others with hope. The disrespect in which history was held by the
          French philosophes is notorious; one of the soberest of them,
          D'Alembert, we believe, was the author of the wish that all record of
          past events could be blotted out.' (Mill, Dissertations, vol. i.
          p.426.) The same sentiment was prevalent, though not in the same
          degree, in this country. Hume writing to an Englishman in 1756, speaks
          of your countrymen' as given over to barbarous and absurd faction.' Of
          his own history the publisher, Millar, told him he had only sold
          forty-five copies in a twelvemonth. (My Own Life, p.5.) Warburton had
          long before complained of the Chronicles published by Hearne that
          there is not one that is not a disgrace to letters; most of them are
          so to common sense, and some even to human nature.' (Parr's Tracts,
          &amp;c., p.109.) The oblivion into which the remains of Christian
          antiquity had sunk, till disinterred by the Tractarian movement, is
          well known. Having neither the critical tools to work with, nor the
          historical materials to work upon, it is no wonder if they failed in
          their art. Theology had almost died out when it received a new impulse
          and a new direction from Coleridge. The evidence-makers ceased from
          their futile labours all at once, as beneath the spell of some
          magician. Englishmen heard with as much surprise as if the doctrine
          was new, that the Christian faith, the Athanasian Creed, of which they
          had come to wish that the Church was well rid, was the perfection of
          human intelligence;' that, the compatibility of a document with the
          conclusions of self-evident reason, and with the laws of conscience,
          is a condition a priori of any evidence adequate to the proof of its
          having been revealed by God' and that this is a principle clearly laid
          down by Moses and St. Paul;' lastly, that there are mysteries in
          Christianity, but that these mysteries are reason, reason in its
          highest form of self-affirmation.' (Aids to Reflection, pref. Lit.
          Remains, iii.293.) In this position of Coleridge, the rationalist
          theology of England, which was in the last stage of decay and dotage,
          seemed to recover a second youth, and to revert at once to the point
          from which it had started a century before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should the religious historian then acknowledge that the impatient
          contempt with which the last century' is now spoken of, is justifiable
          with respect to the later period, with its artificial monotone of
          proof that is no proof, he will by no means allow the same of the
          earlier period 1688-1750. The superiority which the theological
          writing of this period has over that which succeeded it, is to be
          referred in part to the superiority of the internal, over the
          external, proof of Christianity, as an object of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both methods alike, as methods of argumentative proof, place the mind
          in an unfavourable attitude for the consideration of religious truth.
          It is like removing ourselves for the purpose of examining an object
          to the furthest point from which the object is visible. Neither the
          external nor the internal evidences are properly theology at all.
          Theology is -- 1st, and primarily, the contemplative, speculative
          habit, by means of which the mind places itself already in another
          world than this; a habit begun here, to be raised to perfect vision
          hereafter.2ndly, and in an inferior degree, it is ethical and
          regulative of our conduct as men, in those relations which are
          temporal and transitory. Argumentative proof that such knowledge is
          possible can never be substituted for the knowledge without detriment
          to the mental habit. What is true of an individual is true of an age.
          When an age is found occupied in proving its creed, this is but a
          token that the age has ceased to have a proper belief in it
          Nevertheless, there is a difference in this respect between the
          sources from which proof may be fetched. Where it is busied in
          establishing the genuineness and authenticity' of the books of
          Scripture, neglecting its religious lessons, and drawing out instead
          the undesigned coincidences,' Rationalism is seen in its dullest and
          least spiritual form. When, on the other hand, the contents of the
          Revelation are being freely examined, and reason as it is called, but
          really the philosophy in vogue, is being applied to determine whether
          the voice be the voice of God or not, the reasoner is indeed
          approaching his subject from a false point of view, but he is still
          engaged with the eternal verities. The reason has prescribed itself an
          impossible task when it has undertaken to prove, instead of evolve
          them; to argue instead of appropriate them. But anyhow, it is handling
          them; and by the contact is raised in some measure to the height of
          that great argument.'
        </p>

          This acknowledgment seems due to the period now referred to. It is,
          perhaps, rather thinking of its pulpit eloquence than its
          controversies, that Professor Fraser does not hesitate to call this
          the golden age of English theology.' (Essays in Philosophy, p.205.)
          Such language, as applied to our great preachers, was once matter of
          course, but would now hardly be used by any Anglican, and has to be
          sought for in the mouth of members of another communion. The names
          which once commanded universal homage among us -- the Souths, Barrows,
          Tillotsons, Sherlocks, -- excite, perhaps, only a smile of pity.
          Literary taste is proverbially inconstant; but theological is still
          more so, for here we have no rule or chart to guide us but the taste
          of our age. Boussuet, Bourdaloue, and Massillon have survived a dozen
          political revoltions. We have no classical theology, though we have
          not had a political revolution since 1660. For in this subject matter
          the most of Englishmen have no other standard of merit than the
          prejudices of sect. Eminence only marks out a great man for more
          cordial hatred; every flippant High Church reviewer has learnt to
          fling at Locke, the father of English Rationalism, and the greatest
          name among its worthies. Others are, perhaps, only less disliked
          because less known; qui n'a pas de lecteurs, n'a pas d'adversaires.'
          The principal writers in the Deistical Controversy, either side of it,
          have expiated the attention they once engrossed by as universal an
          oblivion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Deistical Controversy, the all-absorbing topic of religious
          writers and preachers during the whole of this first period, has
          pretty well-defined limits. Stillingfleet, who died Bishop of
          Worcester in the last year (1699) of the seventeenth century, marks
          the transition from the old to the new argument. In the six folios of
          Stillingfleet's works may be found the latest echoes of the Romanist
          Controversy, and the first declaration of war against Locke. The
          Deistical Controversy attained its greatest intensity in the twenties
          (1720-1740), after the subsidence of the Bangorian controversy, which
          for a time had diverted attention to itself, and it gradually died out
          towards the middle of the century. The decay of interest in the topic
          is sufficiently marked by the fact that the opinions of Hume failed to
          stimulate curiosity or antagonism. His Treatise of Human Nature (1739)
          fell dead-born from the press,' and the only one of his philosophical
          writings which was received with favour on its first appearance was
          one on the new topic -- Political Discourses (1752). Of this he says
          it was the only work of mine which was successful on the first
          publication, being well received both abroad and at home.' (My Own
          Life.) Bolingbroke, who died in 1751, was the last of the professed
          Deists. When his works were brought out by his executor, Mallet, in
          1754, the interest in them was already gone; they found the public
          cold or indisposed. It was a rusty blunderbuss, which he need not have
          been afraid to have discharged himself, instead of leaving
          half-a-crown to a Scotchman to let it off after his death.' (Boswell,
          p.88.) To talk Deism had ceased to be fashionable as soon as it ceased
          to attract attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rationalism, which is the common character of all the writers of
          this time, is a method rather than a doctrine; an unconscious
          assumption rather than a principle from which they reason. They would,
          however, all have consented in statements such as the following: Bp.
          Gibson, Second Pastoral Letter, 1730. Those among us who have laboured
          of late years to set up reason against revelation would make it pass
          for an established truth, that if you will embrace revelation you must
          of course quit your reason, which, if it were true, would doubtless be
          a strong prejudice against revelation. But so far is this from being
          true, that it is universally acknowledged that revelation itself is to
          stand or fall by the test of reason, or, in other words, according as
          reason finds the evidences of its coming from God to be or not to be
          sufficient and conclusive, and the matter of it to contradict or not
          contradict the natural notions which reason gives us of the being and
          attributes of God.'

          Prideaux (Humphrey, Dean of Norwich), Letter to the Deists, 1748. Let
          what is written in all the books of the N. T. be tried by that which
          is the touchstone of all religions, I mean that religion of nature and
          reason which God has written in the hearts of every one of us from the
          first creation; and if it varies from it in any one particular, if it
          prescribes any one thing which may in the minutest circumstances
          thereof be contrary to its righteousness, I will then acknowledge this
          to be an argument against us, strong enough to overthrow the whole
          cause, and make all things else that can be said for it totally
          ineffectual for its support.

          Tillotson (Archbishop of Canterbury), Sermons, vol. iii. p.485. All
          our reasonings about revelation are necessarily gathered by our
          natural notions about religion, and therefore he who sincerely desires
          to do the will of God is not apt to be imposed on by vain pretences of
          divine revelation; but if any doctrine be proposed to him which is
          pretended to come from God, he measures it by those sure and steady
          notions which he has of the divine nature and perfections; he will
          consider the nature and tendency of it, or whether it be a doctrine
          according to godliness, such as is agreeable to the divine nature and
          perfections, and tends to make us like unto God; if it be not, though
          an angel should bring it, he would not receive it.'

          trial, and hopes to approve itself to the conviction of any equitable

          if in revelation there be found any passages, the seeming meaning of
          which is contrary to natural religion, we may most certainly conclude
          such seeming meaning not to be the real one.' Ibid., ch.8: I have
          argued upon the principles of the fatalists, which I do not believe;
          and have omitted a thing of the utmost importance which I do believe:
          the moral fitness and unfitness of actions, prior to all will
          whatever, which I apprehend as certainly to determine the divine
          conduct, as speculative truth and falsehood necessarily determine the
          divine judgment.'

          To the same elect the leading preacher among the Dissenters, James
          Foster, Truth and Excellency of the Christian Revelation, 1731. The
          faculty of reason which God hath implanted in mankind, however it may
          have been abused and neglected in times past, will, whenever they
          begin to exercise it aright, enable them to judge of all these things.
          As by means of this they were capable of discovering at first the
          being and perfections of God, and that he governs the world with
          absolute wisdom, equity, and goodness, and what those duties are which
          they owe to him and to one another, they must be as capable, if they
          will divest themselves of prejudice, and reason impartially, of
          rectifying any mistakes they may have fallen into about these
          important points. It matters not whether they have hitherto thought
          right or wrong, nor indeed whether they have thought at all; let them
          but begin to consider seriously and examine carefully and impartially,
          and they must be able to find out all those truths which as reasonable
          creatures they are capable of knowing, and which affect their duty and
          happiness.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Warburton, displaying at once his disdain and his ignorance
          of catholic theology, affirms on his own authority, Works iii. p.620,
          that the image of God in which man was at first created, lay in the
          faculty of reason only.'
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is needless to multiply quotations. The received theology of
          the day taught on this point the doctrine of Locke, as clearly stated
          by himself. (Essay, B. iv. ch.19. § 4.) Reason is natural revelation,
          whereby the eternal Father of light and fountain of all knowledge
          communicates to mankind that portion of truth which he has laid within
          the reach of their natural faculties; revelation is natural reason
          enlarged by a new set of discoveries communicated by God immediately,
          which reason vouches the truth of, by the testimony and proofs it
          gives, that they come from God. So that he that takes away reason to
          make way for revelation, puts out the light of both, and does
          much-what the same as if he would persuade a man to put out his eyes
          the better to receive the remote light of an Invisible star by a
          telescope.'
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this assumption, a man's religious belief is a result
          which issues at the end of an intellectual process. In arranging the
          steps of this process, they conceived natural religion to form the
          first stage of the journey. That stage theologians of all shades and
          parties travelled in company. It only when they had reached the end of
          it that the Deists and the Christian apologists parted. The former
          found that the light of reason which had guided them so far indicated
          no road beyond. The Christian writers declared that the same natural
          powers enabled them to recognise the truth of revealed religion. The
          sufficiency of natural religion thus became the turning point of the
          dispute. The natural law of right and duty, argued the Deists, is so
          absolutely perfect that God could not add anything to it. It is
          commensurate with all the real relations in which man stands. To
          suppose that God has created artificial relations, and laid upon man
          positive precepts, is to take away the very notion of morality. The
          moral law is nothing but the conditions of our actual being, apparent
          alike to those of the meanest and of the highest capacity. It is
          inconsistent with this to suppose that God has gone on to enact
          arbitrary statutes, and to declare them to man in an obscure and
          uncertain light. This was the ground taken by the great champion of
          Deism -- Tindal, and expressed in the title of the treatise which he
          published in 1732, when upwards of seventy, Christianity as old as the
          Creation; or, the Gospel a Republication of the Religion of Nature.
          This was the point which the Christian defenders laboured most, to
          construct the bridge which should unite the revealed to the natural.
          They never demur to making the Natural the basis on which the
          Christian rests, to considering the natural knowledge of God as the
          starting point both of the individual mind and of the human race. This
          assumption is necessary to their scheme, in which revelation is an
          argument addressed to the reason. Christianity is a résumé of the
          knowledge of God already attained by reason, and a disclosure of
          further truths. These further truths could not have been thought out
          by reason; but when divinely communicated, they approve themselves to
          the same reason which has already put us in possession of so much. The
          new truths are not of another order of ideas, for Christianity is a
          particular scheme under the general plan of Providence,' (Analogy,
          pt.2, ch.4) and the whole scheme is of a piece and uniform. If the
          dispensation be indeed from God, all the parts of it will he seen to
          be the correspondent members of one entire whole, which orderly
          disposition of things essential to a religious system will assure us
          of the true theory of the Christian faith.' (Warburton, Divine
          Legation, &amp;c., B. ix. Introd. Works, vol. iii. p.600.) How these
          relations are made known, whether by reason or revelation, makes no
          alteration in the case, because the duties arise out of the relations
          themselves, not out of the manner in which we are informed of them.
          (Analogy, pt.2, ch.1.) Those very articles of belief and duties of
          obedience, which were formerly natural with respect to their manner of
          promulgation, are now in the declaration of them also supernatural.'
          (Ferguson, Reason in Religion, 1675, p.29.) The relations to the
          Redeemer and the Sanctifier are not artificial, but as real as those
          to the Maker and Preserver, and the obligations arising out of the one
          set of relations as natural as those arising out of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deference paid to natural religion is farther seen in the attempts
          to establish a priori the necessity of a revelation. To make this out
          it was requisite to show that the knowledge with which reason could
          supply us was inadequate to be the guide of life, yet reason must not
          be too much depressed, inasmuch as it was needed for the proof of
          Christianity. On the one hand, the moral state of the heathen world
          prior to the preaching of Christianity, and of Pagan and savage tribes
          in Africa and America now, the superstitions of the most civilized
          nations of antiquity, the intellectual follies of the wisest
          philosophers, are exhibited in great detail. The usual arguments of
          scepticism on the conscious weakness of reason are brought forward,
          but not pushed very far. Reason is to be humiliated so far as that
          supernatural light shall be seen to be necessary, but it must retain
          its competence to judge of the evidence of this supernatural message.
          Natural religion is insufficient as a light, and a motive to show us
          our way and to make us walk in it; it is sufficient as a light, and a
          motive to lead us to revelation, and to induce us to embrace it. How
          much of religious truth was contained in natural knowledge, or how
          much was due to supernatural communication, was very variously
          estimated. Locke, especially, had warned against our liability to
          attribute to reason much of moral truth that had in fact been derived
          from revelation. But the uncertainty of the demarcation between the
          two is only additional proof of the identity of the scheme which they
          disclose between them. The whole of God's government and dealings with
          man form one wide-spread and consistent scheme, of which natural
          reason apprehends a part, and of which Christianity was the
          manifestation of a further part. Consistently herewith they treated
          natural religion, not as an historical dispensation, but as an
          abstract demonstration. There never was a time when mankind had
          realized or established an actual system of natural religion, but it
          lies always potentially in his reason. It held the same place as the
          social contract in political history. The original contract' had never
          had historical existence, but it was a hypothesis necessary to explain
          the existing fact of society. No society had, in fact, arisen on that
          basis, yet it is the theoretical basis on which all society can be
          shown to rest. So there was no time or country where the religion of
          nature had been fully known, yet the knowledge of God is the only
          foundation in the human mind on which can be built a rational
          Christianity. Though not an original condition of any part of mankind,
          it is an ever-originating condition of every human mind, as soon as it
          begins to reason on the facts of religion, rendering all the moral
          phenomena available for the construction of a scientific theory of
          religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with this view they interpreted the passages in St. Paul
          which speak of the religion of the heathen; e.g., Rom. ii.14. Since
          the time of Augustine (De Spir. et Lit. § 27) the orthodox
          interpretation had applied this verse, either to the Gentile converts,
          or to the favoured few among the heathen who had extraordinary divine
          assistance. The Protestant expositors, to whom the words do by nature
          the things contained in the law,' could never bear their literal
          force, sedulously preserved the Augustinian explanation. Even the
          Pelagian Jeremy, Taylor is obliged to gloss the phrase by nature,'
          thus: By fears and secret opinions which the Spirit of God who is
          never wanting to men in things necessary was pleased to put into the
          hearts of men. (Duct. Dubit. B. ii. ch.1, § 3.) The rationalists,
          however, find the expression by nature' in its literal sense exactly
          conformable to their own views, (Wilkins, Of Nat. Rel. ii. c.9) and
          have no difficulty even in supposing the acceptableness of these
          works, and the salvability of those who do them. Burnet on Art.
          xviii., in his usual confused style of eclecticism, suggests both
          opinions without seeming to see that they are incompatible relics of
          divergent schools of doctrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequent with such a theory of religion was their notion of its
          practical bearings. Christianity was a republication of the moral law
          -- a republication rendered necessary by the helpless state of moral
          debasement into which the world was come by the practice of vice. The
          experience of ages had proved that, though our duty might be
          discoverable by the light of nature, yet virtue was not able to
          maintain itself in the world without additional sanctions. The
          disinterestedness of virtue was here a point much debated. The Deists,
          in general, argued from the notion of morality, that so far as any
          private regard to my own interest, whether present or future,
          influenced my conduct, so far my actions had no moral worth. From this
          they drew the inference that the rewards and punishments of
          Christianity -- these additional sanctions -- could not be a divine
          ordinance, inasmuch as they were subversive of morality. The orthodox
          writers had to maintain the theory of rewards and punishments in such
          a way as not to be inconsistent with the theory of the
          disinterestedness of virtue which they had made part of their
          theology. Even here no precise line can be drawn between the Deistical
          and the Christian moralists. For we find Shaftesbury placing in a very
          clear light the mode in which religious sanctions do, in fact, as
          society is constituted, support and strengthen virtue in the world,
          though he does not deny that the principle of virtue in the individual
          may suffer from the selfish passion being appealed to by the hope of
          reward or the fear of punishment. (Characteristicks, vol. ii. p.66.)
          But with whatever variation in individual disputants, the tone of the
          discussions is unmistakeable. When Collins was asked, Why he was
          careful to make his servants go to Church?' he is said to have
          answered, I do it that they may neither rob nor murder me.' This is
          but an exaggerated form of the practical religion of the age.
          Tillotson's Sermon (Works, vol. iii. p.43) On the Advantages of
          Religion to Societies;' is like Collins' reply at fuller length. The
          Deists and their opponents alike assume that the purpose of the
          supernatural interference of the Deity in revelation must have been to
          secure the good behaviour of man in this that the future life and our
          knowledge of it may be a means to this great end; that the next world,
          if it exist at all, bears that relation to the present. We are chiefly
          familiar with these views from their having been long the butt of the
          Evangelical pulpit, a chief topic in which was to decry the mere
          legal' preaching of a preceding age. To abstain from vice, to
          cultivate virtue, to fill our station in life with propriety, to bear
          the ills of life with resignation, and to use its pleasures moderately
          -- these things are indeed not little; perhaps no one can name in his
          circle of friends a man whom he thinks equal to these demands. Yet the
          experience of the last age has shown us unmistakeably that where this
          is our best ideal of life, whether, with the Deists, we establish the
          obligation of morality on independent' grounds; or, with the orthodox,
          add he religious sanction -- in Mr. Mill's rather startling mode of
          putting it (Dissertations, vol. ii. p.436), Because God is stronger
          than we, and able to damn us if we don't' -- it argues a sleek and
          sordid epicurism, in which religion and a good conscience have their
          place among the means by which life is to be made comfortable. To
          accuse the divines of this age of a leaning to Arminianism is quite
          beside the mark. They did not intend to be other than orthodox. They
          did not take the Arminian side rather than the Calvinistic in the old
          conflict or concordat between Faith and Works, between Justification
          and Sanctification. They had dropt the terminology, and with it the
          mode of thinking, which the terms implied. They had adopted the
          language and ideas of the moralists. They spoke not of sin, but of
          vice, and of virtue, not of works. In the old Protestant theology
          actions had only a certain exterior relation to the justified man;
          gute fromme Werke machen nimmermehr einen guten frommen Mann sondern
          ein guter frommer Mann macht gute Werke.' (Luther.) Now, our conduct
          was thought of, not as a product or efflux of our character, but as
          regulated by our understanding; by a perception of relations, or a
          calculation of consequences. This intellectual perception of
          regulative truth is religions Faith. Faith is no longer the devout
          condition of the entire inner man. Its dynamic nature, and interior
          working, are not denied, but they are unknown; and religion is made to
          regulate life from without, though the logical proof of the being and
          attributes of God, upon which an obligation to obey him can be raised.

          The preachers of any period are not to be censured for adapting their
          style of address and mode of arguing to their hearers. They are as
          necessarily bound to the preconceived notions, as to the language, of
          those whom they have to exhort. The pulpit does not mould the forms
          into which religious thought in any age runs, it simply accommodates
          itself to those that exist. For this very reason, because they must
          follow and cannot lead, sermons are the surest index of the prevailing
          religious feeling of their age. When we are reminded of the powerful
          influence of the pulpit at the Reformation, in the time of the Long
          Parliament, or at the Methodist revival, it must also be remembered
          that these preachers addressed a different class of society from that
          for which our classical pulpit oratory was written. If it could be
          said that Sherlock, Hare, and Gibson preach in vain,' it was because
          the populace were gone to hear mad Henley on his tub. To charge
          Tillotson or Foster with not moving the masses which Whitefield moved,
          is to charge them with not having preached to another congregation
          than that to which they had to preach. Nor did they preach to empty
          pews, though their carefully-written discourses' could never produce
          effects such as are recorded of Burnet's extempore addresses, when he
          was often interrupted by the deep hum of his audience, and when, after
          preaching out the hour-glass, he held it up in his hand, the
          congregation clamorously encouraged him to go on till the sand had run
          off once more.' (Macaulay, vol. ii. p.177.). The dramatic oratory of
          Whitefield could not have sustained its power over the same auditors;
          he had a fresh congregation every Sunday. And in the judgment of one
          quite disposed to do justice to Whitefield there is nothing in his
          sermons such as are printed. Johnson (ap. Boswell) speaking of the
          comparisons drawn between the preaching in the Church and that of the
          Methodists to the disadvantage of the former, says, I never treated
          Whitefield's ministry with contempt; I believe he did good. But when
          familiarity and noise claim the praise due to knowledge, art, and
          elegance, we must beat down such pretensions.' It is, however, the
          substance, and not the manner, of the classical sermons of the
          eighteenth century which is meant, when they are complained of as cold
          and barren. From this accusation they cannot be vindicated. But let it
          be rightly understood that it is a charge not against the preachers
          but against the religious ideas of the period. In the pulpit, the
          speaker has no choice but to take his audience as he finds them. He
          can but draw them on to the conclusions already involved in their
          premises. He cannot supply them with a new set of principles, and
          alter their fixed forms of thought. The ideas out of which the
          Protestant or the Puritan movement proceeded were generated elsewhere
          than in the pulpit.

          The Rationalist preachers of the eighteenth century are usually
          contrasted with the Evangelical pulpit which displaced them. Mr. Neale
          has compared them disadvantageously with the mediæval preachers in
          respect of Scripture knowledge. He selects a sermon of the eighteenth
          and one of the twelfth century; the one by the well-known Evangelical
          preacher John Newton, Rector of St. Mary Woolnoth; the other by
          Guarric, Abbot of Igniac. In Newton's sermon we find nine references
          to the Gospels, two to the Epistles, nine to the Prophets, one to the
          Psalms, and none to any other part of Scripture. In the sermon of
          Guarric we find seven references to the Gospels, one to the Epistles,
          twenty-two to the Psalms, nine to the Prophets, and eighteen to other
          parts of Scripture. Thus the total number of quotations made by the
          Evangelical preacher is twenty-one, by Guarric fifty-seven, and this
          in sermons of about equal length.' (Mediæval Preaching, Introd. xxvi.)
          Mr. Neale has, perhaps, not been fortunate in his selection of a
          specimen sermon. For having the curiosity to apply this childish test
          to a sermon of John Blair, taken at random out of his four volumes, I
          found the number of texts quoted thirty-seven. But, passing this by
          Mr. Neale misses his inference. He means to show how much more
          Scripture knowledge was possessed by the preachers of the dark ages.'
          This is very likely, if familiarity with the mere words of the Vulgate
          version be Scripture knowledge. But it is not proved by the abstinence
          of the eighteenth century preacher from the use of Biblical
          phraseology. The fact, so far as it is one, only shows that our
          divines understood Scripture differently, some will say better, than
          the Middle Age ecclesiastic. The latter had, in the mystical theology
          of the Christian Church, a rich store of religious sentiment, which it
          was an exercise of their ingenuity to find in the poetical books of
          the Hebrew canon. Great part of this fanciful allegorizing is lost,
          apart from the Vulgate translation. But of this the more learned of
          them were quite aware, and on their theory of Scripture
          interpretation, according to which the Church was its guaranteed
          expositor, the verbal meanings of the Latin version were equally the
          inspired sense of the sacred record. It was otherwise with the English
          divine of the eighteenth century. According to the then received view
          of Scripture, its meaning was not assigned by the Church, but its
          language was interpreted by criticism -- i.e., by reason. The aids of
          history, the ordinary rules of grammar and logic, were applied to find
          out what the sacred writers actually said. That was the meaning of
          Scripture, the message supernaturally communicated. Where each text of
          Scripture has but one sense, that sense in which the writer penned it,
          can only be cited in that sense without doing it violence. This was
          the turn by which Selden so discomfited the Puritan divines, who, like
          the Catholic mystics, made Scripture words the vehicle of their own
          feelings. Perhaps in your little pocket Bibles with gilt leaves the
          translation may be thus, but the Greek or Hebrew signifies otherwise.'
          (Whitelocke, Johnson's Life of Selden, p, 303.) If the preacher in the
          eighteenth century had allowed himself to make these allusions, the
          taste of his audience would have rejected them. He would have weakened
          his argument instead of giving it effect.

          No quality of these Discourses' strikes us more now than the good
          sense which pervades them. They are the complete reaction against the
          Puritan sermon of the 17th century. We have nothing far-fetched,
          fanciful, allegoric. The practice of our duty is recommended to us on
          the most undeniable grounds of prudence. Barrow had indulged in
          ambitious periods, and South had been jocular. Neither of these faults
          can be alleged against the model sermon of the Hanoverian period. No
          topic is produced which does not compel our assent as soon as it is
          understood, and none is there which is not understood as soon as
          uttered. It is one man of the world speaking to another. Collins said
          of St. Paul, that he had a great respect for him as both a man of
          sense and a gentleman.' He might have said the same of the best pulpit
          divines of his own time. They bear the closest resemblance to each
          other, because they all use the language of fashionable society, and
          say exactly the proper thing. A person,' says Waterland, must have
          come knowledge of men, besides that of books to succeed well here; and
          must have a kind of practical sagacity which nothing but the grace of
          God joined with recollection and wise observation can bring, to be
          able to represent truths to the life, or to any considerable degree of
          advantage.' This is from his recommendatory preface prefixed an
          edition of Blair's Sermons (1739); not the Presbyterian Dr. Hugh
          Blair, but John Blair, the founder and first President of a Missionary
          College in Virginia, whose Sermons on the Beatitudes' were among the
          most approved models of the day, and recommended by the bishops to
          their candidates for orders. Dr Hugh Blair's Sermons, which Johnson
          thought excellently written, both as to doctrine and language,' (ap.
          Boswell, p.528), are in a different taste -- that of the latter half
          of the century, when solid and sensible reasoning was superseded by
          polished periods and flowery rhetoric. Polished as marble,' says Hugh
          J. Rose, but also as lifeless and as cold.' The sermons which
          Waterland recommends to young students of divinity comprise Tillotson,
          Sharp, Calamy, Sprat, Blackhall, Hoadly, South, Claggett, and
          Atterbury. Of these, Sharp's, Calamy's, and Blackhall's are the best
          models for an easy, natural, and familiar way of writing. Sprat is
          fine, florid and elaborate in his style, artful in his method, and not
          so open as the former, but harder to be imitated. Hoadly is very exact
          and judicious, and both his sense and style just, close, and clear.
          The others are very sound, clear writers, only Scot is too swelling
          and pompous, and South is something too full of wit and satire, and
          does not always observe a decorum in his style.' He advises the
          student to begin his divinity course with reading sermons, because
          they are the easiest, plainest, and most entertaining of any books of
          divinity; and might be digested into a better body of divinity than
          any that is yet extant.' (Advice to a Young Student, 1730).

        <p>
          Not only the pulpit, but the whole theological literature of the age,
          takes the same tone of appeal. Books are no longer addressed by the
          cloistered academic to a learnedly educated class, they are written by
          popular divines -- men of leisure,' Butler calls them -- for the use
          of fashionable society. There is an epoch in the history of letters
          when readers and writers change places; when it ceases to be the
          reader's business to come to the writer to be instructed, and the
          writer begins to endeavour to engage the attention of the reader. The
          same necessity was now laid upon the religious writer. He appeared at
          the bar of criticism, and must gain the wits, and the town. At the
          debate between the Deists and the Christian apologists the public was
          umpire. The time was past when Baxter talked about another world like
          one that had been there, and was come as a sort of express from thence
          to make a report concerning it.' (Calamy, Life, i.220). As the
          preacher now no longer spoke with the authority of a heavenly mission,
          but laid the state of the argument before his hearers, so philosophy
          was no longer a self-centered speculation, an oracle of wisdom. The
          divine went out into the streets, with his demonstration of the being
          and attributes of God printed on a broadside; he solicits your assent
          in the new court-jargon.' When Collins visited Lord Barrington at
          Torts, as they were all men of letters, and had a taste for Scripture
          criticism, it is said to have been their custom, after dinner, to have
          a Greek Testament laid on the table.' (Biog. Brit. Art. Barrington.')
          These discussions were not necessarily unprofitable. Lord Bolingbroke
          was seldom in the company of the Countess of Huntingdon without
          discussing some topic beneficial to his eternal interests, and he
          always paid the utmost respect and deference to her ladyship's
          opinion.' (Memoirs of Countess of Hunt., i.180.) Bishop Butler gives
          his clergy hints how to conduct themselves when sceptical and profane
          men bring up the subject (religion) at meetings of entertainment, and
          such as are the freer sort; innocent ones, I mean, otherwise I should
          not suppose you would be present at them.' (Durham Charge, 1751).
          Tindal's reconversion from Romanism is said to have been brought about
          by the arguments he heard in the coffee-houses. This anecdote, given
          in Curll' catch-penny Life,' rests, not on that bookseller's
          authority, which is worthless, but on that of the medical man who
          attended him in his last illness. It was the same with the controversy
          on the Trinity, of which Waterland says, in 1723, that it was spread
          abroad among all ranks and degrees of men, and the Athanasian creed
          become the subject of common and ordinary conversation.' (Critical
          Hist. of the Athan. Creed, Introd) The Universities were invaded by
          the spirit of the age, and instead of taking students through a
          laborious course of philosophy, natural and moral, turned out
          accomplished gentlemen upon the classics' and a scantling of logic.
          Berkeley's ironical portrait of the modish philosopher is of date
          1732. Lysicles smiled, and said he believed Euphranor had figured to
          himself philosophers in square caps and long gowns, but thanks to
          these happy times, the reign of pedantry was over. Our philosophers
          are of a very different kind from those awkward students who think to
          come at knowledge by poring on dead languages and old authors, or by
          sequestering themselves from the cares of the world to meditate in
          solitude and retirement. They are the best bred men of the age, men
          who know the world, men of pleasure, men of fashion, and fine
          gentlemen. Euph.: I have some small notion of the people you mention,
          but should never have taken them for philosophers. Cri.: Nor would any
          one else till of late. The world was long under a mistake about the
          way to knowledge, thinking it lay through a tedious course of
          academical education and study. But among the discoveries of the
          present age, one of the principal is the finding out that such a
          method doth rather retard and obstruct, than promote knowledge. Lys.:
          I will undertake, a lad of fourteen, bred in the modern way, shall
          make a better figure, and be more considered in any drawing-room, or
          assembly of polite people, than one at four-and-twenty, who hath lain
          by a long time at school and college. He shall say better things, in a
          better manner, and be more liked by good judges. Euph. Where doth he
          pick up this improvement? Cri. Where our grave ancestors would never
          have looked for it, in a drawing-room, a coffee-house, a
          chocolate-late-house, at the tavern, or groom-porter's. In these and
          the like fashionable places of resort, it is the custom for polite
          persons to speak freely on all subjects, religious, moral, or
          political. So that a young gentleman who frequents them is in the way
          of hearing many instructive lectures, seasoned with wit and raillery,
          and uttered with spirit. Three or four sentences from a man of
          quality, spoken with a good air, make more impression, and convey more
          knowledge, than a dozen dissertations in a dry academical way. . . .
          You may now commonly see a young lady, or a petit maître non-plus a
          divine or an old-fashioned gentleman, who bath read many a Greek and
          Latin author, and spent much time in hard methodical study.'
          (Alciphron, Dial. i. § 11.)

        <p>
          Among a host of mischiefs thus arising, one positive good may be
          signalized. If there must be debate, there ought to be fair play; and
          of this, publicity is the best guarantee. To make the public arbiter
          in an abstract question of metaphysics is doubtless absurd, yet it is
          at least a safeguard against extravagance and metaphysical lunacy. The
          verdict of public opinion on such topics is worthless, but it checks
          the inevitable tendency of closet speculation to become visionary.
          There is but one sort of scepticism that is genuine, and deadly in
          proportion as it is real; that namely, which is forced upon the mind
          by its experience of the hollowness of mankind; for men may be read,
          as well as books, too much.' That other logical scepticism which is
          hatched by over-thinking can be cured by an easy remedy; ceasing to
          think.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objections urged against revelation in the course of the Deistical
          controversy were no chimæras of a sickly brain, but solid charges; the
          points brought into public discussion were the points at which the
          revealed system itself impinges on human reason. No time can lessen
          whatever force there may be in the objection against a miracle; it is
          felt as strongly in one century as in another. The debate was not
          frivolous; the objections were worth answering, because they were not
          pitched metaphysically high. To a platonizing divine they look
          trivial; picked up in the street. So Origeu naturally thought that a
          faith which could be shaken by such objections as those of Celsus was
          not worth much.' (Cont. Cels., Pref. § 4.) Just such were the
          objections of the Deists; such as come spontaneously into the thoughts
          of practical men, who never think systematically, but who are not to
          be imposed upon by fancies. Persons sneer at the shallow Deism' of the
          last century; and it is customary to reply that the antagonist
          orthodoxy was at least as shallow. The truth is, the shallowness'
          imputed belongs to the mental sphere into which the debate was for the
          time transported. The philosophy of the age was not above its mission.
          Philosophy,' thought Thomas Reid, in 1764, has no other root but the
          principles of common sense; it grows out of them, it draws its
          nourishment from them; severed from this root, its honours wither, its
          sap is dried up, it dies and rots.' (Inquiry, &amp;c., Intr. § 4.) We,
          in the present generation, have seen the great speculative movement in
          Germany die out from this very cause, because it became divorced from
          the facts on which it speculated. Shut up in the Universities, it
          turned inwards on itself, and preyed on its own vitals. It has only
          been neglected by the world, because it first neglected the great
          facts in which the world has, and feels, an interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          If ever there was a time when abstract speculation was brought down
          from inaccessible heights and compelled to be intelligible, it was the
          period from the Revolution to the middle of the last century. Closet
          speculation had been discredited; the cobwebs of scholasticism were
          exploded; the age of feverish doubt and egotistical introspection had
          not arrived. In that age the English higher education acquired its
          practical aim; an aim in which the development of the understanding,
          and the acquisition of knowledge are considered secondary objects to
          the formation of a sound secular judgment, of the scholar and the
          gentleman' of the old race of schoolmasters. Burke contrasting his own
          times with the preceding age considered our forefathers as deeper
          thinkers than ourselves, because they set a higher value on good sense
          than on knowledge in various sciences, and their good sense was
          derived very often from as much study and more knowledge, though of
          another sort.' (Recollections by Samuel Rogers, p.81.)

        <p>
          When a dispute is joined, e.g. on the origin and composition of the
          Gospels, it is, from the nature of the case, confined to an inner
          circle of Biblical scholars. The mass of the public must wait outside,
          and receive the result on their authority. The religious public were
          very reluctant to resign the verse 1 John v.7, but they did so at last
          on the just ground that after a philological controversy conducted
          with open doors, it had been decided to be spurious. No serious man
          would consider a popular assembly a proper court to decide on the
          doctrine of transubstantiation, or on the Hegelian definition of God,
          though either is easily capable of being held up to the ridicule of
          the half-educated from the platform or the pulpit. It is otherwise
          with the greater part of the points raised in the Deistical
          controversy. It is not the speculative reason of the few, but the
          natural conscience of the many, that questions the extirpation of the
          Canaanites, or the eternity of hell-torments. These are points of
          divinity that are at once fundamental and popular. Butler, though not
          approving of entering into an argumentative defence of religion in
          common conversation,' recommends his clergy to do so from the pulpit
          on the ground that, such as are capable of seeing the force of
          objections, are capable also of seeing the force of the answers which
          are given to them.' (Durham Charge.) If the philosophic intellect be
          dissatisfied with the answers which the divines of that day gave to
          the difficulties started, let it show how, on the rationalist
          hypothesis, these difficulties are removeable for the mass of those
          who feel them. The transcendental reason provides an answer which
          possibly satisfies itself; but to the common reason the answer is more
          perplexing than the difficulty it would clear.

          M. Villemain has remarked in Pascal, that foresight which revealed to
          him so many objections unknown to his generation, and which inspired
          him with the idea of fortifying and intrenching positions which were
          not threatened.' The objections which Pascal is engaged with are not
          only not those of his age, they are not such as could ever become
          general in any age. They are those of the higher reason, and the
          replies are from the same inspiration. Pascal's view of human
          depravity seems to the ordinary man but the despair and delirium of
          the self-tormenting ascetic. The cynical view of our fallen nature,
          however, is at least a possible view. It is well that it should be
          explored, and it will always have its prophets, Calvin or
          Rochefoucault. But to ordinary men an argument in favour of
          revelation, founded on such an assumption, will seem to be in
          contradiction to his daily experience. Pascal's Pensées stand alone; a
          work of individual genius, not belonging to any age. The celebrity
          which the Analogy of Bishop Butler has gained is due to the opposite
          reason. It is no paradox to say that the merit of the Analogy lies in
          its want of originality. It came (1736) towards the end of the
          Deistical period. It is the result of twenty year's study -- the very
          twenty years during which the Deistical notions formed the atmosphere
          which educated people breathed. The objections it meets are not new
          and unseasoned objections, but such as had worn well, and has borne
          the rub of controversy, because they were genuine. And it will be
          equally hard to find in the Analogy any topic in reply, which had not
          been suggested in the pamphlets and sermons of the preceding half
          century. Like Aristotle's physical and political treatises, it is a
          résumé of the discussions of more than one generation. Its admirable
          arrangement only is all its own. Its closely packed and carefully
          fitted older speaks of many years' contrivance. Its substance are the
          thoughts of a whole age, not barely compiled, but each reconsidered
          and digested. Every brick in the building has been rung before it has
          been relaid, and replaced in its true relation to the complex and
          various whole. In more than one passage we see that the construction
          of this fabric of evidence, which consists in a long series of things,
          one preparatory to and confirming another from the beginning of the
          world to the present time,' (Durham Charge) was what occupied Butler's
          attention. Compass of thought, even amongst persons of the lowest
          rank,' (Pref. to Sermon), is that form of the reflective faculty to
          which he is fond of looking both for good and evil. He never will
          forget that justice must be done to every part of a subject when we
          are considering it.' (Sermon iv.) Harmony, and law, and order, he will
          suppose even where he does not find. The tendency of his reason was
          that which Bacon indicates; the spirit of a man being of an equal and
          uniform substance doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater
          equality and uniformity than is in truth.' (Advancement of Learning.)
          This is, probably, the true explanation of the obscurity' which
          persons sometimes complain of in Butler's style. The reason or matter
          he is producing is palpable and plain enought. But he is so solicitous
          to find its due place in the then stage of the argument, so scrupulous
          to give it its exact weight and no more, so careful in arranging its
          situation relatively to the other members of the proof, that a reader
          who does not bear in mind that the effect of the whole' is what the
          architect is preparing, is apt to become embarrassed, and to think
          that obscurity which is really logical precision. The generality of
          men are better qualified for understanding particulars one by one,
          than for taking a comprehensive view of the whole. The philosophical
          breadth which we miss in Butler's mode of conceiving is compensated
          for by this judicial breadth in his mode of arguing, which gives its
          place to each consideration, but regards rather the cumulative force
          of the whole. Many writers before Butler had insisted on this
          character of the Christian evidences. Dr. Jenkin, Margaret Professor
          at Cambridge, whose Reasonableness and Certainty of the Christian
          Religion was the Paley' of divinity students then, says, there is an
          excellency in every part of our religion separately considered, but
          the strength and vigour of each part is in the relation it has to the
          rest, and the several parts must be taken altogether, if we would have
          a true knowledge, and make a just estimate of the whole.
          (Reasonableness, &amp;c. Pt. ii. Pref.1721.) But Butler does not
          merely take the hint from others. It is so entirely the guiding rule
          of his hand and pen that it would appear to have been forced upon him
          by some peculiar experience of his own. It was in society, and not in
          his study, that he had learned the weight of the Deistical arguments.
          At the Queen's philosophical parties, where these topics were
          canvassed with earnestness and freedom, he must have often felt the
          impotence of reply in detail, and seen, as he says, how impossible it
          must be, in a cursory conversation, to unite all this into one
          argument, and represent it as it ought.' (Durham Charge.) Hence his
          own labour to work up his materials into a connected framework, a
          methodized encyclopædia of all the extant topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not that he did not pay attention to the parts. Butler's eminence over
          his contemporary apologists is seen in nothing more than in that
          superior sagacity which rejects the use of any plea that is not
          entitled to consideration singly. In the other evidential books of the
          time we find a miscellaneous crowd of suggestions of very various
          value; never fanciful, but often trivial; undeniable, but weak as
          proof of the point they are brought to prove. Butler seems as if he
          had sifted these books, and retained all that was solid in them. If he
          built with brick, and not with marble, it was because he was not
          thinking of reputation, but of utility, and an immediate purpose.
          Mackintosh wished Butler had had the elegance and ornament of
          Berkeley. They would have been sadly out of place. There was not a
          spark of the littleness of literary ambition about him. There was a
          certain naturalness in Butler's mind, which took him straight to the
          questions on which men differed around him. Generally it is safer to
          prove what no one denies, and easier to explain difficulties which no
          one has ever felt. A quiet reputation is best obtained in the literary
          quæstiunculæ of important subjects. But a simple and straightforward
          man studies great topics because he feels a want of the knowledge
          which they contain. He goes straight to the real doubts and
          fundamental discrepancies, to those on which it is easy to excite
          odium, and difficult to give satisfaction; he leaves to others the
          amusing skirmishing and superficial literature accessory to such
          studies. Thus there is nothing light in Butler, all is grave,
          .serious, and essential; nothing else would be characteristic of him.'
          (Bagehot, Estimates, &amp;c., p.189.) Though he has rifled their books
          he makes no display of reading. In the Analogy he never names the
          author he is answering. In the Sermons he quotes, directly, only
          Hobbes, Shaftesbury, Wollaston, Rochefoucauld, and Fenelon. From his
          writings we should infer that his reading was not promiscuous, even
          had he not himself given us to understand how much opportunity he had
          of seeing the idleness and waste of time occasioned by light reading.

          This popular appeal to the common reason of men, which is one
          characteristic of the rationalist period, was a first effort of
          English theology to find a new basis for doctrine which should replace
          those foundations which had failed it. The Reformation had destroyed
          the authority of the Church upon which Revelation had so long rested.
          The attempt of the Laudian divines to substitute the voice of the
          national Church for that of the Church universal had met with only
          very partial and temporary success. When the Revolution of 1688
          introduced the freedom of the press and a general toleration, even
          that artificial authority which, by ignoring non-conformity, had
          produced an appearance of unity, and erected a conventional standard
          of truth and falsehood, fell to the ground The old and venerated
          authority had been broken by the Reformation. The new authority of the
          Anglican establishment had existed in theory only, and never in fact,
          and the Revolution had crushed the theory, which was now confined to a
          small band of non-jurors. In reaction against Anglican authority,' the
          Puritan movement had tended to rest faith and doctrine upon the inward
          light within each man's breast. This tendency of the new Puritanism,
          which we may call Independency, was a development of the old, purely
          scriptural, Puritanism of Presbyterianism. But it was its natural and
          necessary development. It was consequence of the controversy with the
          establishment. For both the Church and Dissent agreed in acknowledging
          Scripture as their foundation, and the controversy turned on the
          interpreter of Scripture. Nor was the doctrine of the inner light,
          which individualized the basis of faith, confined to the
          Nonconformists. It was shared by a section of the Church, of whom
          Cudworth is the type, to whom Scripture faith is not a mere believing
          of historical things, and upon artificial arguments or testimonies
          only, but a certain higher and diviner power in the soul that
          peculiarly correspondeth with the Deity.' (Intellectual System, Pref.)
          The inner light or witness of the Spirit in the soul of the individual
          believer had, in its turn, fallen into discredit through the
          extravagances to which it had given birth. It was disowned alike by
          Churchmen and Nonconformists, who agree in speaking with contemptuous
          pity of the sectaries of the last age.' The re-action against
          individual religion led to this first attempt to base revealed truth
          on reason. And for the purpose for which reason was now wanted, the
          higher, or philosophic, reason was far less fitted than that universal
          understanding in which all men can claim a share. The inner light,'
          which had made each man the dictator of his own creed, had exploded in
          ecclesiastical anarchy. The appeal from the frantic discord of the
          enthusiasts to reason must needs be, not to an arbitrary or particular
          reason in each man, but to a common sense, a natural discernment, a
          reason of universal obligation. As it was to be universally binding,
          it must be generally recognisable. It must be something not confined
          to the select few, a gift of the self-styled elect, but a faculty
          belonging to all men of sound mind and average capacity. Truth must be
          accessible to the bulk of mankind.' It was a time when the only refuge
          from a hopeless maze, or wild chaos, seemed to be the rational consent
          of the sensible and unprejudiced. Have the bulk of mankind,' writes
          Locke, no other guide but accident and blind chance to conduct them to
          their happiness or misery? Are the current opinions and licensed
          guides of every country sufficient]evidence and security to every man
          to venture his great concernments on? Or, can those be the certain and
          infallible oracles and standards of truth which teach one thing in
          Christendom, and another in Turkey? Or shall a poor countryman be
          eternally happy for having the chance to be born in Italy? Or a day
          labourer be unavoidably lost because he had the ill-luck to be born in
          England? How ready some men may be to say some of these things, I will
          not here examine; but this I am sure, that men must allow one or other
          of these to be true, or else grant that God has furnished men with
          faculties sufficient to direct them in the way they should take, if
          they will but seriously employ them that way, when their ordinary
          vocations allow them the leisure.' (Essay, Book iv. ch.19, § 3.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Such an attempt to secure a foundation in a new consensus will
          obviously forfeit depth to gain in comprehensiveness. This phase of
          rationalism -- Rationalismus vulgaris' -- resigns the transcendental,
          that it may gain adherents. It wants, not the elect, but all men. It
          cannot afford to embarrass itself with the attempt to prove what all
          may not be required to receive. Accordingly there can be no mysteries
          in Christianity. The word musterion, as Archbishop Whately points out
          (Essays, 2nd ser., 5th ed., p.288), always means in the New Testament
          not that which is incomprehensible, but that which was once a secret,
          though now it is revealed it is no longer so. Whately, who elsewhere
          (Paley's Evidence, new ed.) speaks so contemptuously of the cast-off
          clothes' of the Deists, is here but adopting the argument of Toland in
          his Christianity not Mysterious. (Cf. Balguy, Discourses, p.237.)
          There needs no special preparation of heart' to receive the Gospel,
          the evidences of religion are sufficient to convince every
          unprejudiced inquirer. Unbelievers are blameworthy as deaf to an
          argument which is so plain that they cannot but understand it, and so
          convincing that they cannot but be aware of its force. Under such
          self-imposed conditions religious proof seems to divest itself of all
          that is divine, and out of an excess of accommodation to the recipient
          faculty to cease to be a transforming thought. Rationalism can object
          to the old sacramental system that it degrades a spiritual influence
          into a physical effect. But rationalism itself, in order to make the
          proof of revelation universal, is obliged to resolve religion into the
          moral government of God by rewards and punishments, and especially the
          latter. It is this anthropomorphic conception of God as the Governor
          of the universe,' which is presented to us in the theology of the
          Hanoverian divines, a theology which excludes on principle not only
          all that is poetical in life, but all that is sublime in religious
          speculation. To degrade religion to the position of a mere purveyor of
          motive to morality is not more dishonourable to the ethics which must
          ask, than to the religion which will render such assistance.' (A. J.
          Vaughan, Essays, vol.1. p.61.) It is this character that makes the
          reading even of the Analogy so depressing to the soul, as Tholuck
          (Vermischte Schriften, i.193) says of it we weary of a long journey on
          foot, especially through deep sand.' Human nature is not only humbled
          but crushed. It is a common charge against the 18th century divines
          that they exalt man too much, by insisting on the dignity of human
          nature, and its native capacities for virtue. This was the charge
          urged against the orthodox by the evangelical pulpit. But only very
          superficial and incompetent critics of doctrine can suppose that man
          is exalted by being thrown upon his moral faculties. The history of
          doctrine teaches a very different lesson. Those periods when morals
          have been represented as the proper study of man, and his only
          business, have been periods of spiritual abasement and poverty. The
          denial of scientific theology, the keeping in the back-ground the
          transcendental objects of faith, and the restriction of our faculties
          to the regulation of our conduct, seem indeed to be placing man in the
          foreground of the picture, to make human nature the centre round which
          all things revolve. But they do so not by exalting the visible, but by
          materializing the invisible. If there be a sphere of knowledge level
          to our capacities and of the utmost importance to us, we ought surely
          to apply ourselves with all diligence to this our proper business, and
          esteem everything else nothing, nothing as to us, in comparison of it.
          . . . . Our province is virtue and religion, life and manners; the
          science of improving the temper and making the heart better. This is
          the field assigned to us to cultivate; how much it has lain neglected
          is indeed astonishing. . . . Ile who should find out one rule to
          assist us in this work would deserve infinitely better of mankind than
          all the improvers of other knowledge put together.' (Sermon xv.) This
          is the theology of Butler and his contemporaries; a utilitarian
          theology, like the Baconian philosophy, contemning all employment of
          mental power that does not bring in fruit. Intellectui non plumæ, sed
          plumbum addendum et pondera,' (Bacon, Nov. Or., i.104,) might be its
          device.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Analogy it is the same. His term of comparison, the
          constitution and course of nature,' is not what we should understand
          by that term; not what science can disclose to us of the laws of the
          cosmos, but a narrow observation of what men do in ordinary life. We
          see what he means by the constitution of things,' by his saying
          (Sermon xv.) that the writings of Solomon are very much taken up with
          reflections upon human nature and human life; to which he hath added,
          in Ecclesiastes, reflections upon the constitution of things.' In Part
          i. ch.3, of the Analogy, he compares the moral government of God with
          the natural -- the distinction is perhaps from Balguy (Divine
          Rectitude, p.39), that is to say, one part of natural religion with
          another; for the distinction vanishes, except upon a very conventional
          sense of the term moral.' Altogether we miss in these divines not only
          distinct philosophical conceptions, but a scientific use of terms. Dr.
          Whewell considers that Butler shunned the appearance of technical
          terms for the elements of our moral constitution on which he
          speculated,' and thinks that he was driven to indirect modes of
          expression.' (Moral Philosophy in England, p.109.) The truth is that
          Butler uses the language of his day upon the topics on which he
          writes. The technical terms, and strict logical forms, which had been
          adhered to by the writers, small as well as great, of the 17th
          century, had been disused as pedantic; banished first from literature,
          and then from education. They did not appear in style, because they
          did not form part of the mental habit of the writers. Butler does not,
          as Dr. Whewell supposes, think in one form, and write in another, out
          of condescension to his readers. He thinks in the same language in
          which he and those around him speak. Mr. Hort's remark that Butler's
          writings are stoic to the core in the true and ancient sense of the
          word' (Cambridge Essays, 1856, p.337) must be extended to their style.
          The English style of philosophical writing in the Hanoverian period is
          to the English of the 17th century, as the Greek of Epictetus,
          Antoninus, or Plutarch, is to that of Aristotle. And for the same
          reason. The English stoics and their Greek predecessors were practical
          men who moralised in a practical way on the facts of common life, and
          in the language of common life. Neither the rhetorical Schools of the
          Empire, nor the Universities of England, any longer taught the correct
          use of metaphysical language. To imitate classical Latin was become
          the chief aim of the University man in his public exercises, and
          precision of language became under that discipline very speedily a
          lost art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon the whole, the writings of that period are serviceable to us
          chiefly as showing what can and what cannot be effected by
          common-sense thinking in theology. It is of little consequence to
          inquire whether or not the objections of the Deists and the Socinians
          were removed by the answers brought to meet them. Perhaps, on the
          whole, we might be borne out in saying that the defence is at least as
          good as the attack; and so, that even on the ground of common reason,
          the Christian evidences may be arranged in such a way as to balance
          the common-sense improbability of the supernatural -- that there are
          three chances to one for revelation, and only two against it.' (Tracts
          for the Times, No.85.) Had not circumstances given a new direction to
          religious interests, the Deistical controversy might have gone on
          indefinitely, and the amoebæan strain of objection and reply, et
          cantare pares et respondere parati' -- have been prolonged to this day
          without any other result. But that result forces on the mind the
          suggestion that either religious faith has no existence, or that it
          must be to be reached by some other road than that of the trial of the
          witnesses.' It is a reductio ad absurdum of common-sense philosophy,
          of home-baked theology, when we find that the result of the whole is
          that it is safer to believe in a God, lest, if there should happen to
          be one, he might send us to hell for denying his existence.' (Maurice,
          Essays, p.236.) If a religion be wanted which shall debase instead of
          elevating, this should be its creed. If the religious history of the
          eighteenth century proves anything it is this: -- That good sense, the
          best good sense, when it sets to work with the materials of human
          nature and Scripture to construct a religion, will find its way to an
          ethical code, irreproachable in its contents, and based on a just
          estimate and wise observation of facts of life, ratified by Divine
          sanctions in the shape of hope and fear, of future rewards and
          penalties of obedienceand disobedience. This the eighteenth century
          did and did well. It has enforced the truths of natural morality with
          a solidity of argument and variety of proof which they have not
          received since the Stoical epoch, if then. But there its ability
          ended. When it came to the supernatural part of Christianity its
          embarrassment began. It was forced to keep it as much in the
          background as possible, or to bolster it up by lame and inadequate
          reasonings. The philosophy of common-sense had done its own work; it
          attempted more only to show, by its failure, that some higher organon
          was needed for the establishment of supernatural truth. The career of
          the evidential school, its success and failure, -- its success in
          vindicating the ethical part of Christianity and the regulative aspect
          of revealed truth, its failure in establishing the supernatural and
          speculative part, have enriched the history of doctrine with a
          complete refutation of that method as an instrument of theological
          investigation.

          This judgment, however, must not be left unbalanced by a consideration
          on the other side. It will hardly be supposed that the drift of what
          has been said is that common-sense is out of place in religion, or in
          any other matter. The defect of the eighteenth century theology was
          not in having too much good sense, but in having nothing besides. In
          the present day when a godless orthodoxy threatens, as in the
          fifteenth century, to extinguish religious thought altogether, and
          nothing is allowed in the Church of England but the formulæ of past
          thinkings, which have long lost all sense of any kind; it may seem out
          of season to be bringing forward a misapplication of common-sense in a
          bygone age. There are times and circumstances when religious ideas
          will be greatly benefited by being submitted to the rough and ready
          tests by which busy men try what comes in their way; by being made to
          stand their trial, and be freely canvassed, coram populo. As poetry is
          not for the critics, so religion is not for the theologians. When it
          is stiffened into phrases, and these phrases are declared to be
          objects of reverence but not of intelligence, it is on the way to
          become a useless encumbrance, the rubbish of the past, blocking the
          road. Theology then retires into the position it occupies in the
          Church of Rome at present, an unmeaning frostwork of dogma, out of all
          relation to the actual history of man. In that system, theological
          virtue is an artificial life quite distinct from the moral virtues of
          real life. Parmi nous,' says Remusat, un homme religieux est trop
          souvent un homme qui se croit entouré d'ennemis, qui voit avec
          défiance ou scandale les événements et les institutions du siècle, qui
          se désole d'être né dans les jours maudits, et qui a bosoin d'un grand
          fond de bonté innée pour empêcher ses pieuses aversions de devenir de
          mortelles haines.' This system is equally fatal to popular morality
          and to religious theory. It locks up virtue in the cloister, and
          theology in the library. It originates caste sanctity, and a
          traditional philosophy. The ideal of holiness striven after may once
          have been lofty, the philosophy now petrified into tradition may once
          have been a vital faith, but now that they are withdrawn from public
          life, they have ceased to be social influences. On the other hand, the
          eighteenth century exhibits human attainment levelled to the lowest
          secular model of prudence and honesty, but still, such as it was,
          proposed to all men as their rule of life. Practical life as it was,
          was the theme of the pulpit, the press, and the drawing-room. Its
          theory of life was not lofty, but it was true as far as it went. It
          did not, substitute a factitious phraseology, the pass-words of the
          modern pulpit, for the simple facts of life, but called things by
          their right names. Nullum numen habes si sit prudentia' was its motto,
          not denying the numen,' but bringing him very close to the individual
          person, as his moral governor.' The prevailing philosophy was not a
          profound metaphysic, but it was a soundly based arrangement of the
          facts of society; it was not a scheme of the sciences, but a manual
          for every-day use. Nothing of the wild spirit of universal negation
          which was spread over the Continent fifty years later belonged to the
          solid rationalism of this period. The human understanding wished to be
          satisfied, and did not care to believe that of which it could not see
          the substantial ground. The reason was coming slowly to see that it
          had duties which it could not devolve upon others; that a man must
          think for himself, protect his own rights, and administer his affairs.
          The reason was never less extravagant than in this its first essay of
          its strength. Its demands were modest, it was easily satisfied; far
          too easily, we must think, when we look at some of the reasonings
          which passed as valid.
        </p>

          The habits of controversy in which they lived deceived the
          belligerents themselves. The controversial form of their theology,
          which has been fatal to its credit since, was no less detrimental to
          its soundness at the time. They could not discern the line between
          what they did, and what they could not, prove. The polemical temper
          deforms the books they have written. Literature was indeed partially
          refined from the coarser scurrilities with which the Caroline divines,
          a century before, had assailed their Romanist opponents. But there is
          still an air of vulgarity about the polite writing of the age, which
          the divines adopt along with its style. The cassocked divine assumes
          the airs of the roaring blade,' and ruffles it on the mall with a
          horsewhip under his arm. Warburton's stock argument is a threat to
          cudgel anyone who disputes his opinion. All that can be said is that
          this was a habit of treating your opponent which pervaded society. At
          a much later period Porson complains, In these ticklish times . . .
          talk of religion it is odds you have infidel, blasphemer, atheist, or
          schismatic, thundered in your ears; touch upon politics, you will be
          in luck if you are only charged with a tendency to treason. Nor is the
          innocence of your intention any safeguard. It is not the publication
          that shows the character of the author, but the character of the
          author that shows the tendency of the publication.' (Luard's Porson,'
          Camb. Essays, 1857.) A license of party vituperation in the House of
          Commons existed, from the time of the opposition to Walpole onwards,
          which has long been banished by more humane manners. The men who took
          a foremost part seemed to be intent on disparaging each other, and
          proving that neither possessed any qualification of wisdom, knowledge,
          or public virtue. . . Epithets of reproach were lavished personally on
          Lord North, which were applicable only to the vilest and most
          contemptible of mankind.' (Massey, Hist. of England, ii.218.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Were this blustering language a blemish of style and nothing more, it
          would taint their books with vulgarity as literature, but it would not
          vitiate their matter. But the fault reaches deeper than skin-deep. It
          is a most serious drawback on the good-sense of the age that it wanted
          justice in its estimate of persons. They were no more capable of
          judging their friends than their foes. In Pope's satires there is no
          medium; our enemies combine all the odious vices, however incongruous;
          our friends have every virtue under heaven.' We hear sometimes of
          Pope's peculiar malignity.' But he was only doing what every one
          around him was doing, only with a greatly superior literary skill.
          Their savage invective against each other is not a morally worse
          feature than the style of fulsome compliment in which friends address
          each other. The private correspondence of intimate friends betrays an
          unwholesome insincerity, which contrasts strangely with their general
          manliness of character. The burly intellect of Warburton displays an
          appetite for flattery as insatiable as that of Miss Seward and her
          coterie.
        </p>
        <p>
          This habit of exaggerating both good and evil the divines share with
          the other writers of the time. But theological literature, as a
          written debate, had a form of malignant imputation peculiar to itself.
          This is one arising out of the rationalistic fiction which both
          parties assumed, viz., that their respective beliefs were determined
          by an impartial inquiry into the evidence. The orthodox writers
          considered this evidence so clear and certain for their own
          conclusions, that they could account for its not seeming so to others
          only by the supposition of some moral obliquity which darkened the
          understanding in such cases. Hence the obnoxious assumption of the
          divines that the Deists were men of corrupt morals, and the retort of
          the infidel writers, that the clergy were hired advocates. Moral
          imputation, which is justly banished from legal argument, seems to
          find a proper place in theological. Those Christian Deists who, like
          Toland or Collins, approached most nearly in their belief to
          Revelation, were treated, not better, but worse, by the orthodox
          champions; their larger admissions being imputed to disingenuousness
          or calculated reserve. This stamp of advocacy which was impressed on
          English theology at the Reformation -- its first work of consideration
          was an Apology' -- it has not to this day shaken off. Our theologians,
          with rare exceptions, do not penetrate below the surface of their
          subject, but are engaged in defending or vindicating it. The current
          phrases of the bulwarks of our faith,' dangerous to Christianity,' are
          but instances of the habitual position in which we assume ourselves to
          stand. Even more philosophic minds cannot get rid of the idea that
          theology is polemical. Theological study is still the study of topics
          of defence. Even Professor Fraser can exhort us that by the study of
          these topics we might not merely disarm the enemies of religion of
          what, in other times has been, and will continue to be a favourite
          weapon of assault, but we might even convert that weapon into an
          instrument of use in the Christian service.' (Essays in Philosophy,
          p.4,) Modern science,' as it is called, is recommended to the young
          divine, because in it he may find means of "confuting infidelity.'
        </p>
        <p>
          A little consideration will show that the grounds on which advocacy
          before a legal tribunal rests, make it inappropriate in theological
          reasoning. It is not pretended that municipal law is coextensive with
          universal law, and therefore incapable of admitting right on both
          sides. It is allowed that the natural right may be, at times, on one
          side, and the legal title on the other; not to mention the extreme
          case where communis error facit jus.' The advocate is not there to
          supply all the materials out of which the judge is to form his
          decision, but only one side of the case. He is the mere representative
          of his client's interests and has not to discuss the abstract merits
          of the juridical point which may be involved. He does not undertake to
          show that the law is conformable to natural right, but to establish
          the condition of his client relatively to the law. But the rational
          defender of the faith has no place in his system for the variable, or
          the indifferent, or the non-natural. He proceeds on the supposition
          that the whole system of the Church is the one and exclusively true
          expression of reason upon the subject on which it legislates. He
          claims for the whole of received knowledge what the jurist claims for
          international law, to be a universal science. He lays before us, on
          the one hand, the traditional canon or symbol of doctrine. On the
          other hand, he teaches that the free use of reason upon the facts of
          nature and Scripture is the real mode by which this traditional symbol
          is arrived at. To show, then, that the candid pursuit of truth leads
          every partial intellect to the Anglican conclusion was the task which,
          on their theory of religious proof, their theology had to undertake.
          The process, accordingly, should have been analogous to that of the
          jurist or legislator with regard to the internal evidence, and to that
          of the judge with regard to the external evidence. If theological
          argument forgets the judge and assumes the advocate, or betrays the
          least bias to one side, the conclusion is valueless, the principle of
          free inquiry has been violated. Roman Catholic theologians
          consistently enough teach that apologetics' make no part of theology,
          as usually conducted as replies to special objections urged, but that
          a true apologetic must be founded (1) on a discovery of the general
          principle from which the attack proceeds, and (2) on the exhibition,
          per contra, of that general ground-thought of which the single
          Christian truths are developments. (Hageman, Die Aufgabe der
          Catholischen Apologetik.)
        </p>
        <p>
          With rare exceptions the theology of the Hanoverian period is of the
          most violently partisan character. It seats itself, by its theory, in
          the judicial chair, but it is only to comport itself there like Judge
          Jefferies. One of the favourite books of the time was Sherlock's Trial
          of the Witnesses. First published in 1729, it speedily went through
          fourteen editions. It concludes in this way: --
        </p>
        <p>
          Judge. -- What say you? Are the Apostles guilty of giving false
          evidence in the case of the resurrection of Jesus, or not guilty?
        </p>
        <p>Foreman. -- Not guilty.</p>
        <p>
          Judge. -- Very well; and now, gentlemen, I resign my commission, and
          am your humble servant. The company then rose up, and were beginning
          to pay their compliments to the Judge and the counsel, but were
          interrupted by a gentleman, who went up to the Judge and offered him a
          fee. What is this?' says the Judge. A fee, sir,' said the gentleman. A
          fee to a judge is a bribe,' said the Judge. True, sir,' said the
          gentleman; but you have resigned your commission, and will not be the
          first judge who has come from the bench to the bar without any
          diminution of honour. Now, Lazarus's case is to come on next, and this
          fee is to retain you on his side.' One might say that the apologists
          of that day had in like manner left the bench for the bar, and taken a
          brief for the Apostles. They are impatient at the smallest demur, and
          deny loudly that there is any weight in anything advanced by their
          opponents. In the way they override the most serious difficulties,
          they show anything but the temper which is supposed to qualify for the
          weighing of evidence. The astonishing want of candour in their
          reasoning, their blindness to real difficulty, ill-concealed
          predetermination to find a particular verdict, the rise of their style
          in passion in the same proportion as their argument fails in strength,
          constitute a class of writers more calculated than any other to damage
          their own cause with young ingenuous minds, bred in the school of
          Locke to believe that to love truth for truth's sake is the principal
          part of human perfection in this world, and the seed-plot of all other
          virtues. (Locke, æt.73. Letter to Collins.) Spalding has described the
          moral shock his faith received on hearing an eminent clergyman in
          confidential conversation with another, who had cited some powerful
          argument against revelation, say, That's truly awkward; let us
          consider a little how we get out of that;' wie wir uns salviren.
          (Selbstbiographie, p.128.) A truthful mind is a much rarer possession
          than is commonly supposed, for it is as easy to close the eyes of the
          mind as those of the body.' (Butler, Sermon x.) And in this rarity
          there is a natural limit to the injury which uncandid vindications of
          revelation can cause. To whatever causes is to be attributed the
          decline of Deism, from 1750. onwards, the books polemically written
          against it cannot reckon among them. When Casaubon first visited
          Paris, and was being shown over the Sorbonne, his guide said, This is
          the hall in which the doctors have disputed for 300 years.' Aye! and
          what they settled?' was his remark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some exceptions, doubtless, there are to the inconclusiveness of this
          debate. Here again the eminent exception is the Analogy. Butler, it is
          true, comes forward not as an investigator, but as a pleader. But when
          we pass from his inferior brethren to this great master of the art we
          find ourselves in the hands of one who knows the laws of evidence, and
          carefully keeps his statements within them. Butler does not, like his
          fellow apologists, disguise the fact that the evidence is no stronger
          than it is. If it be a poor thing,' to argue in this way, the epithet
          poor may be applied, I fear, as properly to great part, or the whole,
          of human life, as it is to the things mentioned.' (Analogy, Part ii.
          ch.8.) Archbishop Whately, defining the temper of the rational
          theologian, says: -- A good man will, indeed, wish to find the
          evidence of the Christian religion satisfactory; but a wise man will
          not, for that reason, think it satisfactory, but will weigh the
          evidence the more carefully on account of the importance of the
          question.' (Essays, 2nd series, p 24.) This character Butler's
          argument exemplifies. We can feel, as we read, how his judgment must
          have been offended in his contemporaries by the disproportion between
          the positiveness of their assertion and the feebleness of their
          argument. Nor should we expect that Butler satisfied them. They
          thought him a little too little vigorous,' and wished he would have
          spoke more earnestly.' (Byrom's Journal, March, 1737.) Men who
          believed that they were in possession of a demonstration' of
          Christianity' not likely to be satisfied with one who saw so strongly
          the doubtfulness in which things were involved' that he could not
          comprehend men's being impatient out of action or vehement in it.'
          (Unpublished Remains, &amp;c.) Warburton, who has a proof which is
          very little short of mathematical certainty, and to which nothing but
          a mere physical possibility of the contrary can be opposed' (Divine
          Leg., b. i. § 1), was the man for the age, which did not care to stand
          higgling with Butler over the degrees of probability. What could the
          world do with a man who designed the search after truth as the
          business of my life (Correspondence with Dr. Clarke), and who was so
          little prepared to "dogmatise about the future world that he rather
          felt that there is no account to be given in the way of reason of
          men's so strong attachments to the present world.' (Sermon vii.)
          Butler's doubtfulness, however, it should be remarked, is not the
          unsteadiness of the sceptical, but the wariness of the judicial mind;
          a mind determined for itself by its own instincts, but careful to
          confine its statements to others within the evidence produced in
          court. The Analogy does not depicture an inward struggle in his own
          mind, but as he told a friend, his way of writing it had been to
          endeavour to answer as he went along, every possible objection that
          might occur to any one against any position of his in his book.'
          (Bartlett's Life of Butler, p.50.) He does not doubt himself, but he
          sees, what others do not see, the difficulty of proving religion to
          others. There is a saying of Pitt circulating to the effect that the
          Analogy is a dangerous book; it raises more doubts than it solves.'
          All that is true in this is, that to a mind which has never nourished
          objections to revelation a book of evidences may be the means of first
          suggesting them. But in 1736 the objections were everywhere current,
          and the answers to them were mostly of that truly dangerous' sort in
          which assertion runs ahead of proof. The merit of Butler lies not in
          the irrefragable proof,' which Southey's epitaph epitaph attributes to
          his construction, but in his showing the nature of the proof, and
          daring to admit that it was less than certain; to own that a man may
          be fully convinced of the truth of a matter and upon the strongest
          reasons, and yet not be able to answer all the difficulties which may
          be raised upon it.' (Durham Charge, 1751.)

        <p>
          Another, perhaps the only other, book of this polemical tribe which
          can be said to have been completely successful as an answer, is one
          most unlike the Analogy in all its nobler features. This is Bentley's
          Remarks upon a late Discourse of Freethinking, by Phileleutherus
          Lipsiennis, 1713. Coarse, arrogant, and abusive with all Bentley's
          worst faults of style and this masterly critique is decisive. Not, of
          course, of the Deistical controversy, on which the critic avoids
          entering. The Discourse of Freethinking was a small tract published in
          1713 by Anthony Collins. Collins was a gentleman of independent
          fortune, whose high personal character and general respectability
          seemed to give a weight to his words, which assuredly they do not
          carry of themselves. By freethinking, he means liberty of thought --
          the right of bringing all received opinions whatsoever to the
          touchstone of reason. Among the grounds or authorities by which he
          supports this natural right, Collins unluckily had recourse to
          history, and largely, of course, to the precedent of the Greek
          philosophers. Collins, who had been bred at Eton and King's, was
          probably no worse a scholar than his contemporary Kingsmen, and the
          range of his reading was that of a man who had made the classics the
          companions of his maturer years. But that scholarship which can supply
          a quotation from Lucan, or flavour the style with an occasional
          allusion to Tully or Seneca, is quite incompetent to apply Greek or
          Roman precedent properly to a modern case. Addison, the pride of
          Oxford, had done no better. In his Essay on the Evidences of
          Christianity, Addison assigns as grounds for his religious belief,
          stories as absurd as that of the Cocklane ghost, and foreries as rank
          as Ireland's Vortigern, puts faith in the lie about the thundering
          legion, is convinced that Tiberius moved the Senate to admit Jesus
          among the gods, and pronounces the letter of Agbarus, King of Edessa,
          to be a record of great authority.' (Macaulay: Essays.) But the public
          was quite satisfied with Addison's citations, in which a public, which
          had given the victory to Boyle in the Phalaris controversy, could
          hardly suspect anything wrong. Collins was not to escape so easily.
          The Freethinker flounders hopelessly among the authorities he has
          invoked. Like the necromancer's apprentice, he is worried by the
          fiends he has summoned but cannot lay, and Bentley, on whose nod they
          wait, is there like another Cornelius Agrippa hounding them on and
          enjoying the sport. Collins's mistakes, mistranslations,
          misconceptions, and distortions are so monstrous, that it is difficult
          for us now, forgetful how low classical learning had sunk, to believe
          that they are mistakes, and not wilful errors. It is rare sport to
          Bentley, this rat-hunting in an old rick, and he lays about him in
          high glee, braining an authority at every blow. When he left off
          abruptly, in the middle of a Third Part,' it was not because he was
          satiated with slaughter, but to substitute a new excitement, no less
          congenial to his temper -- a quarrel with the University about his
          fees. A grace, voted 1715, tendering him the public thanks of the
          University, and praying him in the name of the University to finish
          what remains of so useful a work,' could not induce him to resume his
          pen. The Remarks of Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, unfinished though they
          are, and trifling as was the book which gave occasion to them, are
          perhaps the best of all Bentley's performances. They have all the
          merits of the Phalaris dissertation, with the advantage of far nobler
          subject. They show how Bentley's exact appreciation of the value of
          terms could, when he chose to apply it to that purpose, serve him as a
          key to the philosophical ideas of past times, no less than to those of
          poetical metaphor. The tone of the pamphlet is most offensive, not
          only not insipid, but exceedingly bad-tasted.' We can only say the
          taste is that of his age, while the knowledge is all his own. It was
          fair to show that his antagonist undertook to interpret the Prophets
          and Solomon without Hebrew; Plutarch and Zosimus (Collins spells it
          Zozimus) without Greek; and Cicero and Lucan without Latin.' (Remarks,
          Part i. No.3.) But the dirt endeavoured to be thrown on Collins will
          cleave to the hand that throws it. It may be worth mention that this
          tract of Bentley contains the original of Sidney Smith's celebrated
          defence of the prizes' in the Church. The passage is a favourable
          specimen of the moral level of a polemic who was accusing his opponent
          of holding opinions the most abject and base that human nature is
          capable of.' (Letter prefixed to Remarks.)

          He can never conceive or wish a priesthood either quieter for him, or
          cheaper, than that of the present Church of England. Of your quietness
          himself is a convincing proof, who has writ this outrageous book, and
          has met with no punishment nor prosecution. And for the cheapness,
          that appeared lately in one of your parliaments, when the accounts
          exhibited showed that 6,000 of your clergy, the greater part of your
          whole number, had, at a middle rate one with another, not 50 pounds a
          year. A poor emolument for so long, so laborious, so expensive an
          education, as must qualify them for holy orders. While I resided at
          Oxford, and saw such a conflux of youth to their annual admissions, I
          have often studied and admired why their parents would, under such
          mean encouragements, design their sons for the church; and those the
          most towardly, and capable, and select geniuses among their children,
          who must needs have emerged in a secular life. I congratulated,
          indeed, the felicity of your establishment, which attracted the choice
          youth of your nation for such very low pay; but my wonder was at the
          parents, who generally have interest, maintenance and wealth, the
          first thing in their view, till at last one of your state-lotteries
          ceased my astonishment. For as in that, a few glittering prizes,
          1,000, 5,000, 10,000 pounds among an infinity of blanks, drew troops
          of adventurers, who, if the whole fund had been equally ticketted,
          would never have come in; so a few shining dignities in your church,
          prebends, deaneries, bishopricks, are the pious fraud that induces and
          decoys the parents to risk their child's fortune in it. Everyone hopes
          his own will get some prize in the church, and never reflects on the
          thousands of blanks in poor country livings. And if a foreigner may
          tell you his mind, from what he sees at home, tis this part of your
          establishment that makes your clergy excel ours [i. e., in Germany,
          from which Phileleutherus Lipsiensis is supposed to write]. Do but
          once level all your preferments, and you'll soon be as level in your
          learning. For, instead of the flower of the English youth, you'll have
          only the refuse sent to your academies, and those, too, cramped and
          crippled in their studies, for want of aim and emulation. So that, if
          your Freethinkers had any politics, instead of suppressing your whole
          order, they should make you all alike; or, if that cannot be done,
          make your preferments a very lottery in the whole similitude. Let your
          church dignities be pure chance prizes, without regard to abilities,
          or morals, or letters.' (Remarks, Part ii. § 40.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been mentioned that Bentley does not attempt to reply to the
          argument of the Discourse on Freethinking. His tactic is to ignore it,
          and to assume that it is only meant as a covert attack on
          Christianity; that Collins is an Atheist fighting under the disguise
          of a Deist. Some excuse perhaps may be made for a man nourished on
          pedagogic latin, and accustomed to launch furious sarcasm at any
          opponent who betrayed a brutal ignorance of the difference between ac'
          and et.' But Collins was not a sharper, and would have disdained
          practices to which Bentley stooped for the sake of a professorship.
          When Bentley, in pride of academic dignity, could thus browbeat a
          person of Collins's consideration, it was not to be expected that the
          inferior fry of Deistical writers, -- Toland, a writer for the press;
          Tindal, a fellow of a college; or Chubb, a journeyman glover -- met
          with fairer treatment from their opponents. The only exception to this
          is the case of Shaftesbury, to whom, as well after his death as in his
          lifetime, his privileges as a peer seem to have secured immunity from
          hangman s usage. He is simply a late noble author.' Nor was this
          respect inspired by the Earl's profession of christianity. He does,
          indeed, make this profession with the utmost unreserve. He asserts his
          steady orthodoxy,' and entire submission to the truly Christian and
          Catholic doctrines of our holy Church, as by law established,' and
          that he holds the mysteries of our religion even in the minutest
          particulars.' (Characteristicks, Vol. iii. p.315.) But this outward
          profession would only have brought down upon any other writer an
          aggravated charge of cowardly malice and concealment of Atheism. If
          Shaftesbury was spared on account of his rank, the orthodox writers
          were not altogether wrong in fastening upon this disingenuousness as a
          moral characteristic of their antagonists. The excuse for this want of
          manliness in men who please themselves with insinuating unpopular
          opinions which they dare not advocate openly, is that it is an
          injustice perpetrated by those who have public feeling on their side.
          They make,' says Mr. Tayler, the honest expression of opinion penal,
          and then condemn men for disingenuousness. They invite to free
          discussion, but determine beforehand that only one conclusion can be
          sound and moral. They fill the arena of public debate with every
          instrument of torture and annoyance for the feeling heart, the
          sensitive imagination, and the scrupulous intellect, and then are
          angry that men do not rush headlong into the martyrdom that has been
          prepared for them.' (Religious Life of England, p.282.)
        </p>
        <p>
          In days when the pillory was the punishment for common libel, it
          cannot be thought much that heresy and infidelity should be punished
          by public opprobrium. And public abhorrence was the most that a writer
          against revelation had now to fear. Mandeville's Fable of the Bees,
          indeed, was presented as a nuisance by the grand jury of Middlesex, in
          1723, as were Bolingbroke's collected Works,' in 1752, and Toland's
          Christianity not Mysterious, in 1699. We find, too that Toland had to
          fly from Dublin, and Collins to go out of the way to Holland, for fear
          of further consequence. But nothing ever came of these presentments.
          The only prosecution for religious libel was that of Woolston, 2
          George II., in which the defendant, who was not of sound mind,
          provoked and even compelled the law officers of the crown to proceed
          against him, though they were very reluctant to do so. When thus
          compelled to declare the law, on this occasion, the Lord Chief Justice
          (Raymond) would not allow it to be doubted that to write against
          Christianity in general was punishable at common law.' Yet both then
          and since, judges and prosecutors have shown themselves shy of
          insisting upon the naked offence of impugning the truth of
          Christianity.' That it is an offence at common law, independent of 9
          &amp; 10 William III., no lawyer will deny. But an instinctive sense
          of the incompatibility of this legal doctrine with the fundamental
          tenet of Protestant rationalism has always served to keep it in the
          background. The judges seem to have played fast and loose in this
          matter, in such sort as might enable the future judge to quote the
          tolerant or the intolerant side of their doctrine as might prove
          convenient; and while seemingly disavowing all interference with fair
          discussion, they still kept a wary hold of the precedents of Hale and
          Raymond, and of the great arcanum of part and parcel;' semiauimesque
          micant digiti, ferrumque retractant.' (Considerations on the Law, of
          Libel. By John Search, 1833.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever excuse the Deistical writers might have for their insidious
          manner of writing, it is more to the present purpose to observe that
          we may draw from it the conclusion that public opinion was throughout
          on the side of the defenders of Christianity. It might seem almost
          superfluous to say this, were it not that complaints meet us on every
          side, which seem to imply the very contrary; that in the words of Mr.
          Gregory, the doctrine of our Church is exploded, and our holy religion
          become only a name which is everywhere spoken against.' (Pref. to
          Beveridge's Private Thoughts, 1709.) Thirty years later Butler writes,
          that it is come to be taken for granted that Christianity is not so
          much as a subject of inquiry; but that it is now, at length,
          discovered to be fictitious. Accordingly they treat it as if in the
          present age this were an agreed point among all people of discernment,
          and nothing remained but to set it up as a principal subject of mirth
          and ridicule, as it were by way of reprisals for its leaving so long
          interrupted the pleasures of the world.' (Advertisement to Analogy,
          1736.) However a loose kind of Deism might he the tone of fashionable
          circles, it is clear that distinct disbelief of Christianity was by no
          means the general state of the public mind. The leaders of the
          Low-church and Whig party were quite aware of this. Notwithstanding
          the universal complaints of the High-church party a the prevalence of
          infidelity, it is obvious that this mode of thinking was confined, to
          a very small section of society. The Independent Whig (May 4, 1720),
          in the middle of its blustering and endeavours to terrify the clergy
          with their unpopularity, is obliged to admit that the High-church
          Popish clergy will laugh in their sleeves at this advice, and. think
          there is folly enough yet left among the laity to support their
          authority; and will laugh themselves, and rejoice over the ignorance
          of the Universities, the stupidity of the drunken squires, the panic
          of the tender sex, and the never-to-be-shaken constancy of the
          multitude.' A still better evidence is the confidence and success with
          which the writers on the side of Revelation appealed to the popular
          passions, and cowed their Deistical opponents into the use of that
          indirect and disingenuous procedure with which they then taunted them.
          The clerical sphere was much more a sphere by itself than it has since
          become. Notwithstanding the large toleration really practised, strict
          professional etiquette was still observed in the Church and the
          Universities. The horizontal hat, the starched band, and the cassock,
          were still worn in public, and certain proprieties of outward manner
          were expected from the cloth.' The violation of these proprieties was
          punished by the forfeiture of the offenders' prospects of preferment,
          a point on which the most extreme sensitiveness existed. In the Balguy
          and Waterland set an officious spirit of delation seems to have
          flourished. The general habit of publicly canvassing religious topics
          was very favourable to this espionage; as, at the Reformation, the
          Catholics gathered their best calumnies against Luther from his
          unreserved table-talk.'
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not difficult to draw the unhappy Middleton into unguarded
          expressions' (Van Mildert, Life of Walerland, p.162); and something
          which had fallen from Rundle in his younger days was used against him
          so successfully that even the Talbot interest was able to procure him
          only an Irish bishoprick. Lord Chesterfield, seeing what advantage the
          High-church party derived from this tactic, endeavoured to turn it
          against them. He gives a circumstantial account of a conversation with
          Pope, which would tend to prove that Atterbury was, nearly all his
          life, a sceptic. The thing was not true, as Mr. Carruthers has shown
          (Life of Pope, 2nd ed. p.213), and true or false, the weapon in
          Chesterfield's hands was pointless.

        <p>
          Though the general feeling of the country was sufficiently decided to
          oblige all who wished to write against Christianity, to do so under a
          mask, this was not the ease with attacks upon the Clergy. Since the
          days of the Lollards there had never been a time when the established
          ministers of religion were held in so much contempt as in the
          Hanoverian period, or when satire upon churchmen was so congenial to
          general feeling. This too was the more extraordinary, as there was no
          feeling against the Church Establishment, nor was non-conformity as a
          theory ever less in favour. The contempt was for the persons, manners,
          and character of the ecclesiastics. When Macaulay brought out his
          portrait of the clergyman of the revolution period, his critics
          endeavoured to show that that portrait was not true to life. They seem
          to have brought out the fact that it was pretty fairly true to
          literature. The difficult point is to estimate how far the satirical
          and popular literature of any age may be taken as representative of
          life. Satire to be popular must exaggerate, but it must be
          exaggeration of known and recognised facts. Mr. Churchill Babington
          (Character of the Clergy, &amp;c., considered, p.48) sets aside two of
          Macaulay's authorities, Oldham and T. Wood, because Oldham was an
          Atheist and Wood a Deist. Admitting that an Atheist and a Deist can be
          under no obligation to truth, yet a satirist, who intends to be read,
          is under the most inevitable engagement to the probable. Satire does
          not create the sentiment to which it appeals. A portrait of the
          country parson temp. George the Second which should be drawn verbatim
          from the pamphlets of the day would be no more historical, than is
          that portrait of the begging friar of the sixteenth century which our
          historians repeat after Erasmus and the Epistolæ Obscurum Virorum.
          History may be extracted from them, but these caricatures are not
          themselves history.
        </p>
        <p>
          One inference which we may safely draw is that public feeling
          encouraged such representations. It is a symptom of the religious
          temper of the times, that the same public which compelled the Deist to
          wear the mask of 'solemn sneer' in his assaults upon Christian
          doctrine required no such disguise or reserve when the ministers of
          the Church were spoken of. Nor does the evidence consist in a few
          stray extracts from here and there a Deist or a cynic, it is the tone
          of all the popular writers of that time. The unedifying lives of the
          clergy are a standard theme of sarcasm, and continue to be so till a
          late period in the century, when a gradual change may be observed in
          the language of literature. This antipathy to the clergy visible in
          the Hanoverian period, admits of comparison with that vein which
          colours the popular songs of the Wickliffite era. In the fifteenth
          century, the satire is not indiscriminate. It is against the monks and
          friars, the bishops and cardinals, as distinct from the poor persoun
          of a toun.' Its point against the organized hypocrisy of the Papal
          Churchmen is given it by the picture of the ideal minister of
          Christe's Gospel' which always accompanies the burlesque. In the
          eighteenth century the license of satire goes much beyond this. In the
          early part of the century we find clerical satire observing to some
          extent a similar discrimination. The Tory parson is libelled always
          with an ostentatious reserve of commendation for the more enlightened
          and liberal Hanoverian, the staunch maintainer of the Protestant
          succession. This is the tone of the Independent Whig, one of the
          numerous weekly sheets called into being in imitation of the Tatler.
          It was started in 1720, taking for its exclusive theme the clergy,
          whom it was its avowed object to abuse. A paper came out every
          Wednesday. It was not a newspaper, and does not deal in libel or
          personalities, hardly ever mentioning a name, very rarely quoting a
          fact, but dilating in general terms upon clerical ignorance and
          bigotry. This dull and worthless trash not only had a considerable
          circulation at the time, but was reprinted, and passed through several
          editions in a collected form. The bishops talked of prohibiting it,
          but, on second thoughts, acted more wisely in taking no notice of it.
          The only part of the kingdom into which it could not find entrance was
          the Isle of Man, where the saintly Wilson combined with apostolic
          virtues much of the old episcopal claims over the consciences of his
          flock. The Independent Whig, though manifestly written by a man of no
          religion, yet finds it necessary to keep up the appearance of
          encouraging the better sort' of clergy, and affecting to despise only
          the political priests, the meddling chaplain, the preferment-hunter,
          the toper, who is notable at bowls, and dexterous at whisk.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we advance towards the middle of the century, and the French
          influence begins to mingle with pure English Deism, the spirit of
          contempt spreads till it involves all priests of all religions. The
          language now is, The established clergy in every country are generally
          the greatest enemies to all kinds of reformation, as they are
          generally the most narrow-minded and most worthless set of men in
          every country. Fortunately for the present times, the wings of
          clerical power and influence are pretty close trimmed, so that I do
          not think their opposition to the proposed reformations could be of
          any great consequence, more of the people being inclined to despise
          them, than to follow them blindly.' (Burgh, Political Disquisition,
          1774.) It was no longer for their vices that the clergy were reviled,
          for the philosopher now had come to understand that their virtues were
          more dangerous' to society. Strictness of life did but increase the
          dislike with which the clergyman was regarded; his morality was but
          double-dyed hypocrisy; religious language from his mouth was
          methodistical cant. Nor did the orthodox attempt to struggle with this
          sentiment. They yielded to it, and adopted for their maxim of conduct,
          surtout point de zèle.' Their sermons and pamphlets were now directed
          against Enthusiasm,' which became the bugbear of that time. Every
          clergyman, who wished to retain any influence over the minds of his
          parishioners, was anxious to vindicate himself from all suspicion of
          enthusiasm. When he had set himself right in this respect, he
          endeavoured to do the same good office for the Apostles. But if he
          were not an enthusiast,' he was an impostor.' For every clergyman of
          the Church had against him an antecedent presumption as a priest.' It
          was now well understood, by all enlightened men, that the whole
          sacerdotal brood were but a set of impostors, who lived by deceiving
          the people, and who had invented religion for their own benefit.
          Natural religion needed no priests' to uphold it; it was obvious to
          every understanding, and could maintain itself in the world without
          any confraternity sworn to the secret.

          Again came a change. As the Methodist movement gradually leavened the
          mass beneath, zeal came again into credit. The old Wickliffite, or
          Puritan, distinction is revived between the Gospel preachers' and the
          dumb dogs.' The antipathy to priests was no longer promiscuous.
          Popular indignation was reserved for the fox-hunter and the pluralist;
          the Hophni and Phinehas generation; the men, who are described as
          careless of dispensing the bread of life to their flocks, preaching a
          carnal and soul-benumbing morality, and trafficking in the souls of
          men by receiving money for discharging the pastoral office in parishes
          where they did not so much as look on the faces of the people more
          than once a year.' In the well-known satire of Cowper, it is no longer
          irreligious mocking at sacred things under pretence of a virtuous
          indignation. It becomes again what it was before the Reformation -- an
          earnest feeling, a religious sentiment, the moral sense of man; Huss
          or Savonarola appealing to the written morality of the Gospel against
          the practical immorality consecrated by Church.

          Something too of the old anti-hierarchical feeling accompanies this
          revival of the influence of the inferior clergy; a faint reflection of
          the bitter hatred which the Lollard had borne to pope and cardinal, or
          Puritan to Prelacy.' The utility of the episcopal and capitular
          dignities continued to be questioned long after the evangelical parish
          pastor had re-established himself in the affections of his flock, and
          1832 saw the cathedrals go down amid the general approbation of all
          classes. In the earlier half of the century the reverse was the case.
          The boorish country parson was the man whose order was despised then,
          and his utility questioned. The Freethinkers themselves could not deny
          that the bench and the stalls were graced by some whose wit,
          reputation, and learning would have made them considerable in any
          profession. The higher clergy had with them the town and the mart, the
          country clergy sided with the squires. The mass of the clergy were not
          in sympathy, either politically or intellectually, with their
          ecclesiastical superiors. The Tory fox-hunter in the Freeholder
          (No.22.) thinks the neighbouring shire very happy for having scarce a
          Presbyterian in it except the bishop;' while Hickes thanks God that
          the main body of the clergy are in their hearts Jacobites.' The
          bishops of George the Second deserved the respect they met with. At no
          period in the history of our Church has the ecclesiastical patronage
          of the crown been better directed than while it was secretly dispensed
          by Queen Caroline. For a brief period, liberality and cultivation of
          mind were passports to promotion in the Church. Nor were politics a
          hindrance; the queen earnestly pressed an English see upon Bishop
          Wilson. The corruption which began with the Duke of Newcastle (1746)
          gradually deepened in the subsequent reign, as political orthodoxy and
          connexion were made the tests, and the borough-holders divided the
          dignities of the Church among their adherents.

          Of an age so solid and practical it was not to be expected that its
          theology and metaphysics would mount into the more remote spheres of
          abstraction. Their line of argument was, as has been seen, regulated
          by the necessity they laid themselves under of appealing to sound
          sense and common reason. But not only was their treatment of their
          topic popular, the motive of their writings was an immediate practical
          necessity. Bishops and deans might be made for merit, but it was not
          mere literary merit, classical scholarship, or University distinction.
          The Deistical controversy did not originate, like some other
          controversies which have made much noise in their time, in speculative
          fancy, in the leisure of the cloister, or the college. It had a living
          practical interest in its complication with the questions of the day.
          The endeavour of the moralists and divines of the period to
          rationalize religion was in fact an effort to preserve the practical
          principles of moral and religious conduct for society. It was not an
          academical disputation, or a contest of wits for superiority, but a
          life and death struggle of religious and moral feeling to maintain
          itself. What they felt they had to contend against was moral
          depravity, and not theological error; they wrote less in the interest
          of truth than in that of virtue. A general relaxation of manners, in
          all classes of society, is universally affirmed to be characteristic
          of that time; and theology and philosophy applied themselves to combat
          this. A striking instance of this is Bishop Berekely, the only
          metaphysical writer of the time, besides Locke, who has maintained a
          very high name in philosophical history. He forms a solitary -- it
          might seem a singular -- exception to what has been said of the
          prosaic and unmetaphysical character of this moralising age. The two
          peculiar metaphysical notions which are connected with Berkeley's
          name, and which, though he did not originate, he propounded with a
          novelty and distinctness equal to originality, have always ranked as
          being on the extreme verge of rational speculation, if not actually
          within the region of unfruitful paradox and metaphysical romance.
          These two memorable speculations, as propounded by Berkeley in the
          Alciphron, come before us not as a Utopian dream, or an ingenious play
          of reason, but interwoven in a polemic against the prevailing
          unbelief. They are made to bend to a most practical purpose, and are
          Berkeley's contribution to the Deistical controversy. The character of
          the man, too, was more in harmony with the plain utilitarian spirit of
          his time than with his own refining intellect. He was not a
          closet-thinker like his master Malebranche, but a man of the world and
          of society, inquisitive and well informed in many branches of
          practical science. Practical schemes, social and philanthropic,
          occupied his mind more than abstract thinking. In pushing the received
          metaphysical creed to its paradoxical consequences, as much as much as
          in prescribing tar-water,' he was thinking only of an immediate
          benefit to mankind.' He seems to have thought nothing of his argument
          until he had brought it to bear on the practical question of the day.

          Were the corruption of manners' merely the complaint of one party or
          set of writers, a cry of factious Puritanism, or of men who were at
          war with society, like the Nonjuring clergy, or of a few isolated
          individuals of superior piety, like William Law, it would be easily
          explicable. The world' at all times, and in all countries, can be
          described with truth as lying in wickedness,' and the rebuke of the
          preacher of righteousness is equally needed in every age. There cannot
          be a darker picture than that drawn by the Fathers of the third
          century of the morals of the Christians in their time. (See passages
          in Jewel's Apology.) The rigorous moralist, heathen or Christian, can
          always point in sharp contrast the vices and the belief of mankind.
          But, after making every allowance for the exaggeration of religious
          rhetoric, and the querulousness of defeated parties, there seems to
          remain some real evidence for ascribing to that age a more than usual
          moral licence, and contempt of external restraints. It is the
          concurrent testimony of men of all parties, it is the general strain
          of the most sensible and worldly divines, prosperous men who lived
          with this very world they censure, men whose code of morals was not
          large nor their standard exacting. To attempt the inquiry what
          specific evils were meant by the general expressions decay of
          religion' and corruption of manners,' the stereotype phrases of the
          time, is not within the limits of this paper. No historian, as far as
          I am aware, has attempted this examination; all have been content to
          render, without valuation, the charges as they find them. I shall
          content myself with producing here one statement of contemporary
          opinion on this point; for which purpose I select a layman, David
          Hartley. (Observations on Man, vol.ii. p.441.)

          There are six things which seem more especially to threaten ruin and
          dissolution to the present States of Christendom.
        </p>
        <p>
          1st. The great growth of atheism and infidelity, particularly amongst
          the governing parts of these States.
        </p>
        <p>
          2nd. The open and abandoned lewdness to which great numbers of both
          sexes, especially in the high ranks of life, have given themselves up.
        </p>
        <p>
          3rd. The sordid and avowed self-interest, which is almost the sole
          motive of action in those who are concerned in the administration of
          public affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          4th. The licentiousness and contempt of every kind of authority,
          divine or human, which is so notorious in inferiors of all ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          5th. The great worldly-mindedness of the clergy, and their gross
          neglect in the discharge of their proper functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          6th. The carelessness and infatuation of parents and magistrates with
          respect to the education of youth, and the consequent early corruption
          of the rising generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these things have evident mutual connexions and influences; and as
          they all seem likely to increase from time to time, so can scarce be
          doubted by a considerate man, whether he be a religious one or no, but
          that they will, sooner or later bring on a total dissolution of all
          the forms of government that subsist at present in the Christian
          countries of Europe.'
        </p>

          Though there is this entire unanimity as to the fact of the prevailing
          corruption, there is the greatest diversity of opinion as to its
          cause. Each party is found in turn attributing it to the neglect or
          disbelief of the abstract propositions in which its own particular
          creed is expressed. The Nonjurors and High-Churchmen attribute it to
          the Toleration Act and the latitudinarianism allowed in high places.
          One of the very popular pamphlets of the year 1721 was a fast-sermon
          preached before the Lord Mayor by Edmund Massey, in which he
          enumerates the evils of the time, and affirms that they are justly
          chargeable upon the corrupt explication of those words of our Saviour,
          My kingdom is not of this world' -- i.e., upon Hoadley's celebrated
          sermon. The latitudinarian clergy divide the blame between the
          Freethinkers and the Nonjurors. The Freethinkers point to the
          hypocrisy of the Clergy, who, they say, lost all credit with the
          people by having preached passive obedience' up to 1688, and then
          suddenly finding out that it was not a scriptural truth. The
          Nonconformists lay it to the enforcement of conformity and
          unscriptural terms of communion;; while the Catholics rejoice to see
          in it the Protestant Reformation at last bearing its natural fruit.
          Warburton characteristically attributes it to the bestowal of
          preferment' by the Walpole administration. (Dedication to Lord
          Mansfield, Works, ii.268.) The power of preferment was not
          under-estimated then. George II. maintained to the last that the
          growth of Methodism was entirely owing to ministers not having
          listened to his advice, and made Whitefield a bishop.' Lastly, that
          everyone may have his say, a professor of moral philosophy in our day
          is found attributing the same facts to the prevalence of that low view
          of morality which rests its rules upon consequences merely.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The reverence which,' says Dr. Whewell, handed down by the traditions
          of ages of moral and religious teaching, had hitherto protected the
          accustomed forms of moral good, was gradually removed. Vice, and
          crime, and sin, ceased to be words that terrified the popular
          speculator. Virtue, and goodness, and purity were no longer things
          which he looked up to with mute respect. He ventured to lay a
          sacrilegious hand even upon these hallowed shapes. He saw that when
          this had been dared by audacious theorists, those objects, so long
          venerated, seemed to have no power of punishing the bold intruder.
          There was a scene like that which occurred when the barbarians broke
          into the Eternal City. At first, in spite of themselves, they were
          awed by the divine aspect of the ancient magistrates; but when once
          their leader had smitten one these venerable figures with impunity,
          the coarse and violent mob rushed onwards, and exultingly mingled all
          in one common destruction.' (Moral Philosophy in England, p.79.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual sequence of cause and effect seems, if it be not
          presumptuous to say so, to be as nearly as possible inverted in this
          eloquent statement. The licentiousness of talk and manners was not
          produced by the moral doctrines promulgated; but the doctrine of moral
          consequences was had recourse to by the divines and moralists as the
          most likelyremedy of the prevailing licentiousness. It was an attempt,
          well-meant but not successful, to arrest the wanton proceedings of the
          coarse and violent mob.' Good men saw with alarm, almost with despair,
          that what they said in the obsolete language of religious teaching was
          not listened to, and tried to address the age in plain and
          unmistakeable terms. The new theory of consequences not introduced by
          men of leisure' to supplant and overthrow a nobler and purer view of
          religion and morality, it was a plain fact of religion stated in plain
          language, in the hope of deterring the wicked from his wickedness. It
          was the address of the Old Testament prophet, Why will ye die, O house
          of Israel?' That there is a God and moral governor, and that obedience
          to His commands is necessary to secure our interests in this world and
          the next -- if any form of rational belief can control the actions of
          a rational being, it is surely this. On the rationalist hypothesis,
          the morality of consequences ought to produce the most salutary
          effects on the general behaviour of mankind. This obligation of
          obedience, the appeal to our desire of our own welfare, was the
          substance of the practical teaching of the age. It was stated with
          great cogency of reasoning, and enforced with every variety of
          illustration. Put its proof at the lowest, let it be granted that they
          did not succeed in removing all the objections of the Deistical
          writers, it must, at least, be allowed that they showed, to the
          satisfaction of all prudent and thinking men, that it was safer to
          believe Christianity true than not. The obligation to practice in
          point of prudence was as perfect as though the proof had been
          demonstrative. And what was the surprising result? That the more they
          demonstrated the less people believed. As the proof of morality was
          elaborated and strengthened, the more it was disregarded, the more
          ungodliness and profaneness flourished and grew. This is certainly not
          what we should antecedently expect. If, as Dr. Whewell assumes, and
          the whole doctrinaire school with him, the speculative belief of an
          age determines its moral character, that should be the purest epoch
          where the morality of consequences is placed in the strongest light --
          when it is most convincingly set before men that their present and
          future welfare depends on how they act; that all we enjoy and great
          part of what we suffer, is placed in our own hands.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience, however, the testimony of history, displays to us a result
          the very reverse. The experiment of the eighteenth century may surely
          be considered as a decisive one on this point. The failure of a
          prudential system of ethics as a restraining force upon. society was
          perceived, or felt in the way of reaction, by the Evangelical and
          Methodist generation of teachers who succeeded the Hanoverian divines.
          So far their perception was just. They went on to infer that, because
          the circulation of one system of belief had been inefficacious, they
          should try the effect of inculcating a set of truths as widely remote
          from the former as possible. Because legal preaching, as they phrased
          it, had failed, they would essay Gospel preaching. The preaching of
          justification by works had not the power to check wickedness,
          therefore justification by faith, the doctrine of the Reformation, was
          the only saving truth. This is not meant as a complete account of the
          origin of the Evangelical school. It is only one point of view -- that
          point which connects the school with the general line of thought this
          paper has been pursuing. Their doctrine of conversion by supernatural
          influence must on no account be forgotten. Yet it appears that they
          thought the channel of this supernatural influence was, in some way or
          other, preaching. Preaching, too, not as rhetoric, but as the
          annunciation of a specific doctrine -- the Gospel. They certainly
          insisted on the heart' being touched, and that the Spirit only had the
          power savingly to affect the heart; but they acted as though this were
          done by an appeal to the reason, and scornfully rejected the idea of
          religious education.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should also be remarked that even the divines of the Hanoverian
          school were not wholly blind to some flaw in their theory, and to the
          practical inefficacy of their doctrine. Not that they underrated the
          force of their demonstrations. As has been already said, the greater
          part of them over-estimated their convincingness, but they could not
          but see that they did not, in fact convince. When this was forced upon
          their observation, when they perceived that an a priori demonstration
          of religion might be placed before a man, and that he did not see its
          force, then, inconsequent with their own theory, they had recourse to
          the notion of moral culpability. If a person refused to admit the
          evidence for revelation, it was because he did not examine it with a
          dispassionate mind. His understanding was biassed by his wishes; some
          illicit passion he was resolved on gratifying, but which prudence,
          forsooth, would not have allowed him to gratify so long as he
          continued to believe in a future judgment. The wish that there were no
          God suggested the thought that there is not. Speculative unbelief is
          thus asserted to be a consequence of a bad heart: it is the grounds
          upon which we endeavour to prove to ourselves and others that the
          indulgence of our passions is consistent with a rational prudence. As
          levelled against an individual opponent, this is a poor controversial
          shift. Many of the Deists were men of worth and probity; of none of
          them is anything known which would make them worse men than the
          average their class in life. Mr. Chichester (Deism compared with
          Christianity, 1821, vol. iii. p.220) says Tindal was infamous for vice
          in general;' but I have not able to trace his authority for the
          assertion. As an imputation not against individual unbelievers, but
          against the competency of reason in general, it may be true, but is
          quite inconsistent with the general hypothesis of the school of
          reasoners who brought it. If reason be liable to an influence which
          warps it, then there is required some force which shall keep this
          influence under, and reason alone is no longer the all-sufficient
          judge of truth. In this way we should be forced back to the old
          orthodox doctrine of the chronic' impotence of reason, superinduced
          upon it by the Fall; a doctrine which the reigning orthodoxy had
          tacitly renounced.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Catholic theory the feebleness of Reason is met half-way and
          made good by the authority of the Church. When the Protestants threw
          off this authority, they did not assign to Reason what they took from
          the Church, but to Scripture. Calvin did not shrink from saying that
          Scripture shone sufficiently by its own light.' As long as this could
          be kept to, the Protestant theory of belief was whole and sound. At
          least it was as sound as the Catholic. In both, Reason, aided by
          spiritual illumination, performs the subordinate function of
          recognising the supreme authority of the Church, and of the Bible,
          respectively. Time, learned controversy, and abatement of zeal drove
          the Protestants generally from the hardy but irrational assertion of
          Calvin. Every foot of ground that Scripture lost was gained by one or
          other of the three substitutes: Church-authority, the Spirit, or
          Reason. Church-authority was essayed by the Laudian divines, but was
          soon found untenable, for on that footing it was found impossible to
          justify the Reformation and the breach with Rome. The Spirit then came
          into favour along with Independency. But it was still more quickly
          discovered that on such a basis only discord and disunion could be
          reared. There remained to be tried Common Reason, carefully
          distinguished from recondite learning, and not based on metaphysical
          assumptions. To apply this instrument to the contents of Revelation
          was the occupation of the early half of the eighteenth century; with
          what success has been seen. In the latter part the century the same
          Common Reason was applied to the external evidences. But here the
          method fails in a first requisite -- universality; for even the
          shallowest array of historical proof requires some book-learning to
          apprehend. Further than this, the Lardner and Paley school could not
          complete their proof satisfactorily, inasmuch as the materials for the
          investigation of the first and second centuries of the Christian era
          were not at hand.

          Such appears to be the past history of the Theory of Belief in the
          Church of England. Whoever would take the religious literature of the
          present day as a whole, and endeavour to make out clearly on what
          basis Revelation is supposed by it to rest, whether on Authority, on
          the Inward Light, on Reason, on self-evidencing Scripture, or on the
          combination of the four, or some of them, and in what proportions,
          would probably find that he had undertaken a perplexing but not
          altogether profitless inquiry.<br />
