<p align="center">PSALM 27 <br/>
 </p>
</b></font>
<p align="justify">TITLE AND SUBJECT. Nothing whatever can be drawn from the 
    title as to the time when this Psalm was written, for the heading, "A Psalm 
    of David," is common to so many of the Psalms; but if one may judge from the 
    matter of the song, the writer <br/>
    was pursued by enemies, Verses 2-3, <br/>
    was shut out from the house of the Lord, Verse 4, <br/>
    was just parting from father and mother, Verse 10,<br/>
    was subject to slander, Verse 12.</p>
<p align="justify">Do not all these meet in the time when Doeg, the Edomite, 
    spoke against him to Saul? It is a song of cheerful hope, well fitted for 
    those in trial who have learned to lean upon the Almighty arm. The Psalm may 
    with profit be read in a threefold way, <br/>
    as the language of David,<br/>
    as the language of the Church,<br/>
    as the language of the Lord Jesus. </p>
<p align="justify">The plenitude of Scripture will thus appear the more 
    wonderful.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">DIVISION. </p>
<p align="justify">The poet first sounds forth his sure confidence in his 
    God, Verses 1-3, </p>
<p align="justify">and his love of communion with him, Verses 4-6. </p>
<p align="justify">He then betakes himself to prayer, Verses 7-12, </p>
<p align="justify">and concludes with an acknowledgment of the sustaining 
    power of faith in his own case, and an exhortation to others to follow his 
    example, Verses 13-14.<br/>
 </p>
<p align="justify">EXPOSITION</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 1. The Lord is my light and my salvation.</p></b> Here 
    is personal interest, "my light," "my salvation;" the soul is assured of it, 
    and therefore, declaring it boldly. "My light;"—into the soul at the new 
    birth divine light is poured as the precursor of salvation. Where there is 
    not enough light to see our own darkness and to long for the Lord Jesus, 
    there is no evidence of salvation. Salvation finds us in the dark, but it 
    does not leave us there; it gives light to those who sit in the valley of 
    the shadow of death. 
<p align="justify">After conversion our God is our joy, comfort, guide, 
    teacher, and in every sense our light. He is light within, light around, 
    light reflected from us, and light to be revealed to us.</p>
<p align="justify">Note, it is not said merely that the Lord gives light, 
    but that he "is" light; nor that he gives salvation, but that he IS 
    salvation. He, then, who by faith has laid hold upon God has all covenant 
    blessings in his possession. Every light is not the sun, but the sun is the 
    father of all lights. This being made sure as a fact, the argument drawn 
    from it is put in the form of a question, <b>Whom shall I fear? </b></p>

<p align="justify">A question which is its own answer. The powers of 
    darkness are not to be feared, for the Lord, our light, destroys them. The 
    damnation of Hell is not to be dreaded by us, for the Lord is our salvation. 
    This is a very different challenge from that of boastful Goliath, for it is 
    based upon a very different foundation; it rests not upon the conceited 
    vigor of an arm of flesh, but upon the real power of the omnipotent I AM.
    </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The Lord is the strength of my life.</p></b> Here is a third 
    glowing epithet, to show that the writer's hope was fastened with a 
    threefold cord which could not be broken. We may well accumulate terms of 
    praise where the Lord lavishes deeds of grace. Our life derives all its 
    strength from him who is the author if it; and if he deigns to make us 
    strong we cannot be weakened by all the machinations of the adversary. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Of whom shall I be afraid?</p></b> The bold question looks 
    into the future as well as the present. "If God is for us, then who can be 
    against us," either now or in time to come?
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 2.</p></b> This verse records a past deliverance, and 
    is an instance of the way in which experience should be employed to reassure 
    our faith in times of trial. Each word is instructive. 
<b>
<p align="justify">When the wicked.</p></b> <i>It is a hopeful sign for us when 
    the wicked hate us</i>; if our foes were godly men it would be a sore 
    sorrow, but <i>as for the wicked their hatred is better than their love. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Even my enemies and my foes.</p></b> There were many of them, 
    they were of different sorts, but they were unanimous in mischief and hearty 
    in hatred.
<b>
<p align="justify">Came upon me</p></b>—advanced to the attack, leaping upon the 
    victim like a lion upon its prey. 
<b>
<p align="justify">To eat up my flesh</p></b>, like cannibals they would make a 
    full end of the man, tear him limb from limb, and make a feast for their 
    malice. 
<p align="justify">The enemies of our souls are not deficient in ferocity, 
    they yield no quarter, and ought to have none in return. </p>
<p align="justify">See in what danger David was; in the grip and grasp of 
    numerous, powerful, and cruel enemies, and yet observe his perfect safety 
    and their utter discomfiture! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">They stumbled and fell.</p></b> God's breath blew them off 
    their legs. There were stones in the way which they never reckoned upon, and 
    over these they made an ignominious tumble. This was literally true in the 
    case of our Lord in Gethsemane, when those who came to take him went 
    backward and fell to the ground; and herein he was a prophetic 
    representative of all wrestling believers who, rising from their knees 
    shall, by the power of faith, throw their foes upon their faces.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 3. Though an host should encamp against me, my 
    heart shall not fear. </p></b>Before the actual conflict, while as yet the 
    battle is untried, the warrior's heart, being held in suspense, is very 
    liable to become fluttered. The encamping host often inspires greater dread 
    than the same host in actual affray. Young tells us of some "Who feel a 
    thousand deaths in fearing one." Doubtless the shadow of anticipated trouble 
    is, to timorous minds, a more prolific source of sorrow than the trouble 
    itself. But faith puts a strengthening plaster to the back of courage, and 
    throws out of the window the dregs of the cup of trembling. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Though war should rise against me, in this will I be 
    confident.</p></b> When it actually comes to push of pike, faith's shield will 
    ward off the blow; and if the first brush should be but the beginning of a 
    war—yet faith's banners will wave in spite of the foe. Though battle should 
    succeed battle, and one campaign should be followed by another, the believer 
    will not be dismayed at the length of the conflict. 
<p align="justify">Reader, this third verse is the comfortable and logical 
    inference from the second, confidence is the child of experience. Have you 
    been delivered out of great perils? then set up your ensign, wait at your 
    watch fire, and let the enemy do his worst.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 4. One thing.</p></b> Divided aims tend to distraction, 
    weakness, disappointment. The man of one book is eminent, the man of one 
    pursuit is successful. <i>Let all our affections be bound up in one 
    affection, and that affection set upon heavenly things. 
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Have I desired</p></b>—what we cannot at once attain, it is 
    well to desire. <i>God judges us very much by the desire of our hearts. </i>
    He who rides a lame horse is not blamed by his master for want of speed, if 
    he makes all the haste he can, and would make more if he could, God takes 
    the will, for the deed with his children. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Of the Lord. </p></b>This is the right target for desires, 
    this is the well into which to dip our buckets, this is the door to knock 
    at, the bank to draw upon. Desire of men, and lie upon the dunghill with 
    Lazarus. Desire of the Lord, and to be carried of angels into Abraham's 
    bosom.<i> Our desires of the Lord should be sanctified, humble, constant, 
    submissive, fervent, </i>and it is well if, as with the psalmist, they are 
    all molten into one mass. 
<p align="justify">Under David's painful circumstances we might have 
    expected him to desire repose, safety, and a thousand other good things, but 
    no, he has set his heart on the pearl, and leaves the rest. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">That will I seek after. </p></b><i>Holy desires must lead to 
    resolute action</i>. The old proverb says, "Wishers and woulders are never 
    good housekeepers," and "wishing never fills a sack." <i>Desires are seed 
    which must be sown in the good soil of activity, or they will yield no 
    harvest</i>. We shall find our desires to be like clouds without rain, 
    unless followed up by practical endeavors. 
<b>
<p align="justify">That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of 
    my life.</p></b> For the sake of communion with the King, David longed to dwell 
    always in the palace. So far from being wearied with the services of the 
    Tabernacle, he longed to be constantly engaged in them, as his life long 
    pleasure. He desired above all things to be one of the household of God, a 
    home born child, living at home with his Father. 
<p align="justify">This is our dearest wish, only we extend it to those days 
    of our immortal life which have not yet dawned.<i> We pine for our Father's 
    house above, the home of our souls; if we may but dwell there forever, we 
    care but little for the goods or ills of this poor life</i>. "Jerusalem the 
    golden" is the one and only goal of our heart's longings. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">To behold the beauty of the Lord.</p></b> An exercise both 
    for earthly and heavenly worshipers. We must not enter the assemblies of the 
    saints in order to see and be seen, or merely to hear the minister. We must 
    repair to the gatherings of the righteous, <i>intent upon the gracious 
    object of learning more of the loving Father, more of the glorified Jesus, 
    more of the mysterious Spirit, in order that we may the more lovingly 
    admire, and the more reverently adore our glorious God</i>. 
<p align="justify">What a word is that, "the beauty of the Lord!" Think of 
    it, dear reader! Better far—behold it by faith! What a sight will that be 
    when every faithful follower of Jesus shall behold "the King in his beauty!" 
    Oh, for that infinitely blessed vision! </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">And to inquire in his temple.</p></b> We should make our 
    visits to the Lord's house enquirers' meetings. Not seeking sinners alone, 
    but assured saints should be enquirers. We must inquire as to the will of 
    God and how we may do it; as to our interest in the heavenly city, and how 
    we may be more assured of it. We shall not need to make inquiries in Heaven, 
    for there we shall know even as we are known; but meanwhile we should sit at 
    Jesus' feet, and awaken all our faculties to learn of him.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 5.</p></b> This verse gives an excellent reason for the 
    psalmist's desire after communion with God, namely, that he was thus secured 
    in the hour of peril. 
<b>
<p align="justify">For in the time of trouble</p></b>—that needy time, that time 
    when others forsake me.
<b>
<p align="justify">He shall hide me in his pavilion</p></b>—he shall give me the 
    best of shelter in the worst of danger. The royal pavilion was erected in 
    the center of the army, and around it all the mighty men kept guard at all 
    hours. Thus in that divine sovereignty which almighty power is sworn to 
    maintain, the believer peacefully is hidden, hidden not by himself 
    furtively, but by the king, who hospitably entertains him. 
<b>
<p align="justify">In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me.</p></b> 
    Sacrifice aids sovereignty in screening the elect from harm. No one of old 
    dared to enter the most holy place on pain of death; and if the Lord has 
    hidden his people there, what foe shall venture to molest them? 
<b>
<p align="justify">He shall set me up upon a rock.</p></b> Immutability, 
    eternity, and infinite <i>power </i>here come to the aid of <i>sovereignty
    </i>and sacrifice. How blessed is the standing of the man whom God himself 
    sets on high above his foes, upon an impregnable rock which never can be 
    stormed! Well may we desire to dwell with the Lord who so effectually 
    protects his people.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 6. And now shall my head be lifted up above my 
    enemies round about me. </p></b>He is quite sure of it. Godly men of old prayed 
    in faith, nothing wavering, and spoke of their answer to their prayers as a 
    certainty. 
<p align="justify">David was by faith so sure of a glorious victory over all 
    those who beset him, that he arranged in his own heart what he would do when 
    his foes lay all prostrate before him; that arrangement was such as 
    gratitude suggested. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of 
    joy. </p></b>That place for which he longed in his conflict, should see his 
    thankful joy in his triumphant return. He does not speak of jubilations to 
    be offered in his palace, and feastings in his banqueting halls—but holy 
    mirth he selects as most fitting for so divine a deliverance. 
<b>
<p align="justify">I will sing. </p></b>This is the most natural mode of 
    expressing thankfulness. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Yes, I will sing praises unto the Lord.</p></b> The vow is 
    confirmed by repetition, and explained by addition, which addition vows all 
    the praise unto Jehovah. Let who will be silent, the believer when his 
    prayer is heard, must and will make his praise to be heard also. <i>Let who 
    will sing unto the vanities of the world, the believer reserves his music 
    for the Lord alone.
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 7. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice.</p></b> <i>
    The pendulum of spirituality swings from prayer to praise</i>. The voice 
    which in the last verse was tuned to music, is here turned to crying. As a 
    good soldier, David knew how to handle his weapons, and found himself much 
    at home with the weapon of "all prayer." Note his concern to be heard.
<p align="justify">Pharisees care not a fig for the Lord's hearing them, so 
    long as they are heard by men, or charm their own pride with their fine 
    sounding devotions. But <i>with a genuine Christian, the Lord's ear is 
    everything. The voice may be profitably used even in private prayer; for 
    though it is unnecessary, it is often helpful, and aids in preventing 
    distractions. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Have mercy also upon me.</p></b> Mercy is the hope of sinners 
    and the refuge of saints. All acceptable petitioners dwell much upon this 
    attribute. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And answer me. </p></b>We may expect answers to prayer, and 
    should not be easy without them any more than we should be if we had written 
    a letter to a friend upon important business, and had received no reply.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 8.</p></b> In this verse we are taught that if we would 
    have the Lord hear our voice, we must be careful to respond to his voice. 
    The true heart should echo the will of God as the rocks among the Alps 
    repeat in sweetest music the notes of the peasant's horn. 
<p align="justify">Observe, that the command was in the plural, to all the 
    saints. But the man of God turned it into the singular by a personal 
    application, <b>Your face, Lord, I will seek. </b></p>
<p align="justify">The voice of the Lord is very effectual where all other 
    voices fail. When you said—then my heart, my inmost nature was moved to 
    an obedient reply.</p>
<p align="justify">Note the promptness of the response—no sooner said than 
    done. As soon as God said "seek, "the heart said, "I will seek." </p>
<p align="justify">Oh, for more of this holy readiness! Would to God that we 
    were more plastic to the divine hand, more sensitive to the touch of God's 
    Spirit.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 9. Hide not your face far from me.</p></b> The word 
    "far" is not in the original, and is a very superfluous addition of the 
    translators, since even the least hiding of the Lord's face is a great 
    affliction to a believer.
<p align="justify">The command to seek the Lord's face would be a painful 
    one if the Lord, by withdrawing himself, rendered it impossible for the 
    seeker to meet with him. <i>A smile from the Lord is the greatest of 
    comforts—but his frown is the worst of ills. </i></p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Put not your servant away in anger.</p></b> Other servants 
    had been put away when they proved unfaithful, as for instance, his 
    predecessor Saul; and this made David, while conscious of many faults, most 
    anxious that divine longsuffering should continue him in favor. 
<p align="justify">This is a most appropriate prayer for <i>us </i>under a 
    similar sense of unworthiness. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">You have been my help.</p></b> How truly can we join in this 
    declaration of many years, in circumstances of varied trial, we have been 
    upheld by our God, and must and will confess our obligation. "Ingratitude," 
    it is said, "is natural to fallen man," but to spiritual men it is unnatural 
    and detestable. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Leave me not, neither forsake me.</p></b> A prayer for the 
    future, and an inference from the past. If the Lord had meant to leave us, 
    why did he begin with us? Past help is but a waste of effort if the soul now 
    be deserted. 
<p align="justify">The first petition, "leave me not," may refer to 
    temporary desertions, and the second word to the final withdrawal of grace, 
    both are to be prayed against; and concerning the second, we have immutable 
    promises to urge. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">O God of my salvation. </p></b>A sweet title worthy of much 
    meditation.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 10. When my father and my mother forsake me. </p></b>
    These dear relations will be the last to desert me, but<i> if the milk of 
    human kindness should dry up even from their breasts, there is a Father who 
    never forgets. </i>Some of the greatest of the saints have been cast out by 
    their families, and persecuted for righteousness' sake. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Then the Lord will take me up. </p></b>He will espouse my 
    cause, will uplift me from my woes, will carry me in his arms, will elevate 
    me above my enemies, and will at last receive me to his eternal dwelling 
    place.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 11. Teach me your way, O Lord. </p></b>He does not pray 
    to be indulged with his own way, but to be informed as to the path in which 
    the righteous Jehovah would have him walk. This prayer evinces . . .
<p align="justify">a humble sense of personal ignorance,<br/>
    great teachableness of spirit, and<br/>
    cheerful obedience of heart. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Lead me in a plain path.</p></b> Help is here sought as well 
    as direction. We not only need a <i>map </i>of the way, but a <i>guide </i>
    to assist us in the journey.
<p align="justify">A path is here desired which shall be open, honest, 
    straightforward—in opposition to the way of cunning, which is intricate, 
    tortuous, dangerous. </p>
<p align="justify">Men seldom succeed in fine speculations and doubtful 
    courses; plain simplicity is the best spirit for an heir of Heaven. Let us 
    leave shifty tricks and political expediencies to the citizens of the 
    world—the New Jerusalem owns plain men for its citizens. Esau was a cunning 
    hunter, Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Because of my enemies.</p></b> These will catch us if they 
    can, but the way of manifest, simple honesty is safe from their rage. It is 
    wonderful to observe how <i>honest simplicity </i>baffles and outwits the 
    craftiness of wickedness. Truth is wisdom. "Honesty is the best policy."
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 12. Deliver me not over unto the will of my 
    enemies;</p></b> or I should be like a victim cast to the lions, to be rent in 
    pieces and utterly devoured. 
<p align="justify">God be thanked that our foes cannot have their way with 
    us, or <i>Smithfield </i>would soon be on a blaze again. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">For false witnesses are risen up against me.</p></b> <i>
    Slander is an old-fashioned weapon out of the armory of Hell, and is still 
    in plentiful use</i>. No matter how holy a man may be, there will be some 
    who will defame him. "Give a dog an ill name, and hang him;" but glory be to 
    God, the Lord's people are not dogs, and their ill names do not injure them.
    
<b>
<p align="justify">And such as breathe out cruelty. </p></b>It is their vital 
    breath to hate the good; they cannot speak without cursing them; such was 
    Paul before conversion. <i>They who breathe out cruelty may well expect to 
    be sent to breathe their native air in Hell; let persecutors beware!
</i><b>
<p align="justify">Verse 13. I would have fainted, unless I had believed to 
    see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. </p></b>Faintness of 
    heart is a common infirmity; even he who slew Goliath was subject to its 
    attacks. <i>Faith puts its bottle of cordial to the lip of the soul, and so 
    prevents fainting.</i> <i>Hope is Heaven's balm for present sorrow. </i>In 
    this land of the dying, it is our blessedness to be looking and longing for 
    our fair portion in the land of the living, whence the goodness of God has 
    banished the wickedness of man, and where holy spirits charm with their 
    society those persecuted saints who were vilified and despised among men. We 
    must believe to see—not see to believe. We must wait the appointed time, and 
    stay our soul's hunger with foretastes of the Lord's eternal goodness which 
    shall soon be our feast and our song.
<b>
<p align="justify">Verse 14. Wait on the Lord</p></b>. 
<p align="justify">Wait at his <i>door </i>with prayer. </p>
<p align="justify">Wait at his <i>foot </i>with humility. </p>
<p align="justify">Wait at his <i>table </i>with service. </p>
<p align="justify">Wait at his <i>window </i>with expectancy. </p>
<p align="justify">Suitors often win nothing but the cold shoulder from 
    earthly patrons after long waiting. He speeds best, whose patron is in the 
    skies. </p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Be of good courage. </p></b>A soldier's motto. Be it mine. 
    Courage we shall need, and for the exercise of it we have as much reason as 
    necessity, if we are soldiers of King Jesus. 
<b>
<p align="justify">And he shall strengthen your heart. </p></b>He can lay the 
    plaster right upon the weak place. Let the heart be strengthened, and the 
    whole machine of humanity is filled with power; a strong heart makes a 
    strong arm. What strength is this which God himself gives to the heart? Read 
    the "Book of Martyrs, "and see its glorious deeds of prowess. Go to God 
    rather, and get such power yourself. 
<b>
<p align="justify">Wait, I say, on the Lord.</p></b> David, in the words "I 
    say," sets his own private seal to the word which, as an inspired man, he 
    had been moved to write. It is his testimony as well as the command of God, 
    and indeed he who writes these scanty notes has himself found it so sweet, 
    so reviving, so profitable to draw near to God, that on his own account he 
    also feels bound to write, <i>"Wait, I SAY, on the Lord."
