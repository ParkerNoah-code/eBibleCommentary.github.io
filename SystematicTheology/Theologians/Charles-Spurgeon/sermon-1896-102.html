          5. (t, teth,) He hath given a portion to them that fear him: (y, yod,)
          He will remember his covenant for ever.6. (k, caph,) He hath declared
          to his people the power of his works, (l, lamed,) To give the heritage
          of the heathen to them.7. (m, mem,) The works of his hands are truth
          and judgment; (n, nun,) All his statutes are true.8. (s, samech,) They
          are established for ever, (, ain,) And are done in truth and
          righteousness.

          5 He hath given a portion to them that fear him The Church being a
          mirror of the grace and justice of God, what the prophet said
          respecting them is here expressly applied to her; not that he designs
          to treat of the justice of God, in general, but only of that which he
          peculiarly displays towards his own people. Hence he adds, that God's
          care of his people is such as to lead him to make ample provision for
          the supply of all their wants. The word trph, tereph, which we have
          translated portion, is frequently taken for a prey: others render it
          meat; but I rather choose to render it portion, in which sense it is
          taken in Proverbs 30:8, and Proverbs 31:15; as if he should say, that
          God had given his people all that was needful, and that, considered as
          a portion, it was large and liberal; for we know that the people of
          Israel were enriched, not in consequence of their own industry, but by
          the blessing of God, who, like the father of a family, bestows upon
          his household every thing necessary for their subsistence. In the
          following clause of the verse, he assigns as the reason for his care
          and kindness, his desire of effectually demonstrating that his
          covenant was not null and void. And here it must be carefully
          observed, that if, in former times, and from a respect to his gracious
          covenant, he manifested so great kindness towards the people of
          Israel, in like manner, the goodness which we receive from him is the
          result of our adoption into his family; and because God is never weary
          in showing kindness to his people, he says that the remembrance of his
          covenant shall never be effaced. Moreover, as he daily and constantly
          loads us with his benefits, so our faith must, in some measure,
          correspond with it: it must not fail, but must rise above life and
          death.

          The next verse is subjoined, by way of exposition, for the purpose of
          showing that God, in bestowing upon his people the heritage of the
          heathen, had manifested to them the power of his works. He does indeed
          employ the term show, but he means a true showing; because the
          possession of the Holy Land was not acquired by mere human power, but
          it was given to them by Divine power, and through the working of many
          miracles; and thus God, as it were, openly testified to the
          descendants of Abraham with what incomparable power he is invested. It
          is on this account that he sets up the people of Israel as a match for
          so many other nations, who would assuredly never have vanquished so
          many enemies, unless they had been sustained from on high.

          7 The works of his hands In the first clause of the verse he exclaims
          that God is known to be faithful and upright in his works, and then he
          goes on to extol the same truth and rectitude as pervading the
          doctrine of the law; the amount of which is, that a beautiful harmony
          characterises all the sayings and doings of God, because every where
          he shows himself to be just and faithful. We have a memorable proof of
          this fact in the redemption of his ancient people. Yet I doubt not,
          that, under the term, works, the prophet comprehends the constant
          government of the Church; because God daily and unceasingly shows that
          he is just and true, and unweariedly pursues the same course. Among
          men it is reckoned to be of more importance for one to be found just
          in practice than in profession; yet, as the doctrine of the law was
          the very life and safety of the people, the prophet very properly, and
          in several expressions, dwells upon the sentiment contained in the
          second clause of the verse; saying, all his statutes are true, they
          are established for ever, and are drawn up in perfect accordance with
          the strict law of truth and equity And assuredly, but for God's having
          kept the people united to him by the sacred chain of the law, the
          fruit of their redemption would have been very small, and even that
          benefit would have soon been lost by them. We ought to observe, then,
          that this subject is brought prominently forward in this place;
          because, in attesting the eternal love of God, it became the means of
          imparting life.<br />
