        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.114)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, January 25, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>"The poor have the gospel preached to them." -- Matt.11:5.</p>
        <p>
          JOHN, the forerunner of Christ, had some followers who continued with
          him after Christ had come in the flesh, and openly manifested himself
          among the people. These disciples were in doubt as to whether Jesus
          was the Messiah or no. I believe that John himself had no doubt
          whatever upon the matter, for he had received positive revelations,
          and had given substantial testimonies on the subject. But in order to
          relieve their doubts, John said to his disciples, in some such words,
          "Go and ask him yourselves;" and, therefore, he dispatched them with
          this message, "Tell us whether thou art he that should come, or do we
          look for another?" Jesus Christ continuing his preaching for a while,
          said, "Stay and receive your answer;" and instead of giving them an
          affirmative reply, "I am that Messiah," he said, "Go and show John
          again those things which ye do hear and see: The blind receive their
          sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,
          the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to
          them." As much as to say, "That is my answer; these things are my
          testimonies -- on the one hand, that I come from God, and, on the
          other hand, that I am the Messiah." You will see the truth and force
          of this reply, if you will observe that it was prophesied of the
          Messiah, that he should do the very things which Jesus at that moment
          was doing. It is said of Messias, in the 35th chap. of Isaiah, at the
          5th and 6th verses, "Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and
          the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap
          as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness
          shall waters break out, and streams in the desert." The Jews had
          forgotten this too much; they only looked for a Messiah who should be
          clothed with temporal grandeur and dignity, and they overlooked the
          teaching of Isaiah, that he should be "a man of sorrows and acquainted
          with grief." And besides that, you observe, they overlooked the
          miracles which it was prophesied should attend the coming of the
          glorious one, the King of kings and Lord of lords. Jesus gave this as
          his answer -- a practical demonstration of John's problem, proving to
          an absolute certainty. But he not only referred to the miracles, he
          gave them a further proof -- "The poor have the gospel preached to
          them." This, also, was one evidence that he was Messias. For Isaiah,
          the great Messianic prophet, had said, "He shall preach the gospel
          unto the meek;" that is, the poor. And in that Jesus did so, it was
          proved that he was the man intended by Isaiah. Besides, Zechariah
          mentions the congregation of the poor who attend on him, and therein
          evidently foretold the coming of Jesus Christ, the preacher to the
          poor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall not, however, dwell upon these circumstances this morning; it
          must be apparent to every hearer, that here is sufficient proof that
          Jesus Christ is the person who had been foretold under the name of
          Shiloh, or Messiah. We all believe that, and, therefore, there is
          little need that I should try to prove what you have already received.
          I rather select my text this morning as one of the constant marks of
          the gospel in all ages and in every land. "The poor have the gospel
          preached to them." This is to be its semper idem its constant stamp.
          And we believe, where the poor have not the gospel preached unto them,
          there is a departure from the dispensation of the gospel, the
          forsaking of this which was to be a fundamental trait and
          characteristic of the gospel dispensation: "The poor have the gospel
          preached to them."
        </p>
        <p>
          I find that these words will bear three translations; I shall,
          therefore, have three heads, which shall be composed of three
          translations of the text. The first is that of the authorised version:
          "The poor have the gospel preached to them;" it is also Tyndal's
          version. The second is the version of Crammer, and the version of
          Geneva, which is the best, "The poor are evangelized," that is to say,
          they not only hear the gospel, but they are influenced by it; -- the
          poor receive it. The last is a translation of some eminent writers,
          and above all, of Wyckliffe, which amused me when I read it, although
          I believe it to be as correct as any of the others. Wyckliffe
          translates it -- "pore men ben taken to prechynge of the gospel." The
          verb may be equally well translated in the active as in the passive
          sense: "The poor have taken to the preaching of the gospel." That is
          to be one of the marks of the gospel dispensation in all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, THE AUTHORISED VERSION, "The poor have the gospel
          preached to them." It was so in Christ's day; it is to be so with
          Christ's gospel to the end of time. Almost every impostor who has come
          into the world has aimed principally at the rich, and the mighty, and
          the respectable; very few impostors have found it to be worth their
          while to make it prominent in their preaching that they preach to the
          poor. They went before princes to promulgate their doctrines; they
          sought the halls of nobles where they might expatiate upon their
          pretended revelations. Few of them thought it worth their while to
          address themselves to those who have been most wickedly called "the
          swinish multitude," and to speak to them the glorious things of the
          gospel of Christ. But it is one delightful mark of Christ's
          dispensation, that he aims first at the poor. "The poor have the
          gospel preached to them." It was wise in him to do so. If we would
          fire a building, it is best to light it at the basement; so our
          Saviour, when he would save a world, and convert men of all classes,
          and all ranks, begins at the lowest rank, that the fire may burn
          upwards, knowing right well that what was received by the poor, will
          ultimately by his grace be received by the rich also. Nevertheless, he
          chose this to be given to his disciples, and to be the mark of his
          gospel -- "The poor have the gospel preached to them." Now, I have
          some things to say this morning, which I think are absolutely
          necessary, if the poor are to have the gospel preached unto them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, let me say then, that the gospel must be preached
          where the poor can come and hear it. How can the poor have the gospel
          preached to them, if they cannot come and listen to it? And yet how
          many of our places of worship are there into which they cannot come,
          and into which, if they could come, they would only come as inferior
          creatures. They may sit in the back seats, but are not to be known and
          recognised as anything like other people. Hence the absolute necessity
          of having places of worship large enough to accommodate the multitude;
          and hence, moreover, the obligation to go out into the highways and
          hedges. If the poor are to have the gospel preached unto them, then we
          must take it where they can get it. If I wanted to preach to English
          people, it would be of no use for me to go and stand on one of the
          peaks of the Himalayas, and begin preaching; they could not hear me
          there. And it is of little avail to build a gorgeous structure for a
          fashionable congregation, and then to think of preaching to the poor;
          they cannot come any more than the Hottentots can make their journey
          from Africa and listen to me here. I should not expect them to come to
          such a place, nor will they willingly enter it. The gospel should be
          preached, then, where the poor will come; and if they will not come
          after it, then let it be taken to them. We should have places where
          there is accommodation for them, and where they are regarded and
          respected as much as any other rank and condition of men. It is with
          this view alone that I have laboured earnestly to be the means of
          building a large place of worship, because I feel that although the
          bulk of my congregation in New Park-street Chapel are poor, yet there
          are many poor who can by no possibility enter the doors, because we
          cannot find room for the multitudes to be received. You ask me why I
          do not preach in the street. I reply, I would do so, and am constantly
          doing so in every place except London, but here I cannot do it, since
          it would amount to an absolute breach of the peace, it being
          impossible to conceive what a multitude of people must necessarily be
          assembled. I trembled when I saw twelve thousand on the last occasion
          I preached in the open air; therefore I have thought it best, for the
          present at least, to desist, until happily there shall be fewer to
          follow me. Otherwise my heart is in the open air movement; I practise
          it everywhere else, and I pray God to give to our ministers zeal and
          earnestness, that they may take the gospel into the streets, highways
          and byeways, and compel the people to come in, that the house may be
          filled. Oh that God would give us this characteristic mark of his
          precious grace, that the poor might have the gospel preached unto
          them!
        </p>
        <p>
          "But," you reply, "there are plenty of churches and chapels to which
          they might come." I answer, yes, but that is only one half of the
          matter. The gospel must be preached attractively before the poor will
          have the gospel preached unto them. Why, there is no attraction in the
          gospel to the great mass of our race, as it is currently preached. I
          confess that when I have a violent headache, and cannot sleep, I could
          almost wish for some droning minister to preach to me; I feel certain
          I could go to sleep then, for I have heard some under the soporific
          influence of whose eloquence I could most comfortably snore. But it is
          not at all likely that the poor will ever go to hear such preachers as
          these. If they are preached to in fine terms -- in grandiloquent
          language which they cannot lay hold of -- the poor will not have the
          gospel preached to them, for they will not go to hear it. They must
          have something attractive to them; we must preach as Christ did; we
          must tell anecdotes, and stories, and parables, as he did; we must
          come down and make the gospel attractive. The reason why the old
          puritan preachers could get congregations was this -- they did not
          give their hearers dry theology; they illustrated it; they had an
          anecdote from this and a quaint passage from that classic author; here
          a verse of poetry; here and there even a quip or pun -- a thing which
          now-a-days is a sin above all sins, but which was constantly committed
          by these preachers, whom I have ever esteemed as the patterns of
          pulpit eloquence. Christ Jesus was an attractive preacher; he sought
          above all means to set the pearl in a frame of gold, that it might
          attract the attention of the people. He was not willing to place
          himself in a parish church, and preach to a large congregation of
          thirteen and a-half, like our good brethren in the city, but would
          preach in such a style that people felt they must go to hear him. Some
          of them gnashed their teeth in rage and left his presence in wrath,
          but the multitudes still thronged to him to hear and to be healed. It
          was no dull work to hear this King of preachers, he was too much in
          earnest to be dull, and too humane to be incomprehensible. I believe
          that until this is imitated, the poor will not have the gospel
          preached to them. There must be an interesting style adopted, to bring
          the people to hear. But if we adopt such a style they will call us
          clownish, vulgar, and so on. Blessed be God, we have long learnt that
          vulgarity is a very different thing from what some men suppose. We
          have been so taught, that we are willing to be even clowns for
          Christ's sake, and so long as we are seeing souls saved we are not
          likely to alter our course. During this last week I have seen, I
          believe, a score of persons who have been in the lowest ranks, the
          very meanest of sinners, the greatest of transgressors, who have,
          through preaching in this place, been restored and reclaimed. Do you
          think then I shall shear my locks to please the Philistine? Oh, no; by
          the grace of God, Samson knoweth where his strength lieth, and is not
          likely to do that to please any man or any set of men. Preaching must
          reach the popular ear; and to get at the people it must be interesting
          to them, and by the grace of God we hope it shall be.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, in the next place, if the poor are to have the gospel preached
          unto them, it must be preached simply. It is a waste of time to preach
          Latin to you, is it not? To the multitude of people it is of no use
          delivering a discourse in Greek. Possibly five or six of the assembly
          might be mightily edified, and go away delighted; but what of that?
          The mass would retire unedified and uninstructed. You talk about the
          education of the people, don't you, and about the vast extent of
          English refinement? For the most part it is a dream. Ignorance is not
          buried yet. The language of one class of Englishmen is a dead language
          to another class; and many a word which is very plain to many of us,
          is as hard and difficult a word to the multitude as if it had been
          culled out of Hindostani or Bengali. There are multitudes who cannot
          understand words composed of Latin, but must have the truth told them
          in round homely Saxon, if it is to reach their hearts. There is my
          friend the Rev. So-and-so, Doctor of Divinity; he is a great student,
          and whenever he finds a hard word in his books he tells it next Sunday
          to his congregation. He has a little intellectual circle, who think
          his preaching must be good, because they cannot understand it, and who
          think it proven that he must be an intelligent man because all the
          pews are empty. They believe he must be a very useful member of
          society; in fact, they compare him to Luther, and think he is a second
          Paul, because nobody will listen to him, seeing it is impossible to
          understand him. Well, we conceive of that good man that he may have a
          work to do, but we do not know what it is. There is another friend of
          ours, Mr. Cloudyton, who always preaches in such a style that if you
          should try to dissect the sermon for a week afterwards, you could by
          no possibility tell what he meant. If you could look at things from
          his point of view you might possibly discover something; but it does
          appear by his preaching as if he himself had lost his way in a fog,
          and were scattering a whole mass of mist about him everywhere. I
          suppose he goes so deep down into the subject that he stirs the mud at
          the bottom, and he cannot find his way up again. There are some such
          preachers, whom you cannot possibly understand. Now, we say, and say
          very boldly too, that while such preaching may be esteemed by some
          people to be good, we have no faith in it all. If ever the world is to
          be reclaimed, and if sinners are to be saved, we can see no likelihood
          in the world of its being done by such means. We think the word must
          be understood before it can really penetrate the conscience and the
          heart; and we would always be preaching such as men can understand,
          otherwise the poor will not "have the gospel preached to them." Why
          did John Bunyan become the apostle of Bedfordshire, and
          Huntingdonshire, and round about? It was because John Bunyan, while he
          had a surpassing genius, would not condescend to cull his language
          from the garden of flowers, but he went into the hayfield and the
          meadow, and plucked up his language by the roots, and spoke out in
          words that the people used in their cottages. Why is it that God has
          blessed other men to the stirring of the people, to the bringing about
          of spiritual revivals, to the renewal of the power of godliness? We
          believe it has always been owing to this -- under God's Spirit -- that
          they have adopted the phraseology of the people, and have not been
          ashamed to be despised because they talked as common people did.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now we have something to say more important than this. We may
          preach, very simply too, and very attractively, and yet it may not be
          true that "the poor have the gospel preached to them," for the poor
          may have something else preached to them beside the gospel. It is,
          then, highly important that we should each of us ask what the gospel
          is, and that when we think we know it we should not be ashamed to say,
          "This is the gospel, and I will preach it boldly, though all men
          should deny it." Oh! I fear that there is such a thing as preaching
          another gospel, "which is not another, but there be some that trouble
          us." There is such a thing as preaching science and philosophy
          attractively, but not preaching the gospel. Mark, it is not preaching,
          but it is preaching the gospel that is the mark of Christ's
          dispensation and of his truth. Let us take care to preach fully the
          depravity of man, let us dwell thoroughly upon his lost and ruined
          estate under the law, and his restoration under the gospel; let us
          preach of these three things, for, as a good brother said, "The gospel
          lies in three things, the Word of God only, the blood of Christ only,
          and the Holy Spirit only." These three things make up the gospel. "The
          Bible; the Bible alone the religion of Protestants; the blood of
          Christ the only salvation from sin, the only means of the pardon of
          our guilt; and the Holy Spirit the only regenerator, the only
          converting power that will alone work in us to will and to do of his
          good pleasure." Without these three things there is no gospel. Let us
          take heed, then, for it is a serious matter, that when the people
          listen to us, it is the gospel that we preach, or else we may be as
          guilty as was Nero, the tyrant, who, when Rome was starving, sent his
          ships to Alexandria, where there was corn in plenty, not for wheat,
          for sand to scatter in the arena for his gladiators. Ah! there be some
          who seem to do so -- scattering the floor of their sanctuary, not with
          the good corn of the kingdom, upon which the souls of God's people may
          feed and grow thereby, but with sand of controversy, and of logic,
          which no child of God can ever receive to his soul's profit. "The poor
          have the gospel preached to them." Let us take heed that it is the
          gospel. Hear then, ye chief of sinners, the voice of Jesus. "This is a
          faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came
          into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." "Him that cometh
          to me I will in no wise cast out." "Whosoever believeth and is
          baptized, shall be saved." "For the Son of man is come to seek and
          save that which is lost."
        </p>
        <p>
          And just one more hint on this point, namely, this, -- it must be said
          of us, if we would keep true to Christ's rule and apostolic practice,
          that "the poor have the gospel preached to them." In these days there
          is a growing hatred of the pulpit. The pulpit has maintained its
          ground full many a year, but partially by its becoming inefficient, it
          is losing its high position. Through a timid abuse of it, instead of a
          strong stiff use of the pulpit, the world has come to despise it; and
          now most certainly we are not a priest-ridden people one-half so much
          as we are press-ridden people. By the press we are ridden indeed.
          Mercuries, Despatches, Journals, Gazettes and Magazines, are now the
          judges of pulpit eloquence and style. They thrust themselves into the
          censor's seat, and censure those whose office it should rather be to
          censure them. For my own part, I cheerfully accord to all men the
          liberty of abusing me; but I must protest against the lying conduct of
          at least one editor, who has misquoted in order to pervert my meaning,
          and has done more; he has, to his eternal disgrace, manufactured a
          quotation from his own head, which never did occur in my works or
          words. The pulpit has become dishonoured; it is esteemed as being of
          very little worth and of no esteem. Ah! we must always maintain the
          dignity of the pulpit. I hold that it is the Thermopylae of
          Christendom; it is here the battle must be fought between right and
          wrong -- not so much with the pen, valuable as that is as an
          assistant, as with the living voice of earnest men, "contending
          earnestly for the faith once delivered unto the saints." In some
          churches the pulpit is put away; there is a prominent altar, but the
          pulpit is omitted. Now, the most prominent thing under the gospel
          dispensation is not the altar which belonged to the Jewish
          dispensation, but the pulpit. "We have an altar, whereof they have no
          right to eat which serve the tabernacle;" that altar is Christ; but
          Christ has been pleased to exalt "the foolishness of preaching" to the
          most prominent position in his house of prayer. We must take heed that
          we always maintain preaching. It is this that God will bless; it is
          this that he has promised to crown with success. "Faith cometh by
          hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." We must not expect to see
          great changes nor any great progress of the gospel until there is
          greater esteem for the pulpit -- more said of it and thought of it.
          "Well," some may reply, "you speak of the dignity of the pulpit; I
          take it, you lower it yourself, sir, by speaking in such a style to
          your hearers." Ah! no doubt you think so. Some pulpits die of dignity.
          I take it, the greatest dignity in the world is the dignity of
          converts -- that the glory of the pulpit is, if I may use such a
          metaphor, to have captives at its chariot-wheels, to see converts
          following it, and where there are such, and those from the very worst
          of men; there is a dignity in the pulpit beyond any dignity which a
          fine mouthing of words and a grand selection of fantastic language
          could ever give to it. "The poor have the gospel preached to them."

          II. now, the next translation is, THE TRANSLATION OF GENEVA,
          principally used by Calvin in his commentary; and it is also the
          translation of Thomas Crammer, whose translation, I believe, was at
          least in some degree moulded by the Genevan translation. He translates
          it thus: -- "The poor receive the gospel." The Genevan translation has
          it, "The poor receive the glad tidings of the gospel," which is a
          tautology, since glad tidings mean the same thing as gospel. The Greek
          has it, "The poor are evangelised." Now, what is the meaning of this
          word "evangelised?" They talk with a sneer in these days of
          evangelical drawing-rooms and evangelicals, and so on. It is one of
          the most singular sneers in the world; for to call a man an
          evangelical by way of joke, is the same as calling a man a gentleman
          by way of scoffing at him. To say a man is one of the gospellers by
          way of scorn, is like calling a man a king by way of contempt. It is
          an honourable, a great, a glorious title, and nothing is more
          honourable than to be ranked among the evangelicals. What is meant,
          then, by the people being evangelised? Old Master Burkitt, thinking
          that we should not easily understand the word, says, that as a man is
          said to be Italianised by living among the Italians, getting their
          manners and customs, and becoming a citizen of the state, so a man is
          evangelised when he lives where the gospel is preached and gets the
          manners and customs of those who profess it. Now, that is one meaning
          of the text. One of the proofs of our Saviour's mission is not only
          that the poor hear the Word, but are influenced by it and are
          gospelized. Oh! how great a work it is to gospelize any man, and to
          gospelize a poor man. What does it mean? It means, to make him like
          the gospel. Now, the gospel is holy, just, and true, and loving, and
          honest, and benevolent, and kind, and gracious. So, then, to gospelize
          a man is to make a rogue honest, to make a harlot modest, to make a
          profane man serious, to make a grasping man liberal, to make a
          covetous man benevolent, to make the drunken man sober, to make the
          untruthful man truthful, to make the unkind man loving, to make the
          hater the lover of his species, and, in a word, to gospelize a man is,
          in his outward character, to bring him into such a condition that he
          labours to carry out the command of Christ, "Love thy God with all thy
          heart, and thy neighbour as thyself." Gospelizing, furthermore, has
          something to do with an inner principle; gospelizing a man means
          saving him from hell and making him a heavenly character; it means
          blotting out his sins, writing a new name upon his heart -- the new
          name of God. It means bringing him to know his election, to put his
          trust in Christ, to renounce his sins, and his good works too, and to
          trust solely and wholly upon Jesus Christ as his Redeemer. Oh! what a
          blessed thing it is to be gospelized! How many of you have been so
          gospelized? The Lord grant that the whole of us may feel the influence
          of the gospel. I contend for this, that to gospelize a man is the
          greatest miracle in the world. All the other miracles are wrapped up
          in this one. To gospelize a man, or, in other words, to convert him,
          is a greater work than to open the eyes of the blind; for is it not
          opening the eyes of the blind soul that he may see spiritual matters,
          and understand the things of heavenly wisdom, and is not a surgical
          operation easier than operation on the soul? Souls we cannot touch,
          although science and skill have been able to remove films and
          cataracts from the eyes. "The lame walk." Gospelizing a man is more
          than this. It is not only making a lame man walk, but it is making a
          dead man who could not walk in the right way walk in the right way
          ever afterwards. "The lepers are cleansed." Ah! but to cleanse a
          sinner is greater work than cleansing a leper. "The deaf hear." Yes,
          and to make a man who never listened to the voice of God hear the
          voice of his Maker, is a miracle greater than to make the deaf hear,
          or even to raise the dead. Great though that be, it is not a more
          stupendous effort of divine power than to save a soul, since men are
          naturally dead in sins, and must be quickened by divine grace if they
          are saved. To gospelize a man is the highest instance of divine might,
          and remains an unparalleled miracle, a miracle of miracles. "The poor
          are evangelized."

        <p>
          Beloved, there have been some very precious specimens of poor people
          who have come under the influence of the gospel. I think I appeal to
          the hearts of all of you who are now present, when I say there is
          nothing we more reverence and respect than the piety of the poor and
          needy. I had an engraving sent to me the other day which pleased me
          beyond measure. It was an engraving simply but exquisitely executed.
          It represented a poor girl in an upper room, with a lean-to roof.
          There was a post driven in the ground, on which was a piece of wood,
          standing on which were a candle and a Bible. She was on her knees at a
          chair, praying, wrestling with God. Everything in the room had on it
          the stamp of poverty. There was the mean coverlet to the old stump
          bedstead; there were the walls that had never been papered, and
          perhaps scarcely whitewashed. It was an upper story to which she had
          climbed with aching knees, and where perhaps she had worked away till
          her fingers were worn to the bone to earn her bread at needlework.
          There it was that she was wrestling with God. Some would turn away and
          laugh at it; but it appeals to the best feelings of man, and moves the
          heart far more than does the fine engraving of the monarch on his
          knees in the grand assembly. We have had lately a most excellent
          volume, the Life of Captain Hedley Vicars; it is calculated to do
          great good, and I pray God to bless it; but I question whether the
          history of Captain Hedley Vicars will last as long in the public mind
          as the history of the Dairyman's Daughter, or the Shepherd of
          Salisbury Plain. The histories of those who have come from the ranks
          of the poor always lay hold of the Christian mind. Oh! we love piety
          anywhere; we bless God where coronets and grace go together; but if
          piety in any place do shine more brightly than anywhere else, it is in
          rags and poverty. When the poor woman in the almshouse takes her bread
          and her water, and blessed God for both -- when the poor creature who
          has not where to lay his head, yet lifts his eye and says, "My Father
          will provide," it is then like the glow-worm in the damp leaves, a
          spark the more conspicuous for the blackness around it. Then religion
          gleams in its true brightness, and is seen in all its lustre. It is a
          mark of Christ's gospel that the poor are gospelized -- that they can
          receive the gospel. True it is, the gospel affects all ranks, and is
          equally adapted to them all; but yet we say, "If one class be more
          prominent than another, we believe that in Holy Scripture the poor are
          most of all appealed to." "Oh!" say some very often, "the converts
          whom God has given to such a man are all from the lower ranks; they
          are all people with no sense; they are all uneducated people that hear
          such-and-such a person." Very well, if you say so; we might deny it if
          we pleased, but we do not know that we shall take the trouble, because
          we think it no disgrace whatever; we think it rather to be an honour
          that the poor are evangelized, and that they listen to the gospel from
          our lips. I have never thought it a disgrace at any time. When any
          have said, "Look, what a mass of uneducated people they are." Yes, I
          have thought, and blessed be God they are, for those are the very
          people that want the gospel most. If you saw a physician's door
          surrounded by a number of ladies of the sentimental school, who are
          sick about three times a week, and never were ill at all -- if it were
          said he cured them, you would say, "No great wonder too, for there
          never was anything the matter with them." But if you heard of another
          man, that people with the worst diseases have come to him, and that
          God has made use of him, and his medicine has been the means of
          healing their diseases, you would then say, "There is something in it,
          for the people that want it most have received it." If, then, it be
          true that the poor will come to hear the gospel more than others, it
          is no disgrace to the gospel, it is an honour to it, that those who
          most want it do freely receive it.

          III. And now I must close up by briefly dwelling on the last point. It
          was the third translation, WYCKLIFFE'S TRANSLATION. To give it you in
          old English -- "Poor men are taking to the preaching of the gospel."
          "Ah!" say some, "they had better remain at home, minding their ploughs
          or their blacksmith's hammer; they had better have kept on which their
          tinkering and tailoring, and not have turned preachers." But it is one
          of the honours of the gospel that poor men have taken to the preaching
          of it. There was a tinker once, and let the worldly-wise blush when
          they hear of it -- there was a tinker once, a tinker of whom a great
          divine said he would give all his learning if he could preach like
          him. There was a tinker once, who never so much as brushed his back
          against the walls of a college, who wrote a "Pilgrim's Progress. Did
          ever a doctor in divinity write such a book. There was a pot-boy once
          -- a boy who carried on his back the pewter pots for his mother, who
          kept the Old Bell. That man drove men mad, as the world had it, but
          led them to Christ, as we have it, all his life long, until, loaded
          with honours, he sank into his grave, with the good will of a
          multitude round about him, with an imperishable name written in the
          world's records, as well as in the records of the church. Did you ever
          hear of any mighty man, whose name stood in more esteem among God's
          people than the name of George Whitfield? And yet these were poor men,
          who, as Wyckliffe said, were taking to the preaching of the gospel. If
          you will read the life of Wyckliffe, you will find him saying there,
          that he believed that the Reformation in England was more promoted by
          the labours of the poor men whom he sent out from Lutterworth than by
          his own. He gathered round him a number of the poor people whom he
          instructed in the faith, and then he sent them two and two into every
          village, as Jesus did. They went into the market-place, and they
          gathered the people around; they opened the book and read a chapter,
          and then they left them a manuscript of it which for months and years
          after the people would assemble to read, and would remember the
          gospellers that had come to tell them the gospel of Christ. These men
          went from market-place to market-place, from town to town, and from
          village to village, and though their names are unknown to fame, they
          were the real reformers. You may talk of Cranmer, and Latimer, and
          Ridley; they did much, but the real reformers of the English nation
          were people whose names have perished from the annals of time, but are
          written in the records of eternity. God has blessed the poor man in
          preaching the truth. Far be it from me to depreciate learning and
          wisdom. We should not have had the Bible translated without learning
          and the more learning a man can have, if he be a sanctified man, the
          better; he has so many more talents to lay out in his Master's
          service; but it is not absolutely necessary for preaching of the Word.
          Rough, untamed, untaught energy, has done much in the church. A
          Boanerges has stood up in a village; he could not put three words
          together in grammatical English; but where the drowsy parson had for
          many a year lulled all his people into an unhallowed rest, this man
          started up, like the herdsman Amos, and brought about a great
          awakening. He began to preach in some cottage; people thronged around
          him, then a house was built, and his name is handed down to use as the
          Rev. So-and-so, but then he was known as Tom the ploughman, or John
          the tinker. God has made use of men whose origin was the most obscure,
          who seemed to have little, except the gifts of nature, which could be
          made use of in God's service; and we hold that this is no disgrace,
          but on the contrary an honour, that poor men are taking to preaching
          the gospel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to ask you this morning to help some poor men in preaching the
          gospel. We are constantly receiving letters from our poor brethren,
          and it is very seldom that we say "No," to their appeals for
          assistance, but we must do so, unless our friends, more especially
          those who love the gospel, really will do something towards the
          maintenance of God's faithful servants. I have, during the past year,
          preached many times for ministers on this ground, that they could not
          live unless some preached a sermon and made a collection for them. In
          some places the population was so small that they could not maintain
          their minister, and in others it was a new movement, and therefore
          they were unable to support him. Some of you subscribe to the Church
          Pastoral Aid Society. That is a very excellent society, but I never
          could see any good in it. There are many poor clergy in the Church of
          England who want assistance bad enough; but if you want to know the
          right way of keeping poor curates, I will tell you. Split a bishop up
          into fifty, and that will do it. If that could be done at once and
          speedily, there would be no need of Pastoral Aid Societies. You will
          say, perhaps, "Let such a thing be done in our denomination." I answer
          that we have no bishops with whom such a thing could be done. I
          believe there is not to be found one minister in the whole Baptist
          denomination whose salary has ever exceeded £600, and there are only
          three, I believe, who receive as much as that, of which I am not one,
          and these three men are in such a position that their demands are
          great, and they have not one penny too much, while the great mass of
          our denomination receive £20, £30, £40, £50, £60, and so on, but below
          £100. The sum collected to-day will be given to those whose incomes
          are below £80, and whose needs are great.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, I have opened my mouth for the dumb, and pleaded the
          cause of the poor, let me end by entreating the poor of the flock to
          consider the poor man's Christ; let me urge them to give Him their
          thoughts, and may the Lord enable them to yield him their hearts. "He
          that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth
          not shall be damned."
        </p>
        <p>
          May God bless the high and low, the rich and poor; yea, all of you,
          for his name's sake.<br />
