          1. And not only by the particulars already mentioned, but also by
          means of the events which shall occur in the time of Antichrist is it
          shown that he, being an apostate and a robber, is anxious to be adored
          as God; and that, although a mere slave, he wishes himself to be
          proclaimed as a king. For he (Antichrist) being endued with all the
          power of the devil, shall come, not as a righteous king, nor as a
          legitimate king, [i.e., one] in subjection to God, but an impious,
          unjust, and lawless one; as an apostate, iniquitous and murderous; as
          a robber, concentrating in himself [all] satanic apostasy, and setting
          aside idols to persuade [men] that he himself is God, raising up
          himself as the only idol, having in himself the multifarious errors of
          the other idols. This he does, in order that they who do [now] worship
          the devil by means of many abominations, may serve himself by this one
          idol, of whom the apostle thus speaks in the second Epistle to the
          Thessalonians: "Unless there shall come a failing away first, and the
          man of sin shall be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and
          exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped;
          so that he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself as if he were
          God." The apostle therefore clearly points out his apostasy, and that
          he is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped --
          that is, above every idol -- for these are indeed so called by men,
          but are not [really] gods; and that he will endeavour in a tyrannical
          manner to set himself forth as God.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Moreover, he (the apostle) has also pointed out this which I have
          shown in many ways, that the temple in Jerusalem was made by the
          direction of the true God. For the apostle himself, speaking in his
          own person, distinctly called it the temple of God. Now I have shown
          in the third book, that no one is termed God by the apostles when
          speaking for themselves, except Him who truly is God, the Father of
          our Lord, by whose directions the temple which is at Jerusalem was
          constructed for those purposes which I have already mentioned; in
          which [temple] the enemy shall sit, endeavouring to show himself as
          Christ, as the Lord also declares: "But when ye shall see the
          abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel the
          prophet, standing in the holy place (let him that readeth understand),
          then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains; and he who is
          upon the house-top, let him not come down to take anything out of his
          house: for there shall then be great hardship, such as has not been
          from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall be."
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Daniel too, looking forward to the end of the last kingdom, i.e.,
          the ten last kings, amongst whom the kingdom of those men shall be
          partitioned, and upon whom the son of perdition shall come, declares
          that ten horns shall spring from the beast, and that another little
          horn shall arise in the midst of them, and that three of the former
          shall be rooted up before his face. He says: "And, behold, eyes were
          in this horn as the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things,
          and his look was more stout than his fellows. I was looking, and this
          horn made war against the saints, and prevailed against them, until
          the Ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most
          high God, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom."
          Then, further on, in the interpretation of the vision, there was said
          to him: "The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth,
          which shall excel all other kingdoms, and devour the whole earth, and
          tread it down, and cut it in pieces. And its ten horns are ten kings
          which shall arise; and after them shall arise another, who shall
          surpass in evil deeds all that were before him, and shall overthrow
          three kings; and he shall speak words against the most high God, and
          wear out the saints of the most high God, and shall purpose to change
          times and laws; and [everything] shall be given into his hand until a
          time of times and a half time," that is, for three years and six
          months, during which time, when he comes, he shall reign over the
          earth. Of whom also the Apostle Paul again, speaking in the second
          [Epistle] to the Thessalonians, and at the same time proclaiming the
          cause of his advent, thus says: "And then shall the wicked one be
          revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the spirit of His mouth,
          and destroy by the presence of His coming; whose coming [i.e., the
          wicked one's] is after the working of Satan, in all power, and signs,
          and portents of lies, and with all deceivableness of wickedness for
          those who perish; because they did not receive the love of the truth,
          that they might be saved. And therefore God will send them the working
          of error, that they may believe a lie; that they all may be judged who
          did not believe the truth, but gave consent to iniquity,"
        </p>
        <p>
          4. The Lord also spoke as follows to those who did not believe in Him:
          "I have come in my Father's name, and ye have not received Me: when
          another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive," calling
          Antichrist "the other," because he is alienated from the Lord. This is
          also the unjust judge, whom the Lord mentioned as one "who feared not
          God, neither regarded man," to whom the widow fled in her
          forgetfulness of God, -- that is, the earthly Jerusalem, -- to be
          avenged of her adversary. Which also he shall do in the time of his
          kingdom: he shall remove his kingdom into that [city], and shall sit
          in the temple of God, leading astray those who worship him, as if he
          were Christ. To this purpose Daniel says again: "And he shall desolate
          the holy place; and sin has been given for a sacrifice, and
          righteousness been cast away in the earth, and he has been active
          (fecit), and gone on prosperously." And the angel Gabriel, when
          explaining his vision, states with regard to this person: "And towards
          the end of their kingdom a king of a most fierce countenance shall
          arise, one understanding [dark] questions, and exceedingly powerful,
          full of wonders; and he shall corrupt, direct, influence (faciet), and
          put strong men down, the holy people likewise; and his yoke shall be
          directed as a wreath [round their neck]; deceit shall be in his hand,
          and he shall be lifted up in his heart: he shall also ruin many by
          deceit, and lead many to perdition, bruising them in his hand like
          eggs." And then he points out the time that his tyranny shall last,
          during which the saints shall be put to flight, they who offer a pure
          sacrifice unto God: "And in the midst of the week," he says, "the
          sacrifice and the libation shall be taken away, and the abomination of
          desolation [shall be brought] into the temple: even unto the
          consummation of the time shall the desolation be complete." Now three
          years and six months constitute the half-week.
        </p>

          5. From all these passages are revealed to us, not merely the
          particulars of the apostasy, and [the doings] of him who concentrates
          in himself every satanic error, but also, that there is one and the
          same God the Father, who was declared by the prophets, but made
          manifest by Christ. For if what Daniel prophesied concerning the end
          has been confirmed by the Lord, when He said, "When ye shall see the
          abomination of desolation, which has been spoken of by Daniel the
          prophet" (and the angel Gabriel gave the interpretation of the visions
          to Daniel, and he is the archangel of the Creator (Demiurgi), who also
          proclaimed to Mary the visible coming and the incarnation of Christ),
          then one and the same God is most manifestly pointed out, who sent the
          prophets, and made promise of the Son, and called us into His
          knowledge.<br />
