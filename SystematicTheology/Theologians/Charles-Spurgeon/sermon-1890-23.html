          These things, then, we have set before you, most dearly beloved, in
          order that ye may understand the power of your bishops, and give
          reverence to God in them, and love them as your own souls; and in
          order that ye may have no communication with those with whom they have
          none, and that ye may not receive those whom they have cast out. For
          the judgment of a bishop is greatly to be feared, although he may bind
          one unjustly, which, however, he ought to guard against with the
          utmost care.<br />
