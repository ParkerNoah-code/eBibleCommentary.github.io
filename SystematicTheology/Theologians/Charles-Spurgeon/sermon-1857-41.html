        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.148)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 23, 1857, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "Yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God,
          which fear before him." -- Ecclesiastes 8:12.
        </p>
        <p>
          I HAVE heard it sometimes said by wicked men, when they would arraign
          the justice of the Most High, that it is unjust that God should
          condemn men for the use of the powers which he himself has given them.
          This most subtle evil has often grieved the hearts of those who are
          weak and ignorant, and have not seen its untruthfulness -- for to
          speak plainly of it, it is a gross lie. God does not condemn men for
          the use of the powers he has given them; he condemns them for the
          misuse of those powers; not for employing them, but for employing them
          as they ought not to employ them; not for thinking, not for speaking,
          not for doing, but for thinking, speaking, and doing, contrary to his
          law God damneth no man for the use of the powers which he hath given
          him, let that be again repeated -- but he doth condemn them for the
          abuse of those powers, and for their impudence in daring to turn those
          powers, which he hath given them, for his honor, against his service,
          and against his throne Now, my friends, there is no power which God
          hath given us, which may not be employed for God. I believe that David
          uttered a great truth, as well as a great exhortation to himself, when
          he said, "Bless the Lord, O my soul and all that is within me, bless
          his holy name." There is nothing in man that God has not there, which
          may not be employed in God's service. Some may ask me whether anger
          can be brought in. I answer, yes. A good man may serve God by being
          angry against sin; and to be angry against sin is a high and holy
          thing. You may ask me, perhaps, whether ridicule can be employed. I
          answer, yes. I believe we may even rightly employ it in the preaching
          of God's word. I know this, I always intend to use it; and if by a
          laugh I can make men see the folly of an error better than in any
          other way, they shall laugh, and laugh here, too; for ridicule is to
          be used in God's service; and every power that God hath implanted in
          man -- I will make no exception, -- may be used for God's service, and
          for God's honor. What man hath gotten for himself by the fall, cannot
          be employed to serve God with, we cannot bring before God Adam's
          robbery, to be a sacrifice to the Almighty, nor can our own carnal and
          sinful passions honor the Most High, but there are natural powers
          which God hath conferred, and none of these are in themselves sinful.
          I would have them, therefore, employed for the Master. Yea, even those
          powers with which it seems impossible to worship, such as the powers
          of assimilation, eating, and drinking, may be brought to honor God;
          for what says the Apostle? -- "whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever
          ye do, do all to the glory of God, giving thanks unto God and the
          Father by Jesus Christ."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you will notice that fear may be yoked into the service of God.
          True fear, not fearing, but believing, saves the soul; not doubt, but
          confidence, is the strength and the deliverance of the Christian.
          Still, fear, as being one of those powers which God hath given us, is
          not in itself sinful. Fear may be used for the most sinful purposes;
          at the same time it may be so ennobled by grace, and so used for the
          service of God, that it may become the very grandest part of man. In
          fact, Scripture has honored fear, for the whole of piety is
          comprehended in these words, "Fear God;" "the fear of the Lord;" "them
          that fear Him." These phrases are employed to express true piety, and
          the men who possess it. Fear, I have said, may ruin the soul, alas! it
          has ruined multitudes. O Fear, thou art the rock upon which many a
          ship hath been wrecked. Many a soul hath suffered spiritual
          destruction through thee, but then it hath been not the fear of God,
          but the fear of man. Many have rushed against the thick bosses of the
          Almighty's buckler, and defied God, in order to escape the wrath of
          feeble man. Many through fear of worldly loss have brought great guilt
          into their consciences; some through fear of ridicule and laughter
          have not had the boldness to follow the right, and so have gone astray
          and been ruined. Yea, and where fear doth not work utter destruction
          it is capable of doing much damage to the spirit. Fear hath paralysed
          the arm of the most gigantic Christian, stopped him in his race, and
          impeded him in his labors. Faith can do anything, but fear, sinful
          fear, can do just nothing at all, but even prevent faith from
          performing its labors. Fear hath made the Christian to sorrow, both by
          night and day, a cankering fear lest his wants should not be provided
          for, and his necessities supplied, has driven the Christian to
          unworthy thoughts; and distrustful, doubting fear hath made him
          dishonor God, and prevented his sucking the honey out of the promises.
          Fear hath kept many a child of God from doing his duty, from making a
          bold profession; hath brought bondage into his spirit. Fear misused,
          thou art the Christian's greatest curse, and thou art the sinner's
          ruin. Thou art a sly serpent, creeping amongst the thorns of sin, and
          when thou art allowed to twist thyself around manhood, thou dost crush
          it in thy folds, and poison it with thy venom. Nothing can be worse
          than this sinful fear; it hath slaughtered its myriads and sent
          thousands to hell. But yet it may seem a paradox; fear, when rightly
          employed, is the very brightest state of Christianity, and is used to
          express all piety, comprehended in one emotion. "The fear of God" is
          the constant description which the Scripture gives of true religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, beloved, I shall want you this morning to have some little
          patience with me whilst I try to go after certain fearing souls whose
          fear is of the right kind, even a fear which gendereth salvation, but
          who through it are now suffering some degree of torment, and are
          wishing to be delivered from it. An old Puritan says, "Jesus Christ
          would shake hands with a man that had the palsy." I must try and do
          the same this morning. Some of you have the palsy of fear. I want to
          come after you and say unto you, "Fear not;" to bid you to be of good
          cheer, because God would comfort you. There are five different kinds
          of fear, that persons are laboring under which I would now endeavor to
          address.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. There is, first, THE FEAR CAUSED BY AN AWAKENING CONSCIENCE. This
          is the lowest grade of godly fear; here all true piety takes its rise.
          By nature, the sinner does not dread the wrath of God; he thinks sin a
          little thing; he looks upon its pleasures, and forgets its penalty, he
          dares the Almighty to the war, and lifts his puny arm against the
          Eternal. No sooner, however, is he awakened by God's Spirit, than fear
          takes possession of his heart, the arrows of the Almighty drink up his
          spirit, the thunders of the law roll in his ears; he feels his life to
          be uncertain, and his body frail, He dreads death, because he knows
          that death would be to him the prelude of destruction; he dreads life,
          for life itself is intolerable, when the wrath of God is poured out
          into his soul. Many of you who are now before me have passed through
          that dreadful ordeal of suffering under a sense of the wrath of God.
          We, my brethren, shall never forget, to our dying day, that hour of
          desperate grief when first we discovered our lost estate. By the
          preaching of the Word, by the reading of the Scriptures, by prayer, or
          by some Providence, we were led to look within; we discovered the evil
          of our hearts, and we heard how terribly God would punish the
          transgressor. Do you not remember how we started from our beds in the
          morning, having slept uneasily, and bowed our knees in prayer, and
          prayed until the hot sweat ran down our brow; but rose without a hope
          that we had been heard? Do you not recollect how, in our business, we
          were sometimes so absent in mind, that those who were round about us
          thought that we must have been bereaved of our wits? Do you not well
          recollect how the best dainties of our meals seemed to have the
          bitterness of wormwood in them, and the sweetest draughts were mingled
          with gall; how all day lone we sorrowed, and went to our bed at night
          with another prayer, still as full of agony and still as hopeless; and
          by night we could not sleep, but dreamed of the wrath to come, saw
          dreams more horrible than we had dreamed before; each night and day
          the wrath of God seemed to increase, and our pangs and agonies became
          more terrible? Oh, we shall never forget it; those of us who have
          passed through the same will never let that era be forgotten, for the
          time of its beginning was the time of our conversion, and the time of
          its end was the time of our salvation. Have I any here who are in this
          same state this morning? I am coming after you, and in coming after
          you I proclaim the words of my text, "Surely I know that it shall be
          well with them that fear God, which fear before him." Sinner, it shall
          be well with thee if thou art now made to fear the wrath of God on
          account of thy sin; if God the Spirit hath poured forth the vials of
          Almighty wrath into thy soul, so that thou art cast down and sore
          vexed. Think not thou shalt be destroyed; it shall be well with thee.
          Let me comfort thee now, whilst thou art suffering these things,
          remember that what thou sufferest is that which all God's people have
          had to suffer in a measure. Many poor hearts come to me when I am
          sitting to see the anxious ones, and at other times, and they tell me
          they are in such deep distress; surely never anyone felt as they feel.
          And when I begin to unfold to them the experience of all saints, and
          tell them how it is a well-trodden path which almost every traveler to
          heaven has had to tread, they stand astonished, and think it cannot be
          so. I tell thee sinner, that thy deepest woes have been felt by some
          one, even more keenly than thou feelest them now. Thou sayest, "I sink
          in deep mire where there is no standing." Why, man, there have been
          some that have sunk far deeper than thou hast sunk. Thou art up to thy
          ancles; I have known some to have been up to the loins, and there have
          been some that have been covered over their very heads so that they
          could say, "All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me." Your
          distresses are very painful, but they are not singular, others have
          had to endure the same. Be comforted, it is not a desert island;
          others have been there too; and if they have passed through this, and
          won the crown, thou shalt pass through it, and inherit yet the glory
          of the believer on the breast of Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I will tell thee something else to comfort thee; I will put this
          question to thee -- Wouldst thou wish to go back and become what thou
          once wast? Thy sins are now so painful, that thou canst scarce eat, or
          drink, or sleep. There was a time when thy sins never haunted thee,
          when thou couldst drink and may with Satan and with sin as merrily as
          anyone. Come, wouldst thou like to be as thou wast then? "No," I hear
          thee say, "no; my Master, my God, grieve me more, if so it pleaseth
          thee, but do not let me be hardened any more." Ask the poor strickened
          conscience, in the first agonies and throes of his grief, whether he
          would like to be a hardened sinner? "No," he says; and when he hears
          the blasphemer swear against God, the tear is in his eye; he says,
          "Lord, I thank thee for my miseries, if they deliver me from hardness
          of heart. I can extol thee for my agonies, if they save me from such
          dire presumption, such rebellion against thee." Well, then, be of good
          cheer, your condition, you see, is not the worst of all; there is a
          worse state yet. Oh, it thou hast come so far, hope thou in Christ,
          thou shalt come further yet. But the great consolation is this, Jesus
          Christ died for thee. If God the Holy Ghost hath shown thee that thou
          art dead in sin, and if he hath revealed to thee the desperate
          character of thine iniquity, and broken thee in pieces with penitence
          on account of thy guilt -- hear me, I speak not now at hap-hazard, I
          speak with God's authority -- Jesus Christ died for thee; yes, for
          thee, thou vilest of the vile. I am no general redemptionist, I
          believe Jesus Christ died for as many as will be saved; I do not
          believe he died in vain for any man alive. I have always believed that
          Christ was punished instead of men. Now, if he were punished in the
          stead of all men, I could see no justice in God punishing men again
          after having punished Christ for them. I hold and believe -- and, I
          think, on Scriptural authority, that Jesus Christ died for all those
          who believe or will believe; and he was punished in the stead of all
          those who feel their need of a Saviour, and lay hold on him. The rest
          reject him, despise him, sin against God, and are punished for their
          sine. But those who are redeemed, having been blood-bought, shall not
          be lost. Christ's blood is too precious to have been shed for men who
          are damned. It is too awful a thing to think of the Saviour standing
          in a sinner's stead, and then that sinner after all having to bear his
          own iniquities; I can never indulge a thought which appears to be so
          unrighteous to God, and so unsafe to men. All that the Saviour bought
          he shall have, all that his heavenly Father hath given him, he says,
          shall come unto him. Now here is something solid for thee, poor soul.
          I ask again, dost thou know and feel thyself to be lost and ruined?
          Then the Saviour bought thee, and will have thee; then he was punished
          for thee and thou never wilt be punished again; then he hung upon the
          cross for thee that thou mightest not perish. For thee there is no
          hell, so far as thou art concerned. The eternal lake is quenched; the
          dungeons of hell are broken open, their bars are cut in sunder. Thou
          art free; no damnation can ever seize thee, no devils can ever drag
          thee to the pit. Thou art redeemed, and thou art saved. "What!" sayest
          thou, "I redeemed! Why, sir, I am full of sin." It is the very reason
          why thou art redeemed. "But I feel myself to be the guiltiest of all
          the human race." Yes, and that is just the evidence that Christ died
          for thee. He says himself, "I came not to call the righteous, but
          sinners to repentance." If you have got abundance of good works, and
          think you can go to heaven by them, you will perish; but if you know
          your guilt, and confess it -- it is not my affirmation, but the
          affirmation of the Scriptures -- "This is a faithful saying, and
          worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to
          save sinners, of whom," says the Apostle, "I am chief." Lay hold on
          that, poor soul: and then I repeat to thee the text, "Yet surely I
          know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before
          him." It shall be well with thee yet, and black though thou art, thou
          shalt one day sing among the bloodwashed ones in glory everlasting.
          That is the first stage of fearing God; we shall now proceed to
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. There are many who have believed, and are truly converted, who
          have a fear which I may call THE FEAR OF ANXIETY. They are afraid that
          they are not converted. They are converted, there is no doubt of it.
          Sometimes they know they are so themselves, but, for the most part,
          they are afraid. There are some people in the world who have a
          preponderance of fear in their characters it seems as if their mind,
          from its peculiar constitution, had a greater aptitude for the state
          of fear than for any other state. Why, even in temporal matters they
          are always fearing; and, when these poor souls get converted, they are
          always afraid that they are not so. First, they will tell you they are
          afraid they never repented enough; the work in their hearts, they say,
          was not deep; it was just superficial surface-ploughing, and never
          entered into their souls. Then they are quite sure they never came to
          Christ aright, they think they came the wrong way. How that can be no
          one knows, for they could not come at all except the Father drew them;
          and the Father did not draw them the wrong way, Still they hold that
          they did not come aright; then if that idea is knocked on the head,
          they say they do not believe aright; but when that is got rid of, they
          say, if they were converted they would not be the subject of so much
          sin. They say they can trust Christ, but they are afraid they do not
          trust him aright; and they always do, what you may, come back to the
          old condition; they are always afraid. And now, what shall I say to
          these good souls? Why, I will say this, "Surely I know that it shall
          be well with them that fear God, which fear before him." Not only
          those who believe, but those who fear, have got a promise, I would to
          God that they had more faith; I would that they could lay hold on the
          Saviour, and had more assurance, and even attain unto a perfect
          confidence; but if they cannot shall I utter a word that would hurt
          them? God forbid; "Surely it shall be with even with them that fear
          God, with them that fear before him." There are some of these poor
          creatures who are the holiest and most heavenly minded people in all
          the world. I have seen men who, with poor, desponding spirits, have
          exhibited the most lovely graces. There has not been the blushing
          healthful beauty of the rose; but the lily hath its beauties, sickly
          though it seemeth, and these, though they be faint and weak, have
          eminently the graces of humility and meekness, of patience and
          endurance, and they practice more of meditation, more of self
          examination, more of repentance more of prayer, than any race of
          Christians alive. God forbid that I should vex their spirits: there
          are some of God's best children who always grow in the shade of fear,
          and can scarcely attain to so much as to say, "I know whom I have
          believed." Darkness suits them best, their eyes are weak, and much
          sunlight seems to blind them, they love the shadows; and though they
          thought they could sing, "I know my Saviour, I love him, and he loves
          me;" they go back again, and begin to groan in themselves, "Do I love
          the Lord; indeed, if it be so, why am I thus?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I am about to utter a great paradox -- I believe that some of
          these poor fearing people have got the greatest faith of anybody in
          the world; I have sometimes thought that great tear, great anxiety,
          must have great faith with it to keep the soul alive at all. See that
          man drowning, there -- there is another in the water too, I see. He in
          the distance thinks he can swim: a plank is thrown to him; he believes
          himself to be in no danger of sinking. Well he clutches the plank very
          leisurely, and does not seem to grasp it firmly. But this poor
          creature here, he knows he cannot swim, he feels that he must soon
          sink Now put the means of escape near him, how desperately he clutches
          it; how he seems as if he would drive his fingers through the plank!
          He clutches it for life or death, that is his all, for he must perish
          if he is not saved by that. Now, in this case, he that fears the most
          believes the most; and I do think it is so sometimes with poor
          desponding spirits. They have the greatest fear of hell, and the
          greatest fear of themselves, and the greatest dread that they are not
          right. Oh, what a faith they must have, when they are enabled to throw
          themselves on Christ, and when they can but whisper to themselves "I
          think that he is mine" -- "Surely I know that it shall be well with
          them that fear God, which fear-before him."
        </p>
        <p>
          But I want to comfort these poor souls a little. I do not think a
          minister does well in killing the lambs; for where would be the sheep
          next year if he should do so? But at the same time it is his business
          to make the lambs grow into sheep if he can. And you who are fearing,
          I would not say a word to hurt you, but I would say a word to comfort
          you if I could; I would remind you that you are not fit to judge of
          yourself. You have been just now examining yourself, and you came to
          the conclusion that you really are not a child of God. Now, you will
          not be offended with me, but I would not give one single farthing for
          your opinion of yourself. Why, I tell you, you have not any judgment.
          It is not long ago you were a base, presumptuous sinner, and then you
          thought yourself all right. I did not believe you then. Well, then you
          began to reform yourself. You practiced many good works, and thought,
          surely you were mending your pace to heaven then. Then I knew you were
          wrong. Now you are becoming a true believer in Christ, but you are
          very fearful, and you say you are not safe. I know you are; you are
          not fit to judge. I should not like to see you elevated to the bench;
          you would scarcely know how to deal with other men, for you would not
          know how to deal with yourself; and who is he that can deal with
          himself? We sometimes think ourselves proud, and we are never more
          humble than when we feel that we are proud. At other times, we think
          ourselves to be wonderfully humble, and we are never more proud than
          then. We sometimes say within ourselves, "Now I think I am overcoming
          my corruptions;" that is just the time when they are about to attack
          us most severely. At another time we are crying, "Surely I shall be
          cut off," that is just the period when sin is being routed, because we
          are hating it the most and crying out the most against it. We are not
          qualified to fudge ourselves, our poor scales are so out of order,
          that they will never tell the truth. Now, then, just give up your own
          judgment, except thus far. Can you say that you "are a poor sinner and
          nothing at all, and that Jesus Christ is your all in all?" Then be
          comforted. You have no right to be anxious; you have no reason to be
          so. You could not say that if you had not been converted. You must
          have been quickened by grace, or else you would not be anxious at all;
          and you must have faith, or else you would not be able even to lay
          hold of Christ so much as to know your own nothingness and his all
          sufficiency. Poor soul! be comforted.
        </p>
        <p>
          But shall I tell thee one thing? Dost thou know the greatest of God's
          people are often in the same condition as thou art now? "No, no," says
          the fearful soul, "I do not believe that, I believe that when persons
          are converted they never have any fear," and they look at the
          minister, and they say, "Oh, but if I could be but like that minister;
          I know he never has doubts and fears. Oh, if I could be like old
          deacon So-and-so -- such a holy man how he prays! Oh, if I could feel
          like Mr. So-and-so, who calls to visit me, and talks to me so sweetly.
          They never doubt." Ah, that is because you do not know. Those whom you
          think to be the strongest, and are so in public, have their times of
          the greatest weakness, when they can scarcely know their own names in
          spiritual things. If one may speak for the rest, those of us who enjoy
          the greatest portions of assurance have times when we would give all
          the world to know ourselves to be possessors of grace; when we would
          be ready to sacrifice our lives if we might but have the shadow of a
          hope that we were in the love of Jesus Christ our Lord. Now, little
          one, if the giants go there, what wonder if the dwarfs must? What if
          God's favourite and chosen ones, what if his valiant men, the body
          guard of Christ, those men whose swords are on their thighs, and who
          stand up for the truth and are its champions -- if they sometimes are
          weak, what wonder if thou shouldest be weak? What if the heirs of
          salvation and the soldiers of the cross sometimes feel their knees
          feeble and their hands hang down and their hearts faint, what wonder
          if thou, who art less than the least of all saints shouldst sometimes
          be in trouble too? Oh, be of good cheer; fear will never kill anybody.
          "Doubts and fears," said an old preacher, once, "are like the
          toothache nothing more painful, but never fatal." They will often
          grieve us, but they will never kill us, they distress us much but they
          will never burn the soul. Fears even do good at times. Let me not
          however, praise them too much. I heard a preacher say, the other day,
          that fear was a good housekeeper. I said, "So I have heard, but I do
          not believe it. She never will keep a cupboard full; she is a good
          doorkeeper; she can keep beggars and thieves away; she is a good
          housedog to guard us and protect us in the night, and warn us of
          dangers, lest we fall into them." The fear of anxiety then, is a good
          fear. Take this promise -- "Surely I know that it shall be well with
          them that fear God, which fear before him."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. And now, my brethren, in the next place there is A FEAR WHICH
          WORKS CAUTION. When we get a little further advanced in the Christian
          life, our present state is not so much a matter of anxiety as our
          future state. We believe that we shall never totally fall from grace.
          We hold it as a cardinal doctrine of our religion that by no means
          will God ever leave his people or suffer them to perish. But we often
          think within ourselves, I am afraid lest I should bring dishonor on
          the cause of Christ; I am afraid lest, in some moment of temptation, I
          shall be left to go astray; I am afraid lest I should lose that
          hallowed peace and that delightful joy which it has been my privilege
          to enjoy, and shall yet go back into the world. God grant I may not
          prove to be a hypocrite, after all! Now, I have hundreds of persons
          just now in this place, who are feeling like this, and I will tell you
          one ill effect of this fear. These persons say, "I dare not join the
          church, because I am afraid I shall fall." A friend mentions to them
          that they hold it to be their duty, if they have believed, to make a
          profession of their faith in baptism. They say, "Well, I believe it to
          be my duty to partake of the two institutions of our Saviour; I ought
          to be buried with him in baptism unto death; I ought also, I know, to
          hold fellowship with him in the Lord's supper, but I dare not join the
          church; for suppose I should bring dishonor upon the cause, suppose I
          should disgrace the church, what a sad thing it would be!" That fear
          is good, in itself. But do you think that you would not bring disgrace
          on Christ's cause as it is? You are always at the place of worship;
          you are never away. You were always looked upon as being one of the
          church, though you have not made a profession. Now, if you were to
          sin, would it not dishonor the church even now? You know your
          relatives and friends esteem you to be a Christian. You would scarce
          dishonor the church more if you were actually to join it; for you
          really are united with it. If you would be consistent, you must never
          go to the chapel any more. Just stop away; give up your seat; turn
          right down irreligious, and then you cannot dishonor the church. Do
          one or the other, but never think you will be saving Christ's church
          by dishonoring God, as you really are doing now. And then I will ask
          you this question, Where do you think a man is safest -- in the paths
          of obedience, or in the paths of disobedience? Now you know you are
          disobedient; you are quite sure of that. Do you think you are safer
          where your wayward will leads you, or where God's Spirit points the
          way? And remember this, if you cannot trust God to keep you standing,
          you must have a poor faith indeed. If you cannot just risk that and be
          united with the church, and hope that Christ will keep you, then I
          fear you will have some terrible fall. If you do not join the church,
          you will bring far more disgrace upon it by being outside it, than you
          would have done if you had been united with it and had been kept. Ah,
          friends, I believe that union with the Christian church is often a
          means under God, of preserving men from sin; for then they think there
          is a bond upon them, and a sacred claim, and many of them are more
          careful what they do. And I trust there would be the same check upon
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, I daresay that the poor creature who has been uttering this,
          thinks I am about to condemn her; and the poor man who has been
          talking so thinks I would cut him off and say he is no child of God.
          God forbid! My text belongs to him. You are afraid you will fall into
          sin -- "Surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God,
          which fear before him." If you should tell me you were not afraid of
          falling, I would not have you in the church for the world; you would
          be no Christian. All Christians, when they are in a right state, are
          afraid of falling into sin. Holy fear is the proper condition of a
          child of God. Even the most confident will not go into presumption. He
          that knows his love to the Saviour, and his Saviour's rove to him, is
          yet afraid lest he should dishonor him. If there be a man who has an
          assurance of such a kind, as to put fear out of the question, so that
          he is never afraid of sinning, I will tell him he has a satanic
          assurance, an assurance which came from Satan and not from God for the
          more assured we are of our own conversion, the more careful we shall
          be lest we should offend God, and the more fearful lest by word or
          look, or deed, we should grieve God's Holy Spirit. I love your fear,
          and love you too for it, you are my brother and sister in Jesus, if
          you can truly say that you fear lest you should sin. Seek then, my
          friends, to grow in this fear of caution, obtain more and more of it;
          and whilst thou dost not distrust the Saviour, learn to distrust
          thyself more and more every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. I shall not detain you many more minutes; I have only to notice in
          the next mace the fear which I may call THE FEAR OF JEALOUSY. Strong
          love will usually promote jealousy. "Love is as strong as death;" then
          comes the next, "Jealousy is cruel as the grave." We cannot love
          strongly without feeling some jealousy -- I mean, not jealousy against
          the object of our love; for, "perfect love casteth out fear" -- but
          jealousy against ourselves. "Oh what jealousy," says the Apostle,
          addressing the Corinthians, "what revenge," did grace work in you when
          you were first converted. The true believer, when he gets his Saviour
          in full possession, and in blissful communion, is so jealous lest any
          rival should intrude in his heart; be is afraid lest his dearest
          friend should get more of his heart than the Saviour has. He is afraid
          of his wealth; he trembles at his health, at his fame, at everything
          that is dear to him, lest it should engross his heart. Oh, how often
          does he pray, "My Lord, let me not be of a divided spirit; cast down
          each idol -- self-will, self-righteousness." And I tell you the more
          he loves, the more he will fear lest he should provoke his Saviour by
          bringing a rival into his heart, and setting up an Antichrist in his
          spirit; so that fear just goes in proportion to love; and the bright
          love is congenial, and must walk side by side with the deepest
          jealousy and the profoundest fear. Seek, my brethren to know the
          meaning of communion, and you must know, then, the meaning of fear;
          for fear and communion must, to a great degree go together.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. And now I will conclude by just mentioning that fear which is felt
          WHEN WE HAVE HAD DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS. Did you never, in the silence
          of the night, look up and view the stars, feeding, like sheep, on the
          azure pastures of the sky? Have you never thought of those great
          worlds, far, far away, divided from us by almost illimitable leagues
          of space? Did you never, whilst musing on the starry heavens, lose
          yourself in thoughts of God; and have you never felt, at such a time,
          that you could say with Jacob, "How dreadful is this place! This is
          none other than the house of God, and the very gate of heaven." Have
          you never seen the craggy hills lift their summits to the skies? Have
          you never marked the tempests sailing o'er them, and seen the
          thunder-cloud burst upon the mountain, and heard the heavens shake
          beneath the tramp of the Most High, and seen the skies all glaring red
          with fire, when God hath sent his thunder-bolts abroad; and have you
          not trembled that God was there, and in other and happier seasons have
          you not in your chamber been so wrapt in devotion, have you not so
          manifestly known the presence of God that you were filled with
          trembling? Fear took hold upon you and made all your bones to shake,
          not because you dreaded God, but because you then saw some of his
          greatness. It is said of Moses, that when he saw the burning bush he
          feared to look upon God. God is so great a Being, that the rightly
          constituted mind must always fear when it approaches into his
          presence. The Eastern subject, when he came before his king, regarded
          him as a being so infinitely superior to himself, that even in the
          vestibule he began to shake, and as he neared the throne he began to
          totter and his cheek was blanched with fear. Like Esther, he would
          faint when he came before the king, so glorious was his majesty. And
          if it be so with earthly monarchs, how fearful must it be to come into
          the presence chamber of the King of kings, and to feel one's self near
          him! Why, I believe that even in heaven we shall have this kind of
          fear. Certainly the angels have it. They dare not look on God. They
          veil their faces with their wings, and whilst they cry aloud, Holy,
          holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts yet they dare not view him. The very
          sight of him might destroy them, and they tremble at his presence. Now
          this kind of fear, if you have ever felt it, if it has been produced
          in your heart by contemplation of God, is a high and hallowed thing,
          and to you this promise is addressed -- "Surely I know that it shall
          be well with them that fear God, which fear before him."
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, might I go round again this morning -- I cannot do it
          personally, yet by my voice -- to the poor trembling soul who is
          overcome with sin. Poor man, where art thou? Hath the devil got hold
          of thee, and have thy sins covered thee up, so that thou canst not see
          the face of the sun, and behold the light of mercy? Listen to me; you
          may never hope till you have left off hoping in yourself. You have
          never any right to believe, till you have nothing to believe in
          yourself. Until you have lost all, you have no right to take anything.
          But now, if you have lost all your own good works and righteousness,
          if you feel that there is no reason why you should be saved, that is
          the very reason why you should be. My Master bids me tell the naked to
          come to his heavenly wardrobe, and take his royal garment for their
          clothing. He bids me tell the hungry to haste away to his heavenly
          granaries, and feed upon the old corn of the kingdom to their very
          full. He bids me tell the thirsty that the river of life is broad and
          deep, and flows freely to all those who thirst after it. Now, sinner,
          if thou art sick of sin, and grieved at heart where thou standest,
          follow me in spirit in these words: "O Lord, I know my guilt, and I
          confess my misery. If thou dampest me to all eternity, thou wilt be
          just; but, O Lord, have mercy upon me, according to thy promise, which
          thou hast made in Christ Jesus, unto those who confess their faults."
          If that came from your heart, go out of that door, and sing all the
          way home, for you are a pardoned sinner. You shall never see death --
          the second death, the death of the soul. Go home to your chamber! let
          your heart burst itself in tears of thankfulness. Go, and there
          prostrate yourself, and bless God that he has enabled you to see that
          only Jesus can do a helpless sinner good. And then, "go your way; eat
          your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart. Let your
          head lack no oil, and your face no ointment; for God hath accepted
          you; and you have a right to be happy. Live cheerfully and joyfully
          all the days of your life, hereafter and for ever."<br />
