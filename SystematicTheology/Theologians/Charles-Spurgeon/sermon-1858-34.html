        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.198)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Friday Afternoon, June 11, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>on the Grand Stand, Epsom Race-Course.</p>
        <p>"So run, that ye may obtain." -- 1 Corinthians 9:24.</p>
        <p>
          WE ARE CONTINUALLY insisting upon it from day to day, that salvation
          is not of works, but of grace. We lay this down as one of the very
          first doctrines of the gospel. "Not of works, lest any man should
          boast." "By grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of
          yourselves; it is the gift of God." But we find that it is equally
          necessary to preach the absolute necessity of a religious life for the
          attainment of heaven at last. Although we are sure that men are not
          saved for the sake of their works, yet are we equally sure that no man
          will be saved without them; and that he who leads an unholy life, who
          neglects the great salvation, can never inherit that crown of life
          which fadeth not away. In one sense, true religion is wholly the work
          of God; yet there are high and important senses in which we must
          ourselves "strive to enter in at the strait gate." We must run a race;
          we must wrestle even to agony; we must fight a battle, before we can
          inherit the crown of life. We have in our text the course of religion
          set down as a race; and inasmuch as there be many who enter upon a
          profession of religion with very false motives, the apostle warns us
          that although all run in a race, yet all do not obtain the prize: they
          run all, but only one is rewarded: and he gives us, therefore, the
          practical exhortation to run that we may obtain; for unless we are the
          winners we had better not have been runners at all; for he that is not
          a winner is a loser; he who makes a profession of religion, and does
          not at last obtain the crown of life, is a loser by his profession;
          for his profession was hypocrisy or else formality, and he had better
          not have made a profession, than fall therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, in entering upon the text, I shall have to notice what it is
          we are to run for: "So run that ye may obtain;" secondly, the mode of
          running, to which we must attend -- "So run that ye may obtain;" and
          then I shall give a few practical exhortations to stir those onward in
          the heavenly race who are flagging and negligent, in order that they
          may at last "obtain."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. In the first place, then, WHAT IS IT THAT WE OUGHT TO SEEK TO
          OBTAIN?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people think they must be religious, in order to be respectable.
          There are a vast number of people in the world who go to church and to
          chapel, because everybody else does so. It is disreputable to waste
          your Sundays, not to be found going up to the house of God, therefore
          they take a pew and attend the services, and they think they have done
          their duty: they have obtained all that they sought for, when they can
          hear their neighbors saying, "Such-and-such a man is a very
          respectable person; he is always very regular at his Church; he is a
          very reputable person, and exceedingly praiseworthy." Verily, if this
          be what you seek after in your religion, you shall get it; for the
          Pharisees who sought the praise of men "had their reward." But when
          you have gotten it, what a poor reward it is! Is it worth the
          drudgery? I do not believe that the drudgery to which people submit in
          order to be called respectable, is at an compensated by what they
          gain. I am sure, for my own part, I would not care a solitary rap what
          I was called, or what I was thought; nor would I perform anything that
          was irksome to myself for the sake of pleasing any man that ever
          walked beneath the stars, however great or mighty he may be. It is the
          sign of a fawning, cringing spirit, when people are always seeking to
          do that which renders them respectable. The esteem of men is not worth
          the looking after, and sad it is, that this should be the only prize
          which some men put before them, in the poor religion which they
          undertake.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are people who go a little farther: they are not content with
          being considered respectable, but they want something more; they
          desire to be considered pre-eminently saints. These persons come to
          our places of worship, and after a little time they venture to come
          forward and ask whether they may unite with our churches. We examine
          them, and so hidden is their hypocrisy that we cannot discover its
          rottenness: we receive them into our churches; they sit at the Lord's
          Supper; they come to our church-meetings: mayhap, they are even voted
          into the deacon's office; sometimes they attain to the pulpit, though
          God has never called them, and preach what they have never felt in
          their hearts. Men may do all this merely to enjoy the praise of men;
          and they will even undergo some persecution for the sake of it;
          because to be thought a saint, to be reckoned by religious people to
          be everything that is right and proper, to have a name among the
          living in Zion, is to some persons a thing exceedingly coveted. They
          would not like to be set down among the "chief of sinners," but if
          they may have their names written among the chief of saints they will
          consider themselves exceedingly exalted. I am afraid we have a
          considerable admixture of persons of this sort in our churches who
          only come for the mere sake of keeping up their religious pretensions
          and obtaining a religious status in the midst of the church of God.
          "Verily, I say unto you they have their reward," and they shall never
          have any but what they obtain here. They get their reward for a little
          time. for a short time they are looked up to. but perhaps even in this
          life they make a trip, and down they go; the church discovers them,
          and they are sent out like the ass stripped of the lion's skin to
          browse once more among their native nettles, no longer to be glorious
          in the midst of the church of the living God. Or mayhap, they may wear
          the cloak until the last day of their lives, and then death comes, and
          strips them of all their tinsel and gewgaw; And they who acted upon
          the stage of religion as kings and princes, are sent behind the stage
          to be unrobed and to find themselves beggars to their shame, and naked
          to their eternal disgrace. It is not this which you and I would seek
          after in religion. Dearly beloved, if we do run the race, we would run
          for a higher and more glorious prize than any of these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another set of people take up with religious life for what they can
          get by it. I have known tradespeople attend church for the mere sake
          of getting the custom of those who went there. I have heard of such
          things as people knowing which side their bread was buttered, and
          going to that particular denomination, where they thought they could
          get the most by it. Loaves and fishes drew some of Christ's followers,
          and they are very attracting baits, even to this day. Men find there
          is something to be gotten by religion. Among the poor it is, perhaps,
          some little charity to be obtained, and among those that are in
          business, it is the custom which they think to get. "Verily I say unto
          you, they have their reward;" for the church is ever foolish and
          unsuspicious. We do not like to suspect our fellow creatures of
          following us from sordid motives. The church does not like to think
          that a man would be base enough to pretend to religion for the mere
          sake of what he can get, and, therefore, we let these people easily
          slip through, and they have their reward. But ah! at what a price they
          buy it! They have deceived the Lord's servants for gold, and they have
          entered into his church as base hypocrites for the sake of a piece of
          bread; and they shall be thrust out at last with the anger of God
          behind them, like Adam driven out of Eden, with the flaming Cherubim
          with a sword turning every way to keep the tree of life; and they
          shall for ever look back upon this as the most fearful crime they have
          committed -- that they pretended to be God's people when they were
          not, and entered into the midst of the fold when they were but wolves
          in sheeps' clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is yet another class, and when I have referred to them I will
          mention no more. These are the people who take up with religion for
          the sake of quieting their conscience, and it is astonishing how
          little of religion will sometimes do that. Some people tell us that if
          in the time of storm men would pour bottles of oil upon the waves,
          there would be a great calm at once. I have never tried it, and it is
          most probable I never shall, for my organ of credulity is not large
          enough to accept so extensive a statement. But there are some people
          who think that they can calm the storm of a troubled conscience by
          pouring a little of the oil of a profession about religion upon it;
          and it is amazing how wonderful an effect this really has. I have
          known a man who was drunk many times in a week, and who got his money
          dishonestly, and yet he always had an easy conscience by going to his
          church or chapel regularly on the Sunday. We have heard of a man who
          could "devour widows' houses" -- a lawyer who could swallow up
          everything that came in his way, and yet he would never go to bed
          without saying his prayers; and that stilled his conscience. We have
          heard of other persons, especially among the Romanists,. who would not
          object to thieving, but who would regard eating anything but fish on a
          Friday as a most fearful sin, supposing that by making a fast on the
          Friday, all the iniquities of all the days in the week would be put
          away. They want the outward forms of religion to keep the conscience
          quiet; for Conscience is one of the worst lodgers to have in your
          house when he gets quarrelsome: there is no abiding with him; he is an
          ill bed-fellow; ill at lying down, and equally troublesome at rising
          up. A guilty conscience is one of the curses of the world: it puts out
          the sun, and takes away the brightness from the moonbeam. A guilty
          conscience casts a noxious exhalation through the air, removes the
          beauty from the landscape, the glory from the flowing river, the
          majesty from the rolling floods. There is nothing beautiful to the man
          that has a guilty conscience. He needs no accusing; everything accuses
          him. Hence people take up with religion just to quiet them. They take
          the sacrament sometimes; they go to a place of worship; they sing a
          hymn now and then, they give a guinea to a charity; they intend to
          leave a portion in their will to build alms-houses, and in this way
          conscience is lulled asleep, and they rock him to and fro with
          religious observances, till there he sleeps while they sing over him
          the lullaby of hypocrisy, and he wakes not until he shall wake with
          that rich man who was here clothed in purple, but in the next world
          did lift up his eyes in hell, being in torments, without a drop of
          water to cool his burning tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          What, then, is it, for which we ought to run in this race? Why heaven,
          eternal life, justification by faith, the pardon of sin, acceptance in
          the Beloved, and glory everlasting. If you run for anything else than
          salvation, should you will, what you have won is not worth the running
          for. Oh! I beseech every one of you, make sure work for eternity,
          never be contented with anything less than a living faith in a living
          Saviour; rest not until you are certain that the Holy Spirit is at
          work in your souls. Do not think that the outside of religion can be
          of use to you; it is just the inward part of religion that God loveth.
          Seek to have a repentance that needeth not to be repented of -- a
          faith which looks alone to Christ, and which will stand by you when
          you come into the swellings of Jordan, Seek to have a love which is
          not like a transient flame, burning for a moment and then
          extinguished; but a flame which shall increase and increase, and still
          increase, till your heart shall be swallowed up therein, and Jesus
          Christ's one name shall be the sole object of your affection. We must,
          in running the heavenly race, set nothing less before us than that
          which Christ did set before him. He set the joy of salvation before
          himself, and then he did run, despising the cross and enduring the
          shame. So let us do; and may God give us good success, that by his
          good Spirit we may attain unto eternal life, through the resurrection
          of Jesus Christ our Lord!
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Thus have I noticed what it is we are to run for. And now the
          Apostle says, "So run that ye may obtain." I shall notice some people
          who never will obtain, and tell you the reason why, and in so doing, I
          shall be illustrating THE RULES OF THE RACE.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some people who certainly never will obtain the prize,
          because they are not even entered. Their names are not down for the
          race, and therefore it is quite clear that they will not run, or if
          they do run, they will run without having any warrant whatever for
          expecting to receive the prize. There are some such here this
          afternoon: who will tell you themselves, "We make no profession, sir
          -- none whatever." It is quite as well, perhaps, that you do not;
          because if you did, you would be hypocrites, and it is better to make
          no profession at all than to be hypocrites. Still, recollect, your
          names are not down for the race, and therefore you cannot win. If a
          man tells you in business that he makes no profession of being honest,
          you know that he is a confirmed rogue. If a man makes no profession of
          being religious, you know what he is -- he is irreligious -- he has no
          fear of God before his eyes, he has no love to Christ, he has no hope
          of heaven. He confesses it himself. Strange that men should be so
          ready to confess this. You don't find persons in the street willing to
          acknowledge that they are confirmed drunkards. Generally a man will
          repudiate it with scorn. You never find a man saying to you, "I don't
          profess to be a chaste living man." You don't hear another say, "I
          don't profess to be anything but a covetous wretch." No; people are
          not so fast about telling their faults: and yet you hear people
          confess the greatest fault to which man can be addicted: they say, "I
          make no profession" -- which means just this -- that they do not give
          God his due. God has made them, and yet they won't serve him; Christ
          hath come into the world to save sinners, and yet they will not regard
          him; the gospel is preached; and yet they will not hear it, they have
          the Bible in their houses, and yet they will not attend to its
          admonitions: they make no profession of doing so. It will be short
          work with them at the last great day. There will be no need for the
          books to be opened, no need for a long deliberation in the verdict.
          They do not profess to be pardoned; their guilt is written upon their
          own foreheads, their brazen shamelessness shall be seen by the whole
          world, as a sentence of destruction written upon their very brows. You
          cannot expect to win heaven unless your names are entered for the
          race. If there be no attempts whatever made, even at so much as a
          profession of religion, then of course you may just sit down and say,
          "Heaven is not for me; I have no part nor lot in the inheritance of
          Israel, I cannot say that my Redeemer liveth; and I may rest quite
          assured that Tophet is prepared of old for me. I must feel its pains
          and know its miseries; for there are but two places to dwell in
          hereafter, and if I am not found on the right hand of the Judge, there
          is but one alternative -- namely, to be cast away for ever into the
          blackness of darkness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there is another class whose names are down, but they never
          started right. A bad start is a sad thing. If in the ancient races of
          Greece or Rome a man who was about to run for the race had loitered,
          or if he had started before the time it would not matter how fast he
          ran, if he did not start in order. The flag must drop before the horse
          starts; otherwise, even if it reach the winning post first, it shall
          have no reward. There is something to be noted, then, in the starting
          of the race. I have known men run the race of religion with all their
          might, and yet they have lost it because they did not start right. You
          say, "Well, how is that?" Why, there are some people who on a sudden
          leap into religion. They get it quickly, and they keep it for a time.
          and at last they lose it because they did not get their religion the
          right way. They have heard that before a man can be saved, it is
          necessary that, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, he should feel the
          weight of sin, that he should make a confession of it, that he should
          renounce all hope in his own works, and should look to Jesus Christ
          alone. They look upon all these things as unpleasant preliminaries and
          therefore, before they have attended to repentance, before the Holy
          Spirit has wrought a good work in them before they have been brought
          to give up everything and trust to Christ, they make a profession of
          religion. This is just setting up in business without a stock in
          trade, and there must be a failure. If a man has no capital to begin
          with, he may make a fine show for a little time, but it shall be as
          the crackling of thorns under a pot, a great deal of noise and much
          light for a little time, but it shall die out in darkness. How many
          there are who never think it necessary that there should be heart work
          within! Let us remember, however, that there never was a true new
          birth without much spiritual suffering, that there never was a man who
          had a changed heart without his first having a miserable heart. We
          must pass through that black tunnel of conviction before we can come
          out upon the high embankment of holy joy; we must first go through the
          Slough of Despond before we can run along the walls of Salvation.
          There must be ploughing before there is sowing; there must be many a
          frost, and many a sharp shower before there is any reaping. But we
          often act like little children who pluck flowers from the shrubs and
          plant them in their gardens without roots; then they say how fair and
          how pretty their little garden is; but wait a little while, and their
          flowers are withered, because they have no roots. This is an the
          effect of not having a right start, not having the "root of the
          matter." What is the good of outward religion, the flower and the leaf
          of it, unless we have the "root of the matter" in us -- unless we have
          been digged into by that sharp iron spade of conviction, and have been
          ploughed with the plough of the Spirit, and then have been sown with
          the sacred seed of the gospel, in the hope of bringing forth an
          abundant harvest? There must be a good start; look well to that, for
          there is no hope of running unless the start be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, there are some runners in the heavenly race who cannot win
          because they carry too much weight. A light weight, of course, has the
          advantage. There are come people who have an immensely heavy weight to
          carry. "How hardly shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of heaven!"
          What is the reason? Because he carries so much weight; he has so much
          of the cares and pleasures of this world; he has such a burden that he
          is not likely to win, unless God should please to give him a mighty
          mass of strength to enable him to bear it. We find many men willing to
          be saved, as they say; they receive the word with great joy, but
          by-and-bye thorns spring up and choke the word. They have so much
          business to do; they say they must live; they forget they must die.
          They have such a deal to attend to, they cannot think of living near
          to Christ. They find they have little time for devotions; morning
          prayer must be cut short, because their business begins early; they
          can have no prayer at night, because business keeps them so late. How
          can they be expected to think of the things of God? They have so much
          to do to answer this question -- "What shall I eat? what shall I
          drink? and wherewithal shall I be clothed?" It is true they read in
          the Bible that their Father who is in heaven will take care of them in
          these things if they will trust him. But they say, "Not so." Those are
          enthusiasts according to their notions who rely upon providence. They
          say, the best providence in all the world is hard work; and they say
          rightly, but they forget that into the bargain of their hard work "it
          is in vain to rise up early and sit up late, and eat the bread of
          carefulness; for except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain
          that build it." You see two men running a race. One of them, as he
          starts, lays aside every weight, he takes off his garment and away he
          runs. There goes the other poor fellow, he has a whole load of gold
          and silver upon his back. Then around his loins he has many
          distrustful doubts about what shall become of him in the future, what
          will be his prospects when he grows old, and a hundred other things.
          He does not know how to roll his burden upon the Lord. See how he
          flags, poor fellow, and how the other distances him, leaves him far
          behind, has gained the corner, and is coming to the winning post. It
          is well for us if we can cast everything away except that one thing
          needful, and say, "This is my business, to serve God on earth, knowing
          that I shall enjoy him in heaven." For when we leave our business to
          God, we leave it in better hands than if we took care of it ourselves.
          They who carve for themselves generally cut their fingers; but they
          who leave God to carve for them, shall never have an empty plate. He
          who will walk after the cloud shall go aright, but he who will run
          before it shall soon find that he has gone a fool's errand. "Blessed
          is the man who trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord.is." "The
          young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that wait upon the
          Lord shall not want any good thing." Our Saviour said, "Consider the
          lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
          spin, and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was
          not arrayed like one of these." Behold the fowls of the air, for they
          sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your
          heavenly Father feedeth them, are ye not much better than they?"
          "Trust in the Lord and do good, and verily thou shalt be fed." "His
          place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks; bread shall be given
          him; his waters shall be sure." "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
          his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."
          Carry the weight of this world's cares about you. and it will be as
          much as you can do to carry them and to stand upright under them, but
          as to running a race with such burdens, it is just impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also another thing that will prevent man's running the race.
          We have known people who stopped on their way to kick their fellows.
          Such things sometimes occur in a race. The horse, instead of speeding
          onwards to the mark, is of an angry disposition, and sets about
          kicking those that are running beside him -- there is not much
          probability of his coming in first. "Now they that run in a race run
          all, but one receiveth the prize." There is one however who never gets
          it, and that is the man who always attends to his fellow-creatures
          instead of himself. It is a mysterious thing that I never yet saw a
          man with a hoe on his shoulder, going to hoe his neighbour's garden,
          it is a rarity to see a farmer sending his team of horses to plough
          his neighbour's land; but it is a most singular thing that every day
          in the week I meet with persons who are attending to other people's
          character. If they go to the house of God and hear a trite thing said,
          they say at once "How suitable that was for Mrs. Smith and Mrs.
          Brown?" The thought never enters their head, how suitable it was to
          themselves. They lend their ears to everybody else, but they do not
          hear for themselves. When they get out of chapel, perhaps as they walk
          home, their first thought is, "Well, how can I find fault with my
          neighbors?" They think that putting other people down is going up
          themselves (there never was a greater mistake); that by picking holes
          in their neighbour's coat they mend their own They have so few virtues
          of their own that they do not like anybody else to have any therefore
          they do the best they can to despoil everything good in their
          neighbor; and it there be a little fault, they will look at it through
          a magnifying glass, but they will turn the glass the other way when
          they look at their own sins. Their own faults become exceedingly small
          while those of others become magnificently great. Now this is a fault
          not only among professing religious men, but among those who are not
          religious. We are all so prone to find fault with other people instead
          of attending to our own home affairs. We attend to the vineyards of
          others, but our own vineyard we have not kept. Ask a worldly man why
          he is not religious, and he tells you "Because so-and-so makes a
          profession of religion and is not consistent." Pray is that any
          business of yours? To your own Master you must stand or fall, and so
          must he; God is their judge, and not you. Suppose there are a great
          many inconsistent Christians -- and we are compelled to acknowledge
          that there are -- so much the more reason why you should be a good
          one. Suppose there are a great many who deceive others; so much the
          more reason you should set the world an example of what a genuine
          Christian is. "Ah! but," you say, "I am afraid there are very few."
          Then why don't you make one? But after all, is that your business?
          Must not every man bear his own burden? You will not be judged for
          other men's sins, you will not be saved by their faith, you will not
          be condemned for their unbelief. Every man must stand in his own
          proper flesh and blood at the bar of God, to account for the works
          done in his own body, whether they have been good or whether they have
          been evil. It will be of little avail for you to say at the day of
          judgment, "O Lord, I wee looking at my neighbors; O Lord, I was
          finding fault with the people in the village; I was correcting their
          follies." But thus saith the Lord: "Did I ever commission thee to be a
          judge or a divider over them? Why, if thou hadst so much time to
          spare, and so much critical judgment, didst thou not exercise it upon
          thyself? Why didst thou not examine thyself, so that thou mightest
          have been found ready and acceptable in the day of God?" These persons
          are not very likely to win the race, because they turn to kicking
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, there is another class of persons who will not win the race --
          namely, those who, although they seem to start very fair, very soon
          loiter. They dart ahead at the first starting, and distance all the
          others. There they fly away as if they had wings to their heels; but a
          little further on in the race, it is with difficulty that with whip
          and spur they are to be kept going at all, and they almost come to a
          stand still. Alas! this race of persons are to be discovered in all
          our churches. We get young people who come forward and make a
          profession of religion, and we talk with them, and we think it is all
          well with them, and for a little while they do run well; there is
          nothing wanting in them; we could hold them up as patterns for the
          imitation of others. Wait a couple of years. they drop off just by
          little and little. First, perhaps, there is the attendance on a
          week-day service neglected; then it is altogether discontinued; then
          one service on Sabbath; then perhaps family prayer, then private
          prayer -- one thing after another is given up, until at last the whole
          edifice which stood upright and looked so fair, having been built upon
          the sand, gives way before the shock of time, and down it falls, and
          great is the ruin thereof. Recollect, it is not starting that wins the
          race; it is running all the way. He that would be saved, must hold on
          to the end: "He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved."
          Stop and loiter in the race before you have come to the end thereof,
          and you have made one of the greatest mistakes that could possibly
          occur. On, on, on! while you live; still onward, onward, onward! for
          until you come to the grave, you have not come to your resting place
          until you arrive at the tomb, you have not come to the spot where you
          may cry "Halt!" Ever onward if ye would win. If you are content to
          lose, if you would lose your own soul, you may say, "Stop," if you
          please; but if you would be saved evermore, be on, on, till you have
          gained the prize.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is another class of persons, who are worse than these. They
          start well too, and they run very fast at first, but at last they leap
          over the posts and rails, they go quite out of the course altogether,
          and you do not know where they are gone. Every now and then, we get
          such people as this. They go out from us, because they are not of us,
          for had they been of us, doubtless they would have continued with us.
          I might point out in my congregation on the Sabbath-day, a man whom I
          saw start myself. I saw him running so well I almost envied him the
          joy he seemed always able to preserve, the faith which ever seemed to
          be so buoyant and full of jubilee. Alas! just when we thought he was
          speeding onwards to the prize, some temptation crossed his path, and
          he turned aside. Away he is scrambling far over the heath, out of the
          path of right, and men say, "Aha! aha! so would we have it; so would
          we have it." And they laugh and make merriment over him, because,
          having once named the name of Jesus Christ, he hath afterwards gone
          back again, and his last end is worse than the first. Those whom God
          starts never do this, for they are preserved in Christ Jesus. Those
          who have been "entered" in the great roll of the Covenant before all
          eternity shall persevere, by the aid of the good Spirit. He that began
          the good work in them, shall carry it on even unto the end. But, alas!
          there are many who run on their own account and in their own strength;
          and they are like the snail, which as it creeps, leaves its life as a
          trail upon its own path. They melt away; their nature decayeth; they
          perish, and where are they? Not in the church, but lost to all hope.
          They are like the dog that returned to his vomit, and the sow that was
          washed to her wallowing in the mire. "The last end of that man shall
          be worse than the first."
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not think I shall now mention any other class of persons. I have
          brought before you the rules of the race, if you would will; if you
          would "so run that you may obtain," you must first of all take care to
          start well; you must keep to the course; you must keep strait on; you
          must not stop on the road, or turn aside from it, but, urged on by
          Divine grace, you must ever fly onwards, "like an arrow from the bow,
          shot by an archer strong." And never rest until the march is ended,
          and you are made pillars in the house of your God, to go out no more
          for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. But now I am about to give you some few reasons to URGE YOU
          ONWARD IN THE HEAVENLY RACE -- those of you who are already running.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my reasons shall be this -- "We are compassed about by so great
          a cloud of witnesses." When zealous racers on yonder heath are flying
          across the plain, seeking to obtain the reward, the whole heath is
          covered with multitudes of persons, who are eagerly gazing upon them,
          and no doubt the noise of those who cheer them onward, and the
          thousand eyes of those who look upon them, have a tendency to make
          them stretch every nerve, and press with vigor on. It was so in the
          games to which the apostle alludes. There the people sat on raised
          platforms, while the racers ran before them, and they cried to them,
          and the friends of the racers urged them forward, and the kindly voice
          would ever be heard bidding them go on. Now, Christian brethren, how
          many witnesses are looking down upon you. Down! do I say? It is even
          so. From the battlements of heaven the angels look down upon you, and
          they seem to cry to-day to you with sweet, silvery voice, "Ye shall
          reap if ye faint not; ye shall be rewarded if ye continue stedfast in
          the work and faith of Christ." And the saints look down upon you --
          Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; martyrs and confessors, and your own pious
          relatives who have ascended to heaven, look down upon you, and if I
          might so speak, methinks sometimes you might hear the clapping of
          their hands when you have resisted temptation and overcome the enemy;
          and you might see their suspense when you are lagging in the course,
          and you might hear their friendly word of caution as they bid you gird
          up the loins of your mind, and lay aside every weight, and still speed
          forward, never resting to take your breath, never staying for a
          moment's ease till you have attained the flowery beds of heaven. where
          you may rest forever. And recollect, these are not the only eyes that
          are looking upon you. The whole world looks upon a Christian: he is
          the observed of all observers. In a Christian every fault is seen. A
          worldly man may commit a thousand faults, and nobody notices him; but
          let a Christian do so, and he will very soon have his faults published
          to the wide world. Everywhere men are looking at Christians. and it is
          quite right that they should do so. I remember a young man, a member
          of a Christian church, who went to a public-house hall of the lowest
          character; and he was no sooner mounting up the stairs, than one of
          them said, "Ah! here comes the Methodist; we will give it to him." As
          soon as they had him in the room, they first of all lead him up and
          down to let everybody see the Methodist who had come among them, and
          then they kicked him down stairs. I sent them my respectful
          compliments for doing so, for it served him right; and I took care
          that he was kicked down stairs in another sense afterwards, and kicked
          out of the church. The world would not have him and the church would
          not have him. The world then looks upon you, it never misses an
          opportunity of throwing your religion in your teeth. If you don't give
          sixteen ounces to the pound of morality, if you don't come up to the
          mark in everything, you will hear of it again. Don't think the world
          is ever asleep. We say, "as sound asleep as a church," and that is a
          very good proverb; but we cannot say, "as sound asleep as the world"
          for it never sleeps; it always has its eyes open, it is always
          watching us in all we do. The eyes of the world are upon you. "We are
          compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses;" "let us run with
          patience the race that is set before us." And there are darker and yet
          more malignant eyes that scowl upon us. There are spirits that people
          this air, who are under the prince of the power of the air, who watch
          every day for our halting.
        </p>
        <p>"Millions of spiritual creatures walk this earth,</p>
        <p>Both when we wake and when we sleep."</p>
        <p>
          And alas! those spiritual creatures are not all good. There be those
          that are not yet chained and reserved in darkness, but who are
          permitted by God to wander through this world like roaring lions,
          seeking whom they may devour, ever ready to tempt us. And there is one
          at the head of them called Satan, the enemy, and you know his
          employment. He has access to the throne of God, and he makes most
          horrid use of it, for he accuses us day and night before the throne.
          The accuser of the brethren is not yet cast down -- that is to be in
          the great day of the triumph of the Son of Man; but as Jesus stands
          our Advocate before the throne, so does old Satan first watch us and
          tempt us, and then stands as our accuser before the bar of God. O my
          dear brothers and sisters, if you have entered into this race, and
          have commenced it, let these many eyes urge you forward.
        </p>
        <p>"A cloud of witnesses around</p>
        <p>Hold thee in full survey;</p>
        <p>Forget the steps already trod,</p>
        <p>And onward urge thy way."</p>
        <p>
          And now a more urgent consideration still. Recollect, your race is win
          or lose -- death or life, hell or heaven, eternal misery or
          everlasting joy. What a stake that is for which you run. If I may so
          put it, you are running for your life; and if that does not make a man
          run nothing will. Put a man there on yonder hill, and put another
          after him with a drawn sword seeking his life, If there is any run in
          him you will soon see him run; there will be no need for us to shout
          out to him, "Run, man, run" for he is quite certain that his life is
          at hazard, and he speeds with all his might -- speeds till the veins
          stand like whipcords on his brow, and a hot sweat runs from every pore
          of his body -- and still flees onward. Now, he looks behind, and sees
          the avenger of blood speeding after him; he does not stop; he spurns
          the ground, and on he flees till he reaches the city of refuge, where
          he is safe. Ah! if we had eyes to see, and if we knew who it is that
          is pursuing us every afar of our lives, how we should run! for lo! O
          man, hell is behind thee, sin pursues thee, evil seeks to overtake
          thee; the City of Refuge has its gates wide open; I beseech thee, rest
          not till thou canst say with confidence, "I have entered into this
          rest, and now I am secure, I know that my Redeemer liveth." And rest
          not even then, for this is not the place for rest; rest not until thy
          six days work is done; and thy heavenly Sabbath is begun. Let this
          life be thy six days of ever-toiling faith. Obey thy Master's
          commandment; "labour therefore to enter into this rest," seeing that
          there are many who shall not enter in, because through their want of
          faith they shall not be able. If that urge not a man to speed forward,
          what can?
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me picture yet one more thing; and may that help you onward!
          Christian, run onward, for remember who it is that stands at the
          winning post. You are to run onward, always looking unto Jesus, then
          Jesus must be at the end. We are always to be looking forward, and
          never backward; therefore Jesus must be there. Are you loitering? See
          him with his open wounds. Are you about to leave the course? See him
          with his bleeding hands; will not that constrain you to devote
          yourself to him? Will not that impel you to speed your course, and
          never loiter until you have obtained the crown? Your dying Master
          cries to you to-day, and he says. "By my agony and bloody sweat; by my
          cross and passion, onward! By my life, which I gave for you; by the
          death which I endured for your sake, onward!" And see! He holds out
          his hand, laden with a crown sparkling with many a star, and he says,
          "By this crown, onward!" I beseech you, onward, my beloved; press
          forward, for "I know that there is laid up for me a crown of life
          which fadeth not away, and not for me only, but for all them that love
          his appearing."
        </p>
        <p>
          I have thus addressed myself to all sorts of characters. Will you this
          afternoon take that home to yourself which is the most applicable to
          your case. Those of you who make no profession of religion, are living
          without God and without Christ, strangers to the commonwealth of
          Israel, -- let me affectionately remind you that the day is coming
          when you will want religion. It is very well now to be sailing over
          the smooth waters of life, but the rough billows of Jordan will make
          you want a Saviour. It is hard work to die without a hope; to take
          that last leap in the dark is a frightful thing indeed. I have seen
          the old man die when he has declared he would not die. He has stood
          upon the brink of death, and he has said, "All dark, dark, dark! O
          God, I cannot die." And his agony has been fearful when the strong
          hand of the destroyer has seemed to push him over the precipice. He
          lingered shivering on the brink, and feared to launch away." And
          frightful was the moment when the foot slipped and the solid earth was
          left, and the soul was sinking into the depths of eternal wrath. You
          will want a Saviour then, when your pulse is faint and few; you will
          need an angel then to stand at your bedside: and when the spirit is
          departing, you will need a sacred convoy to pilot you through the dark
          clouds of death and guide you through the iron gate, and lead you to
          the blessed mansion in the land of the hereafter. Oh, "seek ye the
          Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the
          wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
          him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him; and to our
          God, for he will abundantly pardon. For my thoughts are not your
          thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the
          heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your
          ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." O Lord, turn us and we
          shall be turned. Draw us and we will run after thee; and thine shall
          be the glory; for the crown of our race shall be cast at thy feet, and
          thou shalt have the glory forever and ever.<br />
