          "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me." -- John
          10:27.
        </p>
        <p>
          CHRISTIANS ARE HERE compared to sheep. Not a very flattering
          comparison you may say; but then we do not wish to be flattered, nor
          would our Lord deem it good to flatter us, While far from flattering,
          it is, however, eminently consoling, for of all creatures there are
          not any more compassed about with infirmity than sheep. In this
          frailty of their nature they are a fit emblem of ourselves; at least,
          of so many of us as have believed in Jesus and become his disciples.
          Let others boast how strong they are; yet if there be strong ones
          anywhere, certainly we are weak. We have proved our weakness, and day
          by day we lament it. We do confess our weakness; yet may we not repine
          at it, for, as Paul said, so we find, when we are weak then are we
          strong. Sheep have many wants, yet they are very helpless, and quite
          unable to provide for themselves. But for the shepherd's cure they
          would soon perish. This, too, is our case. Our spiritual needs are
          numerous and pressing, Yet we cannot supply any of them. We are
          travelers through a wilderness that yields us neither food nor water.
          Unless our bread drop down from heaven, and our water flow out of the
          living rock, we must die. Our weakness and our want we keenly feel:
          still we have no cause to murmur, since the Lord knows our poor
          estate, and succours us with the tenderest care. Sheep, too, are silly
          creatures, and in this respect likewise we are very sheepish. We
          meekly own it to him who is ready to guide us. We say, as David said,
          "O God, thou knowest my foolishness;" and he says to us as he said to
          David, "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
          shalt go." If Christ were not our wisdom, we should soon fall a prey
          to the destroyer. Every grain of true wisdom that we possess we have
          derived from him; of ourselves we are dull and giddy; folly is bound
          up in our heart. The more conscious you are, dear brethren, of your
          own deficiencies, your lack of stamina, discretion, sagacity, and all
          the instincts of self-preservation, the more delighted you will be to
          see that the Lord accepts you under these conditions, and calls you
          the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. He discerns you
          as you are, claims you as his own, foresees all the ills to which you
          are exposed, yet tends you as his flock, sets store by every lamb of
          the fold, and so feeds you according to the integrity of his heart,
          and guides you by the skilfulness of his hands. "I will feed my flock,
          and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God." Oh, what sweet
          music there is to us in the name which is given to our Lord Jesus
          Christ of "the good Shepherd"! It not only describes the office he
          holds, but it sets forth the sympathy he feels, the aptness he shows,
          and the responsibility he bears to promote our well-being. What if the
          sheep be weak, yet is the shepherd strong to guard his flock from the
          prowling wolf or the roaring lion. If the sheep suffer privation
          because the soil is barren, yet is the shepherd able to lead them into
          pasturage suitable for them. If they be foolish, yet he goes before
          them, cheers them with his voice, and rules them with the rod of his
          command. There cannot be a flock without a shepherd; neither is there
          a shepherd truly without a flock. The two must go together. They are
          the fullness of each other. As the church is the fullness of him that
          filleth all in all, so we rejoice to remember that "of his fullness
          have all we received, and grace for grace." That I am like a sheep is
          a sorry reflection; but that I have a shepherd charms away the sorrow
          and creates a new joy. It even becomes a gladsome thing to be weak,
          that I may rely on his strength; to be full of wants, that I may draw
          from his fullness; to be shallow and often at my wit's end, that I may
          be always regulated by his wisdom. Even so doth my shame redound to
          his praise. Not to you, ye great and mighty, who lift your heads high,
          and claim for yourselves honor: not for you is peace, not to you is
          rest; but unto you, ye lowly ones, who delight in the valley of
          humiliation, and feel yourselves to be taken down in your own esteem
          -- to you it is that the Shepherd becomes dear; and to you will he
          give to lie down in green pastures beside the still waters.

          In a very simple way, we shall speak about the proprietor of the
          sheep. "My sheep," says Christ. Then, we shall have a little to say
          about the marks of the sheep. After that I propose to talk awhile
          about the privileges of the sheep. "I know my sheep:" they are
          privileged to be known of Christ. "My sheep hear my voice."
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Who is the proprietor of the sheep? They are all Christ's. "My
          sheep hear my voice." How came the saints to be Christ's?
        </p>
        <p>
          They are his, first of all, because he chose them. Ere the worlds were
          made, out of all the rest of mankind he selected them. He knew the
          race would fall, and become unworthy of the faculties with which he
          endowed them, and the inheritance he had assigned them. To him
          belonged the sovereign prerogative that he might have mercy on whom he
          would have mercy; and he, out of his own absolute will, and according
          to the counsel of his own good pleasure, made choice severally and
          individually of certain persons, and he said, "These are mine." Their
          names were written in his book: they became his portion and his
          heritage. Having chosen them of old so many ages ago, rest assured he
          will not lose them now. Men prize that which they have long had. If
          there is a thing that was mine but yesterday, and it is lost today, I
          might not fret about it; but if I have long possessed it, and called
          it my patrimony, I would not willingly part with it. Sheep of Christ,
          ye shall be his for ever, because ye have been his from ever. They are
          Christ's sheep, because his Father gave them to him. They were the
          gift of the Father to Christ. He often speaks of them in this way. "As
          many as thou hast given me:" "Thou hast given them me," saith he, over
          and over again. Of old, the Father gave his people to Christ.
          Separating them from among men, he presented them to him as a gift,
          committed them into his hand as a trust, and ordained them for him as
          the lot of his inheritance. Thus they become a token of the Father's
          love to his only begotten Son, a proof of the confidence he reposed in
          him, and a pledge of the honor that shall be done unto him. Now, I
          suppose we most of us know how to value a gift for the donor's sake.
          If presented to us by one whom we love, we set great store by it. If
          it has been designed to be a love-token, it awakens in our minds many
          sweet memories. Though the intrinsic worth may be of small account,
          the associations make it exceedingly precious. We might be content to
          lose something of far greater value in itself rather than that which
          is the gift of a friend, the offering of his love. I like the delicate
          sentiment of the poet, as it is expressed in that pretty verse --
        </p>
        <p>"I never cast a flower away,</p>
        <p>The gift of one who cared for me;</p>
        <p>A little flower -- a faded flower,</p>
        <p>But it was done reluctantly."</p>
        <p>
          Yet, oh, how weak the words of human passion! but, oh, how strong the
          expressions of divine ardor, when Jesus speaks to the Father of "the
          men whom thou gavest me out of the world"! "Thine they were," he says,
          "and thou gavest them me; and those that thou gavest me I have kept."
          Ye sheep of Christ, rest safely; let not your soul be disturbed with
          fear. The Father gave you to his Son, and he will not lightly lose
          what God himself has given him. The infernal lions shall not rend the
          meanest lamb that is a love-token from the Father to his best Beloved.
          While Christ stands defending his own, he will protect them from the
          lion and the bear, that would take the lambs of his flock; he will not
          suffer the least of them to perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My sheep," says Christ. They are his, furthermore, because, in
          addition to his choice and to the gift, he has bought them with a
          price. They had sold themselves for nought; but he has redeemed them,
          not with corruptible things as with silver and gold, but with his
          precious blood. A man always esteems that to be exceedingly valuable
          which he procured with risk -- with risk of life and limb. David felt
          he could not drink the water that the brave warriors who broke through
          the host of the Philistines brought to him from the well at Bethlehem,
          because it seemed to him as though it were the blood of the men that
          went in jeopardy of their lives; and he poured it out before the Lord.
          It was too precious a draught for him, when men's lives had been
          hazarded for it. But the good Shepherd not only hazarded his life, but
          even laid it down for his sheep. Jacob exceedingly valued one part of
          his possessions, and he gave it to Joseph: he gave him one portion
          above his brethren. Now, you may be sure he would give, Joseph that
          which he thought most precious. But why did he give him that
          particular portion? Because, he says, "I took it out of the hand of
          the Amorite with my sword and with my bow." Now, our blessed Shepherd
          esteems his sheep because they cost him his blood. They cost him his
          blood -- I may say, he took them out of the hand of the Amorite with
          his sword and with his bow in bloody conflict, where he was victor,
          but yet was slain. There is not one sheep of all his flock but what he
          can see the mark of his blood on him. In the face of every saint the
          Savior sees, as in a glass, the memorial of his bloody sweat in
          Gethsemane, and his agonies at Golgotha. "Ye are not your own, for ye
          are bought with a price." That stands as a call to duty, but it is at
          the same time a consolation, for if he has bought me, he will have me.
          Bought with such a price, he will not like to lose me, nor suffer any
          foe to take me out of his hand. Think not that Christ will suffer
          those to perish for whom he died. To me the very suggestion seems to
          draw near to the verge of blasphemy. If he has bought me with his
          blood, I cannot conceive he cares nothing for me, will take no further
          concern about me, or will suffer my soul to be cast into the pit. If
          he has suffered in my stead, where is justice gone that the substitute
          should bear my guilt, and I should bear it too? and where is mercy
          fled, that God should execute twice the punishment for one offense!
          Nay, beloved, those whom he hath bought with blood are his, and he
          will keep them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My sheep," says Christ. They are his, or in due time they shall
          become so, through his capturing them by sacred power. As well by
          power are we redeemed as by price, for the blood-bought sheep had gone
          astray even as others. "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have
          turned every one to his own way," but, my brethren, the good shepherd
          has brought many of us back with infinite condescension: with
          boundless mercy he followed us when we went astray. Oh, what blind
          slaves we were when we sported with death! We did not know then what
          his love had ordained for us: it never entered our poor, silly heads
          that there was a crown for us; we did not know that the Father's love
          had settled itself on us, or ever the day-star knew its place. We know
          it now, and it is he that has taught us; for he followed us over
          mountains of vanity, through bogs and miry places of foul
          transgression; tracked our devious footsteps on and on, through youth
          and menhood, till at last, with mighty grace, he grasped us in his
          arms and laid us on his shoulder, and is this day carrying us home to
          the great fold above, rejoicing as he bears all our weight and finds
          us in all we need. Oh, that blessed work of effectual grace! He has
          made us his own, he has defeated the enemy, the prey has been taken
          from the mighty, and the lawful captive has been delivered. "He hath
          broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron asunder," to set
          his people free. "O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness,
          and for his wonderful works to the children of men!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "My SHEEP," saith Christ, as he stands in the midst of his disciples.
          "My Shepherd," let us one and all reply. All the sheep of Christ who
          have been redeemed by his power, become his by their own willing and
          cheerful surrender of themselves to him. We would not belong to
          another if we might; nor would we wish to belong to ourselves if we
          could; nor, I trust, do we want any part of ourselves to be our own
          property. Judge ye whether this be true of you or not. In that day
          when I surrendered my soul to my Savior, I gave him my body, my soul,
          my spirit; I gave him all I had, and all I shall have for time and for
          eternity. I gave him all my talents, my powers, my faculties, my eyes,
          my ears, my limbs, my emotions, my judgment, my whole manhood, and all
          that could come of it, whatever fresh capacity or new capability I may
          be endowed with. Were I at this good hour to change the note of
          gladness for one of sadness, it should be to wail out my penitent
          confession of the times and circumstances in which I have failed to
          observe the strict and unwavering allegiance I owe to my Lord. So far
          from regretting, I would fain renew my vows and make them over again.
          In this I think every Christian would join.
        </p>
        <p>"Tis done!</p>
        <p>the great transaction's done:</p>
        <p>I am my Lord's, and he is mine:</p>
        <p>He drew me, and I follow'd on,</p>
        <p>Charm'd to confess the voice divine.</p>
        <p>Now rest, my long-divided heart;</p>
        <p>Fix'd on this blissful center, rest:</p>
        <p>With ashes who would grudge to part,</p>
        <p>When call'd on angels' bread to feast?</p>
        <p>High heaven, that heard the solemn vow,</p>
        <p>That vow renew'd shall daily hear:</p>
        <p>Till in life's latest hour I bow,</p>
        <p>And bless in death a bond so dear."</p>
        <p>
          And yet, brethren, though our hearts may now be all in a glow, lest
          they should presently grow cold, or the bleak atmosphere of this evil
          world should chill our devotion, let us never cease to think of the
          good Shepherd in that great, good act, which most of all showed his
          love when he laid down his life for the sheep. You have heard the
          story told by Francis de Sales. He saw a girl carrying a pail of water
          on her head, in the midst of which she had placed a piece of wood. On
          asking her why she did this, she told him it was to prevent the motion
          of the water, for fear it might be spilt. And so, said he, let us
          place the cross of Christ in the midst of our hearts to check the
          movement of our affections, that they may not be spilt in restless
          cares or grievous troubles.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My sheep," says Christ, and thus he describes his people. They are
          Christ's, his own, a peculiar property. May I hope that this truth
          will be henceforth treasured up in your soul! It is a common truth,
          certainly; but when it is laid home by the Holy Spirit it shines, it
          beams, not merely as a lamp in a dark chamber, but as the day-star
          rising in your hearts. Remember this is no more our shame that we are
          sheep, but it is our honor that we are Christ's sheep. To belong to a
          king carries some measure of distinction. We are the sheep of the
          imperial pastures. This is our safety: he will not suffer the enemy to
          destroy his sheep. This is our sanctity: we are separated, the sheep
          of the pasture of the Lord's Christ. This is sanctification in one
          aspect of it: for it is the making of us holy, by setting us apart to
          be the Lord's own portion for ever. And this is the key to our duty:
          we are his sheep: then let us live to him, and consecrate ourselves to
          him who loved us and gave himself for us. Christ is the proprietor of
          the sheep; and are the property of the good Shepherd.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, let us commune together awhile upon the marks of the sheep.
          When there are so many flocks of sheep, it is necessary to mark them.
          Our Savior marks us. It has been very properly observed, that there
          are two marks on Christ's sheep. One is on their ear, the other is on
          their foot. These are two marks of Christ's sheep not to be found on
          any other; but they are to be found on all his own -- the mark on the
          ear: "My sheep hear my voice." -- the mark on the foot: "I know them,
          and they follow me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of this mark on their ear. "My sheep hear my voice." They hear
          spiritually. A great many people in Christ's day heard his voice who
          did not hear it in the way and with the perception that is here
          intended. They would not hear; that is to say, they would not hearken
          or give heed, neither would they obey his call or come unto him that
          they might have life. These were not always the worst sort of people:
          there were some of the best that would not hear Christ, of whom he
          said, according to the original, as translated by some, "Ye search the
          Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are
          they which testify of me. And ye will not come to me, that ye might
          have life." They would get as far as curiosity or criticism might
          allure them; but they would not go any farther: they would not believe
          in Jesus. Now, the spiritual ear listens to God. The opening of it is
          the work of the Holy Spirit, and this is a mark of Christ's chosen
          blood-bought people, that they hear not only the hollow sound, but the
          hidden sense; not the bare letter, but the spiritual lesson; and that
          too not merely with the outward organ, but with the inward heart. The
          chief point is that they hear his voice. Oh, if all that heard my
          voice heard Christ's voice, how would I wander down every street in
          this city to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ; but, alas! the voice
          of the minister is utterly ineffectual to save a soul, unless the
          voice of Christ reach the conscience and rouse its dormant powers. "My
          sheep hear my voice;" the voice of Jesus, his counsel, his command,
          clothed with the authority of his own sacred sovereign utterance. When
          the gospel comes to you as Christ's gospel, with demonstration of the
          Spirit, the invitation is addressed to you by him. You can look upon
          it in no other light; so you must accept and receive it. When his
          princely power comes with it -- being mighty to save, he puts saving
          power into the word -- then you hear Christ's voice as a fiat that
          must be obeyed, as a summons that must be attended to, as a call to
          which there must be a quick response. O beloved, do not ever rest
          satisfied with hearing the voice of the preacher. We are only Christ's
          speaking-trumpets: there is nothing in us: it is only his speaking
          through us that can do any good. O children of God, some of you do not
          always listen to Christ's voice in the preaching. While we comment on
          the word, you make your comments on us. Our style, or our tone, or
          even our gesture, is enough to absorb -- I might rather say, to
          distract -- your thoughts. "Why look ye so earnestly on us?" I beseech
          you, give less heed to the livery of the servant, and give more care
          to the message of the Master. Listen warily, if you please; but judge
          wisely, if you can. See how much pure grain, and how much of Christ,
          there is in the sermon. Use your sieve; put away all the chaff; take
          only the good wheat; hear Christ's voice. Well were it if we could
          obscure ourselves that we might manifest him. I could wish so to
          preach that you could not see even my little finger; might I but so
          preach that you could get a full view of Jesus only. O that you could
          hear his voice drowning ours! This is the mark, the peculiar mark of
          those who are Christ's peculiar people: they hear his voice.
          Sometimes, truly it sounds in the ministry; sometimes it thrills forth
          from that book of books, which is often grossly neglected; sometimes
          it comes in the nightwatches. His voice may speak to us in the street.
          Silent as to vocal utterance, but like familiar tones that sometimes
          greet us in our dreams, the voice of Christ is distinctly audible to
          the soul. It will come to you in sweet or in bitter providences; yea,
          there is such a thing as hearing Christ's voice in the rustling of
          every leaf upon the tree, in the moaning of every wind, in the
          rippling of every wave. And there be those that have learned to lean
          on Christ's bosom, till they have looked for all the world as though
          they were a shell that lay in the ocean of Christ's love, listening
          for ever to the sonorous cadence of that deep, unfathomed,
          all-mysterious main. The billows of his love never cease to swell. The
          billowy anthem still peals on with solemn grandeur in the ear of the
          Christian. O may we hear Christ's voice each one of us for ourselves!
          I find that language fails me, and metaphors are weak to describe its
          potent spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          One point is worth noticing, however. I think our Lord meant here that
          his sheep, when they hear his voice, know it so well that they can
          tell it at once from the voice of strangers. The true child of God
          knows the gospel from the law. It is not by learning catechisms,
          reading theological books, or listening to endless controversies, that
          he finds this out. There is an instinct of his regenerate nature far
          more trustworthy than any lessons he has been taught. The voice of
          Jesus! Why there is no music like it. If you have once heard it, you
          cannot mistake it for another, or another for it. Some are babes in
          grace: others are of full age, and by reason of use, have their senses
          exercised; but one sense is quickly brought out -- the sense of
          hearing. It is so easy to tell the joy-bells of the gospel from the
          death-knell of the law; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth
          life. "Do, or die," says Moses. "Believe, and live," says Christ: you
          must know which is which. Yes; and I think they are equally shrewd and
          quick to discriminate between the flesh and the Spirit. Let some of
          the very feeblest of God's people sit down under a fluent ministry,
          with all the beauties of rhetoric, and let the minister preach up the
          dignity of human nature, and the sufficiency of man's reason to find
          out the way of righteousness, and you will hear them say: "It is very
          clever; but there is no food for me in it." Bring, however, the best
          and most instructed, and most learned Christian man, and set him down
          under a ministry that is very faulty as to the gift of utterance, and
          incorrect even in grammar; but if it is full of Jesus Christ, I know
          what he will say: "Ah! never mind the man, and never mind the platter
          on which he brought the meat; it was food to my soul that I fed upon
          with a hearty relish; it was marrow and fatness, for I could hear
          Christ's voice in it." I am not going to follow out these tests; but
          certain it is, that the sheep know Christ's voice, and can easily
          distinguish it. I saw hundreds of lambs the other day together, and
          there were also their mothers; and I am sure if I had had the task of
          allotting the proper lamb to each, or to any of them, it would have
          kept me till now to have done it. But somehow the lambs knew the
          mothers, and the mothers knew the lambs; and they were all happy
          enough in each other's company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every saint here, mixed up as he may be at times with parties and
          professors of all sorts, knows Christ, and Christ knows him, and he is
          therefore bound to his owner. That is the mark on the ear. You have
          seen sometimes in the country two flocks together on the road, and you
          say: "I wonder how the shepherds will manage to keep them distinct?
          They will get mixed up." They do not; they go this way and that way;
          and after a little commingling they separate, for they know their
          master's voice; "and a stranger will they not follow." You will go
          to-morrow, many of you, out into the world, some to the Exchange,
          others to the market, and others again into the factory: you are all
          mixed. Yes; but the seeming confusion of your company is temporary,
          not real and permanent. You will come right again, and you will go to
          your own home and your own fellowship. And at the last, when we shall
          have ended our pilgrimage, the one shall wend his way to the glory
          land, and the other to the abyss of woe. There will be no mistake. You
          will hear the Master's call, and obey. There is a mark on the ear
          which identifies every saint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ's sheep hear his voice obediently. This is an important proof
          of discipleship. Indeed, it may serve as a reproof to many. Oh, I
          would that you were more careful about this! "He that hath my
          commandments, and keepeth them," said Jesus, "he it is that loveth
          me." "He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings." How comes it to
          pass, then, that there are certain commands of Christ which some
          Christians will suffer to lie in abeyance? They will say, "The Lord
          commands this, but it is not essential." Oh, unloving spirit, that can
          think anything unessential that thy Bridegroom bids thee do! They that
          love, think little things of great moment, especially when they are
          looked upon as tokens of the strength or the tenderness of one's
          regard. It may not be essential, in order to prove the relation in
          which a wife stands to her husband, that she should study his tastes,
          consult his wishes, or attend to his comfort. But will she the less
          strive to please, because love, not fear, constrains her? I trow not.
          And can it be that any of you, my brethren, would harbour such a
          thought as your negligence implies? Do you really suppose that after
          the choice of Christ has been fixed on you, and the love of Christ has
          been plighted to you, you may now be as remiss or careless as you
          like? Nay, rather, might we not expect that a sacred passion, an
          ardent zeal, a touch of inspiration would stir you up, put you on the
          alert, make you wake at the faintest sound of his voice, or keep you
          listening to do his will? Be it ours, then, to act out with fidelity
          that verse we have often sung with enthusiasm: --
        </p>
        <p>"In all my Lord's appointed ways</p>
        <p>My journey I'll pursue."</p>
        <p>
          However little the precept may appear in the eyes of others; however
          insignificant as compared with our salvation, yet -- doth the Lord
          command it? -- then his sheep hear his voice, and they follow him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Christ has marked his sheep on their feet as well as their ears. They
          follow him: they are gently led, not harshly driven. They follow him
          as the Captain of their salvation; they trust in the power of his arm
          to clear the way for them. All their trust on him is stayed; all their
          hope on him they lean. They follow him as their teacher; they call no
          man "Rabbi" under heaven, but Christ alone. He is the infallible
          source of their creeds; neither will they allow their minds to be
          ruled by conclaves, councils, nor decrees. Hath a Christ said it? It
          is enough. If not, it is no more for me than the whistling of the
          wind. They follow a Christ as their teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the sheep of Christ follow him as their example; they desire to be
          in this world as he was. It is one of their marks, that to a greater
          or less degree they have a Christ-like spirit; and if they could they
          would be altogether like their Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          They follow him, too, as their Commander, and Lawgiver, and Prince.
          "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it," was his mother's wise speech;
          and it is the children's wise rule: "Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
          it." Oh, blessed shall they be above many of whom it shall be said,
          "These are they that have not defiled their garments." "These are they
          which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." Some of his followers
          are not very scrupulous. They love him. It is not for us to judge
          them. Rather we place ourselves among them and share in the censure.
          But happiest of all the happy are they who see the footprint -- the
          print of that foot that once was pierced with the nail -- and put
          their foot down where he placed it, and then again, in the selfsame
          mark, follow where he trod, till they climb at last to the throne.
          Keep close to Christ; take care of his little precepts unto the end.
          Remember, "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and
          shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
          heaven." Do not peril being least in the heavenly kingdom though it is
          better to be that than to be greatest in the kingdom of darkness. O
          seek to be very near him, to be a choice sheep in his chosen flock,
          and to have the mark distinctly upon your foot!
        </p>
        <p>
          I will not stay to apply these truths, but leave each one of you to
          make such self-searching enquiries as the text suggests. Have I the
          ear mark? Have I the foot mark? "My sheep hear my voice," "and they
          follow me." I hope that I am among the number.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. The last point, with which we now proceed to close, is -- THE
          PRIVILEGE OF CHRIST'S SHEEP. It does not look very large, but if we
          open it we shall see an amazing degree of blessedness in it. "I know
          them," "I know them." What does it mean?
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not time now to tell you all it means. "I know them." What is
          the reverse of this but one of the most dreadful things that is
          reserved for the day of judgment? There will be some who will say,
          "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast
          out devils?" And he shall say, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, I
          never knew you; depart from me, ye cursed." Now measure the height of
          that privilege by the depth of this misery. "I never knew you." What a
          volume of scorn it implies! What a stigma of infamy it conveys! Change
          the picture. The Redeemer says, "I know them," "I know them." How his
          eyes flash with kindness; how their cheeks burn with gratitude, as he
          says, "I know them "! Why, if a man had a friend and acquaintance that
          he used to know, and some years after he found him a disreputable,
          abandoned, wicked, guilty criminal, I feel pretty sure he would not
          say much about having known such a fellow, though he might be driven
          to confess that he had some years ago a passing acquaintance with him.
          But our Lord Jesus Christ, though he knows what poor, unworthy ones we
          are, yet when we shall be brought up before the Lord, before the great
          white throne, he will confess he knew us. He does know us, we are old
          acquaintances of his, and he has known us from before the foundation
          of the world, "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to
          be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn
          among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also
          called." There are riches of grace in this; but we will consider it in
          another way. Our Savior knows us, our Shepherd knows us. Beloved, he
          knows your person and all about you. You, with that sick body, that
          aching head, he knows you and he knows your son with all its
          sensitiveness; that timidity, that anxiety, that constitutional
          depression -- he knows it all. A physician may come to see you, and be
          unable to detect what the disease is that pains or prostrates you, but
          Christ knows you through and through; all the parts of your nature he
          understands. "I know them," saith he; he can therefore prescribe for
          you. He knows your sins. Do not let that dismay you, because he has
          blotted them all out; and he only knows them to forgive them, to cover
          them with his righteousness. He knows your corruptions; he will help
          you to overcome them; he will deal with you in providence and in
          grace, so that they shall be rooted up. He knows your temptations.
          Perhaps you are living away from your parents and Christian friends,
          and you have had an extraordinary temptation, and you wish you could
          go home and tell your mother. Oh, he knows it, he knows it; he can
          help you better than your mother can. You say: "I wish the minister
          knew the temptation I have passed through." Do not tell it; God knows
          it. As Daniel did not want Nebuchadnezzar to tell him the nature of
          his dream, but gave him the dream and the interpretation at the same
          time, so God can send you comfort. There will be a word as plainly
          suited to your case as though it were all printed and the preacher had
          known it all. It must be so. Depend upon it, the Lord know's your
          temptation, and watches your trial; or be it a sick child, or be it a
          bad matter of business that has lately occurred; or be it a slander
          that has wounded your heart, there is not a pang you feel but God as
          surely sees it as the weaver sees the shuttle which he throws with his
          own hand. He knows your trial, and he knows the meaning of your
          groans: he can read the secret desire of your heart, you need not
          write it nor speak it: he has understood it all. You were saying: "O
          that my child were converted! O that I grew in grace!" He knows it: he
          knows it every whit. There is not a word on your tongue, nor a wish in
          your heart, but he knoweth it altogether. O dear heart, he knows your
          sincerity! Perhaps you want to join the church, and your proposal has
          been declined, because you could not give satisfactory testimony. If
          you are sincere, he knows it; he knows, moreover, what your anxiety
          is. You cannot tell another what it is that is bitter to you -- the
          heart knoweth its own bitterness -- he knows it. As his secret is with
          you, so your secret is with him. He knows you: he knows what you have
          been trying to do. That secret gift -- that offering dropped so
          quietly where none could see it -- he knows it. And he knows that you
          love him. "Yes," you are saying in your soul, "if ever I loved thee,
          my Jesus, tis now." No, you cannot tell him, nor tell others; but he
          knows it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, now, in closing, let us say that in the text there is mutual
          knowledge. "I know them, but they also know me, because they hear my
          voice, and recognize it." Here is mutual confession. Christ speaks,
          else there would be no voice: they hear, else were the voice not
          useful. "I know them;" that is his thoughts go towards them. "They
          follow me;" that is, their thoughts go towards him. He leads the way,
          else they could not follow. They follow, however, whom he leads the
          way. Being the counterpart of each other, what the one does the other
          returns through grace; and what grace puts into the sheep the shepherd
          recognises, and makes a return to them. Christ and his church become
          an echo of each other: his the voice, theirs is but a faint echo of
          it; still it is a true echo, and you shall know who are Christ's by
          this. Do they echo what Christ saith? Oh, how I wish we were all
          sheep! How my soul longs that we may many of us who are not of his
          fold be brought in. The Lord bring you in, my dear hearers. The Lord
          give you his grace, and make you his own, comfort you, and make you to
          follow him. And if you are his, show it. These, dear brethren and
          sisters, here at this time, desire to confess Christ in your presence.
          If they are doing right, and you are not doing as they do, then you
          are doing wrong. If it is the duty of one, it is the duty of all; and
          if one Christian may neglect making a profession, all may do so, and
          then there will be no visible church whatever, and the visible
          ordinances must die out. If you know him, own him, for he hath said:
          "Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess
          also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me
          before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."
          God bless you, for Christ's sake. Amen.

          Letter from Mr. Spurgeon, read at the Tabernacle on Lord's-day, June
          18th: --
        </p>
        <p>MY BELOVED FRIENDS, --</p>
        <p>
          As soon as the church had resolved to meet for special prayer for me,
          I began rapidly to recover. It pleased God to turn the wind at the
          beginning of this week, and the change in the temperature has worked
          wonders. We may truthfully say of the Wednesday meeting for prayer,
          that the Lord fulfilled his word: "Before they call, I will answer;
          and while they are yet speaking, I will hear." For all this great
          goodness I pray you to unite with me in sincere and intense gratitude
          to the Lord our God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel bound publicly to express my happiness of heart. This week has
          furnished me with the liveliest proofs of your true love. I have been
          deeply touched with the various ways in which the affection of so many
          of you has sought to find expression. I value this not only for my own
          sake, though it is very sweet to be the object of such hearty love,
          but because I see in it the evidence that our union has been cemented
          by years, and the earnest of future years of united effort, if God
          spares us. The absence of unity is weakness: its indisputable presence
          is strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the closing day of my thirty-seventh year, I find myself the pastor
          of a beloved flock, who have borne the test of twelve Sabbaths of
          their minister's absence, and the severer test of more than seventeen
          years of the same ministry, and are now exhibiting more love to him
          than ever. I bless God, but I also thank you, and assure you that I
          never felt happier in the midst of my people than I do now in the
          prospect of returning to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am still weak, but the improvement in strength has been this week
          very surprising. I hardly dare speak of the future; but I earnestly
          hope we shall look each other in the face on the first Sabbath of
          July.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collection to-day is to enable the London Baptist Association to
          build a new chapel in the Wandsworth Road. We are to carry out the
          project, so that it will not become us to be slack in our collection.
          London grows so rapidly, that much must be done to keep pace with its
          spiritual needs. Our Association does something, but ten times more
          would be little enough. You will I am sure give as God has prospered
          you. The College, of course, will be less helped; but I must beg to
          thank you for the continued series of noble contributions which have
          made each week remarkable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peace be with you and the Lord's own anointing. May those who speak to
          you to-day be filled with the Spirit. May the soft south wind of the
          Spirit's love be among you, and may you pour forth praise as flowers
          breathe perfume.
        </p>
        <p>Yours very truly,</p>
        <p>C.H. Spurgeon<br /></p>
