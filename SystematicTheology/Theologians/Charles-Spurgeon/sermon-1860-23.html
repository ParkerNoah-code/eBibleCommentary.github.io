          |For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might
          be made the righteousness of God in him.| -- 2 Corinthians 5:21.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOMETIME AGO an excellent lady sought an interview with me, with the
          object as she said, of enlisting my sympathy upon the question of
          |Anti-Capital Punishment.| I heard the excellent reasons she urged
          against hanging men who had committed murder, and though they did not
          convince me, I did not seek to answer hem. She proposed that when a
          man committed murder, he should be confined for life. My remark was,
          that a great many men who had been confined half their lives were not
          a bit the better for it, and as for her belief that they would
          necessarily be brought to repentance, I was afraid it was but a dream.
          |Ah,| she said, good soul as she was, |that is because we have been
          all wrong about punishments. We punish people because we think they
          deserve to be punished. Now, we ought to show them,| said she, |that
          we love them; that we only punish them to make them better.| |Indeed,
          madam,| I said, |I have heard that theory a great many times, and I
          have seen much fine writing upon the matter, but I am no believer in
          it. The design of punishment should be amendment, but the ground of
          punishment lies in the positive guilt of the offender. I believe that
          when a man does wrong, he ought to be punished for it, and that there
          is a guilt in sin which justly merits punishment.| |Oh no; she could
          not see that. Sin was a very wrong thing, but punishment was not a
          proper idea. She thought that people were treated too cruelly in
          prison, and that they ought to be taught that we love them. If they
          were treated kindly in prison, and tenderly dealt with, they would
          grow so much better, she was sure.| With a view of interpreting her
          own theory, I said, |I suppose, then, you would give criminals all
          sorts of indulgences in prison. Some great vagabond who has committed
          burglary dozens of times -- I suppose you would let him sit in an easy
          chair in the evening before a nice fire, and mix him a glass of
          spirits and water, and give him his pope, and make him happy, to show
          him how much we love him.| |Well, no, she would not give him the
          spirits, but, still, all the rest would do him good.| I thought that
          was a delightful picture certainly. It seemed to me to be the most
          prolific method of cultivating rogues which ingenuity could invent. I
          imagine that you could row any number of thieves in that way; for it
          would be a special means of propagating all manner of roguery and
          wickedness. These very delightful theories to such a simple mind as
          mine, were the source of much amusement, the idea of fondling
          villains, and treating heir crimes as if they were the tumbles and
          falls of children, made me laugh heartily. I fancied I saw the
          government resigning its functions to these excellent persons, and the
          grand results of their marvellously kind experiments. The sword of the
          magistrate transformed into a gruel-spoon, and the jail become a sweet
          retreat for injured reputations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Little however, did I think I should live to see this kind of stuff
          taught in pulpits; I had no idea that there would come out a divinity,
          which would bring down God's moral government from he solemn aspect in
          which Scripture reveals it, to a namby-pamby sentimentalism, which
          adores a Deity destitute of every masculline virtue. But we never know
          to-day what may occur to-morrow. We have lived to see a certain sort
          of men -- thank God they are not Baptists -- though I am sorry to say
          there are a great many Baptists who are beginning to follow in their
          trail -- who seek to teach now-a-days, that God is a universal Father,
          and that our ideas of his dealing with the impenitent as a Judge, and
          not as a Father, are remnants of antiquated error. Sin, according to
          these men, is a disorder rather than an offence, an error rather than
          a crime. Love is the only attribute they can discern, and the
          full-orbed Deity they have not known. Some of these men push their way
          very far into the bogs and mire of falsehood, until they inform us
          that eternal punishment is ridiculed as a dream. In fact, books now
          appear, which teach us that there is no such thing as the Vicarious
          Sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ. They use the word Atonement it is
          true, but in regard to its meaning, they have removed the ancient
          landmark. They acknowledge that the Father has shown his great love to
          poor sinful man by sending his Son, but not that God was inflexibly
          just in the exhibition of his mercy, not that he punished Christ on
          the behalf of his people, nor that indeed God ever will punish anybody
          I his wrath, or that there is such a thing as justice apart from
          discipline. Even sin and hell are but old words employed henceforth in
          a new and altered sense. Those are old-fashioned notions, and we poor
          souls who go on talking about election and imputed righteousness, are
          behind our time. Ay, and the gentlemen who bring out books on this
          subject, applaud Mr. Maurice, and Professor Scott, and the like, but
          are too cowardly to follow them, and boldly propound these sentiments.
          These are the new men whom God has sent down from heaven, to tell us
          that the apostle Paul was all wrong, that our faith is vain, that we
          have been quite mistaken, that there was no need for propitiating
          blood to wash away our sins; that the fact was, our sins needed
          discipline, but penal vengeance and righteous wrath are quite out of
          the question. When I thus speak, I am free to confess that such ideas
          are not boldly taught by a certain individual whose volume excites
          these remarks, but as he puffs the books of gross perverters of the
          truth, I am compelled to believe that he endorses such theology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, brethren, I am happy to say that sort of stuff has not gained
          entrance into this pulpit. I dare say the worms will eat the wood
          before there will be anything of that sort sounded in his place; and
          may these bones be picked by vultures, and this flesh be rent in
          sunder by lions, and may every nerve in this body suffer pangs and
          tortures, ere these lips shall give utterance to any such doctrines or
          sentiments. We are content to remain among the vulgar souls who
          believe the old doctrines of grace. We are wolling still to be behind
          in the great march of intellect, and stand by that unmoving cross,
          which, like the pole star, never advances, because it never stirs, but
          always abides in its place, the guide of the soul to heaven, the one
          foundation other than which no man can lay, and without building upon
          which, no man shall ever see the face of God and live.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus much have I said upon a matter which just now is exciting
          controversy. It has been my high privilege to be associated with six
          of our ablest brethren in the ministry, in a letter of protest against
          the countenance which a certain newspaper seemed willing to lend to
          this modern heresy. We trust it may be the means, in the hands of God,
          of helping to check that downward march -- that wandering from truth
          which seems by some singular infatuation, to have unsettled the minds
          of some brethren in our denomination. Now I come to address you upon
          the opic which is most continually assailed by those who preach
          another gospel |which is not another -- but there be some that trouble
          you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ,| namely, the doctrine of
          the substitution of Christ on our behalf, his actual atonement for our
          sins, and our positive and actual justification through his sufferings
          and righteousness. It seems to me that until language can mean the
          very reverse of what it says, until by some strange logic, God's Word
          can be contradicted and can be made to belief itself, the doctrine of
          substitution can never be rooted out of the words which I have
          selected for my text |He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
          sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.|
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then, the sinlessness of the substitute; secondly, the reality
          of the imputation of sin to him; and thirdly, the glorious reality of
          the imputation of righteousness to us.
        </p>
        <p>I. First, THE SINLESSNESS OF THE SUBSTITUTE.</p>
        <p>
          The doctrine of Holy Scripture is this, that inasmuch as man could not
          keep God's law, having fallen in Adam, Christ came and fulfilled the
          law on the behalf of his people; and that inasmuch as man had already
          broken the divine law and incurred the penalty of the wrath of God,
          Christ came and suffered in the room, place, and stead of his elect
          ones, that so by his enduring the full vials of wrath, they might be
          emptied out and not a drop might ever fall upon the heads of his
          blood-bought people. Now, you will readily perceive that if one is to
          be a substitute for another before God, either to work out a
          righteousness or to suffer a penalty, that substitute must himself be
          free from sin. If he hath sin of his own, all that he can suffer will
          but be the due reward of his own iniquity. If he hath himself
          transgressed, he cannot suffer for another, because all his sufferings
          are already due on his own personal account. On the other and, it is
          quite clear that none but a perfect man could ever work out a spotless
          righteousness for us, and keep the law in our stead, for if he hath
          dishonoured the commandment in his thought, there must be a
          corresponding flaw in his service. If the warp and woof be speckled,
          how shall he bring forth the robe of milk-white purity, and wrap it
          about our loins? He must be a spotless one who shall become the
          representative of his people, either to give them a passive or active
          righteousness, either to offer a satisfaction as the penalty of their
          sins, or a righteousness as the fulfilment of God's demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is satisfactory for us to know, and to believe beyond a doubt, that
          our Lord Jesus was without sin. Of course, in his divine nature he
          could not know iniquity; and as for his human nature, it never knew
          the original taint of depravity. He was of the seed of the woman, but
          not of the tainted and infected see of Adam. Overshadowed as was the
          virgin by the Holy Ghost, no corruption entered into his nativity.
          That holy thing which was born of her was neither conceived in sin nor
          shapen in iniquity. He was brought into this world immaculate. He was
          immaculately conceived and immaculately born. In him that natural
          black blood which we have inherited from Adam never dwelt. His heart
          was upright within him; his soul was without any bias to evil; his
          imagination had never been darkened. He had no infatuated mind. There
          was no tendency whatever in him that to do that which was good, holy,
          and honourable. And as he did not share in the original depravity, so
          he did not share in the imputed sin of Adam which we have inherited --
          not, I mean, in himself personally, though he took the consequences of
          that, as he stood as our representative. The sin of Adam had never
          passed over the head of the second Adam. All that were in the loins of
          Adam sinned in him when he touched the fruit; but Jesus was not in the
          loins of Adam. Though he might be conceived of as being in the womb of
          the woman -- |a new thing which the Lord created in the earth,| -- he
          lay not in Adam when he sinned, and consequently no guilt from Adam,
          either of depravity of nature, or of distance from God, ever fell upon
          Jesus as the result of anything that Adam did. I mean upon Jesus as
          considered in himself though he certainly took the sin of Adam as he
          was the representative of his people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, as in his nature he was free from the corruption and
          condemnation of the sin of Adam, so also in his life, no sin ever
          corrupted his way. His eye never flashed with unhallowed anger; his
          lip never uttered a treacherous or deceitful word; his heat never
          harboured an evil imagination. Never did he wander after lust; no
          covetousness ever so much as glanced into his soul. He was |holy,
          harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.| From the beginning of his
          life to the end, you cannot put your finger even upon a mistake, much
          less upon a wilful error. So perfect was he, that no virtue seems to
          preponderate, or by an opposing quality give a bias to the scale of
          absolute rectitude. John is distinguished for his love, Peter for his
          courage; but Jesus Christ is distinguished for neither one above the
          another, because he possesses all in such sublime unison, such
          heavenly harmony, that no one virtue stands out above the rest. He is
          meek, but he is courageous. He is loving, but he is decided; he is
          bold as a lion, yet he is quiet and peaceful as a lamb. He was like
          that fine flour which was offered before God in the burnt offering; a
          flour without grit, so smooth, that when you rubbed it, it was soft
          and pure, no particles could be discerned: so was his character fully
          ground, fully compounded. There was not one feature in his moral
          countenance which had undue preponderance above the other; but he was
          replete in everything that was virtuous and good. Tempted he was, it
          is true, but sinned he never. The whirlwind came from he wilderness,
          and smote upon the four corners of that house, but it fell not, for it
          was founded upon a rock. The rains descended, heaven afflicted him;
          the winds blew, the mysterious agency of hell assailed him; the floods
          came, all earth was in arms against him, but yet he stood firm in the
          midst of all. Never once did he even seem to bend before the tempest;
          but buffetting the fury of the blast, bearing all the temptations that
          could ever happen to man, which summed themselves up and consummated
          their fury on him, he stood to the end, without a single flaw in his
          life, or a stain upon his spotless robe. Let us rejoice, then, in
          this, my beloved brothers and sisters, that we have such a substitute
          -- one who is fit and proper to stand in our place, and to suffer in
          our stead, seeing he has no need to offer a sacrifice for himself; no
          need to cry for himself, |Father, I have sinned;| no need to bend the
          knee of the penitent and confess his own iniquities, for he is without
          spot or blemish, the perfect lamb of God's passover.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have you carefully notice the particular expression of the
          text, for it struck me as being very beautiful and significant, --
          |who knew no sin.| It does not merely say did none, but knew none. Sin
          was no acquaintance of his; he was acquainted with grief, but no
          acquaintance of sin. He had to walk in the midst of its most
          frequented haunts, but did not know it; not that he was ignorant of
          its nature, or did not know its penalty, but he did not know it; he
          was a stranger to it, he never gave it the wink or nod of familiar
          recognition. Of course he knew what sin was, for he was ver God, but
          with the sin he had no communion, no fellowship, no brotherhood. He
          was a perfect stranger in the presence of sin; he was a foreigner; he
          was not an inhabitant of that land where sin is acknowledge. He passed
          through the wilderness of suffering, but into the wilderness of sin he
          could never go. |He knew no sin;| mark that expression and treasure it
          up, and when you are thinking of your substitute, and see him hang
          bleeding upon the cross, think that you see written in those lines of
          blood written along his blessed body, |He knew no sin.| Mingled with
          the redness of his blood -- that Rose of Sharon; behold the purity of
          his nature, the Lily of the Valley -- |He knew no sin.|
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Let us pass on to notice the second and most important point; THE
          ACTUAL SUBSTITUTION OF CHRIST, AND THE REAL IMPUTATION OF SIN TO HIM.
          |He made him to be sin for us.|
        </p>
        <p>
          Here be careful to observe who transferred the sin. God the Father
          laid on Jesus the iniquities of us all. Man could not make Christ sin.
          Man could not transfer his guilt to another. It is not for us to say
          whether Christ could or could not have made himself sin for us; that
          certain it is, he did not take this priesthood upon himself, but he
          was called of God, as was Aaron. The Redeemer's vicarious position is
          warranted, nay ordained by divine authority. |He hath made him to be
          sin for us.| I must now beg you to notice how very explicit the term
          is. Some of our expositors will have it that the word here used must
          mean |sin-offering.| |He made him to be a sin-offering for us.| I
          thought it well to look to my Greek Testament to see whether it could
          be so. Of course we all know that the word here translated |sin,| is
          very often translated |sin-offering,| but it is always useful, when
          you have a disputed passage, to look it through, and see whether in
          this case the word would bear such a meaning. These commentators say
          it means a sin-offering, -- well, I will read it: |He hath made him to
          be a sin-offering for us who knew no sin-offering.| Does not that
          strike you as being ridiculous? But they are precisely the same words;
          and if it be fair to translate it |sin-offering| in one place, it
          must, in all reason, be fair to translate it so in the other. The fact
          it, while in some passages it may be rendered |sin-offering,| in this
          passage it cannot be so, because it would be to run counter to all
          honesty to translate the same word in the same sentence two different
          ways. No; we must take hem as they stand. |He hath made him to be sin
          for us,| not merely an offering, but sin for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          My predecessor, Dr. Gill, edited the works of Tobias Crisp, but Tobias
          Crisp went further than Dr. Gill or any of us can approve; for in one
          place Crisp calls Christ a sinner, though he does not mean that he
          ever sinned himself. He actually calls Christ a transgressor, and
          justifies himself by that passage, |He was numbered with the
          transgressors.| Martin Luther is reputed to have broadly said that,
          although Jesus Christ was sinless, yet he was the greatest sinner that
          ever lived, because all the sins of his people lay upon him. Now, such
          expressions I think to be unguarded, if not profane. Certainly
          Christian men should take care that they use not language which, by
          the ignorant and uninstructed, may be translated to mean what they
          never intended to teach. The fact is, brethren, that in no sense
          whatever -- take that as I say it -- in no sense whatever can Jesus
          Christ ever be conceived of as having been guilty. He knew no sin.|
          Not only was he not guilty of any sin which he committed himself, but
          he was not guilty of our sins. No guilt can possibly attach to a man
          who has not been guilty. He must have had complicity in the deed
          itself, or else no guilt can possibly be laid on him. Jesus Christ
          stands in the midst of all the divine thunders, and suffers all the
          punishment, but not a drop of sin ever stained him. In no sense is he
          ever a guilty man, but always is he an accepted and a holy one. What,
          then, is the meaning of that very forcible expression f my text? We
          must interpret Scriptural modes of expression by the verbage of the
          speakers. We know that our Master once said himself, |This cup is the
          new covenant in my blood;| he did not mean that the cup was the
          covenant. He said, |Take, eat, this is my body| -- no one of us
          conceives that the bread is the literal flesh and blood of Christ. We
          take that bread as if it were the body, and it actually represents it.
          Now, we are to read a passage like this, according to the analogy of
          faith. Jesus Christ was made by his Father sin for us, that is, he was
          treated as if he had himself been sin. He was not sin; he was not
          sinful; he was not guilty; but, he was treated by his Father, as if he
          had not only been sinful, but as if he had been sin itself. That is a
          strong expression used here. Not only hath he made him to be the
          substitute for sin, but to be sin. God looked on Christ as if Christ
          had been sin; not as if he had taken up the sins of his people, or as
          if they were laid on him, though that were true, but as if he himself
          had positively been that noxious -- that God-hating -- that
          soul-damning thing, called sin. When the Judge of all the earth said,
          |Where is Sin?| Christ presented himself. He stood before his Father
          as if he had been the accumulation of all human guilt; as if he
          himself were that thing which God cannot endure, but which he must
          drive from his presence for ever. And now see how this making of Jesus
          to be sin was enacted to the fullest extent. The righteous Lord looked
          on Christ as being sin, and therefore Christ must be taken without the
          camp. Sin cannot be borne in God's Zion, cannot be allowed to dwell in
          God's Jerusalem; it must be taken without the camp, it is a leprous
          thing, put it away. Cast out from fellowship, from love, from pity,
          sin must ever be. Take him away, take him away, ye crowd! Hurry him
          through the streets and bear him to Calvary. Take him without the camp
          -- as was the beast which was offered for sin without the camp, so
          must Christ be, who was made sin for us. And now, God looks on him as
          being sin, and sin must bear punishment. Christ is punished. The most
          fearful of deaths is exacted at his hand, and God has no pity for him.
          How should he have pity on sin? God hates it. No tongue can tell, no
          soul can divine the terrible hatred of God to that which is evil, and
          he treats Christ as if he were sin. He prays, but heaven shuts out his
          prayer; he cries for water, but heaven and earth refuse to wet his
          lips except with vinegar. He turns his eye to heaven, he sees nothing
          there. How should he? God cannot look on sin, and sin can have no
          claim on God: |My God, my God,| he cries, |why hast thou forsaken me?|
          O solemn necessity, how could God do anything with sin but forsake it?
          How could iniquity have fellowship with God? Shall divine smiles rest
          on sin? Nay, nay, it must not be. Therefore is it that he who is made
          sin must bemoan desertion and terror. God cannot touch him, cannot
          dwell with him, cannot come near him. He is abhorred, cast away; it
          hath pleased the Father to bruise him; he hath put him to grief. At
          last he dies. God will not keep him in life -- how should he? Is it
          not the meetest thing in the world that sin should be buried? |Bury it
          out of my sight, hide this corruption,| and lo! Jesus, as if he were
          sin, is put away out of the sight of God and man as a thing obnoxious.
          I do not know whether I have clearly uttered what I want to state, but
          what a rim picture that is, to conceive of sin gathered up into one
          mass -- murder, lust and rapine, and adultery, and all manner of
          crime, all piled together in one hideous heap. We ourselves, brethren,
          impure though we be, could not bear this; how much less should God
          with his pure and holy eyes bear with that mass of sin, and yet there
          it is, and God looked upon Christ as if he were that mass of sin. He
          was not sin, but he looked upon him as made sin for us. He stands in
          our place, assumes our guilt, takes on him our iniquity, and God
          treats him as if he had been sin. Now, my dear brothers and sisters,
          let us just lift up our hearts with gratitude for a few moments. Here
          we are to-night; we know that we are guilty, but our sins have all
          been punished years ago. Before my soul believed in Christ, the
          punishment of my sin had all been endured. We are not to think that
          Christ's blood derives its efficacy from our faith. Fact precedes
          faith. Christ hath redeemed us; faith discovers his; but it was a fact
          of that finished sacrifice. Though still defiled by sin, yet who can
          lay anything to he charge of the man whose guilt is gone, lifted
          bodily from off him, and put upon Christ? How can any punishment fall
          on that man who ceases to possess sins, because his sin has eighteen
          hundred years ago been cast upon Christ, and Christ has suffered in
          his place and stead? Oh, glorious triumph of faith to be able to say,
          whenever I feel the guilt of sin, whenever conscience pricks me, |Yes,
          it is true, but my Lord is answerable for it all, for he has taken it
          all upon himself, and suffered in my room, and place, and stead.| How
          precious when I see my debts, to be able to say, |Yes, but the blood
          of Christ, God's dear Son, hath cleansed me from all sin!| How
          precious, not only to see my sin dying when I believe, but to know
          that it was dead, it was gone, it ceased to e, eighteen hundred years
          ago. All the sins that you and I have ever committed, or ever shall
          commit, if we be heirs of mercy, and children of God, are all dead
          things.
        </p>
        <p>|Our Jesus nailed them to his cross,</p>
        <p>And sung the triumph when he rose.|</p>
        <p>
          These cannot rise in judgment to condemn us; they have all been slain,
          shrouded, buried; they are removed from us as far as the east is from
          the west, because |He hath made him to be sinf or us who knew no sin.|
        </p>
        <p>
          III. You see then the reality of the imputation of sin to Christ from
          the amazing doctrine that Christ is made sin for us. But now notice
          the concluding thought, upon which I must dwell a moment, but it must
          be ver briefly, for two reasons, my time has gone, and my strength has
          gone too. |THAT WE MIGHT BE MADE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IN HIM.|
          Now, here I beg you to notice, that it does not simply say that we
          might be made righteous, but |that we might be made the righteousness
          of God in him;| as if righteousness, that lovely, glorious,
          God-honouring, God-delighting thing -- as if we were actually made
          that. God looks on his people as being abstract righteousness, not nly
          righteous, but righteousness. To be righteous, is as if a man should
          have a box covered with gold, the box would then be golden; but to be
          righteousness is to have a box of solid gold. To be a righteous man is
          to have righteousness cast over me; but to be made righteousness, that
          is to be made solid essential righteousness in the sight of God. Well
          now, this is a glorious fact and a most wonderful privilege, that we
          poor sinners are made |the righteousness of God in him.| God sees no
          sin in any one of his people, no iniquity in Jacob, when he looks upon
          them in Christ. In themselves he sees nothing but filth and
          abomination, in Christ nothing but purity and righteousness. Is it
          not, and must it not ever be to the Christian, one of his most
          delightful privileges to know that altogether apart from anything that
          we have ever done, or can do, God looks upon his people as being
          righteous, nay, as being righteousness, and that despite all of the
          sins they have ever committed, they are accepted in him as if they had
          been Christ, while Christ was punished for hem as if he had been sin.
          Why, when I stand in my own place, I am lost and ruined; my place is
          the place where Judas stood, the place where the devil lies in
          everlasting shame. But when I stand in Christ's place -- and I fail to
          stand where faith has put me till I stand there -- when I stand in
          Christ's place, the Father's everlastingly beloved one, the Father's
          accepted one, him whom the Father delighteth to honour -- when I stand
          there, I stand where faith hath a right to put me, and I am in the
          most joyous spot that a creature of God can occupy. Oh, Christian, get
          thee up, get thee up into the high mountain, and stand where thy
          Saviour stands, for that is thy place. Lie not there on the dunghill
          of fallen humanity, that is not thy place now; Christ has once taken
          it on thy behoof. |He made him to be sin for us.| Thy place is yonder
          there, above the starry hosts, where he hath raised us up together,
          and made us sit together in heavenly places in him. Not there, at the
          day of judgment, where the wicked shriek for shelter, and beg for the
          hills to cover hem, but there, where Jesus sits upon his throne --
          there is thy place, my soul. He will make thee to sit upon his throne,
          even as he has overcome, and has sat down with his Father upon his
          throne. Oh! That I could mount to the heights of this argument
          to-night; it needs a seraphic preacher to picture the saint in Christ,
          robed in Christ's righteousness, wearing Christ's nature, bearing
          Christ's palm of victory, sitting on Christ's throne, wearing Christ's
          crown. And yet this is our privilege! He wore my crown, the crown of
          thorns; I wear his crown, the crown of glory. He wore my dress, nay,
          rather, he wore my nakedness when he died upon the cross; I wear his
          robes, the royal robes of the King of kings. He bore my shame; I bear
          his honour. He endured my sufferings to this end that my joy may be
          full, and that his joy may be fulfilled in me. He laid in the grave
          that I might rise from the dead and that I may dwell in him, and all
          this he comes again to give me, to make it sure to me and to all hat
          love his appearing, to show that all his people shall enter into their
          inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my brothers and sisters, Mr. Maurice, McLeod, Campbell, and their
          great admirer, Mr. Brown, may go on with their preaching as long as
          they like, but they will never make a convert of a man who knows what
          the vitality of religion is; for he who knows what substitution means,
          he who knows what it is to stand where Christ stands, will never care
          to occupy the ground on which Mr. Maurice stands. He who has ever been
          made to sit together with Christ, and once to enjoy the real
          preciousness of a transfer of Christ's righteousness to him and his
          sin to Christ, that man has eaten the bread of heaven, and will never
          renounce it for husks. No, my brethren, we could lay down our lives
          for this truth rather than give it up. No, we cannot by any means turn
          aside from this glorious stability of faith, and for this good reason,
          that there is nothing for us in the doctrine which these men teach. It
          may suit intellectual gentlefolk, I dare say it does; but it will not
          suit us. We are poor sinners and nothing at all, and if Christ is not
          our all in all, there is nothing for us. I have often thought the best
          answer for all these new ideas is, that the true gospel was always
          preached to the poor; -- |The poor have the gospel preached to hem.|
          -- I am sure that the poor will never learn the gospel of these new
          divines, for they cannot make head or tail of it, nor the rich either;
          for after you have read through one of their volumes, you have not the
          least idea of what the book is about, until you have read it through
          eight or nine times, and then you begin to think you are a very stupid
          being for ever having read such inflated heresy, for it sours your
          temper and makes you feel angry, to see the precious truths of God
          trodden under foot. Some of us must stand out against these attacks on
          truth, although we love not controversy. We rejoice in the liberty of
          our fellow-men, and would have them proclaim their convictions; but if
          they touch these precious things, they touch the apple of our eye. We
          can allow a thousand opinions in the world, but that which infringes
          upon the precious doctrine of a covenant salvation, through the
          imputed righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ, -- against that we
          must, and will, enter our hearty and solemn protest, as long as God
          spares us. Take away once from us those glorious doctrines, and where
          are we brethren? We may lay us down and die, for nothing remains that
          is worth living for. We have come to the valley of the shadow of
          death, when we find these doctrines to e untrue. If these things which
          I speak to you to-night be not the verities of Christ; if they be not
          true, there is no comfort left for any poor man under God's sky, and
          it were better for us never to have been born. I may say what Jonathan
          Edwards says at the end of his book, |If any man could disprove the
          doctrines of the gospel, he should then sit down and weep to think
          they were not true, for,| says he, |it would be the most dreadful
          calamity that could happen to the world, to have a glimpse of such
          truths, and then for them to melt away in the thin air of fiction, as
          having no substantiality in them.| Stand up for the truth of Christ; I
          would not have you be bigotted, but I would have you be decided. Do
          not give countenance to any of this trash and error, which is going
          abroad, but stand firm. Be not turned away from your stedfastness by
          any pretence of intellectuality and high philosophy, but earnestly
          contend for the faith once delivered to he saints, and hold fast the
          form of sound words which you have heard of us, and have been taught,
          even as ye have read in this sacred Book, which is the way of
          everlasting life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus then, beloved, without gathering up my strength for the fray, or
          attempting to analyse the subtleties of those who would pervert the
          simple gospel, I speak out my mind and utter the kindlings of my heart
          among you. Little enough will ye reck, over whom the Holy Ghost hath
          given me the oversight, what the grievous wolves may design, if ye
          keep within the fold. Break not the sacred bounds wherein God hath
          enclosed his Church. He hath encircled us in the arms of covenant
          love. He hath united us in indissoluble bonds to the Lord Jesus. He
          hath fortified us with the assurance that the Holy Spirit shall guide
          us into all truth. God grant that those beyond the pale of visible
          fellowship with us in this eternal gospel may see their danger and
          escape from he fowler's snare!<br />
