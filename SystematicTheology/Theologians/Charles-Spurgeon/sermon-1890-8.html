          Fasting, which ye have learned to hold three times in the year among
          us, we decree now to take place, as more suitable, in four seasons; so
          that even as the year revolves through four seasons, we too may keep a
          solemn fast quarterly in the four seasons of the year. And as we are
          replenished with corn, and wine, and oil for the nourishment of our
          bodies, so let us be replenished with fasting for the nourishment of
          our souls, in accordance with the word of the prophet Zechariah, who
          says, "The word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord of
          hosts, As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to
          wrath, and I repented not; so again have I thought in these days to do
          well unto Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. These are
          the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth to his
          neighbour; judge the truth and the judgment of peace in your gates;
          and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour,
          and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith
          the Lord of hosts. And the word of the Lord of hosts came unto me,
          saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The fast of the fourth month,
          and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast
          of the tenth, shall be to the house of the Lord joy and gladness, and
          cheerful feasts; only love the truth and peace, saith the Lord of
          hosts." In this, then, we ought to be all of one mind, so that,
          according to apostolic teaching, we may all say the same thing, and
          that there be no divisions among us. Let us then be perfect in the
          same mind, and in the same judgment; in ready zeal for which work we
          congratulate ourselves on having your affection as our partner. For it
          is not meet for the members to be at variance with the head; but,
          according to the testimony of sacred Scripture, all the members should
          follow the head. It is matter of doubt, moreover, to no one, that the
          church of the apostles is the mother of all the churches, from whose
          ordinances it is not right that you should deviate to any extent. And
          as the Son of God came to do the Father's will, so shall ye fulfil the
          will of your mother, which is the Church, the head of which, as has
          been stated already, is the church of Rome. Wherefore, whatsoever may
          be done against the discipline of this church, without the decision of
          justice, cannot on any account be permitted to be held valid.
