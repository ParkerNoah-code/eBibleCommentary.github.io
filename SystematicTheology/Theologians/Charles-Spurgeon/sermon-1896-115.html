          1. Not unto us, O Jehovah! not unto us, but unto thy name give the
          glory, on account of thy mercy, on account of thy truth.2. Why should
          the heathen say, Where is now their God? 3. Surely our God is in
          heaven: he hath done whatsoever pleased him.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          1 Not unto us, O Jehovah! It is not certain by whom, or at what time,
          this psalm was composed. We learn from the first part of it, that the
          faithful betake themselves to God, in circumstances of extreme
          distress. They do not make known their desires in plain words, but
          indirectly hint at the nature of their request. They openly disclaim
          all merit, and all hope of obtaining deliverance otherwise than God's
          doing it from a sole regard to his own glory, for these things are
          inseparably connected. Deserving, therefore, to meet with a repulse,
          they yet beseech God not to expose his name to the derision of the
          heathen. In their distress they desire to obtain consolation and
          support; but, finding nothing in themselves meritorious of God's
          favor, they call upon him to grant their requests, that his glory may
          be maintained. This is a point to which we ought carefully to attend,
          that, altogether unworthy as we are of God's regard, we may cherish
          the hope of being saved by him, from the respect that he has for the
          glory of his name, and from his having adopted us on condition of
          never forsaking us. It must, also be noticed, that their humility and
          modesty prevent them from openly complaining of their distresses, and
          that they do not begin with a request for their own deliverance, but
          for the glory of God. Suffused with shame by reason of their calamity,
          which, in itself, amounts to a kind of rejection, they durst not
          openly crave, at God's hand, what they wished, but made their appeal
          indirectly, that, from a regard to his own glory, he would prove a
          father to sinners, who had no claim upon him whatever. And, as this
          formulary of prayer has once been delivered to the Church, let us
          also, in all our approaches unto God, remember to lay aside all
          self-righteousness, and to place our hopes entirely on his free favor.
          Moreover, when we pray for help, we ought to have the glory of God in
          view, in the deliverance which we obtain. And it is most likely they
          adopted this form of prayer, being led to do so by the promise. For,
          during the captivity, God had said, |Not for your sake, but for mine
          own sake will I do this,| Isaiah 48:11. When all other hopes fail,
          they acknowledge this to be their only refuge. The repetition of it is
          an evidence how conscious they were of their own demerit, so that, if
          their prayers should happen to be rejected a hundred times, they could
          not, in their own name, prefer any charge against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 Why should the heathen say, Where is now their God? They here
          express how God would maintain his glory in the preservation of the
          Church, which, if he permitted to be destroyed, would expose his name
          to the impious reproaches of the heathen, who would blaspheme the God
          of Israel, as being destitute of power, because he forsook his
          servants in the time of need. This is not done from the persuasion
          that God requires any such representation, but rather that the
          faithful may direct their thoughts back to that holy zeal contained in
          the words to which we have formerly adverted, |The railings of those
          that railed against thee have fallen upon me,| Psalm 69:10. And this
          is the reason for not having recourse to rhetorical embellishment, to
          move him to put forth his power to preserve the Church; they simply
          protest that their anxiety for their own safety does not prevent them
          from valuing the glory of God, even as it is worthy of being more
          highly valued. They go on to show how the glory of God was connected
          with their deliverance, by declaring that he was the Author of the
          covenant, which the ungodly had boasted was abolished and disannulled;
          and who, consequently, had declared that the grace of God was
          frustrated, and that his promises were vain. This is the ground on
          which they remind him of his favor and faithfulness, both of which
          were liable to mischievous calumnies, should he disappoint the hopes
          of his people, to whom he was bound by an everlasting covenant; and
          upon whom, in the exercise of his gratuitous mercy, he had bestowed
          the privilege of adoption. And as God, in making us also partakers of
          his Gospel, has condescended to graft us into the body of his Son, we
          ought to make a public acknowledgement of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 Surely our God is in heaven. The faithful, with holy boldness,
          encourage themselves the more to prayer. Our prayers, we know, are
          worthless when we are agitated with doubts. Had that blasphemy
          penetrated their hearts, it would have inflicted a mortal wound. And
          hence they very opportunely guard against it, by discontinuing the
          train of their supplications. By-and-bye we shall consider the second
          clause of this verse in its proper place, where they scoff at the
          idols, and lewd superstitions of the heathen. But, at present, every
          word in this clause demands our careful inspection. When they place
          God in heaven, they do not confine him to a certain locality, nor set
          limits to his infinite essence; but they deny the limitation of his
          power, its being shut up to human instrumentality only, or its being
          subject to fate or fortune. In short, they put the universe under his
          control; and, being superior to every obstruction, he does freely
          every thing that may seem good to him. This truth is still more
          plainly asserted in the subsequent clause, He hath done whatsoever
          pleased him. God, then, may be said to dwell in heaven, as the world
          is subject to his will, and nothing can prevent him from accomplishing
          his purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          That God can do whatsoever he pleaseth is a doctrine of great
          importance, provided it be truly and legitimately applied. This
          caution is necessary, because curious and forward persons, as is usual
          with them, take the liberty of abusing a sound doctrine by producing
          it in defense of their frantic reveries. And in this matter we daily
          witness too much of the wildness of human ingenuity. This mystery,
          which ought to command our admiration and awe, is by many shamelessly
          and irreverently made a topic of idle talk. If we would derive
          advantage from this doctrine, we must attend to the import of God's
          doing whatsoever he pleaseth in heaven and on the earth. And, first,
          God has all power for the preservation of his Church, and for
          providing for her welfare; and, secondly, all creatures are under his
          control, and therefore nothing can prevent him from accomplishing all
          his purposes. However much, then, the faithful may find themselves cut
          off from all means of subsistence and safety, they ought nevertheless
          to take courage from the fact, that God is not only superior to all
          impediments, but that he can render them subservient to the
          advancement of his own designs. This, too, must also be borne in mind,
          that all events are the result of God's appointment alone, and that
          nothing happens by chance. This much it was proper to premise
          respecting the use of this doctrine, that we may be prevented from
          forming unworthy conceptions of the glory of God, as men of wild
          imaginations are wont to do. Adopting this principle, we ought not to
          be ashamed frankly to acknowledge that God, by his eternal counsel,
          manages all things in such a manner, that nothing can be done but by
          his will and appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this passage Augustine very properly and ingeniously shows, that
          those events which appear to us unreasonable not only occur simply by
          the permission of God, but also by his will and decree. For if our God
          doeth whatsoever pleaseth him, why should he permit that to be done
          which he does not wish? Why does he not restrain the devil and all the
          wicked who set themselves in opposition to him? If he be regarded as
          occupying an intermediate position between doing and suffering, so as
          to tolerate what he does not wish, then, according to the fancy of the
          Epicureans, he will remain unconcerned in the heavens. But if we admit
          that God is invested with prescience, that he superintends and governs
          the world which he has made, and that he does not overlook any part of
          it, it must follow that every thing which takes place is done
          according to his will. Those who speak as if this would be to render
          God the author of evil are perverse disputants. Filthy dogs though
          they be, yet they will not, by their barking, be able to substantiate
          a charge of lying against the prophet, or to take the government of
          the world out of God's hand. If nothing occurs unless by the counsel
          and determination of God, he apparently does not disallow sin; he has,
          however, secret and to us unknown causes why he permits that which
          perverse men do, and yet this is not done because he approves of their
          wicked inclinations. It was the will of God that Jerusalem should be
          destroyed, the Chaldeans also wished the same thing, but after a
          different manner; and though he frequently calls the Babylonians his
          stipendiary soldiers, and says that they were stirred up by him,
          (Isaiah 5:26;) and farther, that they were the sword of his own hand,
          yet we would not therefore call them his allies, inasmuch as their
          object was very different. In the destruction of Jerusalem God's
          justice would be displayed, while the Chaldeans would be justly
          censured for their lust, covetousness, and cruelty. Hence, whatever
          takes place in the world is according to the will of God, and yet it
          is not his will that any evil should be done. For however
          incomprehensible his counsel may be to us, still it is always based
          upon the best of reasons. Satisfied with his will alone, so as to be
          fully persuaded, that, notwithstanding the great depth of his
          judgments, (Psalm 36:6) they are characterized by the most consummate
          rectitude; this ignorance will be far more learned than all the acumen
          of those who presume to make their own capacity the standard by which
          to measure his works. On the other hand, it is deserving of notice,
          that if God does whatsoever he pleases, then it is not his pleasure to
          do that which is not done. The knowledge of this truth is of great
          importance, because it frequently happens, when God winks and holds
          his peace at the afflictions of the Church, that we ask why he permits
          her to languish, since it is in his power to render her assistance.
          Avarice, fraud, perfidy, cruelty, ambition, pride, sensuality,
          drunkenness, and, in short, every species of corruption in these times
          is rampant in the world, all which would instantly cease did it seem
          good to God to apply the remedy. Wherefore, if he at any time appears
          to us to be asleep, or has not the means of succoring us, let this
          tend to make us wait patiently, and to teach us that it is not his
          pleasure to act so speedily the part of our deliverer, because he
          knows that delay and procrastination are profitable to us; it being
          his will to wink at and tolerate for a while what assuredly, were it
          his pleasure, he could instantly rectify.<br />
