          1. This very thing, too, still further demonstrates their opinion
          false, and their fictitious system untenable, that they endeavour to
          bring forward proofs of it, sometimes through means of numbers and the
          syllables of names, sometimes also through the letter of syllables,
          and yet again through those numbers which are, according to the
          practice followed by the Greeks, contained in [different] letters; --
          [this, I say,] demonstrates in the clearest manner their overthrow or
          confusion, as well as the untenable and perverse character of their
          [professed] knowledge. For, transferring the name Jesus, which belongs
          to another language, to the numeration of the Greeks, they sometimes
          call it |Episemon,| as having six letters, and at other times |the
          Plenitude of the Ogdoads,| as containing the number eight hundred and
          eighty-eight. But His [corresponding] Greek name, which is |Soter,|
          that is, Saviour, because it does not fit in with their system, either
          with respect to numerical value or as regards its letters, they pass
          over in silence. Yet surely, if they regard the names of the Lord, as,
          in accordance with the preconceived purpose of the Father, by means of
          their numerical value and letters, indicating number in the Pleroma,
          Soter, as being a Greek name, ought by means of its letters and the
          numbers [expressed by these], in virtue of its being Greek, to show
          forth the mystery of the Pleroma. But the case is not so, because it
          is a word of five letters, and its numerical value is one thousand
          four hundred and eight. But these things do not in any way correspond
          with their Pleroma; the account, therefore, which they give of
          transactions in the Pleroma cannot be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Moreover, Jesus, which is a word belonging to the proper tongue of
          the Hebrews, contains, as the learned among them declare, two letters
          and a half, and signifies that Lord who contains heaven and earth; for
          Jesus in the ancient Hebrew language means |heaven,| while again
          |earth| is expressed by the words sura usser. The word, therefore,
          which contains heaven and earth is just Jesus. Their explanation,
          then, of the Episemon is false, and their numerical calculation is
          also manifestly overthrown. For, in their own language, Soter is a
          Greek word of five letters; but, on the other hand, in the Hebrew
          tongue, Jesus contains only two letters and a half. The total which
          they reckon up, viz., eight hundred and eighty-eight, therefore falls
          to the ground. And throughout, the Hebrew letters do not correspond in
          number with the Greek, although these especially, as being the more
          ancient and unchanging, ought to uphold the reckoning connected with
          the names. For these ancient, original, and generally called sacred
          letters of the Hebrews are ten in number (but they are written by
          means of fifteen ), the last letter being joined to the first. And
          thus they write some of these letters according to their natural
          sequence, just as we do, but others in a reverse direction, from the
          right hand towards the left, thus tracing the letters backwards. The
          name Christ, too, ought to be capable of being reckoned up in harmony
          with the Æons of their Pleroma, inasmuch as, according to their
          statements, He was produced for the establishment and rectification of
          their Pleroma. The Father, too, in the same way, ought, both by means
          of letters and numerical value, to contain the number of those Æons
          who were produced by Him; Bythus, in like manner, and not less
          Monogenes; but pre-eminently the name which is above all others, by
          which God is called, and which in the Hebrew tongue is expressed by
          Baruch, [a word] which also contains two and a half letters. From this
          fact, therefore, that the more important names, both in the Hebrew and
          Greek languages, do not conform to their system, either as respects
          the number of letters or the reckoning brought out of them, the forced
          character of their calculations respecting the rest becomes clearly
          manifest.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. For, choosing out of the law whatever things agree with the number
          adopted in their system, they thus violently strive to obtain proofs
          of its validity. But if it was really the purpose of their Mother, or
          the Saviour, to set forth, by means of the Demiurge, types of those
          things which are in the Pleroma, they should have taken care that the
          types were found in things more exactly correspondent and more holy;
          and, above all, in the case of the Ark of the Covenant, on account of
          which the whole tabernacle of witness was formed. Now it was
          constructed thus: its length was two cubits and a half, its breadth
          one cubit and a half, its height one cubit and a half; but such a
          number of cubits in no respect corresponds with their system, yet by
          it the type ought to have been, beyond everything else, clearly set
          forth. The mercy-seat also does in like manner not at all harmonize
          with their expositions. Moreover, the table of shew-bread was two
          cubits in length, while its height was a cubit and a half. These stood
          before the holy of holies, and yet in them not a single number is of
          such an amount as contains an indication of the Tetrad, or the Ogdoad,
          or of the rest of their Pleroma. What of the candlestick, too, which
          had seven branches and seven lamps? while, if these had been made
          according to the type, it ought to have had eight branches and a like
          number of lamps, after the type of the primary Ogdoad, which shines
          pre-eminently among the Æons, and illuminates the whole Pleroma. They
          have carefully enumerated the curtains as being ten, declaring these a
          type of the ten Æons; but they have forgotten to count the coverings
          of skin, which were eleven in number. Nor, again, have they measured
          the size of these very curtains, each curtain being eight-and-twenty
          cubits in length. And they set forth the length of the pillars as
          being ten cubits, with a reference to the Decad of Æons. |But the
          breadth of each pillar was a cubit and a half;| and this they do not
          explain, any more than they do the entire number of the pillars or of
          their bars, because that does not suit the argument. But what of the
          anointing oil, which sanctified the whole tabernacle? Perhaps it
          escaped the notice of the Saviour, or, while their Mother was
          sleeping, the Demiurge of himself gave instructions as to its weight;
          and on this account it is out of harmony with their Pleroma,
          consisting, as it did, of five hundred shekels of myrrh, five hundred
          of cassia, two hundred and fifty of cinnamon, two hundred and fifty of
          calamus, and oil in addition, so that it was composed of five
          ingredients. The incense also, in like manner, [was compounded] of
          stacte, onycha, galbanum, mint, and frankincense, all which do in no
          respect, either as to their mixture or weight, harmonize with their
          argument. It is therefore unreasonable and altogether absurd [to
          maintain] that the types were not preserved in the sublime and more
          imposing enactments of the law; but in other points, when any number
          coincides with their assertions, to affirm that it was a type of the
          things in the Pleroma; while [the truth is, that] every number occurs
          with the utmost variety in the Scriptures, so that, should any one
          desire it, he might form not only an Ogdoad, and a Decad, and a
          Duodecad, but any sort of number from the Scriptures, and then
          maintain that this was a type of the system of error devised by
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. But that this point is true, that that number which is called five,
          which agrees in no respect with their argument, and does not harmonize
          with their system, nor is suitable for a typical manifestation of the
          things in the Pleroma, [yet has a wide prevalence, ] will be proved as
          follows from the Scriptures. Soter is a name of five letters; Pater,
          too, contains five letters; Agape (love), too, consists of five
          letters; and our Lord, after blessing the five loaves, fed with them
          five thousand men. Five virgins were called wise by the Lord; and, in
          like manner, five were styled foolish. Again, five men are said to
          have been with the Lord when He obtained testimony from the Father, --
          namely, Peter, and James, and John, and Moses, and Elias. The Lord
          also, as the fifth person, entered into the apartment of the dead
          maiden, and raised her up again; for, says [the Scripture], |He
          suffered no man to go in, save Peter and James, and the father and
          mother of the maiden.| The rich man in hell declared that he had five
          brothers, to whom he desired that one rising from the dead should go.
          The pool from which the Lord commanded the paralytic man to go into
          his house, had five porches. The very form of the cross, too, has five
          extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on
          which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails. Each of our
          hands has five fingers; we have also five senses; our internal organs
          may also be reckoned as five, viz., the heart, the liver, the lungs,
          the spleen, and the kidneys. Moreover, even the whole person may be
          divided into this number [of parts], -- the head, the breast, the
          belly, the thighs, and the feet. The human race passes through five
          ages first infancy, then boyhood, then youth, then maturity, and then
          old age. Moses delivered the law to the people in five books. Each
          table which he received from God contained five commandments. The veil
          covering the holy of holies had five pillars. The altar of
          burnt-offering also was five cubits in breadth. Five priests were
          chosen in the wilderness, -- namely, Aaron, Nadab, Abiud, Eleazar,
          Ithamar. The ephod and the breastplate, and other sacerdotal
          vestments, were formed out of five materials; for they combined in
          themselves gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.
          And there were five kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua the son of Nun
          shut up in a cave, and directed the people to trample upon their
          heads. Any one, in fact, might collect many thousand other things of
          the same kind, both with respect to this number and any other he chose
          to fix upon, either from the Scriptures, or from the works of nature
          lying under his observation. But although such is the case, we do not
          therefore affirm that there are five Æons above the Demiurge; nor do
          we consecrate the Pentad, as if it were some divine thing; nor do we
          strive to establish things that are untenable, nor ravings [such as
          they indulge in], by means of that vain kind of labour; nor do we
          perversely force a creation well adapted by God [for the ends intended
          to be served], to change itself into types of things which have no
          real existence; nor do we seek to bring forward impious and abominable
          doctrines, the detection and overthrow of which are easy to all
          possessed of intelligence.
        </p>

          5. For who can concede to them that the year has three hundred and
          sixty-five days only, in order that there may be twelve months of
          thirty days each, after the type of the twelve Æons, when the type is
          in fact altogether out of harmony [with the antitype]? For, in the one
          case, each of the Æons is a thirtieth part of the entire Pleroma,
          while in the other they declare that a month is the twelfth part of a
          year. If, indeed, the year were divided into thirty parts, and the
          month into twelve, then a fitting type might be regarded as having
          been found for their fictitious system. But, on the contrary, as the
          case really stands, their Pleroma is divided into thirty parts, and a
          portion of it into twelve; while again the whole year is divided into
          twelve parts, and a certain portion of it into thirty. The Saviour
          therefore acted unwisely in constituting the month a type of the
          entire Pleroma, but the year a type only of that Duodecad which exists
          in the Pleroma; for it was more fitting to divide the year into thirty
          parts, even as the whole Pleroma is divided, but the month into
          twelve, just as the Æons are in their Pleroma. Moreover, they divide
          the entire Pleroma into three portions, -- namely, into an Ogdoad, a
          Decad, and a Duodecad. But our year is divided into four parts, --
          namely, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. And again, not even do the
          months, which they maintain to be a type of the Triacontad, consist
          precisely of thirty days, but some have more and some less, inasmuch
          as five days remain to them as an overplus. The day, too, does not
          always consist precisely of twelve hours, but rises from nine to
          fifteen, and then falls again from fifteen to nine. It cannot
          therefore be held that months of thirty days each were so formed for
          the sake of [typifying] the Æons; for, in that case, they would have
          consisted precisely of thirty days: nor, again, the days of these
          months, that by means of twelve hours they might symbolize the twelve
          Æons; for, in that case, they would always have consisted precisely of
          twelve hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But further, as to their calling material substances |on the left
          hand,| and maintaining that those things which are thus on the left
          hand of necessity fall into corruption, while they also affirm that
          the Saviour came to the lost sheep, in order to transfer it to the
          right hand, that is, to the ninety and nine sheep which were in
          safety, and perished not, but continued within the fold, yet were of
          the left hand, it follows that they must acknowledge that the
          enjoyment of rest did not imply salvation. And that which has not in
          like manner the same number, they will be compelled to acknowledge as
          belonging to the left hand, that is, to corruption. This Greek word
          Agape (love), then, according to the letters of the Greeks, by means
          of which reckoning is carried on among them, having a numerical value
          of ninety-three, is in like manner assigned to the place of rest on
          the left hand. Aletheia (truth), too, having in like manner, according
          to the principle indicated above, a numerical value of sixty-four,
          exists among material substances. And thus, in fine, they will be
          compelled to acknowledge that all those sacred names which do not
          reach a numerical value of one hundred, but only contain the numbers
          summed by the left hand, are corruptible and material.
