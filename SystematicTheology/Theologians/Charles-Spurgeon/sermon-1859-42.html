        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.266)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, August 7th, 1859, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens.</p>
        <p>
          "And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
          disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
          Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. And when he heard that it
          was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son
          of David, have mercy on me. And many charged him that he should hold
          his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have
          mercy on me. And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called.
          And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
          rise; he calleth thee. And he, casting away his garment, rose, and
          came to Jesus. And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou
          that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
          might receive my sight. And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith
          hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and
          followed Jesus in the way." -- Mark 10:46-52.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS POOR MAN was beset with two great evils -- blindness and poverty.
          It is sad enough to be blind, but If a man that is blind is in
          possession of riches, there are ten thousand comforts which may help
          to cheer the darkness of his eye and alleviate the sadness of his
          heart. But to be both blind and poor, these were a combination of the
          sternest evils. One thinks it scarcely possible to resist the cry of a
          beggar whom we meet in the street if he is blind. We pity the blind
          man when he is surrounded with luxury, but when we see a blind man in
          want, and following the beggar's trade in the frequented streets, we
          can hardly forbear stopping to assist him. This case of Bartimeus,
          however, is but a picture of our own. We are all by nature blind and
          poor. It is true we account ourselves able enough to see; but this is
          but one phase of our blindness. Our blindness is of such a kind that
          it makes us think our vision perfect; whereas, when we are enlightened
          by the Holy Spirit, we discover our previous sight to have been
          blindness indeed. Spiritually, we are blind; we are unable to discern
          our lost estate; unable to behold the blackness of sin, or the terrors
          of the wrath to come. The unrenewed mind is so blind, that it
          perceives not the allattractive beauty of Christ; the Sun of
          Righteousness may arise with healing beneath his wings, but twere all
          in vain for those who cannot see his shining. Christ may do many
          mighty works in their presence, but they do not recognize his glory;
          we are blind until he has opened our eyes. But besides being blind we
          are also by nature poor. Our father Adam spent our birthright, lost
          our estates. Paradise, the homestead of our race, has become
          dilapidated, and we are left in the depths of beggary without anything
          with which we may buy bread for our hungry fouls, or raiment for our
          naked spirits; blindness and beggary are the lot of all men after a
          spiritual fashion, till Jesus visits them in love. Look around then,
          ye children of God; look around you this morning, and ye shall see in
          this hall many a counterpart of poor blind Bartimeus sitting by the
          wayside begging. I hope there be many such come here, who though they
          be blind, and naked and poor, nevertheless are begging -- longing to
          get something more than they have -- not content with their position.
          With just enough spiritual life and sensitiveness to know their
          misery, they have come up to this place begging. Oh that while Jesus
          passes by this day they may have faith to cry aloud to him for mercy!
          Oh may his gracious heart be moved by their thrilling cry, "Jesus thou
          Son of David have mercy on me!" Oh may he turn and give sight unto
          such, that they may follow him and go on their way rejoicing!
        </p>
        <p>
          This morning I shall address myself most particularly to the poor and
          blind souls here to-day. The poor blind man's faith described in this
          passage of Scripture, is a fit picture of the faith which I pray God
          you may be enabled to exert to the saving of your souls. We shall
          notice the origin of his faith, how his faith perceived its
          opportunity when Jesus passed by; we shall listen to his faith while
          it cries and begs; we shall look upon his faith while it leaps in
          joyous obedience to the divine call; and then we shall hear his faith
          describing his case: "Lord, that I might receive my sight;" and I
          trust we shall be enabled to rejoice together with this poor believing
          man, when his sight is restored, as we see him in the beauty of
          thankfulness and gratitude follow Jesus in the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, then, we shall note THE ORIGIN OF THIS POOR BLIND MAN'S
          FAITH. He had faith, for it was his faith which obtained for him his
          sight. Now, where did he get it? We are not told in this passage how
          Bartimeus came to believe Jesus to be the Messiah; but I think we may
          very fairly risk a conjecture. It is quite certain that Bartimeus did
          not come to believe in Christ from what he saw. Jesus had worked many
          miracles; many eyes had seen, and many hearts had believed because of
          what they saw. Bartimeus also believed, but certainly not as the
          result of his eyesight, for he was stone-blind. No ray of light had
          ever burst into his soul; he was shut up in thick darkness and could
          see nothing. How then was it that he came to believe? It certainly
          could not have been because he had traveled much through the country,
          for blind men stay at home; they care not to journey far. There is
          nothing they can see. However fair the landscape, they cannot drink it
          in with their eyes; whatever lovely spots others may behold, there are
          no attractions for their blank survey. They therefore stay at home.
          And especially a mendicant like this, how should he travel? He would
          be perhaps unknown out of the city in which his father Timeus had
          lived -- even Jericho. He could not move the heart of strangers to
          charity, nor would he be likely to find a guide to conduct him
          throughout the dreary miles of that land. He would be almost
          necessarily a poor blind stay-at-home. Then how did he acquire his
          faith? Methinks it might be in this fashion. On the nearest bank he
          could find outside Jericho, he sat begging in the sunlight; for blind
          men always love to bask in the sun. Though they see nothing, there is
          a kind of glimmering that penetrates the visual organ, and they
          rejoice in it. At least they feel the heat of the great orb of day if
          they see not his light. Well, as he sat there, he would hear the
          passers by talking of Jesus of Nazareth, and as blind men are usually
          inquisitive, he would ask them to stay and tell him the story -- some
          tale of what Jesus had done; and they would tell him how he raised the
          dead, and healed the leper; and he would say, "I wonder if he can give
          sight to the blind." And one day it came to pass, that he was told
          Jesus had restored to sight a man who had been born blind. This indeed
          was the great master-story that the world has to tell, for it had
          never been so known before in Israel, that a man who had been born
          blind should have his eyes opened. I think I see the poor man as he
          hears the story, he drinks it in, claps his hands, and cries, "Then
          there is yet hope for me. Mayhap the Prophet will pass this way, and
          if he doth, oh I will cry to him, I will beg him to open my eyes too;
          for if the worst case has been cured, then surely mine may be." Many
          and many a day as he sat there, he would call to the passer by again,
          and would say, "Come tell me the story of the man that was born blind
          and of Jesus of Nazareth that opened his eyes," and perhaps he would
          even get tiresome, as blind men are wont. He must hear the story told
          him a hundred times over, and always would there be a smile on the
          poor fellow's face when he heard the refreshing narrative. It never
          could be told too often, for he loved to hear it. To him it was like a
          cool refreshing breeze in the heat of burning sun. "Tell it me, tell
          it me, tell it me again," says he -- "the sweet story of the man that
          opened the eyes of the blind." And methinks as he sat all alone, and
          unable to divert his mind with many things, he would always keep his
          heart fixed on that one narrative, and turn it over, and over, and
          over again, till in his day-dreams he would half think he could see,
          and sometimes almost imagine that his own eyes were going to be opened
          too. Perhaps on one of those occasions, as he was turning over this in
          his mind, some text of Scripture he had heard in the synagogue,
          occurred to him; he heard that Messiah should come to open the eyes of
          the blind, and quick in thought, having better eyes within than he had
          without, he came at once to the conclusion that the man who could open
          the eyes of the blind was none other than the Messiah; and from that
          day he was a secret disciple of Jesus. He might have heard him scoffed
          at, but he did not scoff. How could he scoff at one who had opened the
          eyes of the blind? He might have heard many a passer-by reviling
          Christ, and calling him an impostor, but he could not join in the
          reviling. How could he be a deceiver who gave sight to poor blind men?
          I fancy this would be the cherished dream of his life. And perhaps for
          the two or three years of the Saviour's ministry, the one thought of
          the poor blind man would be, "Jesus of Nazareth opened the eyes of one
          that was blind." That story which he had heard led him to believe
          Jesus must be the predicted Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, O ye spiritually blind, ye spiritually poor, how is it ye have
          not believed in Christ? Ye have heard the wondrous deeds which he has
          done; "Faith cometh by hearing." Ye have understood how one after
          another has been pardoned and forgiven; you have stood in the house of
          God and listened to the confession of the penitent and the joyous
          shout of the believer, and yet you believe not. You have journeyed up
          year after year to the sanctuary of God, and ye have heard many
          stories -- many a glorious narrative of the pardoning power of Christ;
          and how is it, O ye spiritually blind, that ye have never thought on
          him? Why is it you have not turned this over and over in your minds.
          "This man receiveth sinners, and will he not receive me?" How is it
          that ye have not recollected that he who put away the sin of Paul and
          Magdalene can put away your's also. Surely, if but one story told into
          the ear of the poor blind man could give him faith, if his faith came
          but by one hearing, how is it that though ye have heard many times
          that there was no salvation without faith in Christ, and listened to
          many an earnest appeal, yet ye have not believed? Yet, it may be, I
          have among these poor blind men some here to-day that are simply
          believing. You have never yet laid hold of faith, but still in the
          depths of your soul there is a something which says, "Yes he is able
          to save me; I know he hath power to forgive," and sometimes the voice
          speaks a little louder, and it cheers your heart with a thought like
          this, "Go to him he will not cast you away, he has never cast out one
          yet who did venture upon his power and goodness." Well, my dear
          hearer, if thou art in this plight, thou art happy, and I am a happy
          man to have the privilege of addressing thee -- it shall not be long
          ere the faith within thee, which has been born by hearing, shall
          acquire strength enough to exercise itself to gain the blessing. That
          is the first thing -- the origin of the faith of poor blind Bartimeus,
          it doubtless came by hearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now, in the next place, we shall notice his faith in ITS QUICKNESS
          AT GRASPING THE GRACIOUS OPPORTUNITY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jesus had been through Jericho, and as he went into the city there was
          a blind man standing by the way, and Jesus healed him. Bartimeus
          however seems to have resided at the other side of Jericho, therefore
          he did not get a blessing till Christ was about to leave it. He is
          sitting down upon his customary spot by the wayside where some friend
          has left him, that he might remain there all day and beg, and he hears
          a great noise and trampling of feet, he wonders what it is, and he
          asks a passer-by what is that noise? "Why all this tumult?" Aml the
          answer is, "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by." That is but small
          encouragement, yet his faith had now arrived at such a strength that
          this was quite enough for him, that Jests of Nazareth passeth by.
          Unbelief would have said, "He passes by, there is no bearing for you;
          he passes by, there is no hope of mercy; he is about to leave, and he
          takes no notice of you." Why, if you and I needed encouagement, we
          should want Christ to stand still; we should need that some one should
          say, "Jesus of Nazareth is standing still and looking for you;" ay,
          but this poor man's faith was of such a character that it could feed
          on any dry crust on which our puny little faith would have starved. He
          was like that poor woman, who when she was repused, said, "Truth,
          Lord, I am but a dog, yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the
          master's table." He only heard "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by;" but
          that was enough for him. It was a slender opportunity. He might have
          reasoned thus with himself, "Jesus is passing by, he is just going out
          of Jericho; surely he cannot stay now he is on a journey." No, rather
          did he argue thus with himself, "if he is going out of Jericho, so
          much the more reason that I should stop him, for this may be my last
          chance." And, therefore, what unbelief would argue as a reason for
          stopping his mouth did but open it the wider. Unbelief might have
          said, "He is surrounded by a great multitude of people, he cannot get
          at you. His disciples are round about him too, he will be so busy in
          addressing them that he will never regard your feeble cry." "Ay," said
          he, "so much the greater reason then that I should cry with all my
          might;" and he makes the very multitude of people become a fresh
          argument why he should shout aloud, "Jesus of Nazareth have mercy upon
          me." So, however slender the opportunity, yet it encouraged him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now my dear hearers, we turn to you again. Faith has been in your
          heart perhaps for many a day, but how foolish have you been; you have
          not availed yourself of encouraging opportunities as you might have
          done. How many times has Christ not only passed by, but stopped and
          knocked at your door, and stood in your house. He has wooed and
          invited you, and yet you would not come, still trembling and wavering,
          you durst not exercise the faith you have, and risk the results and
          come boldly to him. He has stood in your streets, -- "Lo these many
          years," till the poor blind man's hair would have turned grey with
          age. He is standing in the street to-day -- to-day he addresses you
          and says, "Sinner come to me and live." To-day is mercy freely
          presented to you; to-day is the declaration made -- "Whosoever will,
          let him come and take of the water of life freely." You poor
          unbelieving heart will you not, dare you not take advantage of the
          encouragement to come to him? Your encouragements are infinitely
          greater than those of this poor blind man, let them not be lost upon
          you. Come now, this very moment, cry aloud to him now, ask him to have
          mercy upon you, for now he not only passes by, but he presents himself
          with outstretched arms, and cries, "Come unto me, and I will give you
          rest, and life, and salvation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Such was the encouragement of this man's faith, and I would that
          something in the service of this morning, might give encouragement to
          some poor Bartimeus, who is sitting or standing here.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. In the third place, having noticed how the faith of the blind man
          discovered and seized upon this opportunity, the passing by of the
          gracious Saviour, we have TO LISTEN TO THE CRY OF FAITH. The poor
          blind man sitting there, is informed that it is Jesus of Nazareth.
          Without a moment's pause or ado, he is up and begins to cry -- "Thou
          Son of David, have mercy upon me -- thou Son of David, have mercy on
          me." But he is in the middle of a fair discourse, and his hearers like
          not that he should be interrupted -- "Hold thy tongue, blind man.
          Begone! he cannot attend to thee." Yet what does the narrative say
          about him?" He cried the more a great deal;" not only cried he more,
          but he cries a great deal more. "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me."
          "Oh," says Peter, "do not interrupt the Master, what are you so noisy
          for?" "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me:" he repeats it again.
          "Remove him," says one, "he interrupts the whole service, take him
          away," and so they tried to move him; yet he cries the more vigorously
          and vehemently, "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me -- thou Son of
          David, have mercy on me." Methinks we hear his shout. It is not to be
          imitated; no artiste could throw into an utterance such vehemence or
          such emotion as this man would cast into it. -- "Thou Son of David,
          have mercy on me " Every word would tell, every syllable would suggest
          an argument, there would be the very strength, and might, and blood,
          and sinew of that man's life cast into it; he would be like Jacob
          wrestling with the angel, and every word would be a band to grasp him
          that he might not go. "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me." We have
          here a picture of the power of faith. In every case, sinner, if thou
          wouldst be saved, thy faith must exercise itself in crying. The gate
          of heaven is to be opened only in one way, by the very earnest use of
          the knocker of prayer. Thou canst not have thine eyes opened until thy
          mouth is opened. Open thy mouth in prayer, and he shall open thine
          eyes to see; so shalt thou find joy and gladness. Mark you, when a man
          hath faith in the soul and earnestness combined with it, he will pray
          indeed. Call ye not those things prayers that ye hear read in the
          churches. Imagine not that those orations are prayers that you hear in
          our prayer-meetings. Prayer is something nobler than all these. That
          is prayer, when the poor soul in some weighty trouble, fainting and
          athirst, lifts up its streaming eyes, and wrings its hands, and beats
          its bosom, and then cries, "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me." Your
          cold orations will ne'er reach the throne of God. It is the burning
          lava of the soul that hath a furnace within -- a very volcano of grief
          and sorrow -- it is that burning lava of prayer that finds its way to
          God. No prayer ever reaches God's heart which does not come from our
          hearts. Nine out of ten of the prayers which ye listen to in our
          public services have so little zeal in them, that if they obtained a
          blessing it would be a miracle of miracles indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear hearers, are you now seeking Christ in earnest prayer? Be not
          afraid of being too earnest or too persevering. Go to Christ this day,
          agonize and wrestle with him; beg him to have mercy on you, and if he
          hear you not, go to him again, and again, and again. Seven times a day
          call upon him, and resolve in your heart that you will never cease
          from prayer till the Holy Ghost hath revealed to your soul the pardon
          of your sin. When once the Lord brings a man to this resolve "I will
          be saved. If I perish, I will still go to the throne of grace and
          perish only there," that man cannot perish. He is a saved man, and
          shall see God's face with joy. The worst of us is, we pray with a
          little spasmodic earnestness and then we cease. We begin again, and
          then once more the fervor ceases and we leave off our prayers. If we
          would get heaven, we must carry it not by one desperate assault, but
          by a continuous blockade. We must take it with the red hot shot of
          fervent prayer. But this must be fired day and night, until at last
          the city of heaven yields to us. The kingdom of heaven suffereth
          violence, and the violent must take it by force. Behold the courage of
          this man. He is hindered by many, but he will not cease to pray. So if
          the flesh, the devil, and your own hearts should bid you cease your
          supplication, never do so, but so much the more a great deal cry
          aloud, "Thou Son of David have mercy on me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I must observe here the simplicity of this man's prayer. He did not
          want a liturgy or a prayer-book on this occasion. There was something
          he needed, and he asked for that. When we have our needs at hand they
          will usually suggest the proper language. I remember a remark of
          quaint old Bunyan, speaking of those who make prayers for others, "The
          apostle Paul said he knew not what to pray for, and yet," says he
          "there are many infinitely inferior to the apostle Paul, who can write
          prayers; who not only know what to pray for, and how to pray, but who
          know how other people should pray, and not only that, but who know how
          they ought to pray from the first day of January to the last of
          December." We cannot dispense with the fresh influence of the Holy
          Spirit suggesting words in which our needs may be couched; and as to
          the idea that any form of prayer will ever suit an awakened and
          enlightened believer, or will ever be fit and proper for the lip of a
          penitent sinner -- I cannot imagine it. This man cried from his heart,
          the words that came first -- the simplest which could possibly express
          his desire -- "Thou Son of David, have mercy on me." Go and do thou
          likewise thou poor blind sinner, and the Lord will hear thee, as he
          did Bartimeus.
        </p>
        <p>
          High over the buz and noise of the multitude and the sound of the
          trampling of feet is heard a sweet voice, which tells of mercy, and of
          love, and of grace. But louder than that voice is heard a piercing cry
          -- a cry repeated many and many a time -- which gathers strength in
          repetition; and though the throat that utters it be hoarse, yet does
          the cry wax louder and louder, and stronger still, -- "Jesus, thou Son
          of David, have mercy on me." The Master stops. The sound of misery in
          earnest to be relieved can never be neglected by him. He looks around:
          there sits Bartimeus. The Saviour can see him, though he cannot see
          the Saviour: "Bring him hither to me," saith he; "let him come to me,
          that I may have mercy on him." And now, they who had bidden him hold
          his clamor change their note, and gathering around him they say, "Be
          of good cheer; rise, he calleth thee." Ah, poor comforters! they would
          not soothe him when he needed it. What cared he now for all they had
          to say? The Master had spoken; that was enough, without their
          officious assistance. Nevertheless they cry, "Arise, he calleth thee;"
          and they lead him, or are about to lead him, to Christ, but he needs
          no leading; pushing them aside he hurls back the garment in which he
          wrapped himself by night -- no doubt, a ragged one -- and casting that
          away, the blind man seems as if he really saw at once. The sound
          guides him, and with a leap, leaving his cloak behind him, waving his
          hands for very gladness, there he stands in the presence of him who
          shall give him sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          IV. We pause here to observe HOW EAGERLY HE OBEYED THE CALL. The
          Master had but to speak, but to stand still, and command him to be
          called, and he comes. No pressure is needed. Peter need not pull him
          by one arm, and John by the other. No; he leaps forward, and is glad
          to come. "He calleth me, and shall I stand back?"
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, my dear hearers, how many of you have been called under the
          sound of the ministry, and yet you have not come: Why is it? did you
          think that Christ did not mean it when he said -- "Come unto me all ye
          that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest?" Why is it
          that you still keep on at your labors and are still heavy laden? Why
          do you not come? Oh, come! Leap to him that calleth thee! I pray you
          cast away the rainment of your worldliness, the garment of your sin.
          Cast away the robe of your self-righteousness, and come, come away.
          Why is it that I bid you? Surely if you will not come at the Saviour's
          bidding, you will not come at mine, If your own stern necessities do
          not make you attend to his gracious call, surely nothing I can say can
          ever move you. O my poor blind brothers and sisters! you, who cannot
          see Christ to be your Saviour, you that are full of guilt and fear, he
          calleth you,
        </p>
        <p>"Come ye weary, heavy laden,</p>
        <p>Lost and ruined by the fall."</p>
        <p>
          Come ye that have no hope, no righteousness; ye outcast, ye
          desponding, ye distressed, ye lost, ye ruined, come! come! to-day.
          Whoever will, in your ears to-day doth mercy cry, "Arise, he calleth
          thee!" O, Saviour! call ye them effectually. Call now: let the Spirit
          speak. O Spirit of the living God, bid the poor prisoner come, and let
          him leap to lose his chains. I know that which kept me a long time
          from the Saviour was the idea that he had never called me: and yet
          when I came to him, I discovered that long ere that he had invited me
          but I had closed my ear, I thought surely he had invited every one
          else to him, but I must be left out, the poorest and the vilest of
          them all. O sinner! if such be thy consciousness, then you are one to
          whom the invitation is specially addressed. Trust him now, justly thou
          art, with all thy sins about thee, come to him and ask him to forgive
          thee; plead his blood and merits, and thou canst not, shalt not plead
          in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. We proceed towards the conclusion. The man has come to Christ, let
          US LISTEN TO HIS SUIT. Jesus, with loving condescension takes him by
          the hand and in order to test him, and that all the crowd might see
          that he really knew what he wanted, Jesus said to him -- "What wilt
          thou that I should do unto thee?" How plain the man's confession, not
          one word too many, he could not have said it in a word less -- "Lord
          that I might receive my sight." There was no stammering here, no
          stuttering, and saying, "Lord I hardly know what to say." He just told
          it at once -- "Lord that I might receive my sight."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if there be a hearer in this house who has a secret faith in
          Christ, and who has heard the invitation this morning, let me beseech
          you go home to your chamber, and there, kneeling by your bedside, by
          faith picture the Saviour saying to you -- "What wilt thou that I
          should do unto thee?" "Fall on your knees, and without hesitation tell
          him all, tell him you are guilty, and you desire that he would pardon
          you. Confess your sins; keep none of them back. Say, "Lord, I implore
          thee pardon my drunkenness, my profanity, or whatever it may be that I
          have been guilty of;" and then still imagine thou hearest him saying
          -- "What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?" Tell him, "Lord I
          would be kept from all these sins in the future. I shall not be
          content with being pardoned, I want to be renewed;" tell him thou hast
          a hard heart, ask him to soften it; tell him thou have a blind eye,
          and thou canst not see thine interest in Christ. Ask him to open it;
          confess before him thou art full of iniquity and prone to wander; ask
          him to take thine heart and wash it, and then to set it upon things
          above, and suffer it no longer to be fond of the things of earth. Tell
          it out plainly, make a frank and full confession in his presence; and
          what if it should happen, my dear hearer, that this very day, while
          thou art in thy chamber, Christ should give thee the touch of grace,
          put thy sins away, save thy soul, and give thee the joy to know that
          thou art now a child of God, and now a heir of heaven. Imitate the
          blind man in the explicitness and straight-forwardness of his
          confession and his request, -- "Lord, that I might receive my sight."
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, how cheering the fact, the blind man had no sooner stated
          his desire than immediately he received his sight. Oh! how he must
          have leaped in that moment! What joys must have rushed in upon his
          spirit! He saw not the men as trees walking, but he received his sight
          at once; not a glimmer, but a bright full burst of sunlight fell upon
          his benighted eyeballs. Some persons do not believe in instantaneous
          conversions, nevertheless they are facts. Man! a man has come into
          this hall with all his sins about him, and ere he has left it has felt
          his sins forgiven. He has come here a hardened reprobate, but he has
          gone away from that day forth to lead a new life, and walk in the fear
          of God. The fact is, there are many conversions that are gradual; but
          regeneration after all, at least in the part of it called
          "quickening," must be instantaneous, and justification is given to a
          man as swiftly as the flash of lightning. We are full of sin one hour,
          but it is forgiven in an instant; and sins, past, present, and to
          come, are cast to the four winds of heaven in less time than the clock
          takes to beat the death of a second. The blind man saw immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now what would you imagine this man would do as soon as his eyes
          were opened. Has he a father, will he not go to see him? Has he a
          sister, or a brother, will he not long to get to his household? Above
          all has he a partner of his poor blind existence, will he not seek her
          out to go and tell her that now he can behold the face of one who has
          so long loved and wept over him? Will he not now want to go and see
          the temple, and the glories of it? Does he not now desire to look upon
          the hills and all their beauties, and behold the sea and its storms
          and all its wonders? No, there is but one thing that poor blind man
          now longs for -- it is that he may always see the man who has opened
          his eyes. "He followed Jesus in the way." What a beautiful picture
          this is of a true convert. The moment his sins are forgiven, the one
          thing he wants to do is to serve Christ. His tongue begins to itch to
          tell somebody else of the mercy he has found. He longs to go off to
          the next shop and tell some workfellow that his sins are all pardoned.
          He cannot be content. He thinks he could preach now. Put him in the
          pulpit, and though there were ten thousand before him, he would not
          blush to say, "He hath taken me out of the miry clay, and out of the
          horrible pit, and set my feet upon a rock, and put a new song into my
          mouth and established my goings." All he now asks is, "Lord, I would
          follow thee whithersoever thou goest. Let me never lose thy company.
          Make my communion with thee everlasting. Cause my love to increase.
          May my service be continual, and in this life may I walk with Jesus,
          and in the world to come all I ask is that I may live with him."
        </p>
        <p>
          You see the crowd going along now. Who is that man in the midst with
          face so joyous? Who is that man who has lost his upper garment? See he
          wears the dress of a beggar. Who is he? You would not think there is
          any beggary about him; for his step is firm and his eye glistening and
          sparkles, and hearken to him; as he goes along, sometimes he is
          uttering a little hymn or song; at other times when others are
          singing, hearken to his notes, the loudest of them all. Who is this
          man, always so happy and so full of thankfulness.? It is the poor
          blind Bartimeus, who once sat by the wayside begging. And do you see
          yonder man, his brother, and his prototype? Who is it that sings so
          heartily in the house of God, and who when he is sitting in that
          house, or walking by the way is continually humming to himself, some
          strain of praise? Oh! it is that drunkard who has had his sins
          forgiven, it is that swearer who has had his profanity cleansed out,
          it is she who was once a harlot, but is now one of the daughters of
          Jerusalem, -- 'tis she who once led others to hell, who now washes her
          Redeemer's feet and wipes them with the hairs of her head. Oh, may God
          grant that this story of Bartimeus may be written over again in your
          experience, and may you all at last meet where the eternal light of
          God shall have chased away all blindness, and where the inhabitants
          shall never say, "I am sick."
