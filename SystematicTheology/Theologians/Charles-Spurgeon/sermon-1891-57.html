          1. Moreover, their ignorance comes out in a clear light with respect
          to the case of that woman who, suffering from an issue of blood,
          touched the hem of the Lord's garment, and so was made whole; for they
          maintain that through her was shown forth that twelfth power who
          suffered passion, and flowed out towards immensity, that is, the
          twelfth Æon. [This ignorance of theirs appears] first, because, as I
          have shown, according to their own system, that was not the twelfth
          Æon. But even granting them this point [in the meantime], there being
          twelve Æons, eleven of these are said to have continued impassible,
          while the twelfth suffered passion; but the woman, on the other hand,
          being healed in the twelfth year, it is manifest that she had
          continued to suffer during eleven years, and was healed in the
          twelfth. If indeed they were to say that eleven Æons were involved in
          passion, but the twelfth one was healed, it would then be a plausible
          thing to say that the woman was a type of these. But since she
          suffered during eleven years, and [all that time] obtained no cure,
          but was healed in the twelfth year, in what way can she be a type of
          the twelfth of the Æons, eleven of whom, [according to hypothesis,]
          did not suffer at all, but the twelfth alone participated in
          suffering? For a type and emblem is, no doubt, sometimes diverse from
          the truth [signified] as to matter and substance; but it ought, as to
          the general form and features, to maintain a likeness [to what is
          typified], and in this way to shadow forth by means of things present
          those which are yet to come.

          2. And not only in the case of this woman have the years of her
          infirmity (which they affirm to fit in with their figment) been
          mentioned, but, lo! another woman was also healed, after suffering in
          like manner for eighteen years; concerning whom the Lord said, |And
          ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound during
          eighteen years, to be set free on the Sabbath-day?| If, then, the
          former was a type of the twelfth Æon that suffered, the latter should
          also be a type of the eighteenth Æon in suffering. But they cannot
          maintain this; otherwise their primary and original Ogdoad will be
          included in the number of Æons who suffered together. Moreover, there
          was also a certain other person healed by the Lord, after he had
          suffered for eight-and-thirty years: they ought therefore to affirm
          that the Æon who occupies the thirty-eighth place suffered. For if
          they assert that the things which were done by the Lord were types of
          what took place in the Pleroma, the type ought to be preserved
          throughout. But they can neither adapt to their fictitious system the
          case of her who was cured after eighteen years, nor of him who was
          cured after thirty-eight years. Now, it is in every way absurd and
          inconsistent to declare that the Saviour preserved the type in certain
          cases, while He did not do so in others. The type of the woman,
          therefore, [with the issue of blood] is shown to have no analogy to
          their system of Æons. <br />
