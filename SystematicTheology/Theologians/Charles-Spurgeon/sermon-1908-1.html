        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.3114)</p>
        <p>Published on Thursday, October 15th, 1908.</p>
        <p>Delivered by</p>
        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark.</p>
        <p>
          NOTE: This is taken from an early published edition of the original
          sermon. The version that appears in The Metropolitan Tabernacle
          Pulpit, vol.54, was edited and slightly abbreviated. For edition we
          have restored the fuller text of the earlier published edition, while
          retaining a few of the editorial refinements of the Met Tab edition.

          "Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth
          by the living creatures, with his four faces. The appearance of the
          wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they
          four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it
          were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. When they went, they went upon
          their four sides: and they turned not when they went. As for their
          rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were
          full of eyes round about them four. And when the living creatures
          went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were
          lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up." -- Ezekiel
          1:15-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          WHILE READING THE SCRIPTURES, we tried to hint at the practical
          benefits of the doctrine of Providence. We attempted to explain that
          portion of Scripture which teaches us to "take no thought for the
          morrow, for the morrow will take thought for the things of itself."
          Our blessed Lord had there uttered very precious words to drive away
          our fears, to keep us from distrust and from distress, and to enable
          us so to rely upon Providence that we may say, he that feeds the
          ravens, and clothes the lilies, will never suffer me to famish nor to
          be naked. Having shown you from our Lord's own words the practical
          benefits of the doctrine of Providence, I thought I would endeavor to
          explain that doctrine more fully this morning. I am constantly talking
          about providence in my preaching, and I thought it quite as well to
          devote a whole sermon to explain what I believe are God's great
          wonder-working processes which we call Providence. In looking for a
          text I found this, These "wheels" signify divine Providence; and I
          trust, while explaining them, I may be so assisted by God's Spirit
          that I may say many things to you concerning God's government which
          may rejoice any who are desponding, and lift up the souls of many who
          are distressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Going at once to my divisions, my first remark will be that
          PROVIDENCE IS HERE COMPARED TO A "WHEEL."
        </p>
        <p>
          When the prophet had seen the "living creatures," which I take it were
          angels, he opened his eyes again, and he saw a wonderful illustration
          of the divine Providence, and this exhibition was in the figure of a
          wheel. You must know that this is not the only place where the
          comparison is to be found; for among the classics, the Romans and the
          Greeks were accustomed to compare the wondrous works of God in
          Providence to a wheel. The story goes, that a certain king being taken
          prisoner, was bound in chains, and dragged along at the chariot wheels
          of his conqueror. As he went along, he kept looking at the wheel, and
          shedding tears -- looking at the wheel again, and lifting up his eyes
          and smiling. The conqueror turned and said, "Wherefore art thou
          looking at that wheel?" He said, "I was thinking, such is the lot of
          man; just now I was here; now I am there; but soon I may be here again
          at the top of the wheel, and thou mayest be grinding the dust." This
          was well for a heathen. The prophet had the very same idea. He was
          permitted by God to see that the wheel is a very beautiful figure of
          divine Providence. Let us show you that it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have just hinted at the reason why Providence is like a wheel;
          because sometimes one part of the wheel is at the top, and then it is
          at the bottom. Sometimes this part is exalted, and anon it sinks down
          to the dust. Then it is lifted to the air, and then again by a single
          revolution it is brought down again to the earth. Just as our poet
          sings --
        </p>
        <p>"Here he exalts neglected worms</p>
        <p>To sceptres and a crown;</p>
        <p>And there the following page he turns,</p>
        <p>And treads the monarch down."</p>
        <p>
          So it is with our life. Sometimes we are in humble poverty, and hardly
          know what we shall do for bread; anon the wheel revolves, and we are
          brought into the comfort of wealth; our feet stand in a spacious room;
          we are fed with corn and wine; we drink of a cup overflowing its brim.
          Again we are brought low through affliction and famine. A little while
          and another page is turned, and we are exalted to the heavens, and can
          sing and rejoice in the Lord our God. I have no doubt many of you here
          have experienced a far more checkered life than I have, and therefore
          you can feel that your life has been as a "wheel." Ah! man, thou art
          strong, and great, and rich; thou mayest stand now as the uppermost
          part of it; but it is a wheel, and you may yet be brought low. And
          you, poor, who are depressed and downcast, who are weeping because you
          know not where you shall lay your heads -- that wheel may revolve and
          you may be lifted up. Our own experience is never a stable thing; it
          is always changing, always turning round. The fly that sits now on the
          edge of the wheel may be crushed by its next revolution, and be
          brought to the dust of death the next day. The world may cry
          "Hosannah" to its minister to-day and the next day may say, "Crucify
          him, crucify him." Such is the state of man. Providence is like a
          wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know that, in a wheel there is one portion that never turns round,
          that stands steadfast; and that is the axle. So in God's Providence,
          there is an axle which never moves. Christian, here is a sweet thought
          for thee! Thy state is ever changing; sometimes thou art exalted, and
          sometimes depressed; yet there is an unmoving point in thy state. What
          is that axle? What is the pivot upon which all the machinery revolves?
          It is the axle of God's everlasting love toward his covenant people.
          The exterior of the wheel is changing, but the center stands forever
          fixed. Other things may move; but God's love never moves: it is the
          axle of the wheel; and this is another reason why Providence should be
          compared to a wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet further. You observe, when the wheel moves very rapidly you can
          discern nothing but the circumference -- nothing but the exterior
          circle. So, if you look back to history, and read the story of a
          thousand years, you just set the wheel of Providence revolving
          rapidly; you lose sight of all the little things that are within the
          circle; you see only one great thing, and that is, that God is working
          through the world his everlasting purposes. You sit down and take a
          book of history -- say the History of England -- and you will say of
          one event, "Now that seems to be out of place;" of another, "That
          seems to be out of time;" of another, "That seems to be adverse to the
          cause of liberty;" but look through a thousand years, and those things
          which seemed as if they would crush liberty in her germ; those things
          which seemed as if they would destroy this our commonwealth in our
          very rising, have been those which have caused the sturdy oak of
          liberty to take deeper root. Take the whole together, instead of the
          things one by one; look at a thousand years, and you will see nothing
          but one round ring of symmetry, teaching you that God is wise, and God
          is just. So let it be with you in your lives. Here you are fretting
          about troubles today. Think also of the past; put all your troubles
          together, and they are no troubles at all. You will see that one
          counteracts the other. If you take your life -- not today, but look
          back on forty years of it -- you will be obliged, instead of lamenting
          and mourning, to bless God for his mercies toward you. Let the wheel
          go round, and you will see nothing but a ring of everlasting wisdom
          revolving.
        </p>
        <p>
          I trust I have made the first part intelligible -- that the Providence
          of God is here compared to a wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. The second thought is that THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IS IN SOME
          MYSTERIOUS WAY connected WITH ANGELS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at verse 15: "Now as I beheld the living creatures." Then turn to
          the 19th verse: "And when the living creatures went, the wheels went
          by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
          the wheels were lifted up." These living creatures I believe to be
          angels; and the text teaches us that there is a connection between
          Providence and angelic agency. I do not know how to explain it; I
          cannot tell how it is; but I believe angels have a great deal to do
          with the business of this world. In times of miracles and wondrous
          things, there was an angel that came down and slew the firstborn of
          Egypt; and an angel cut off the hosts of Sennacherib. Angels did
          mighty things in those ancient days. My firm belief is, that angels
          are sent forth somehow or other to bring about the great purposes of
          God. The great wheel of Providence is turned by an angel. When there
          is some trouble which seems to stop that wheel, some mighty cherub
          puts his shoulder to it, and hurls it around, and makes the chariot of
          God's Providence still go on. Angels have much more to do with us than
          we imagine. I do not know but that spirits sometimes come down and
          whisper thoughts into our ears. I have strange thoughts sometimes,
          that seem to come from a land of dreams; and fiery visions that make
          my soul hot within me. Sometimes I have thoughts which I know come
          from God's Spirit; some which are glorious, and some that are not so
          good as those which the Spirit would have put there, but still holy
          thoughts; and I often attribute them to angels. I have sometimes a
          thought which cheers me in distress; and was not an angel sent to
          strengthen Christ in the garden? How do you think the angel
          strengthened him? Why, by putting thoughts into Christ's mind. He
          could not in any other way: he could not strengthen him by a plaster,
          or by any physical means; but by injecting thoughts. And so with us.
          There was a temptation which might have led you astray; but God said,
          "Gabriel, fly! there is a danger to one of my people; go and put such
          a thought into his soul, that when the danger comes he will say, Get
          thee behind me, Satan, I will have nothing to do with sin."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have each of us a guardian angel to attend us; and if there be any
          meaning in the passage, "In heaven their angels do always behold the
          face of my Father which is in heaven," it means that every person has
          a guardian spirit, and every Christian has some angel who flies about
          him, and holds the shield of God over his brow; keeps his foot, lest
          he should dash it against a stone; guards him, controls him, manages
          him; injects thoughts, restrains evil desires, and is the minister and
          servant of the Holy Ghost to keep us from sin, and lead us to
          righteousness. Whether I am right or wrong, I leave you to judge; but
          perhaps I have more angelology in me than most people. I know my
          imagination sometimes has been so powerful that I could almost, when I
          have been alone at night, fancy I saw an angel fly by me, and hear the
          horse-hoofs of the cherubim as they dashed along the stony road when I
          have been out preaching the word. However, I take it that the text
          teaches us that angels have very much to do with God's Providence. For
          it says, "And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them;
          and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the
          wheels were lifted up." Let us bless God that he has made angels
          ministering spirits to minister unto them that are heirs of salvation.
        </p>
        <p>III. Our third remark shall be, that PROVIDENCE IS UNIVERSAL.</p>
        <p>
          That you will see by the text: "Behold one wheel upon the earth by the
          living creatures, with his four faces." The wheel had "four faces." I
          think that means one face to the north, another to the south, another
          to the east, and another to the west. There is a face to every
          quarter. Providence is universal, looking to every quarter of the
          globe. Have you ever been in a house where there was an old picture
          hanging? I have sometimes stood in a picture-gallery, and there has
          been some old warrior: he has looked at me. If I have gone to the
          other end of the room, he has still looked at me; wherever you are in
          the room, a well-painted portrait will be looking at you. Such is the
          Providence of God; wherever you are, the eye of God will be upon you
          -- as much upon you as if there were not another person in the whole
          world. If there were only one, you might think how much God would look
          upon that one, but he looks on each one of us as if there were no
          other created being, and nothing else in the whole world. His eye is
          fixed upon us at every hour, and at every moment. Wherever we may be,
          we shall have one face of the wheel turned upon us.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot banish me from my Lord. Send me to the snows of Siberia or
          Lapland, I shall have the eyes of God there; send me to Australia, and
          let me toil at the gold diggings, there will he visit me. If you send
          me to the utmost verge of the round globe, I shall still have the eye
          of God upon me. Put me in the desert where there is not one single
          blade of grass growing, and his presence shall cheer me. Or let me go
          to sea, amid the howlings of the tempest and the shrieking wind, where
          the mad waves lift up their hands to the skies as if they would pluck
          the stars from their cloudy thrones, and I shall have the eye of God
          there. Let me sink, and let my gurgling voice be heard among the waves
          -- let my body lie down in the caverns of the sea, and the eye of God
          shall be on every bone, and in the day of the resurrection shall my
          every atom be tracked in its wanderings. Yes, the eye of God is
          everywhere; Providence is universal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there may be some here who have friends far away -- let me comfort
          them. The eye of God is looking on them. There may be some here who
          are about to part with beloved ones who are going to distant
          countries. Wherever they are, they will be as much in the keeping of
          God as though they were here. If one part of the world is not as near
          the sun's light as another, yet they are all equally near the eye of
          our God. Transport me where you please -- wherever the cloudy pillar
          of Providence shall guide me -- and I shall have God with me. That
          thought comforted the great traveler, Mungo Park, when he was in the
          desert of Sahara. He had been robbed and stripped of every thing, and
          was left naked. He suddenly saw a little piece of moss, and taking it
          up, he saw how beautiful it was. He said: "Then the hand of God is
          here -- here is one of his works; though I call loudly none can hear
          me, for there is nothing but the prowling lion and the howling jackal;
          yet God is here." That comforted him. Wherever you may be, whatever
          may be your case, God will be with you. Whatever period of your life
          you may now be in, God is with you. His eye is at the bridal and at
          the funeral; at the cradle and at the grave. In the battle, God's eye
          is looking through the smoke; in the revolution, there is God's hand
          managing the masses of men who have broken loose from their rulers. In
          the earthquake, there is Jehovah manifest; in the tempest, there is
          God's hand, tossing the bark, dashing it against the rocks, or saving
          it in his hand from the boisterous waves. In all seasons, at all
          times, in all dangers, and in all climates, there is the hand of God.
        </p>
        <p>IV. Our next remark is, that PROVIDENCE IS UNIFORM.</p>
        <p>
          It is only one Providence, and ever one. "Now as I beheld the living
          creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures,
          with his four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their work was
          like unto the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness." There
          were four wheels and four faces, yet one likeness. There was but one
          piece of machinery; and thus we are taught that Providence is all one.
          Sometimes providences seem to cross each other. One thing that God
          does seems to contradict the next thing; but it never really does so.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a great truth, though hard for us to grasp, that Providence is
          one. Just look at the case of Joseph. God has it in his mind that
          Joseph shall be governor over all the land of Egypt: how is that to be
          done? The first thing to be done is that Joseph's brethren must hate
          him. O, say you, that is a step backward. Next, Joseph's brethren must
          put him in the pit. That is another step backward, say you. No, it is
          not: wait a little. Joseph's brethren must sell him; that is another
          step backward, is it not? Providence is one, and you must not look at
          its separate parts. He is sold; he becomes a favorite: so far, so
          good. That is a step onward. Anon, he is put in a dungeon. Wait and
          see the end; all the different parts of the machinery are one. They
          appear to clash; but they never do. Put them all together. If Joseph
          had not been put in the pit, he never would have been the servant of
          Potiphar: if he never had been put in the round-house, he never would
          have interpreted the jailor's dream; and if the king had never
          dreamed, he would not have been sent for. There were a thousand
          chances, as the world has it, working together to produce the
          exaltation of Joseph. Providence is one: it never clashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh!" says one, "I cannot understand that; Providence seems to be very
          adverse to me. Mrs. Hannah More, I think it is, says, she went into a
          place where they were manufacturing a carpet. She said: "There is no
          beauty there." The man said: "It is one of the most beautiful carpets
          you ever saw." "Why, here is a piece hanging out, and it is all in
          disorder." "Do you know why, ma'am? You look at the wrong side." So it
          is very often with us. You and I think Providence is very bad, because
          we are looking at the wrong side. We do took at the wrong side while
          we are here, but when we get to heaven we shall see the right side of
          God's dealings; and when we do we shall say., "Lord, how wonderful are
          thy works: in wisdom thou hast made them all: glorious are thy works,
          and that my soul knoweth right well." You have been puzzled sometimes
          to think why that friend was brought into the grave. You have said,
          Why was I made sick at such a time? Why that trouble and that
          calamity? That is no business of yours. It is yours to believe that
          all things work together for one great purpose: that one thing never
          crosses another. But you must not expect to see it so just yet. Here
          on earth the machine appears to be broken into pieces, and we can only
          see it in confusion: but in heaven we shall see it all put together.
          Suppose I go into a place where some great artist is manufacturing a
          machine: I say, Do you mean to say this is a machine? Yes, and an
          exquisite one it will be. It does not look like it; I could not put it
          together. O, no, sir, you could not, but I can: and come and see it
          when I have put it together, and you shall see that each part fits --
          that each cog on one wheel will work on the cog of another wheel, and
          all the parts will move together when I adjust them. Do not find fault
          with it, and say, One is too small and another too large, because you
          know nothing at all about it. So, dear friends, you and I can never
          see but parts of God's ways. We only see here a wheel and there a
          wheel; but we must wait till we get to heaven, then we shall see the
          right side of the carpet; we shall see it all put together, and then
          we shall see it was one piece of machinery, had one end, one aim, one
          object, and was all one.
        </p>
        <p>
          V. The next thought is, that, in this text, PROVIDENCE IS COMPARED TO
          THE SEA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look to the 16th verse -- "The appearance of the wheels and their work
          was like unto the color of a beryl." The word beryl is commonly used
          in Scripture to denote the ocean, because it bears the greatest
          likeness to that deep green you sometimes see, and at other times the
          blue appearance of the sea. Let us transport ourselves for a moment to
          the top of some high cliff, and we look down on the noisy ocean. It
          has been the theme of a thousand songs; it has bome myriads of fleets
          on its mighty breast. Ay! and yet there it is rolling on. If you begin
          to think about the ocean, though it is one of the minor parts of God's
          works compared with the constellations of the heavens, and the globes
          which he has hung on high, you begin to be lost in the vastness of
          your conceptions concerning the greatness of God's works. And so with
          providence.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is like the ocean for another reason. The sea is never still; both
          day and night it is always moving. In the day, when the sun shines
          upon it, its waves march up in marshaled order as if about to capture
          the whole land, and drown all the solid earth. Then again they march
          back each one as if reluctant to yield its prey. It is always moving:
          the moon shines upon it, and the stars light it up; still it moves.
          Or, it is darkness, and notfiing is seen; still it moves -- by night
          and day the restless billows chant a boisterous hymn of glory, or
          murmur the solemn dirge of mariners wrecked far out in the depths.
          Such is Providence; by night or day Providence is always going on. The
          farmer sleeps, but his wheat is growing. The mariner on the sea
          sleeps, but the wind and the waves are carrying on his bark.
          Providence! thou never stoppest; thy mighty wheels never stay their
          everlasting circles. As the blue ocean has rolled on impetuously for
          ages, so shall Providence, until he who first set it in motion shall
          bid it stop; and then its wheels shall cease, forever fixed by the
          eternal decree of the mighty God.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, you will see another reason why the sea is like Providence. Man
          cannot manage it. Who can rule or govern the sea? Men cannot. Xerxes
          made chains for the Hellespont, and lashed the sea with whips because
          it washed away his boats; but what cared the sea about that? It
          laughed at him; and if he had not been too great a coward to put
          himself on its bosom, it might have swallowed him. Canute put his
          chair on the beach, and bade the waves retire. What cared they for
          him? They came and would have washed him and his chair away if he had
          not moved backward. The sea is not to be governed by man. A whole
          fleet sails over it, and it is only like a feather blown by the wind
          across the surface of a brook. All we ever put on the sea is as
          nothing. It can nevcr be restrained, nor chained, nor managed by man.
          Greedy man hath carved the land, but the sea has no landmark. It is
          impetuous; it follows its own will. So does Providence; it will not be
          managed by man. Napoleon once heard it said, that man proposes and God
          disposes. "Ah," said Napoleon, "but I propose and dispose too." How do
          you think he proposed and disposed. He proposed to go and take Russia;
          he proposed to make all Europe his. He proposed to destroy that power,
          and how did he come back again? How had he disposed it? He came back
          solitary and alone, his mighty army perished and wasted,. having
          well-nigh eaten and devoured one another through hunger. Man proposes
          and God disposes. Providence, like the sea, cannot be directed by man;
          it can be controlled by God. "It is not in man that walketh to direct
          his steps" --
        </p>
        <p>"Chained to his throne a volume lies,</p>
        <p>With all the fates of men."</p>
        <p>
          Man cannot alter it, and cannot change it. Let him try to stand
          against God's Providence; and Providence will grind and crush him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many more reasons; but I think it would be wasting time to
          notice them. I leave you to finish that part of the subject.
        </p>
        <p>VI. Again, GOD'S PROVIDENCE IS INTRICATE.</p>
        <p>
          This is our sixth remark; and that you will find is here too. "The
          appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a
          beryl; and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their
          work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel." We have just
          said that Providence is intricate. When Joseph brought his two sons up
          to Jacob's deathbed side, Jacob ordered the two boys to be brought;
          and when he was about to bless them, he guided his hands wittingly;
          and he put his right hand on the head of the youngest, and his left
          hand on the head of the eldest. "O!" said Joseph, "not so, my father."
          But he said, "it is even so;" and he gave the blessing. He would not
          give the blessing in any other way; but he crossed his hands. And so
          God usually blesses his children by crossing his hands. We say, "Do
          not deal so with me." "It is even so, child; there is a blessing on
          thy head." Do not say, Uncross thy hands; that is the way to bless the
          most of all. I wish to put thee greatest blessing upon thee; and
          therefore I have crossed my hands. Providence is wonderfully
          intricate. Ah! you want always to see through Providence, do you not?
          You never will, I assure you. You have not eyes good enough. You want
          to see what good that affliction was to you; you must believe it. You
          want to see how it can bring good to the soul; you may be enabled in a
          little time; but you cannot see it now; you must believe it. Honor God
          by trusting him. God has many gordian knots which wicked men may cut,
          and which righteous men may try to unravel, but which God alone can
          untie. We see the wicked prosper; they flourish, and great is their
          power, while the righteous are cast down. We say why? There are wheels
          within wheels. Do not fret yourselves because evil-doers are more
          prosperous. There may be a nation that seems to have right on its
          side; that nation may be crushed, and another people who are
          tyrannical may get the victory. Do not say why? Do not ask? You shall
          know the reason when you get up yonder:
        </p>
        <p>"God plants his footsteps in the sea,</p>
        <p>And rides upon the storm."</p>
        <p>
          Do not attempt to do what Gabriel never dare do -- to ask the reason
          why, for God will never give it.
        </p>
        <p>VII. PROVIDENCE IS ALWAYS CORRECT.</p>
        <p>
          I shall not detain you long over this. The prophet saw the wheels, and
          he well says, they turned not when they went, they always went
          straight forward; they never turned to the right or to the left. Such
          is God's Providence. Man marks out plans: he says, I shall build this
          tower; he gets it halfway up, and he finds he has not enough to finish
          it with; he has to pull it down, lay a smaller foundation, and build
          again. God never does so; he has a plan when he begins, and he carries
          that plan out: he lays the foundation, and always finishes the
          topstone. There are some who talk about God's changing his purpose;
          such people do not know what God is at all. How could God change? God
          must either change from a better to a worse, or from a worse to a
          better. If he change from a worse to a better, he is not perfect now;
          and if he change from what he is to something worse, he will not be
          perfect then, and he will not be God. He cannot change. It is not
          possible that God should ever change or shift in any of his purposes.
          Can he change because he has not power? Why, sirs, he could girdle
          this globe with mountains, or move the hills into the sea. Can he
          change because he has not patience enough? What, he who from his
          purpose never swerves? Shall he change because he has made a mistake?
          Shall the Most High, Jehovah, ever have an error in his mighty mind?
          To err is human. With the divine Being the whole goes on, and what he
          has ordained shall be. On the iron rock of destiny it is written, and
          it cannot be altered. God moves the wheel, and the wheel goes on; and
          though a thousand armies stand to stop it, it goes on still. "They
          turned not to the right hand not to the left when they went."
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot make out what some of you do with your comfortless gospel --
          believing that God loves you today, and hates you tomorrow -- that you
          are a child of God one day, and a child of the devil the next. I could
          not believe a gospel like that. If I were a heathen, I could believe
          it at once, because I could manufacture a god of wood and stone. I
          would have a god of mud, that I could alter with my fingers, and
          change it to any fashion. But if I once believe in a God that "was and
          is, and is to come," I know he cannot change; and I feel a constancy
          of faith, and a firmness of hope, which the cares and trials of this
          mortal life cannot destroy. He will not cast off his people whom he
          hath chosen.
        </p>
        <p>VIII. One more thought. PROVIDENCE IS AMAZING.</p>
        <p>
          We shall not dwell on this; but just show you that the text says so.
          "As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and
          their rings were full of eyes round about them four." Even the man
          that knows that every wave that dashes against the ship is washing him
          nearer home -- that every breath of wind that rises comes to his sail
          and fills it, and sends it to the white cliffs of his native Albion --
          even the man that feels that all is for him -- even he must say that
          Providence is amazing. O! that thought, it staggers thought! O! it is
          an idea that overwhelms me -- that God is working all! The sins of
          man, the wickedness of our race, the crimes of nations, the iniquities
          of kings, the cruelties of wars, the terrific scourge of pestilence --
          all these things in some mysterious way are working the will of God!
          We must not look at it; we cannot look at it. I cannot explain it. I
          cannot tell you where human will and free agency unite with God's
          sovereignty and with his unfailing decrees. This has been the place
          where intellectual gladiators have fought with each other ever since
          the time of Adam. Some have said, Man does as he likes; and others
          have said, God does as he pleases. In one sense, they are both true;
          but there is no man that has brains or understanding enough to show
          where they meet. We cannot tell how it is that I do just as I please
          as to which street I shall go home by; and yet I cannot go home but
          through a certain road. John Newton used to say, there were two
          streets to go to St. Mary Woolnoth; but Providence directed him as to
          which he should use. Last Sabbathday I came down a certain street I do
          not know why -- and there was a young man who wished to speak to me;
          he wished to see me many times before. I say that was God's Providence
          -- that I might meet that young man. Here was Providence, and yet
          there was my choice; how, I cannot tell. I cannot comprehend it. I
          believe that every particle of dust that dances in the sunbeam does
          not move an atom more or less than God wishes -- that every particle
          of spray that dashes against the steamboat has its orbit as well as
          the sun in the heavens -- that the chaff from the hand of the winnower
          is steered as the stars in their courses. The creeping of an aphis
          over the rosebud is as much fixed as the march of the devastating
          pestilence -- the fall of sere leaves from a poplar is as fully
          ordained as the tumbling of an avalanche. He that believes in a God
          must believe this truth. There is no standing-point between this and
          atheism. There is no half way between a mighty God that worketh all
          things by the sovereign counsel of his will and no God at all. A God
          that cannot do as he pleases -- a God whose will is frustrated, is not
          a God, and cannot be a God. I could not believe in such a God as that.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX. Our last and closing idea is, that PROVIDENCE IS FULL OF WISDOM.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will see this by the last part of the 18th verse -- "And their
          rings were full of eyes round about them four." You will say this
          morning, Our minister is a fatalist. Your minister is no such thing.
          Some will say, Ah! he believes in fate. He does not believe in fate at
          all. What is fate? Fate is this -- Whatever is, must be. But there is
          a difference between that and Providence. Providence says, Whatever
          God ordains must be; but the wisdom of God never ordains any thing
          without a purpose. Every thing in this world is working for some one
          great end. Fate does not say that. Fate simply says that the thing
          must be; Providence says, God moves the wheels along, and there they
          are. If any thing would go wrong, God puts it right; and if there is
          any thing that would move awry, he puts his hand and alters it. It
          comes to the same thing; but there is a difference as to the object.
          There is all the difference between fate and Providence that there is
          between a man with good eyes and a blind man. Fate is a blind thing;
          it is the avalanche crushing the village down below and destroying
          thousands. Providence is not an avalanche; it is a rolling river,
          rippling at the first like a rill down the sides of the mountain,
          followed by minor streams, till it rolls in the broad ocean of
          everlasting love, working for the good of the human race. The doctrine
          of Providence is not, that what is, must be; but that, what is, works
          together for the good of our race, and especially for the good of the
          chosen people of God. The wheels are full of eyes; not blind wheels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us close with the thought, that there is the greatest wisdom in
          the workings of Providence. Now you were in great distress probably,
          and you could not see why. The next time you are in distress, you must
          say, The wheels are full of eyes: I have but two eyes; but God's
          wheels are full of eyes -- God can see every thing; I can only see one
          thing at a time. I see it looks good for me now; I do not know what it
          will be tomorrow. I see what the plant is now; I do not know what it
          will be tomorrow. I see what the plant is now; I do not know what it
          will be tomorrow. I know not what kind of flower that herb will yield.
          This affliction is a cassava root, full of poison, and would soon
          destroy me; but God can put that in the oven, so that all the poison
          shall evaporate, and it shall become food for me to live upon. This
          trouble of mine seems to me to be destructive: God shall get all the
          destroying power out of it, and it shall be made food. Now, thou tried
          one, groaning down in the valley, up with thine heart; away with thy
          tears; put thy hand on thy breast, and make thy heart stop its hard
          beating -- thou poor soul! dash the cup of misery from thine hand;
          thou art not condemned; thou art a pardoned Christian. Remember that
          God hath said, "All things work together for good" -- more still, they
          "work together for good to them that love God, even to them that are
          called according to his purpose." O! how I would like to make your
          hearts like flint and steel against trouble! We cannot bear the winds
          of trouble; we are soon cast down and broken-hearted. When we are in
          prosperity, we are giants; we think we can do like Samson; we can take
          hold of the two pillars of trouble and distress, and we can pull them
          down. But once tell us that the Philistines will be upon us, and we
          have no power.
        </p>
        <p>
          He who has faith is better than the stoic. The stoical philosopher
          bore it, because he believed it must be; the Christian bears it
          because he believes it is working for his good. Next time trouble
          comes, disease comes, pestilence comes, smile at it, and say:
        </p>
        <p>"He that has made his refuge God,</p>
        <p>Shall find a most secure abode;</p>
        <p>Shall walk all day beneath his shade,</p>
        <p>And there at night shall rest his head."</p>
        <p>
          Let this be thy shield to keep off the thrusts of distress, let this
          be thy high rock against all the winds of sorrow. Sing,
        </p>
        <p>"Though the way may be rough, it cannot be long,</p>
        <p>So smooth it with hope, and cheer it with song."</p>
        <p>Psalm 103</p>
        <p>
          Verse 1. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
          his holy name.1
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, my heart, be down in the dumps no longer, take thy harp from the
          willows, tune its strings, and begin to pour forth its music to the
          praise of love divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          2-4. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: who
          forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases; who
          redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
          lovingkindness and tender mercies;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a better crown than any emperor ever wore, unless he also was
          a child of God. Priceless gems and jewels rare adorn this wondrous
          coronet; "who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies."
        </p>
        <p>
          5-9. Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; is that thy youth is
          renewed like the eagle's. The LORD executeth righteousness and
          judgment for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto
          Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. The LORD is merciful and
          gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not always
          chide.2
        </p>
        <p>
          Art thou suffering his chidings just now? They are good for thee, but
          they will not last for ever: "He will not always chide:" --
        </p>
        <p>
          9, 10. Neither will he keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with
          us after our sins; --
        </p>
        <p>
          It is all of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed: "He hath not
          dealt with us after our sins;" --
        </p>
        <p>
          10-12. Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven
          is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear
          him. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
          transgressions from us.3
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, surely, he will also remove our troubles from us; but if not, as
          he has removed our transgressions so far away that they can never be
          brought back again, we have real cause for joy whatever happens to us
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
          that fear him.4

          The very best of them are only objects of pity. Though they are the
          best, they need that he should look down upon them with infinite
          compassion.

          14-19. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. As
          for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he
          flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the
          place thereof shall know it no more. But the mercy of the LORD is from
          everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his
          righteousness unto children's children; to such as keep his covenant,
          and to those that remember his commandments to do them. The LORD hath
          prepared his throne in the heaven; and his kingdom ruleth over all.

          What a comfort this is for us! Over the great as well as over the
          little, over all parts of the earth, as well where war rageth as where
          peace reigneth "his kingdom ruleth over all." Nothing happeneth
          without his permission, even the little things of life are ordered by
          him; the foreknown station of a rush by the riverside is as fixed as
          the place of a king, and the chaff from the hand of the winnower is
          steered as surely as the stars in their courses; for, to God, nothing
          is little and nothing is great.

          20, 21. Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
          his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the
          LORD, all ye his hosts;" --
        </p>
        <p>
          Let all the armies of heaven break forth into one song: "Bless ye the
          LORD, all ye his hosts;" --

          21.22. Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. Bless the LORD, all
          his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
