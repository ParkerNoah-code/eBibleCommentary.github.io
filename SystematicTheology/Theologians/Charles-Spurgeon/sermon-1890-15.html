          Whosoever, therefore, has not been lawfully married, or has been
          united without the dotal title (dotali titulo) and the blessing of a
          priest, cannot by any means bring a charge against priests, or those
          who are lawfully married, or bear witness against them, since every
          one who is polluted with the stain of incest is infamous, and is not
          allowed to accuse the above-named. And consequently not only they, but
          all those too who agree with them, are to be rejected, and are
          rendered infamous. We hold that the same should also be the case with
          robbers, or with those who assault the elderly. The laws of the world,
          indeed, put such persons to death; but we, with whom mercy has the
          first place, receive them under the mark of infamy to repentance. That
          infamy also with which they are stained, we are not able to remove;
          but our desire is to heal their souls by public penitence, and by
          satisfaction made to the Church: for public sins are not to be purged
          by secret correction. Those, again, who are suspected in the matter of
          the right faith, should by no means be admitted to prefer charges
          against priests, and against those of whose faith there is no doubt;
          and such persons should be held of doubtful authority in matters of
          human testimony. Their voice, consequently, should be reckoned invalid
          whose faith is doubted; and no credit should be given to those who are
          ignorant of the right faith. Accordingly, in judgment, inquiry should
          be made as to the conversation and faith of the person who accuses,
          and of him who is accused; since those who are not of correct
          conversation and faith, and whose life is open to impeachment, are not
          allowed to accuse their elders, neither can such permission be given
          to those whose faith and life and liberty are unknown. Nor should vile
          persons be admitted to accuse them. But a clear examination is to be
          made as to what kind of persons the accusers are (rimandæ sunt
          enucleatim personæ accusatorum); for they are not to be admitted
          readily without writing, and are never to be admitted as accusers on
          mere writing. For no one may either accuse or be accused by mere
          writing, but with the living voice; and every one must lay his
          accusation in the presence of him whom he seeks to accuse. And no
          credit should be given to any accuser in the absence of him whom he
          seeks to accuse. In like manner, witnesses must not prefer their
          evidence by writing only; but they must give their testimony
          truthfully in their own persons, and in matters which they have seen
          and do know. And they are not to give evidence in any other cases or
          matters but in those which are known to have happened in their
          presence. Accusers, moreover, of one blood, are not to bear witness
          against those who are not related to the family, nor is that to be the
          case with domestics (familiares) or those proceeding from the house;
          but if it is their wish, and they agree among themselves, the parents
          only should give evidence in such cases, and not others. Neither
          accusers nor witnesses should be admitted who are open to any
          suspicion; for the feeling of relationship, or friendship, or
          lordship, is wont to impede the truth. Carnal love, and fear, and
          avarice, commonly blunt the perceptions of men, and pervert their
          opinions; so that they look on gain as godliness, and on money as the
          reward of prudence. Let no one, then, speak deceitfully to his
          neighbour. The mouth of the malevolent is a deep pit. The innocent
          man, while he believes easily, falls readily; but though he falls, he
          rises; and the shuffler, with all his arts, goes headlong to ruin,
          whence he can never rise or escape. Therefore let every one weigh well
          his words, and let him not say to another what he would not say to
          himself. Whence the sacred Scripture says well: |Do not that to
          another which thou wouldest not have done to thyself.| For we need
          time to do anything perfectly (maturius); and let us not be
          precipitate in our counsels or our works, neither let us violate
          order. But if any one has fallen in anything, let us not consign him
          to ruin; but let us reprove him with brotherly affection, as the
          blessed apostle says: |If a man be overtaken in any fault, ye which
          are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
          considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's
          burden, and so will ye fulfil the law of Christ.| Furthermore, the
          sainted David had deadly crimes to repent of, and yet he was continued
          in honour. The blessed Peter also shed the bitterest tears when he
          repented of having denied the Lord; but still he abode an apostle. And
          the Lord by the prophet makes this promise to the sinning: |In the day
          that the sinner is converted, and repenteth, I will not mention any
          more against him all his transgressions.|
