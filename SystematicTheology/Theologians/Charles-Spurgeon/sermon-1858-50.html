        <p>A Sermon</p>
        <p>(No.214)</p>
        <p>Delivered on Sabbath Morning, September 19, 1858, by the</p>
        <p>REV. C.H. SPURGEON</p>
        <p>at the Music Hall, Royal Surrey Gardens</p>
        <p>"His name shall be called Wonderful." -- Isaiah 9:6.</p>
        <p>
          ONE EVENING LAST WEEK I stood by the sea-shore when the storm was
          raging. The voice of the Lord was upon the waters; and who was I that
          I should tarry within doors, when my Master's voice was heard sounding
          along the water? I rose and stood to behold the flash of his
          lightnings, and listen to the glory of his thunders. The sea and the
          thunders were contesting with one another; the sea with infinite
          clamor striving to hush the deep-throated thunder, so that his voice
          should not be heard; yet over and above the roar of the billows might
          be heard that voice of God, as he spoke with flames of fire, and
          divided the way for the waters. It was a dark night, and the sky was
          covered with thick clouds, and scarce a star could be seen through the
          rifts of the tempest; but at one particular time, I noticed far away
          on the horizon, as if miles across the water, a bright shining, like
          gold. It was the moon hidden behind the clouds, so that she could not
          shine upon us; but she was able to send her rays down upon the waters,
          far away, where no cloud happened to intervene. I thought as I read
          this chapter last evening, that the prophet seemed to have stood in a
          like position, when he wrote the words of my text. All round about him
          were clouds of darkness; he heard prophetic thunders roaring, and he
          saw flashes of the lightnings of divine vengeance; clouds and
          darkness, for many a league, were scattered through history; but he
          saw far away a bright spot -- one place where the clear shining came
          down from heaven. And he sat down, and he penned these words: "The
          people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
          dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
          shined;" and though he looked through whole leagues of space, where he
          saw the battle of the warrior "with confused noise and garments rolled
          in blood," yet he fixed his eye upon one bright spot in futurity, and
          he declared, that there he saw hope of peace, prosperity and
          blessedness; for said he, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
          given: and the government shad be upon his shoulder: and his name
          shall be called Wonderful."
        </p>
        <p>
          My dear friends, we live to-day upon the verge of that bright spot.
          The world has been passing through these clouds of darkness, and the
          light is gleaming on us now, like the glintings of the first rays of
          morning. We are coming to a brighter day, and "at evening time it
          shall be light." The clouds and darkness shall be rolled up as a
          mantle that God needs no longer, and he shall appear in his glory, and
          his people shall rejoice with him. But you must mark, that all the
          brightness was the result of this child born, this son given, whose
          name is called Wonderful; and if we can discern any brightness in our
          own hearts, or in the world's history, it can come from nowhere else,
          than from the one who is called "Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty
          God."
        </p>
        <p>
          The person spoken of in our text, is undoubtedly the Lord Jesus
          Christ. He is a child born, with reference to his human nature; he is
          born of the virgin, a child. But he is a son given, with reference to
          his divine nature, being given as well as born. Of course. the Godhead
          could not be born of woman. That was from everlasting, and is to
          everlasting. As a child he was born, as a son he was given. "The
          government is upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called
          Wonderful." Beloved, there are a thousand things in this world, that
          are called by names that do not belong to them; but in entering upon
          my text, I must announce at the very opening, that Christ is called
          Wonderful, because he is so. God the Father never gave his Son a name
          which he did not deserve. There is no panegyric here, no flattery. It
          is just the simple name that he deserves, they that know him best will
          say that the word doth not overstrain his merits, but rather falleth
          infinitely short of his glorious deserving. His name is called
          Wonderful. And mark, it does not merely say, that God has given him
          the name of Wonderful -- though that is implied; but "his name shall
          be called" so. It shall be; it is at this time called Wonderful by all
          his believing people, and it shall be. As long as the moon endureth,
          there shall be found men, and angels, and glorified spirits, who shall
          always call him by his right name. "His name shall be called
          Wonderful."
        </p>
        <p>
          I find that this name may bear two or three interpretations. The word
          is sometimes in Scripture translated "marvellous." Jesus Christ may be
          called marvellous; and a learned German interpreter says, that without
          doubt, the meaning of miraculous is also wrapt up in it. Christ is the
          marvel of marvels, the miracle of miracles. "His name shall be called
          Miraculous," for he is more than a man, he is God's highest miracle.
          "Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh." It
          may also mean separated, or distinguished. And Jesus Christ may well
          be called this; for as Saul was distinguished from all men, being head
          and shoulders taller than they, so is Christ distinguished above all
          men; he is anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, and in
          his character, and in his acts he is infinitely separated from all
          comparison with any of the sons of men. "Thou art fairer than the
          children of men; grace is poured into thy lips." He is "the chief
          among ten thousand and altogether lovely." "His name shall be called
          the Separated One," the distinguished one, the noble one, set apart
          from the common race of mankind.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall, however, this morning, keep to the old version, and simply
          read it thus, "His name shall be called Wonderful." And first I shall
          notice that Jesus Christ deserveth to be called Wonderful for what he
          was in the past; secondly, that he is called Wonderful by all his
          people for what he is in the present; and in the third place, that he
          shall be called Wonderful, for what he shall be in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. First, Christ shall be called Wonderful for WHAT HE WAS IN THE
          PAST. Gather up your thoughts, my brethren. for a moment, and center
          them all on Christ, and you will soon see how wonderful he is.
          Consider his eternal existence, "begotten of his Father from before
          all worlds," being of the same substance with his Father: begotten,
          not made, co-equal, co-eternal, in every attribute, "very God of very
          God." For a moment remember that he who became an infant of a span
          long, was no less than the King of ages, the everlasting Father, who
          was from eternity. and is to be to all eternity. The divine nature of
          Christ is indeed wonderful. Just think for a moment, how much interest
          clusters round the life of an old man. Those of us who are but as
          children in years, look up to him with wonder and astonishment, as he
          tells us the varied stories of the experience through which he has
          passed; but what is the life of an aged man -- how brief it appears
          when compared with the life of the tree that shelters him. It existed
          long before that old man's father crept a helpless infant into the
          world. How many storms have swept over its brow! how many kings have
          come and gone! how many empires have risen and fallen since that old
          oak was slumbering in its acorn cradle! But what is the life of the
          tree compared with the soil on which it grows? What a wonderful story
          that soil might tell! What changes it has passed through in all the
          eras of time that have elapsed since "in the beginning God created the
          heavens and the earth." There is a wonderful story connected with
          every atom of black mould which furnishes the nourishment of the oak.
          But whilst is the history of that soil compared with the marvellous
          history of the rock on which it rests -- the cliff on which it lifts
          its head. Oh! what stories might it tell, what records lie hidden in
          its bowels. Perhaps it could tell the story of the time when "the
          earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the
          earth." Perhaps it might speak and tell us of those days when the
          morning and the evening were the first day, and the morning and the
          evening were the second day, and could explain to us the mysteries of
          how God made this marvellous piece of miracle, -- the world. But what
          is the history of the cliff, compared with that of the sea that rolls
          at its base -- that deep blue ocean, over which a thousand navies have
          swept, without leaving a furrow Upon its brow! But what is the history
          of the sea, compared with the history of the heavens that are
          stretched like a curtain over that vast basin! What a history is that
          of the hosts of heaven -- of the everlasting marches of the sun, moon,
          and stars! Who can tell their generation, or who can write their
          biography? But what is the history of the heavens, compared with the
          history of the angels? They could tell you of the day when they saw
          this world wrapped in swaddling bands of mist -- when, like a newborn
          infant, the last of God's offspring, it came forth from him, and the
          morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy. But
          what is the history of the angels that excel in strength, compared
          with the history of the Lord Jesus Christ? The angel is but of
          yesterday, and he knoweth nothing; Christ, the Eternal One, chargeth
          even his angels with folly, and looks upon them as his ministering
          spirits, that come and go at his good pleasure. Oh, Christians, gather
          with reverence and mysterious awe around the throne of him who is your
          great Redeemer; for "his name is called Wonderful," since he has
          existed before all things, and "by him all things were made; and
          without him was not anything made that was made."
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, again, the incarnation of Christ, and you will rightly say,
          that his name deserveth to be called "Wonderful." Oh! what is that I
          see? Oh! world of wonders, what is that I see? The Eternal of ages,
          whose hair is white like wool, as white as snow, becomes an infant.
          Can it be? Ye angels, are ye not astonished? He becomes an infant,
          hangs at a virgin's breast, draws his nourishment from the breast of
          woman. Oh wonder of wonders! Manger of Bethlehem, thou hast miracles
          poured into thee. This is a sight that surpasses all others. Talk ye
          of the sun, moon, and stars; consider ye the heavens, the work of
          God's fingers, the moon and the stars that he hath ordained; but all
          the wonders of the universe shrink into nothing, when we come to the
          mystery of the incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was a
          marvellous thing when Joshua bade the sun to stand still, but more
          marvellous when God seemed to stand still, and no longer to move
          forward, but rather, like the sun upon the dial of Ahaz, did go back
          ten degrees, and veil his splendor in a cloud. There have been sights
          matchless and wonderful, at which we might look for years, and yet
          turn away and say, "I cannot understand this; here is a deep into
          which I dare not dive; my thoughts are drowned; this is a steep
          without a summit; I cannot climb it; it is high, I cannot attain it!"
          But all these things are as nothing, compared with the incarnation of
          the Son of God. I do believe that the very angels have never wondered
          but once and that has been incessantly ever since they first beheld
          it. They never cease to tell the astonishing story, and to tell it
          with increasing astonishment too, that Jesus Christ. the Son of God,
          was born of the Virgin Mary, and became a man. Is he not rightly
          called Wonderful? Infinite, and an infant -- eternal, and yet born of
          a woman -- Almighty, and yet hanging on a woman's breast supporting
          the universe, and yet needing to be carried in a mother's arms -- king
          of angels, and yet the reputed son of Joseph -- heir of all things and
          yet the carpenter's despised son. Wonderful art thou O Jesus, and that
          shall be thy name for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          But trace the Saviours course, and all the way he is wonderful. Is it
          not marvellous that he submitted to the taunts and jeers of his
          enemies -- that for a long life he should allow the bulls of Bashan to
          gird him round, and the dogs to encompass him? Is it not surprising
          that he should have bridled in his anger when blasphemy was uttered
          against his sacred person? Had you or I been possessed of his
          matchless might, we should have dashed our enemies down the brow of
          the hill, if they had sought to cast us there; we should never have
          submitted to shame and spitting; no, we would have looked upon them,
          and with one fierce look of wrath, have dashed their spirits into
          eternal torment. But he hears it all -- keeps in his noble spirit --
          the lion of the tribe of Judah, but bearing still the lamb-like
          character of
        </p>
        <p>"The humble man before his foes,</p>
        <p>A weary man, and full of woes."</p>
        <p>
          I do believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the king of heaven, and yet he
          was a poor, despised, persecuted, slandered man; but while I believe
          it I never can understand it. I bless him for it; I love him for it; I
          desire to praise his name while immortality endures for his infinite
          condescension in thus suffering for me; but to understand it, I can
          never pretend. His name must all his life long be called Wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
          But see him die. Come O my brothers, ye children of God, and gather
          round the cross. See your Master. There he hangs. Can you understand
          this riddle: God was manifest in the flesh, and crucified of men? My
          Master, I cannot understand how thou couldst stoop thine awful head to
          such a death as this -- how then couldst take from thy brow the
          coronet of stars which from old eternity had shone resplendent there;
          but how thou shouldest permit the thorn-crown to gird the temples
          astonishes me far more. That thou shouldest cast away the mantle of
          thy glory, the azure of thine everlasting empire, I cannot comprehend;
          but how thou shouldest have become veiled in the ignominious purple
          for awhile, and then be bowed to by impious men, who mocked thee as a
          pretended king, and how thou shouldest be stripped naked to thy shame,
          without a single covering, this is still more incomprehensible. Truly
          thy name is Wonderful. Oh thy love to me is wonderful, passing the
          love of woman. Was ever grief like thine? Was ever love like thine,
          that could open the flood gates of such grief. Thy grief is like a
          river; but was there ever spring that poured out such a torrent? Was
          ever love so mighty as to become the fount from which such an ocean of
          grief could come rolling down? Here is matchless love -- matchless
          love to make him suffer, matchless power to enable him to endure all
          the weight of his Father's wrath. Here is matchless justice, that he
          himself should acquiesce in his Father's will, and not allow men to be
          saved without his own sufferings; and here is matchless mercy to the
          chief of sinners, that Christ should suffer even for them. "His name
          shall be called Wonderful."
        </p>
        <p>
          But he died. He died! See Salem's daughters weep around. Joseph of
          Arimathea takes up the lifeless body after it has been taken down from
          the cross. They bear it away to the sepulcher. It is put in a garden.
          Do you can him Wonderful now?
        </p>
        <p>"Is this the Saviour long foretold</p>
        <p>To usher in the age of gold?"</p>
        <p>
          And is he dead? Lift his hands! They drop motionless by his side. His
          foot exhibits still the nail-print; but there is no mark of life.
          "Aha," cries the Jew, "is this the Messiah? He is dead; he shall see
          corruption in a little space of time. Oh! watchman, keep good ward
          lest his disciples steal his body. His body can never come forth,
          unless they do steal it; for he is dead. Is this the Wonderful the
          Counsellor?" But God did not leave his soul in Hades; nor did he
          suffer his body -- "his holy one" -- to see corruption? Yes, he is
          wonderful, even in his death. That clay-cold corpse is wonderful.
          Perhaps this is the greatest wonder of all, that he who is "Death of
          death and hell's destruction" should for awhile endure the bonds of
          death. But here is the wonder. He could not be holden of those bonds.
          Those chains which have held ten thousand of the sons and daughters of
          Adam, and which have never been broken yet by any man of human mould,
          save by a miracle, were but to him as green withes. Death bound our
          Samson fast and said, "I have him now, I have taken away the locks of
          his strength; his glory is departed, and now he is mine; but the hands
          that kept the human race in chains were nothing to the Saviour; the
          third day he burst them, and he rose again from the dead, from
          henceforth to die no more. Oh! thou risen Saviour -- thou who couldst
          not see corruption -- thou art wonderful in thy resurrection. And thou
          art wonderful too in thine ascension -- as I see thee leading
          captivity captive and receiving gifts for men. "His name shall be
          called Wonderful."
        </p>
        <p>
          Pause here one moment, and let us think -- Christ is surpassingly
          wonderful. The little story I have told you just now -- not little in
          itself, but little as I have told it -- has in it something
          surpassingly wonderful. All the wonders that you ever saw are nothing
          compared with this. As we have passed through various countries we
          have seen a wonder, and some older traveler than ourselves has said,
          "Yes this is wonderful to you. but I could show you something that
          utterly eclipses that." Though we have seen some splendid landscapes,
          with glorious hills, and we have climbed up where the eagle seemed to
          knit the mountain and the sky together in his flight, and we have
          stood and looked down, and said, "How wonderful!" Saith he, "I have
          seen fairer lands than these, and wider and richer prospects far." But
          when we speak of Christ, none can say they ever saw a greater wonder
          than he is. You have come now to the very summit of everything that
          may be wondered at. There are no mysteries equal to this mystery,
          there is no surprise equal to this surprise; there is no astonishment,
          no admiration that should equal the astonishment and admiration that
          we feel when we behold Christ in the glories of the past. He surpasses
          everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet again. Wonder is a short-lived emotion; you know, it is
          proverbial that a wonder grows gray-headed in nine days. The longest
          period that a wonder is found to last is about that time. It is such a
          short-lived thing. But Christ is and ever shall be wonderful. You may
          think of him through three-score years and ten, but you shall wonder
          at him more at the end than at the beginning. Abraham might wonder at
          him, when he saw his day in the distant future; but I do mat think
          that even Abraham himself could wonder at Christ so much as the very
          least in the kingdom of heaven of to-day wonders at him, seeing that
          we know more than Abraham, and therefore wonder more. Think again for
          one moment, and you will say of Christ that he deserves to be called
          Wonderful, not only because he is always wonderful, and because he is
          surpassingly wonderful, but also because he is altogether wonderful.
          There have been some great feats of skill in the arts and sciences;
          for instance, if we take a common wonder of the day, the telegraph --
          how much there is about that which is wonderful! But there are a great
          many things in the telegraph that we can understand. Though there are
          many mysteries in it, still there are parts of it that are like keys
          to the mysteries, so that if we cannot solve the riddle wholly, yet it
          is disrobed of some of the low garments of its mystery. But now if you
          look at Christ anyhow, anywhere, anyway, he is all mystery, he is
          altogether wonderful, always to be looked at and always to be admired.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, he is universally wondered at. They tell us that the
          religion of Christ is very good for old women. I was once complimented
          by a person, who told me he believed my preaching would be extremely
          suitable for blacks -- for negroes. He did not intend it as a
          compliment, but I replied, "Well sir, if it is suitable for blacks I
          should think it would be very suitable for whites; for there is only a
          little difference of skin, and I do not preach to people's skins, but
          to their hearts." Now, of Christ we can say that he is universally a
          wonder, the strongest intellects have wonderful at him. Our Lockes and
          our Newtons have felt themselves to be as little children when they
          have come to the foot of the cross. The wonder has not been confined
          to ladies, to children, to old women and dying men, the highest
          intellects, and the lustiest minds have all wondered at Christ. I am
          sure it is a difficult task to make some people wonder. Hard thinkers
          and close mathematicians are not easily brought to wonder: but such
          men have covered their faces with their hands and cast themselves in
          the dust, and confessed that they have been lost in wonder and
          amazement. Well then may Christ be called Wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
          II. "His name shall be called Wonderful." He is wonderful for WHAT HE
          IS IN THE PRESENT. And here I will not diverge, but will just appeal
          to you personally. Is he wonderful to you? Let me tell the story of my
          own wonderment at Christ, and in telling it, I shall be telling the
          experience of all God's children. There was a time when I wondered not
          at Christ. I heard of his beauties, but I had never seen them; I heard
          of his power, but it was nought to me; it was but news of something
          done in a far country -- I had no connection with it, and therefore I
          observed it not. But once upon a time, there came one to my house of a
          black and terrible aspect. He smote the door; I tried to bolt it -- to
          hold it fast. He smote again and again, till at last he entered, and
          with a rough voice he summoned me before him; and he said, "I have a
          message from God for thee; thou art condemned on account of thy sins."
          I looked at him with astonishment; I asked him his name. He said, "My
          name is the Law." and I fell at his feet as one that was dead. "I was
          alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin
          revived, and I died." As I lay there, he smote me. He smote me till
          every rib seemed as if it must break, and the bowels be poured forth.
          My heart was melted like wax within me; I seemed to be stretched upon
          a rack -- to be pinched with hot irons -- to be beaten with whips of
          burning wire. A misery extreme dwelt and reigned in my heart. I dared
          not lift up mine eyes, but I thought within myself, "There may be
          hope, there may be mercy for me. Perhaps the God whom I have offended
          may accept my tears and my promises of amendment, and I may live." But
          when that thought crossed me, heavier were the blows and more poignant
          my sufferings than before, till hope entirely failed me, and I had
          nought wherein to trust. Darkness black and dense gathered round me; I
          heard a voice as it were, of rushing to and fro, and of wailing and
          gnashing of teeth. I said within my soul, "I am cast out from his
          sight, I am utterly abhorred of God, he hath trampled me in the mire
          of the streets in his anger." And there came one by, of sorrowful but
          of loving aspect, and he stooped over me, and he said, "Awake thou
          that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
          light." I arose in astonishment, and he took me, and he led me to a
          place where stood a cross, and he seemed to vanish from my sight. But
          he appeared again hanging there. I looked upon him as he bled upon
          that tree. His eyes darted a glance of love unutterable into my
          spirit, and in a moment, looking at him, the bruises that my soul had
          suffered were healed; the gaping wounds were cured; the broken bones
          rejoiced; the rags that had covered me were all removed; my spirit was
          white as the spotless snows of the far-off north; I had melody within
          my spirit, for I was saved, washed, cleansed, forgiven, through him
          that did hang upon the tree. Oh, how I wondered that I should be
          pardoned! It was not the pardon that I wondered at so much; the wonder
          was that it should come to me. I wondered that he should be able to
          pardon such sins as mine; such crimes, so numerous and so black, and
          that after such an accusing conscience he should have power to still
          every wave within my spirit, and make my soul like the surface of a
          river, undisturbed, quiet, and at ease. His name then to my spirit was
          Wonderful. But, brethren and sisters, if you have felt this, you can
          say you thought him wonderful then -- if you are feeling it, a sense
          of adoring wonder enraptures your heart even now.
        </p>
        <p>
          And has he not been wonderful to you since that auspicious hour, when
          first you heard Mercy's voice spoken to you? How often have you been
          in sadness, sickness, and sorrow! But your pain has been light, for
          Jesus Christ has been with you on your sick-beds; your care has been
          no care at all, for you have been able to cast your burden upon him.
          The trial which threatened to crush you, rather lifted you up to
          heaven, and you have said "How wonderful that Jesus Christ's name
          should give me such comfort, such joy, such peace, such confidence."
          Various things bring to my recollection a period now removed by the
          space of nearly two years. Never shall we forget, beloved, the
          judgments of the Lord, when by terrible things in righteousness he
          answered our prayer that he would give us success in this house. We
          cannot forget how the people were scattered -- how some of the sheep
          were slain, and the shepherd himself was smitten. I may not have told
          in your hearing the story of my own woe. Perhaps never soul went so
          near the burning furnace of insanity, and yet came away unharmed. I
          have walked by that fire until these locks seemed to be crisp with the
          heat thereof. My brain was racked. I dared not look up to God, and
          prayer that was once my solace, was cause of my affright and terror,
          if I attempted it. I shall never forget the time when I first became
          restored to myself. It was in the garden of a friend. I was walking
          solitary and alone, musing upon my misery, much cheered as that was by
          the kindness of my loving friend, yet far too heavy for my soul to
          bear, when on a sudden the name of Jesus flashed through my mind. The
          person of Christ seemed visible to me. I stood still. The burning lava
          of my soul was cooled. My agonies were hushed. I bowed myself there,
          and the garden that had seemed a Gethsemane became to me a Paradise.
          And then it seemed so strange to me, that nought should have brought
          me back but that name of Jesus. I thought indeed at that time that I
          should love him better all the days of my life. But there were two
          things I wondered at. I wondered that he should be so good to me, and
          I wondered more that I should have been so ungrateful to him. But his
          name has been from that time "Wonderful" to me, and I must record what
          he has done for my soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, brothers and sisters, you shall all find, every day of your
          life, whatever your trials and troubles, that he shall always be made
          the more wonderful by them. He sends your troubles to be like a black
          foil, to make the diamond of his name shine the brighter. You would
          never know the wonders of God if it were not that you find them out in
          the furnace. "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business
          in great waters, these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in
          the deep," and we shall never see the wonders of God except in that
          deep; we must go into the deeps before we know how wonderful his power
          and his might to save.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must not leave this point without one more remark. There have been
          times when you and I have said of Christ, "His name is wonderful
          indeed, for we have been by it transported entirely above the world,
          and carried upward to the very gates of heaven itself." I pity you,
          beloved, if you do not understand the rhapsody I am about to use.
          There are moments when the Christian feels the charms of earth all
          broken, and his wings are loosed, and he begins to fly; and up he
          soars, till he forgets earth's sorrows and leaves them far behind, and
          up he goes till he forgets earth's joys, and leaves them like the
          mountain tops far below, as when the eagle flies to meet the sun; and
          up, up, up he goes, with his Saviour full before him almost in vision
          beatific. His heart is full of Christ; his soul beholds his Saviour,
          and the cloud that darkened his view of the Saviour's face seems to be
          dispersed. At such a time the Christian can sympathise with Paul. He
          says, "Whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell -- God
          knoweth!" but I am, as it were, "caught up to the third heaven." And
          how is this rapture produced? By the music of flute, harp, sackbut,
          psaltery, and all kinds of instruments? No. How then? By riches? By
          fame? By wealth? Ah, no. By a strong mind? By a lively disposition?
          No. By the name of Jesus. That one name is all sufficient to lead the
          Christian into heights of transport that verge upon the region where
          the angels fly in cloudless day.
        </p>
        <p>
          III. I have no more time to stay upon this point, although the text is
          infinite, and one might preach upon it for ever. I have only to notice
          that his name shall be called Wonderful IN THE FUTURE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day is come, the day of wrath, the day of fire. The ages are
          ended; the last century, like the last pillar of a dilapidated temple,
          has crumbled to its fall. The clock of time is verging to its last
          hour. It is on the stroke. The time is come when the things that are
          made must disappear. Lo, I see earth's bowels moving. A thousand
          hillocks give up the slumbering dead. The battle fields are clothed no
          more with the rich harvests that have been manured with blood; but a
          new harvest has sprung up. The fields are thick with men. The sea
          itself becomes a prolific mother, and though she hath swallowed men
          alive, she gives them up again, and they stand before God, an
          exceeding great army. Sinners! ye have risen from your tombs; the
          pillars of heaven are reeling; the sky is moving to and fro; the sun,
          the eye of this great world, is rolling like a maniac's, and glaring
          with dismay. The moon that long has cheered the night now makes the
          darkness terrible, for she is turned into a clot of blood. Portents,
          and signs, and wonders past imagination, make the heavens shake, and
          make men's hearts quail within them. Suddenly upon a cloud there comes
          one like unto the Son of Man. Sinners! picture your astonishment and
          your wonder when you see him. Where art thou, Voltaire? Thou saidst,
          "I will crush the wretch." Come and crush him now! "Nay" saith
          Voltaire, "he is not the man I thought he was." Oh how will he wonder
          when he finds out what Christ is! Now, Judas, come and give him a
          traitor's kiss! "Ah! nay," says he, "I knew not what I kissed: I
          thought I kissed only the son of Mary, but lo! he is the everlasting
          God." Now, ye kings and princes, that stood up and took counsel
          together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, "Let us
          break his bands asunder, and cast his cords from us!" Come now, take
          counsel once more; rebel against him now! Oh! can ye picture the
          astonishment, the wonder the dismay, when careless, godless infidels
          and Socinians find out what Christ is? "Oh!" they will say, "this is
          wonderful, I thought not he was such as this;" while Christ shall say
          to them, "thou thoughtest that I was altogether such as yourselves;
          but I am no such thing; I am come in all my Father's glory to judge
          the quick and dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          Pharaoh led his hosts into the midst of the Red Sea. The path was dry
          and shingly, and on either shore stood like a wall of alabaster the
          clear white water stiff as with the breath of frost, consolidated into
          marble. There it stood. Can ye guess the astonishment and dismay of
          the hosts of Pharaoh, when they saw those walls of water about to
          close upon them? "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish!" Such
          will be your astonishment, when Christ, whom ye have despised to-day
          -- Christ, whom ye would not have to be your Saviour -- Christ whose
          Bible ye left unread, whose Sabbath ye despised -- Christ, whose
          gospel ye rejected, shall come in the glory of his Father, and all his
          holy angels with him. Ay, then indeed will ye "behold, and wonder, and
          perish," and you shall say, "His name is Wonderful."
        </p>
        <p>
          But perhaps, the most wonderful part of the day of judgment is this,
          do you see all the horrors yonder -- the black darkness the horrid
          night, the clashing comets the pale stars, sickly and wan, falling
          like figs from the fig tree? Do you hear the cry, "Rocks, hide us,
          mountains, on us fall?" "Every battle of the warrior is with confused
          noise;" but there never was a battle like this. This is with fire and
          smoke indeed. But do ye see yonder? All is peaceful all serene and
          quiet. The myriads of the redeemed, are they shrieking, crying,
          wailing? No; see them! They are gathering -- gathering round the
          throne. That very throne that seems to scatter, as with a hundred
          hands, death and destruction on the wicked, becomes the sun of light
          and happiness to all believers. Do you see them coming robed in white,
          with their bright wings? while gathering round him they veil their
          faces. Do ye hear them cry, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, for
          thou wast slain, and thou hast risen from the dead; worthy art thou to
          live and reign, when death itself is dead?" Do ye hear them? It is all
          song, and no shriek. Do ye see them? It is all joy, and no terror. His
          name to them is Wonderful; but it is the wonder of admiration the
          wonder of ecstacy, the wonder of affection, and not the wonder of
          horror and dismay. Saints of the Lord! ye shall know the wonders of
          his name, when ye shall see him as he is, and shall be like him in the
          day of his appearing. Oh! my enraptured spirit, thou shalt bear thy
          part in thy Redeemer's triumph, unworthy though thou art, the chief of
          sinners, and less than the least of saints. Thine eye shall see him
          and not another; "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and when he shall
          stand in the latter day upon the earth, though worms devour this body,
          yet in my flesh shall I see God." Oh! make your selves ready, ye
          virgins! Behold the bridegroom cometh. Arise and trim your lamps, and
          go ye out to meet him. He comes -- he comes -- he comes; and when he
          comes, you shall well say of him as you meet him with joy, "Thy name
          is called Wonderful. All hail! all hail! all hail!"<br />
