        <p>Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, March 4th, 1900,</p>

        <p>C. H. SPURGEON,</p>
        <p>At New Park Street Chapel, Southwark,</p>

        <p>
          "Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
          things, which thou knowest not." -- Jeremiah 33:3.
        </p>
        <p>
          GOD'S PEOPLE WILL NEVER THRIVE on anything less substantial than bread
          from heaven. Israel in Egypt might live on garlic and onions, but
          Israel in the wilderness must be fed with the manna that came down
          from heaven, and with the water that gushed out of the rock, when it
          was smitten by the rod of God. The child of God, while he is yet in
          his sins, may, like other men, revel in them, and the pleasures and
          follies of this world may be his delight; but when he is once brought
          out of Egypt, by the high hand of God's purpose, and the almighty hand
          of God's strength, he will never live on anything less than God's
          promise and God's truth. It is in vain for men to try to remove his
          doubts and strengthen his self-confidence, it is in vain for men to
          endeavour to feed him with man-made doctrine or with rationalistic
          ideas, he must have something that is divine, that has the stamp of
          revelation upon it; in fact, unless we can come forth every Sabbath
          with a "Thus, saith the Lord," we are no capable ministers of the New
          Covenant, and it is not in our power to comfort the Lord's children.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this chapter we find the prophet Jeremiah in prison; he was shut up
          in the court! of the prison, and in order to comfort him, the Word of
          the Lord came to him saying, "Thus saith the Lord." Something less
          than it may suffice, in the time of our prosperity, to make our hopes
          buoyant; for, alas! there is enough of the natural man in the
          Christian to make him rejoice even in carnal things when he is far
          from being thoroughly sanctified; but when we are in trouble, when
          affliction and adversity, sickness and suffering, are trying us,
          there, is no man-made raft upon which our soul can float through
          floods of tribulation and waves of deep distress, but we must have the
          divine life-buoy of a "Thus saith the Lord." That is what the
          Christian wants in every time and in every place, but this is what he
          more especially needs when he does business in deep waters, and is
          sorely exercised by affliction, "Thus saith the Lord." My text is a
          "Thus saith the Lord." "Thus saith the Lord, call unto me, and I will
          answer thee, mad show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest
          not."
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is, first, a large promise; here is, secondly, an implied
          imperfection; and here is, thirdly, a particular application of the
          promise, making up for that imperfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. Here is, first A LARGE PROMISE: "Call unto me, and I will answer
          thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if any friend should write us a letter containing such words as
          those, "Call unto me, and I will answer you," we would naturally
          understand by them, that whatever we might ask of our friend, he would
          most assuredly give us; and if he were a person in whose ability and
          kindness we had confidence, we should not be very slow in availing
          ourselves of his permission to seek his aid. If we were in debt, we
          should apply to him for financial help, so that we might be able to
          meet our liabilities; if we were tried by sickness, we should apply to
          him that he might give us medicines to relieve our pains; if our
          friends had been ungrateful to us, we should most likely call upon him
          for sympathy; and if our spirits were distressed from some unknown
          cause, if we believed him to have immense wisdom, we should ask him
          for some cordial to raise us from our distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how different is the case when we read these words as coming from
          the lips of God! Then, my brethren, how strange it is that, instead of
          making use of them, we just read them as a matter of course, but we
          seldom think of making use of them. "Yes," we say, "it is a very
          comforting doctrine, that God answers prayer; it is truly consolatory
          to hear our minister inform us that, whatever we ask in prayer,
          believing, we shall receive." But there the matter ends; and, except
          with a few choice spirits, it remains a matter of doctrine, and not a
          matter of practice to us. "O fools, and slow of heart to believe," our
          Master might well say to us; and if he should come into our heart, he
          would administer a thousand rebukes to us for our slackness in proving
          the truth of his promise. For God means what he says; and inasmuch as
          he has said, "Call unto me, and I will answer thee," he intends that
          his words should stand good; and he wishes us to believe them to be
          true, and therefore to prove our faith by acting upon them. Alas! the
          truth is too plain to be disputed, that the most of us, while, in a
          sense, we receive this doctrine because it is in the Bible, do not so
          receive it as to put it into practice. In introducing, to your notice,
          the great general truth, "Call unto me, and I will answer thee," I
          shall probably have to answer a host of objections and questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well," says one person, "would you wish us to believe, sir, that
          whatever we ask in prayer we shall receive?" I must, reply to you with
          discretion. In the first place, who are you who now ask that question?
          Are you a child God, or are you a worldling! Have you been born again,
          or are you still what you were by nature, without any renewal from the
          Holy Spirit! For, upon your answer to that question, mine must depend.
          If you are still without the Spirit of God, and are unrenewed, I would
          remind you of that passage which says, concerning the wicked, "Even
          his prayer shall be abomination;" and if your prayer be an
          abomination, of course you cannot expect God to accept an abomination,
          and answer it. You must, therefore, know that, you yourself are a
          partaker of to grace of God, or else this promise does not belong to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You grant me that, and then you ask me this question, "Sir, I hope I
          am a child of God; am I, therefore, to understand that, whatever I
          shall ask for in prayer, I shall receive of God?" To you also I must
          answer with discretion; lest, in endeavoring to state a truth, I
          should utter a falsehood. I must first ask you in what state of heart
          you are as a child of God. Have you been lately communing with Christ.
          Have you been constant in the study of his Word? What are your wishes?
          What are your wants? What are your desires? For, upon your answers to
          these questions, my reply your enquiry must depend, it may be that you
          are a Christian; but, nevertheless, though an Israelite, you, like
          Israel in the wilderness, are asking for meat that you may satisfy
          your own lust, even as they did; but when they craved for flesh and
          the Lord sent them quails, while the meat was ye in their mouths, the
          curse the Lord came upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are sure to have our prayers answered, if it is right that they
          should be answered. Sometimes, even the Lord's people ask for things
          which it would not be for God's glory to give, nor for their profit to
          receive, if you should tell your child you would give him anything he
          liked ask for, you would not for a moment suppose that you included in
          the promise any absurd request he might make. Suppose he should! ask
          you for a dose of arsenic, suppose he should request you to kill him,
          would you fulfill your promise? Certainly not. You would Say, "My
          child, I love you too well to listen to the ravings of your madness; I
          desire your good too much to grant your absurd request, and I cannot
          hearken to you. God says the same: "'Call upon me, and I will answer
          you,' but I will not always answer you as you wish to be answered. If
          you ask for a thing which is not fit for you to receive, I will give
          you something better. I will not give you that very thing; I will hear
          your prayers, but I will not give you exactly what you ask for, but I
          will grant you something infinitely superior to the thing itself."
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be a sad thing if God always heard our prayers, and gave us
          just what we asked of him. If he always gave us the exact thing we
          asked for, we should ruin ourselves. You may have heard the story of a
          woman who had a child who was very ill; and when her pastor called, to
          see her, she asked him to pray for the child's life, and in the prayer
          he very properly said, "O Lord, spare this child's life, if it be thy
          will." The mother interrupted him, and said, "No, I cannot have it so;
          this child must live. I want you to pray to God that the child may
          live whether God wills it or no." The minister said, "Woman, you will
          have cause to tremble on account of this petition. If you ask such a
          thing as this of God, there will be a curse upon it." Nevertheless,
          the prayer was prayed; and, twenty years afterwards, that woman, with
          an aching heart, saw her son riding in a cart to Tyburn, where he was
          going to be hanged. Better would it have been for him and also for her
          that he had perished at the breast, and be carried to an untimely
          grave, than that he should send her grey hairs with sorrow to the
          grave. God, therefore, makes this very kind reservation that, if we
          ask for ask for absurd things, things which would not be for our
          profit, he will not grant them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the question is put to me again, "Sir, if I ask for a thing which
          is obviously a good thing, which is most assuredly for my profit, may
          I be certain, after I have aaked in prayer for that thing, that I
          shall have it?" Once more, I must ask another question. Have you yet
          learned the heavenly art of believing God? Because, you may be a
          Christian, you may believe in Christ enough for your soul's salvation;
          but you may be so small a Christian that you have never yet attained
          the mountain height of belief in all your Lord has uttered. And, mark
          you, the promise of an answer to our prayers is only given to our
          faith. The Lord Jesus Christ put it thus to his disciples: "What
          things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,
          and ye shall have them." Now, if you go on your knees in prayer, and
          ask God for anything, and do not believe that he will give it to you,
          it may come in God's extraordinary bounty, but it will not come in
          answer to your prayer. Your prayers shall be answered in proportion to
          your faith; so, if you believe, and ask for a thing at is for your
          good and God's glory, you will have it as surely as the promise is a
          promise and God is God. I have talked with many Christians, and some
          of my aged friends have talked with far more than I have, but both
          they and myself can bear witness that we have never yet met with any
          Christian that could charge God with breaking his promise. We have met
          with many who have been far from having the faith they ought to have,
          but we have never discovered one go faithless to God as to charge him
          with not answering the prayer that was stamped with believing.
          Whenever there is faith, there will be the answer to the prayer of
          faith; you will never hear a Christian deny that truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my privilege, some two years ago, where at Bristol, to visit
          the Orphan house of Mr. Muller, and I never saw a more striking or
          startling exhibition of the power of faith than I did there. Mr.
          Muller supports three hundred orphan children on no resources but his
          own faith and prayer. When he needs anything, he calls them together,
          offers supplication to God, and asks that necessaries may be supplied;
          and, although there are three hundred to be fed, to be clothed, and to
          be housed, and though they have often been brought so low that there
          has not been a farthing in their coffers, nor a handful of meal in
          their barrel, when mealtime has come, there has always been abundance
          of bread in the house in answer to prayer. I shall never forget my
          interview with that holy man of God. Some gentleman said to me, "I
          wish you would ask Mr. Muller a question or two, if you see him, as to
          the foundation of a new Orphan House which he proposes to build to
          hold seven hundred more children.. Now, I feel that three hundred is
          quite enough for one man to care for; I think it is very absurd for
          him to have seven hundred more; he will never be able to support a
          thousand. AS to the preset Institution, I believe that generous
          persons hear about it, and send him subscriptions for it maintenance;
          but as to his supporting seven hundred more orphans, that is
          impossible." I replied, "I think there is something in what you say. I
          will ask him when I see him." But when I saw him, I could not, and
          dare not, ask him any such questions; and when I saw what a great work
          he had done by his faith, and began to remark upon it, he said, "Oh!
          it is only a little thing that I have done; faith could do far more
          thou that. If it were God's will that I should feed the universe on
          prayer and faith, I could do ft. If I had more faith, it could be
          accomplished." I was just going to say that, possibly, a thousand
          orphans would be more than he could support, when he said, "When I got
          three hundred children, I began to pray God to send me money to build
          an Orphan House to hold seven hundred more; and I have already £17,000
          sent in for it, although I have never solicited a contribution from
          anybody but the Lord. I believe God has made me to be here, to be to
          the world, a proof that he hears and answers prayer." I thought so,
          too, when I saw that huge building, and the many dear children rising
          up to praise their God, and singing so sweetly in honor of the good
          Shepherd, who had gathered them like lambs to his bosom, and had
          gently folded them there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brethren, we do not speak without solid facts to confirm our
          assertion, when we affirm that, whatever a saint asks in prayer, if he
          asks in faith, and it is for his own profit, and for God's glory, he
          will be sure to have it. I daresay you have read Huntington's "Bank of
          Faith." He certainly gives us too many of those instances for most
          people to believe, but I fancy there are plenty of persons alive who
          have had as many answers to their prayers as ever William Huntington
          had, and who, if they were to write the minutiae of their lives, could
          bear most solemn testimony to the truth that never could they re,
          member God being unfaithful to his promises, or their prayers
          unanswered. This, however, must always depend upon the person himself,
          for if we ask waveringly, or without faith, we must not expect to be
          answered. We must not forge that what God implies, when he does not
          grant unbelieving requests, is just this, "Inasmuch as you have no
          faith, I have nothing to give you." We must do as the people did at
          Christmas time in the olden days. It used to be the custom for the
          poor inhabitants in a village to go round with basins to the rich
          people in the parish, and beg bread and other victuals of them; and
          the rule was, that every gentleman was to fill the bowl that was
          brought to his door. Of course, the wisest amongst the poor folk
          brought a very large bowl for the Christmas gathering, but those who
          had little faith in the generosity of their wealthy neighbours took a
          small bowl, and that was filled; but those who took a big bowl had
          theirs filled too. So, dear friends, you must always try, in your
          prayers, to bring a big bowl to God. Bring great faith, and rest
          assured that, according to thy faith, it shall be done unto thee. If
          thou has little faith thou shalt have little answer; if thou hast
          tolerable faith, thou shalt have a tolerable answer; and if thou ht a
          mighty faith, thou shalt have such a mighty answer that thou shalt
          wonder at it, yet thou shall feel that it is according to the promise
          of our text, "Call unto me, and I will answer thee."
        </p>
        <p>
          II. Now we come to the second part of our subject, and we notice AN
          IMPLIED IMPERFECTION: "Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew
          thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not." It is implied
          that God's people do not know everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you ever meet with a man who knew everything? I have happened to
          meet with half-a-dozen such. I once met with a minister who knew all
          things, -- according to his own account, I mean, not according to
          mine. He told me when I saw him, that, in the parish where he lived,
          there were not more than a dozen people who knew the Lord Jesus Christ
          in truth. I was interested in that man, for I knew a little about him,
          so I said to him, "Well, who are they?" So he began," Well, there is
          myself, and my wife, and my two deacons," and so on, "Oh!" I answered,
          "the only person I should dispute out of that number would be
          yourself, because I think you know too much by a great deal; you seem
          to have climbed up, and to have looked into the secret roll of God's
          decrees. No child of God would do that. Children do not look into
          their father's secrets; it is only thieves who do that. I should doubt
          your claim to be a child of God."
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of us, at times, meets with an interesting individual who knows
          far too much, in whose company one always feels uncomfortable. We
          never introduce any subject, we leave him to do that, because he is
          the Pope of our circle. He hates Popery, of course; two Popes cannot
          agree; so, naturally, he has a very strong objection to the Pope of
          Rome. He himself knows all things. You utter a sentiment; he tells you
          directly that it is not sound; he knows, of course. You talk about a
          matter of experience; but he says, "That is not the experience of the
          living child of God." He is umpire, of course; he knows all about it;
          he is the judge who ends all strife; he settles everything. Bring him
          in, his vote is the casting vote, which it were almost profane to
          controvert. He is King, Lords, and Commons, all rolled into one; he
          makes the laws, and he fulfils them. He is, in his own sphere, the
          Autocrat of all Christians. Now, God's children belong to a very
          different order of beings from this very respectable and very
          venerable individual; they do not know everything, and they do not
          pretend to be full of all knowledge. One of the best of them, whose
          name was Paul, said, "Not as though I have already attained, either
          were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that
          for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not
          myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those
          things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which
          are before, I press toward the mark or the prize of the high calling
          of God in Christ Jesus."
        </p>
        <p>
          An old man once met a young one who had been to College about six
          months; and he sad to him, "Do you know much?" Yes," the young man
          answered, "I am getting on very fast." The old man said, "You will not
          say that in a year's time, or else I shall have no hope for you." In a
          years time, he asked him whether he knew much more than he did six
          months before, He replied, "Sometimes, I think I know a great deal
          more, but, at other times, I think I know a great deal less. I have
          discovered my own ignorance more than ever this last year." Then the
          old man said, "By the time you have been in college four years, you
          will confess yourself to be a very great fool;" and when he met him,
          during to four year, he said, "What do you know now" The student
          replied, "I think perhaps I know more than when I entered College;
          but, in my own opinion, I know much less. When I first came, I thought
          myself competent to give a decisive opinion upon every subject; now, I
          am obliged to weigh everything before I am able to state anything
          positively. My own ignorance has been discovered."
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, depend upon it, dear friends, it will be the same with each of
          you. We may think, when we first join the church, "We know almost
          everything." Some people suppose that all the truth is found in to
          Baptist denomination; others imagine it is all in the Episcopalian,
          Independent, or Wesleyan denomination, or in whatever sect they belong
          to; but when we have been members of the Baptist denomination for one
          considerable time, we discover that there are several faults amongst
          us; and we think, perhaps, that if we were fashioned according to the
          Presbyterian model, we might be improved. By-and-by, we find a friend
          who attends an Episcapal church, where he hears the gospel very
          plainly preached by a very earnest clergyman, and we say we think
          there is something good in the Episcopalians; and the longer we live,
          the more we find that there is something good in all; and that, after
          all, we do not know so much as we thought we did, and that our church,
          though it seemed to be the very model of perfection, is found to be
          full of infirmities, as well as any other church, and it is not
          exactly the Church after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I repeat, then, the assertion that is implied in the text, that we
          have, all of us, a certain amount of ignorance and imperfection; for
          if we knew all things, we should have no necessity for this promise,
          that God would show us great and mighty things, which we do not know.
          That, as we are still imperfect, and growing in our knowledge, this
          promise is exceedingly precious to us. I can scarcely think that I
          have any person here of that particular clique, who fancy they know
          everything. If I have, I would say a word to him. There is a certain
          body of excellent men, who call themselves "God's dear people!" That
          is just what they are; they are dear to anybody, nobody would think of
          buying them. If they were to be given away, they would be scarcely
          worth having. They are God's dear people. They hear their minister
          preach a sermon, made up of the extract of gall and bitterness, and
          that just pleases them. His people rejoice in that kind of talk, and
          say that he is a faithful minister. If he were to leave off being
          bitter, he would not be faithful, -- faithfulness, according to their
          meaning, consits in finding fault with all the world besides. They
          tell you to go to "Little Bethel," "Rehoboth," or "Bethesda," because
          there is no truth anywhere else. It is only there that the truth is to
          be had, and all other congregations are schismatics, whom it is their
          duty to denounce and persecute with the utmost rigour of the gospel,
          and you are aware that the utmost rigour of the gospel is worse than
          the utmost rigour of the law. The rigour of the gospel is more
          intolerable than even the rule of Draco himself; for those pensions
          exclude, denounce, and condemn every man who is not to the very turn
          of a hair's breadth in conformity with their views. To every such
          person we say, "Dear brother, you are very wise! All hail to you! We
          will put you in the chair as the marvellous Doctor of Divinity. You
          are the man, wisdom will die with you; and, while we humbly bow at
          your feet, we are obliged to say that you do not know everything yet;
          there are a few things that need to be revealed even to you; and while
          we keep ourselves at a respectful distance from anything like your
          superior knowledge, we are compelled to think that you have not yet
          attained unto perfection, and we cannot admit that you are the only
          man in all the world who understands and knows the gospel." Well,
          though our brother will not not join with us in saying, "We do not
          know all things," I think that all who are here present will bow their
          heads, and each one will say, "Lord, teach me what I do not know; for
          the little that I know is noticing to be compared with the volumes of
          thy wisdom which I have not read, and do not yet understand."
        </p>
        <p>
          III. Now we come to the third head of our subject, which is the best
          of all. We have here THE PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF THE PROMISE: "Call
          unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
          things, which thou knowest not."
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we understand this promise to relate to gospel doctrines. I
          confess that when I first preached in a country village as its past, I
          read all Dr. Gill's "Body of Divinity" and Calvin's "Institutes "; and
          when I had done that, I thought, "Now! have got hold of the truth, I
          am certain I have; and I can meet all opponents, and if they are not
          conformed to the views of that most learned man, Dr. Gill, and that
          excellent confessor, John Calvin, I will soon cut them up root and
          branch." Well, I begun to preach what I had learned from these great
          and good men, and I have never been ashamed of having done so, for, as
          a successor of Dr. Gill, I am not ashamed to endorse his views even
          now, and to subscribe to the doctrinal statements that John Calvin
          uttered. However, I soon began to find out that there was a good deal
          to be said, after all, concerning some matters that Dr. Gill and John
          Calvin did not mention, and I found at I was obliged somewhat to
          stretch my charity, and to take to my heart some brethren who did not
          quite see all things which those enlightened men saw. And, moreover, I
          found out that I did not know everything, and that I had a good deal
          stall to learn, and I find the same thing every day. I hope at all
          times to hold firmly all the truth I have received. I intend to grasp
          tightly with one hand the truths I have already learned, and to keep
          the other hand wide opera to take in the things I do not yet know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps I have some young man here who has a notion that some minister
          has got all the truth, or that he himself has embraced all the truth.
          Now, young man, there are a great many things that you do not know;
          there are some doctrines you do not understand. If you will wait a
          little while, and study your Bible more, you will go down on your
          knees, and say, "Lord, I never knew my own ignorance much as I do now;
          wilt thou teach me thy truth?" Do we desire to understand the faith of
          God? Let us not be discouraged. In answer to our prayer, God will show
          us "great and mighty things" which we do not know now. You are a
          Christian, yet you do not comprehend the doctrine of election, or the
          doctrine of effectual calling puzzles you. You are a Churchman,
          perhaps, yet you do not know anything about these things. You are like
          a man I met once in a railway carriage. He said he was a High
          Churchman, and I said I was a High Churchman too. "How can that be?"
          he enquired, "you are a Dissenter." "But," I replied, "I believe many
          of the doctrines of your Church." He said, "I think not." "Well," I
          said "I believe in the doctrine of election, predestination, and so
          on." "Oh!" he said, "I do not." "But," I said, "they are in your
          Articles." He said, "I believe the Catechism, but I have not read the
          Articles." "Then," I rejoined, "I am the better Churchman of the two;
          you are the Dissenter, and I am the High Churchnmn. You ought to be
          turned out of the Church if you do not believe the Articles. They
          ought to take me, and give me a first-rate living, the make me one of
          their bishops; for I have read the Articles, and studied them."
        </p>
        <p>
          A great many people do not know what they believe. No person has a
          right to say he is a Churchman, till he has read the Prayer-book. You
          have no right to say you are Wesleyan till you have read Wesley's
          sermons; and you have no right to y you are a Calvinist till you have
          red what Calvin believed; and you have no right to say you are a
          Christian till you have read your Bible, for the Bible is the standard
          of Christian faith and practice; and when you come to read your
          Bibles, you will find this one thing out, that your own little views
          were not quite so wide as the Bible, after all; and you will have to
          say, "Lord, show me great and mighty things, which I know not not." I
          am persuaded that neither the Church of England, nor the Wesleyans,
          nor the Independents, nor the Baptists, have got all the truth. I
          would not belong to any one of these denominations, for all the land
          that is beneath the sky, if I had to endorse all that is held by them.
          I believe that the Church ought to be governed by at Episcopalian
          Presbyterian Baptist Independency. I believe we are all right in a
          great many of our doctrines, but that we all have something yet to
          learn. The doctrine of "man's responsibility" is not to be denied, nor
          the doctrine of "God's sovereignty" to be disputed. I hope that, some
          day, we shall all bring our views to the test of the Sacred
          Scriptures. Then shall we have one Church, "one Lord, one faith, one
          baptism." Then shall we know great and mighty things which we know not
          now. I would persuade you, my Baptist friends, that your system is not
          perfect, and you members of the Episcopalian Church, that your polity
          is not altogether without imperfection; and I Would entreat you, my
          friend, though you are a member of an excellent body of believers,
          however excellent that church may be, not to think it is infallible.
          Go down on your knees, and ask God to teach you what you do not know,
          and to make you better than your creed; or else, in nine cases out of
          ten, you will not be worth much.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, next, "great, and mighty things, 'which thou knowest not," God
          will show thee in providence. A poor man is in trouble; he has not
          wherewithal to buy daily broad. Let him call upon God, and ask for it;
          and though he has never seen the Lord thrust out his hand from heaven,
          or feed him by the ravens, or quench his thirst with water out of the
          rock, let him go down on his knees, and he will find that there are
          more wonders in providence than you and I have seen yet In answer to
          prayer, we shall see how God's providence, though it is far beyond our
          ideas, is according to our prayers. There are many Christians who have
          been in great trouble, and have experienced a most marvellous
          deliverance in providence. If we have great trouble, let us bring them
          to our great God; let us cry unto him, and in providence we shall see
          "great and mighty things" which we know not as yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next place, very briefly passing over these points, "great and
          mighty things, which thou knowest not," God will show thee in matters
          of Christian experience. Let us search God's Word, and give ourselves
          unto prayer, and then, in matters of experience, we shall see "great
          and mighty things" which we know not yet. A Christian is immeasurably
          beyond the worldling, and there is a possibility of a Christian
          becoming as much beyond himself as he now is beyond a sinner dead in
          sins. There is no telling how great he may become even on earth. I do
          not think we can ever on earth become perfect, but we know not how
          near to perfection we may come. We may not, whilst on earth, dwell in
          heaven; but; who can tell how much of heaven may dwell in us whilst we
          are here? Did you ever sit down and read the Life Of Herbert, or
          Whitefield, or Haliburton? After we have read such books, we say
          within ourselves, "What poor worms we are,!" We feel like Robert Hall,
          who, when a certain minister came to see him, said, "I am so glad to
          see you! Mr. So-and-so has been here; he is so far above me, that I
          felt myself to be nothing in his presence, but now I begin to feel
          myself a man again." Have you never felt, when in the company of some
          great and mighty man, as if you were nothing at all? When I first read
          Henry Martyn's Life, I could not refrain from weeping for some hours
          afterwards, to think how much below such a life as his I was living.
          Yet you know not but that you may climb where these men did; the steps
          of the mountain of piety may be steep to look upon, but they are
          accessible to the feet of diligence. Go on, and you shall yet stand
          where Moses stood, and behold Canaan from the top of Nebo. Remember
          that you are as yet upon the lowlands; be not ashamed to acknowledge
          that you are desirous to climb upwards. Bend you knees, and God will
          show you in experience "great and mighty things" that you know not
          yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any man is content with his own experience, it is entirely through
          ignorance. I will defy anyone to take Rutherford's Letters, and sit
          down, and after he has read them, to help saying, "Rutherford seems to
          have been like an angel of God; I am only a man, I never can stand
          where Rutherford stood." Frequently, when I return home from chapel on
          the Sabbath evening, I get down George Herbert's book of songs; and
          when I see how much he loved the Lord, it seems to me as if he had
          struck upon his harp the very notes that he hall heard in Paradise,
          and sung them all again. Let us not be discouraged, we may yet become
          Herberts, and Rutherfords, and Whitfields; nay, there is no reason why
          we should not become as great as the Old or New Testament saints.
          There is no reason why we should not be, as great as Abraham, and
          Isaac, and Jacob; for why should not every child of God, in these
          days, become a mighty a man of faith as was Abraham of old? Let us
          lead the promise of the text: "Call unto me, and I will answer thee,
          and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not."
        </p>
        <p>
          And, to conclude, the same truth holds good with regard to the
          universal Church of God. I do not know whether you may have noticed
          that the devil, in his wisdom, has just tried to pervert all our
          services. My heart has been made glad by the opening of Exeter Hall
          for the preaching of the gospel! Never did my heart so leap for joy as
          when I heard that our brethren of the Church of England had to begun
          to preach in Exeter Hall, though I felt sad when those doors were shut
          against them. Now our joys are blasted, and our happiness is clouded.
          It appears that, because some have lately endeavoured to turn to good
          account the earnestness of the people to hear the Word in their own
          churches and chapels, next Sunday we shall see the lamentable
          spectacle, in this great metropolis, of a place, not open simply for
          the preaching of the Word, but actually for a Sabbath Concert.* We
          shall read of multitudes assembled in a building, the property of one
          connected with a theatre; we shall hear of people being gathered
          together, and there will be a person found who will profess to preach
          the gospel to them, and the "Messiah" will be performed as the great
          inducement for attracting them. Perhaps there is no person who feels
          more sorrow than I do that this fearful cloud has fallen upon us. The
          devil may one day open the Crystal Palace, the Museum, and every other
          place on Sunday; but the Lord reigneth; and if this nation shall be
          given up to Sabbath breaking, let us not despair. God sits as the
          ruler in heaven and, as surely as he is God, he will get the victory.
          The devil will outwit himself, as he has always done; Satan will fall
          into his own pit. I hope, however, that the Christians of Great
          Britain will be very earnest in calling upon God. Pray continually to
          the Most High, that he will prosper the preaching of the gospel to the
          multitude; but that he will never allow our entering into
          unconsecrated places to be twisted and turned to unhallowed uses, and
          that God will bring forth greater good out of the great evil, and so
          glorify himself, and thus show us great and mighty things that we know
          not.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can only now beseech the Lord to pour his blessing upon each of you.
          May you be earnest in prayer, and constant in supplication; and if you
          have never known Christ yet, may he soon be made known to you by the
          Holy Spirit, and may your prayers be lifted up to heaven that he may
          show you his salvation, which is one of the "great and mighty things"
          which you know not now!
        </p>
        <p>
          *MR. SPURGEON was referring to the arrangements which had been made
          for a sacred concert and a gospel address combined at the Alhambra
          Palace. Happily, the minister who took the service, abandoned it after
          one attempt, being convinced that more harm than good would result
          from it; but, unhappily, since then, not only have sacred concerts
          been regularly established, either with or without gospel addresses;
          but many places are open, on the Lord's-day, for secular concerts, at
          which there is not even the pretence of any religious service. Our
          comfort still is, as it was MR. SPURGEON'S over forty years ago, that
          "the Lord reigneth," and he will get the victory over all his
          adversaries.
