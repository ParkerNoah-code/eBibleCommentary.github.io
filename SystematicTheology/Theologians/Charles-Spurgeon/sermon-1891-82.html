          1. The Apostle Peter, therefore, after the resurrection of the Lord,
          and His assumption into the heavens, being desirous of filling up the
          number of the twelve apostles, and in electing into the place of Judas
          any substitute who should be chosen by God, thus addressed those who
          were present: |Men [and] brethren, this Scripture must needs have been
          fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of David, spake before
          concerning Judas, which was made guide to them that took Jesus. For he
          was numbered with us: ... Let his habitation be desolate, and let no
          man dwell therein; and, His bishoprick let another take;| -- thus
          leading to the completion of the apostles, according to the words
          spoken by David. Again, when the Holy Ghost had descended upon the
          disciples, that they all might prophesy and speak with tongues, and
          some mocked them, as if drunken with new wine, Peter said that they
          were not drunken, for it was the third hour of the day; but that this
          was what had been spoken by the prophet: |It shall come to pass in the
          last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and
          they shall prophesy.| The God, therefore, who did promise by the
          prophet, that He would send His Spirit upon the whole human race, was
          He who did send; and God Himself is announced by Peter as having
          fulfilled His own promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. For Peter said, |Ye men of Israel, hear my words; Jesus of
          Nazareth, a man approved by God among you by powers, and wonders, and
          signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also
          know: Him, being delivered by the determined counsel and foreknowledge
          of God, by the hands of wicked men ye have slain, affixing [to the
          cross]: whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death;
          because it was not possible that he should be holden of them. For
          David speaketh concerning Him, I foresaw the Lord always before my
          face; for He is on my right hand, lest I should be moved: therefore
          did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also, my flesh
          shall rest in hope: because Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
          neither wilt Thou give Thy Holy One to see corruption.| Then he
          proceeds to speak confidently to them concerning the patriarch David,
          that he was dead and buried, and that his sepulchre is with them to
          this day. He said, |But since he was a prophet, and knew that God had
          sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his body one should
          sit in his throne; foreseeing this, he spake of the resurrection of
          Christ, that He was not left in hell, neither did His flesh see
          corruption. This Jesus,| he said, |hath God raised up, of which we all
          are witnesses: who, being exalted by the right hand of God, receiving
          from the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, hath shed forth this
          gift which ye now see and hear. For David has not ascended into the
          heavens; but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on
          My right hand, until I make Thy foes Thy footstool. Therefore let all
          the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same
          Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.| And when the
          multitudes exclaimed, |What shall we do then?| Peter says to them,
          |Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus for the
          remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.|
          Thus the apostles did not preach another God, or another Fulness; nor,
          that the Christ who suffered and rose again was one, while he who flew
          off on high was another, and remained impassible; but that there was
          one and the same God the Father, and Christ Jesus who rose from the
          dead; and they preached faith in Him, to those who did not believe on
          the Son of God, and exhorted them out of the prophets, that the Christ
          whom God promised to send, He sent in Jesus, whom they crucified and
          God raised up.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Again, when Peter, accompanied by John, had looked upon the man
          lame from his birth, before that gate of the temple which is called
          Beautiful, sitting and seeking alms, he said to him, |Silver and gold
          I have none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus
          Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. And immediately his legs and his
          feet received strength; and he walked, and entered with them into the
          temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.| Then, when a
          multitude had gathered around them from all quarters because of this
          unexpected deed, Peter addressed them: |Ye men of Israel, why marvel
          ye at this; or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own
          power we had made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, the God of
          Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified
          His Son, whom ye delivered up for judgment, and denied in the presence
          of Pilate, when he wished to let Him go. But ye were bitterly set
          against the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be
          granted unto you; but ye killed the Prince of life, whom God hath
          raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses. And in the faith of
          His name, him, whom ye see and know, hath His name made strong; yea,
          the faith which is by Him, hath given him this perfect soundness in
          the presence of you all. And now, brethren, I wot that through
          ignorance ye did this wickedness. ... But those things which God
          before had showed by the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ
          should suffer, He hath so fulfilled. Repent ye therefore, and be
          converted, that your sins may be blotted out, and that the times of
          refreshing may come to you from the presence of the Lord; and He shall
          send Jesus Christ, prepared for you beforehand, whom the heaven must
          indeed receive until the times of the arrangement of all things, of
          which God hath spoken by His holy prophets. For Moses truly said unto
          our fathers, Your Lord God shall raise up to you a Prophet from your
          brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever He
          shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul,
          whosoever will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among
          the people. And all [the prophets] from Samuel, and henceforth, as
          many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. Ye are the
          children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our
          fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds
          of the earth be blessed. Unto you first, God, having raised up His
          Son, sent Him blessing you, that each may turn himself from his
          iniquities.| Peter, together with John, preached to them this plain
          message of glad tidings, that the promise which God made to the
          fathers had been fulfilled by Jesus; not certainly proclaiming another
          god, but the Son of God, who also was made man, and suffered; thus
          leading Israel into knowledge, and through Jesus preaching the
          resurrection of the dead, and showing, that whatever the prophets had
          proclaimed as to the suffering of Christ, these had God fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. For this reason, too, when the chief priests were assembled, Peter,
          full of boldness, said to them, |Ye rulers of the people, and elders
          of Israel, if we this day be examined by you of the good deed done to
          the impotent man, by what means he has been made whole; be it known to
          you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus
          Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,
          even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the
          stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the
          head-stone of the corner. [Neither is there salvation in any other:
          for] there is none other name under heaven, which is given to men,
          whereby we must be saved:| Thus the apostles did not change God, but
          preached to the people that Christ was Jesus the crucified One, whom
          the same God that had sent the prophets, being God Himself, raised up,
          and gave in Him salvation to men.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. They were confounded, therefore, both by this instance of healing
          (|for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of
          healing took place| ), and by the doctrine of the apostles, and by the
          exposition of the prophets, when the chief priests had sent away Peter
          and John. [These latter] returned to the rest of their fellow-apostles
          and disciples of the Lord, that is, to the Church, and related what
          had occurred, and how courageously they had acted in the name of
          Jesus. The whole Church, it is then said, |when they had heard that,
          lifted up the voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, Thou art
          God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in
          them is; who, through the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father
          David, Thy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the
          people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the
          rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His
          Christ. For of a truth, in this city, against Thy holy Son Jesus, whom
          Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles,
          and the people of Israel, were gathered together, to do whatsoever Thy
          hand and Thy counsel determined before to be done.| These [are the]
          voices of the Church from which every Church had its origin; these are
          the voices of the metropolis of the citizens of the new covenant;
          these are the voices of the apostles; these are voices of the
          disciples of the Lord, the truly perfect, who, after the assumption of
          the Lord, were perfected by the Spirit, and called upon the God who
          made heaven, and earth, and the sea, -- who was announced by the
          prophets, -- and Jesus Christ His Son, whom God anointed, and who knew
          no other [God]. For at that time and place there was neither
          Valentinus, nor Marcion, nor the rest of these subverters [of the
          truth], and their adherents. Wherefore God, the Maker of all things,
          heard them. For it is said, |The place was shaken where they were
          assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
          they spake the word of God with boldness| to every one that was
          willing to believe. |And with great power,| it is added, |gave the
          apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,| saying to
          them, |The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye seized and
          slew, hanging [Him] upon a beam of wood: Him hath God raised up by His
          right hand to be a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel,
          and forgiveness of sins. And we are in this witnesses of these words;
          as also is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that believe in
          Him.| |And daily,| it is said, |in the temple, and from house to
          house, they ceased not to teach and preach Christ Jesus,| the Son of
          God. For this was the knowledge of salvation, which renders those who
          acknowledge His Son's advent perfect towards God.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. But as some of these men impudently assert that the apostles, when
          preaching among the Jews, could not declare to them another god
          besides Him in whom they (their hearers ) believed, we say to them,
          that if the apostles used to speak to people in accordance with the
          opinion instilled into them of old, no one learned the truth from
          them, nor, at a much earlier date, from the Lord; for they say that He
          did Himself speak after the same fashion. Wherefore neither do these
          men themselves know the truth; but since such was their opinion
          regarding God, they had just received doctrine as they were able to
          hear it. According to this manner of speaking, therefore, the rule of
          truth can be with nobody; but all learners will ascribe this practice
          to all [teachers], that just as every person thought, and as far as
          his capability extended, so was also the language addressed to him.
          But the advent of the Lord will appear superfluous and useless, if He
          did indeed come intending to tolerate and to preserve each man's idea
          regarding God rooted in him from of old. Besides this, also, it was a
          much heavier task, that He whom the Jews had seen as a man, and had
          fastened to the cross, should be preached as Christ the Son of God,
          their eternal King. Since this, however, was so, they certainly did
          not speak to them in accordance with their old belief. For they, who
          told them to their face that they were the slayers of the Lord, would
          themselves also much more boldly preach that Father who is above the
          Demiurge, and not what each individual bid himself believe [respecting
          God]; and the sin was much less, if indeed they had not fastened to
          the cross the superior Saviour (to whom it behoved them to ascend),
          since He was impassible. For, as they did not speak to the Gentiles in
          compliance with their notions, but told them with boldness that their
          gods were no gods, but the idols of demons; so would they in like
          manner have preached to the Jews, if they had known another greater or
          more perfect Father, not nourishing nor strengthening the untrue
          opinion of these men regarding God. Moreover, while destroying the
          error of the Gentiles, and bearing them away from their gods, they did
          not certainly induce another error upon them; but, removing those
          which were no gods, they pointed out Him who alone was God and the
          true Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. From the words of Peter, therefore, which he addressed in Cæsarea
          to Cornelius the centurion, and those Gentiles with him, to whom the
          word of God was first preached, we can understand what the apostles
          used to preach, the nature of their preaching, and their idea with
          regard to God. For this Cornelius was, it is said, |a devout man, and
          one who feared God with all his house, giving much alms to the people,
          and praying to God always. He saw therefore, about the ninth hour of
          the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying, Thine alms are
          come up for a memorial before God. Wherefore send to Simon, who is
          called Peter.| But when Peter saw the vision, in which the voice from
          heaven said to him, |What God hath cleansed, that call not thou
          common,| this happened [to teach him] that the God who had, through
          the law, distinguished between clean and unclean, was He who had
          purified the Gentiles through the blood of His Son -- He whom also
          Cornelius worshipped; to whom Peter, coming in, said, |Of a truth I
          perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation, he
          that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to Him.| He
          thus clearly indicates, that He whom Cornelius had previously feared
          as God, of whom he had heard through the law and the prophets, for
          whose sake also he used to give alms, is, in truth, God. The knowledge
          of the Son was, however, wanting to him; therefore did [Peter] add,
          |The word, ye know, which was published throughout all Judea,
          beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached, Jesus
          of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost, and with power;
          who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
          devil; for God was with Him. And we are witnesses of all those things
          which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they
          slew, hanging Him on a beam of wood: Him God raised up the third day,
          and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but unto us, witnesses
          chosen before of God, who did eat and drink with Him after the
          resurrection from the dead. And He commanded us to preach unto the
          people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be
          the Judge of quick and dead. To Him give all the prophets witness,
          that, through His name, every one that believeth in Him does receive
          remission of sins.| The apostles, therefore, did preach the Son of
          God, of whom men were ignorant; and His advent, to those who had been
          already instructed as to God; but they did not bring in another god.
          For if Peter had known any such thing, he would have preached freely
          to the Gentiles, that the God of the Jews was indeed one, but the God
          of the Christians another; and all of them, doubtless, being
          awe-struck because of the vision of the angel, would have believed
          whatever he told them. But it is evident from Peter's words that he
          did indeed still retain the God who was already known to them; but he
          also bare witness to them that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, the
          Judge of quick and dead, into whom he did also command them to be
          baptized for the remission of sins; and not this alone, but he
          witnessed that Jesus was Himself the Son of God, who also, having been
          anointed with the Holy Spirit, is called Jesus Christ. And He is the
          same being that was born of Mary, as the testimony of Peter implies.
          Can it really be, that Peter was not at that time as yet in possession
          of the perfect knowledge which these men discovered afterwards?
          According to them, therefore, Peter was imperfect, and the rest of the
          apostles were imperfect; and so it would be fitting that they, coming
          to life again, should become disciples of these men, in order that
          they too might be made perfect. But this is truly ridiculous. These
          men, in fact, are proved to be not disciples of the apostles, but of
          their own wicked notions. To this cause also are due the various
          opinions which exist among them, inasmuch as each one adopted error
          just as he was capable [of embracing it]. But the Church throughout
          all the world, having its origin firm from the apostles, perseveres in
          one and the same opinion with regard to God and His Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. But again: Whom did Philip preach to the eunuch of the queen of the
          Ethiopians, returning from Jerusalem, and reading Esaias the prophet,
          when he and this man were alone together? Was it not He of whom the
          prophet spoke: |He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb
          dumb before the shearer, so He opened not the mouth?| |But who shall
          declare His nativity? for His life shall be taken away from the
          earth.| [Philip declared] that this was Jesus, and that the Scripture
          was fulfilled in Him; as did also the believing eunuch himself: and,
          immediately requesting to be baptized, he said, |I believe Jesus
          Christ to be the Son of God.| This man was also sent into the regions
          of Ethiopia, to preach what he had himself believed, that there was
          one God preached by the prophets, but that the Son of this [God] had
          already made [His] appearance in human nature (secundum hominem), and
          had been led as a sheep to the slaughter; and all the other statements
          which the prophets made regarding Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Paul himself also -- after that the Lord spoke to him out of
          heaven, and showed him that, in persecuting His disciples, he
          persecuted his own Lord, and sent Ananias to him that he might recover
          his sight, and be baptized -- |preached,| it is said, |Jesus in the
          synagogues at Damascus, with all freedom of speech, that this is the
          Son of God, the Christ.| This is the mystery which he says was made
          known to him by revelation, that He who suffered under Pontius Pilate,
          the same is Lord of all, and King, and God, and Judge, receiving power
          from Him who is the God of all, because He became |obedient unto
          death, even the death of the cross.| And inasmuch as this is true,
          when preaching to the Athenians on the Areopagus -- where, no Jews
          being present, he had it in his power to preach God with freedom of
          speech -- he said to them: |God, who made the world, and all things
          therein, He, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples
          made with hands; neither is He touched by men's hands, as though He
          needed anything, seeing He giveth to all life, and breath, and all
          things; who hath made from one blood the whole race of men to dwell
          upon the face of the whole earth, predetermining the times according
          to the boundary of their habitation, to seek the Deity, if by any
          means they might be able to track Him out, or find Him, although He be
          not far from each of us. For in Him we live, and move, and have our
          being, as certain men of your own have said, For we are also His
          offspring. Inasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought
          not to think that the Deity is like unto gold or silver, or stone
          graven by art or man's device. Therefore God, winking at the times of
          ignorance, does now command all men everywhere to turn to Him with
          repentance; because He hath appointed a day, on which the world shall
          be judged in righteousness by the man Jesus; whereof He hath given
          assurance by raising Him from the dead.| Now in this passage he does
          not only declare to them God as the Creator of the world, no Jews
          being present, but that He did also make one race of men to dwell upon
          all the earth; as also Moses declared: |When the Most High divided the
          nations, as He scattered the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the
          nations after the number of the angels of God;| but that people which
          believes in God is not now under the power of angels, but under the
          Lord's [rule]. |For His people Jacob was made the portion of the Lord,
          Israel the cord of His inheritance.| And again, at Lystra of Lycia
          (Lycaonia), when Paul was with Barnabas, and in the name of our Lord
          Jesus Christ had made a man to walk who had been lame from his birth,
          and when the crowd wished to honour them as gods because of the
          astonishing deed, he said to them: |We are men like unto you,
          preaching to you God, that ye may be turned away from these vain idols
          to [serve] the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
          and all things that are therein; who in times past suffered all
          nations to walk in their own ways, although He left not Himself
          without witness, performing acts of goodness, giving you rain from
          heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and
          gladness.| But that all his Epistles are consonant to these
          declarations, I shall, when expounding the apostle, show from the
          Epistles themselves, in the right place. But while I bring out by
          these proofs the truths of Scripture, and set forth briefly and
          compendiously things which are stated in various ways, do thou also
          attend to them with patience, and not deem them prolix; taking this
          into account, that proofs [of the things which are] contained in the
          Scriptures cannot be shown except from the Scriptures themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. And still further, Stephen, who was chosen the first deacon by the
          apostles, and who, of all men, was the first to follow the footsteps
          of the martyrdom of the Lord, being the first that was slain for
          confessing Christ, speaking boldly among the people, and teaching
          them, says: |The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, ... and
          said to him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and
          come into the land which I shall show thee; ... and He removed him
          into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And He gave him none inheritance
          in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; yet He promised that He
          would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him. ...
          And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange
          land, and should be brought into bondage, and should be evil-entreated
          four hundred years; and the nation whom they shall serve will I judge,
          says the Lord. And after that shall they come forth, and serve me in
          this place. And He gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so
          [Abraham] begat Isaac.| And the rest of his words announce the same
          God, who was with Joseph and with the patriarchs, and who spake with
          Moses.
        </p>
        <p>
          11. And that the whole range of the doctrine of the apostles
          proclaimed one and the same God, who removed Abraham, who made to him
          the promise of inheritance, who in due season gave to him the covenant
          of circumcision, who called his descendants out of Egypt, preserved
          outwardly by circumcision -- for he gave it as a sign, that they might
          not be like the Egyptians -- that He was the Maker of all things, that
          He was the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He was the God of
          glory, -- they who wish may learn from the very words and acts of the
          apostles, and may contemplate the fact that this God is one, above
          whom is no other. But even if there were another god above Him, we
          should say, upon [instituting] a comparison of the quantity [of the
          work done by each], that the latter is superior to the former. For by
          deeds the better man appears, as I have already remarked; and,
          inasmuch as these men have no works of their father to adduce, the
          latter is shown to be God alone. But if any one, |doting about
          questions,| do imagine that what the apostles have declared about God
          should be allegorized, let him consider my previous statements, in
          which I set forth one God as the Founder and Maker of all things, and
          destroyed and laid bare their allegations; and he shall find them
          agreeable to the doctrine of the apostles, and so to maintain what
          they used to teach, and were persuaded of, that there is one God, the
          Maker of all things. And when he shall have divested his mind of such
          error, and of that blasphemy against God which it implies, he will of
          himself find reason to acknowledge that both the Mosaic law and the
          grace of the new covenant, as both fitted for the times [at which they
          were given], were bestowed by one and the same God for the benefit of
          the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
          12. For all those who are of a perverse mind, having been set against
          the Mosaic legislation, judging it to be dissimilar and contrary to
          the doctrine of the Gospel, have not applied themselves to investigate
          the causes of the difference of each covenant. Since, therefore, they
          have been deserted by the paternal love, and puffed up by Satan, being
          brought over to the doctrine of Simon Magus, they have apostatized in
          their opinions from Him who is God, and imagined that they have
          themselves discovered more than the apostles, by finding out another
          god; and [maintained] that the apostles preached the Gospel still
          somewhat under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they
          themselves are purer [in doctrine], and more intelligent, than the
          apostles. Wherefore also Marcion and his followers have betaken
          themselves to mutilating the Scriptures, not acknowledging some books
          at all; and, curtailing the Gospel according to Luke and the Epistles
          of Paul, they assert that these are alone authentic, which they have
          themselves thus shortened. In another work, however, I shall, God
          granting [me strength], refute them out of these which they still
          retain. But all the rest, inflated with the false name of |knowledge,|
          do certainly recognise the Scriptures; but they pervert the
          interpretations, as I have shown in the first book. And, indeed, the
          followers of Marcion do directly blaspheme the Creator, alleging him
          to be the creator of evils, [but] holding a more tolerable theory as
          to his origin, [and] maintaining that there are two beings, gods by
          nature, differing from each other, -- the one being good, but the
          other evil. Those from Valentinus, however, while they employ names of
          a more honourable kind, and set forth that He who is Creator is both
          Father, and Lord, and God, do [nevertheless] render their theory or
          sect more blasphemous, by maintaining that He was not produced from
          any one of those Æons within the Pleroma, but from that defect which
          had been expelled beyond the Pleroma. Ignorance of the Scriptures and
          of the dispensation of God has brought all these things upon them. And
          in the course of this work I shall touch upon the cause of the
          difference of the covenants on the one hand, and, on the other hand,
          of their unity and harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          13. But that both the apostles and their disciples thus taught as the
          Church preaches, and thus teaching were perfected, wherefore also they
          were called away to that which is perfect -- Stephen, teaching these
          truths, when he was yet on earth, saw the glory of God, and Jesus on
          His right hand, and exclaimed, |Behold, I see the heavens opened, and
          the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.| These words he
          said, and was stoned; and thus did he fulfil the perfect doctrine,
          copying in every respect the Leader of martyrdom, and praying for
          those who were slaying him, in these words: |Lord, lay not this sin to
          their charge.| Thus were they perfected who knew one and the same God,
          who from beginning to end was present with mankind in the various
          dispensations; as the prophet Hosea declares: |I have filled up
          visions, and used similitudes by the hands of the prophets.| Those,
          therefore, who delivered up their souls to death for Christ's Gospel
          -- how could they have spoken to men in accordance with
          old-established opinion? If this had been the course adopted by them,
          they should not have suffered; but inasmuch as they did preach things
          contrary to those persons who did not assent to the truth, for that
          reason they suffered. It is evident, therefore, that they did not
          relinquish the truth, but with all boldness preached to the Jews and
          Greeks. To the Jews, indeed, [they proclaimed] that the Jesus who was
          crucified by them was the Son of God, the Judge of quick and dead, and
          that He has received from His Father an eternal kingdom in Israel, as
          I have pointed out; but to the Greeks they preached one God, who made
          all things, and Jesus Christ His Son.
        </p>
        <p>
          14. This is shown in a still clearer light from the letter of the
          apostles, which they forwarded neither to the Jews nor to the Greeks,
          but to those who from the Gentiles believed in Christ, confirming
          their faith. For when certain men had come down from Judea to Antioch
          -- where also, first of all, the Lord's disciples were called
          Christians, because of their faith in Christ -- and sought to persuade
          those who had believed on the Lord to be circumcised, and to perform
          other things after the observance of the law; and when Paul and
          Barnabas had gone up to Jerusalem to the apostles on account of this
          question, and the whole Church had convened together, Peter thus
          addressed them: |Men, brethren, ye know how that from the days of old
          God made choice among you, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear
          the word of the Gospel, and believe. And God, the Searcher of the
          heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as to us;
          and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
          faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to impose a yoke upon the neck
          of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
          But we believe that, through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
          are to be saved, even as they.| After him James spoke as follows:
          |Men, brethren, Simon hath declared how God did purpose to take from
          among the Gentiles a people for His name. And thus do the words of the
          prophets agree, as it is written, After this I will return, and will
          build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will
          build the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: that the residue of men
          may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, among whom my name has
          been invoked, saith the Lord, doing these things. Known from eternity
          is His work to God. Wherefore I for my part give judgment, that we
          trouble not them who from among the Gentiles are turned to God: but
          that it be enjoined them, that they do abstain from the vanities of
          idols, and from fornication, and from blood; and whatsoever they wish
          not to be done to themselves, let them not do to others.| And when
          these things had been said, and all had given their consent, they
          wrote to them after this manner: |The apostles, and the presbyters,
          [and] the brethren, unto those brethren from among the Gentiles who
          are in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting: Forasmuch as we have
          heard that certain persons going out from us have troubled you with
          words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep
          the law; to whom we gave no such commandment: it seemed good unto us,
          being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our
          beloved Barnabas and Paul; men who have delivered up their soul for
          the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and
          Silas, that they may declare our opinion by word of mouth. For it
          seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater
          burden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from meats offered
          to idols, and from blood, and from fornication; and whatsoever ye do
          not wish to be done to you, do not ye to others: from which preserving
          yourselves, ye shall do well, walking in the Holy Spirit.| From all
          these passages, then, it is evident that they did not teach the
          existence of another Father, but gave the new covenant of liberty to
          those who had lately believed in God by the Holy Spirit. But they
          clearly indicated, from the nature of the point debated by them, as to
          whether or not it were still necessary to circumcise the disciples,
          that they had no idea of another god.
        </p>
        <p>
          15. Neither [in that case] would they have had such a tenor with
          regard to the first covenant, as not even to have been willing to eat
          with the Gentiles. For even Peter, although he had been sent to
          instruct them, and had been constrained by a vision to that effect,
          spake nevertheless with not a little hesitation, saying to them: |Ye
          know how it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep
          company with, or to come unto, one of another nation; but God hath
          shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. Therefore
          came I without gainsaying;| indicating by these words, that he would
          not have come to them unless he had been commanded. Neither, for a
          like reason, would he have given them baptism so readily, had he not
          heard them prophesying when the Holy Ghost rested upon them. And
          therefore did he exclaim, |Can any man forbid water, that these should
          not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?| He
          persuaded, at the same time, those that were with him, and pointed out
          that, unless the Holy Ghost had rested upon them, there might have
          been some one who would have raised objections to their baptism. And
          the apostles who were with James allowed the Gentiles to act freely,
          yielding us up to the Spirit of God. But they themselves, while
          knowing the same God, continued in the ancient observances; so that
          even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their reproof, although
          formerly eating with the Gentiles, because of the vision, and of the
          Spirit who had rested upon them, yet, when certain persons came from
          James, withdrew himself, and did not eat with them. And Paul said that
          Barnabas likewise did the same thing. Thus did the apostles, whom the
          Lord made witnesses of every action and of every doctrine -- for upon
          all occasions do we find Peter, and James, and John present with Him
          -- scrupulously act according to the dispensation of the Mosaic law,
          showing that it was from one and the same God; which they certainly
          never would have done, as I have already said, if they had learned
          from the Lord [that there existed] another Father besides Him who
          appointed the dispensation of the law.
